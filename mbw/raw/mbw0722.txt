[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Richie, Andy Enoco, Dave Hamilton from Mac Geek Gap.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.640]   They're all here to talk about the latest. We're going to take a look at the new public betas on
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:19.840]   iOS, iPadOS, and TV and watchOS. And maybe sometime soon on MacOS, pros, cons, what works,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.920]   what doesn't work. We'll talk about ARM and Apple Silicon and why it might be the end of the
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.720]   win-tell monopoly. And then finally, we'll get into the Apple TV plus. Some of the must watch,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.480]   and some that are coming soon. It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.280]   Joining us now from Montreal. It is the lovely and talented Renee Richie,
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.720]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie. Hello Renee. You make me feel so good, Leo. That's why you're great.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.440]   Thank you. You're carefully groomed. I'm trying to survive this, Leo.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.360]   You've got your Zoom shirt. I'm sorry, your Zoom hoodie on. You're ready to go. Ready to run.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.560]   Good to go. Good to go. Looking forward to this. Do you go out and how do you poke
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.360]   you on these days? Do you go out in the park and do it? I don't because I have it on a separate
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.080]   phone, but iOS 14 still crashes Pokemon go at launch. If it's not on my main phone, I don't do
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.560]   it as much because I'm contrary to what Andy and Akko would have you believe. I am not that
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.720]   guy with 16 phones on my bicycle. That's not how I roll. That's not what Andy tells me.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.160]   Andy and Akko from Anakko.com and WBGBH Boston. Hello Andrew.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.080]   Renee, please just let me have that mental image in that fantasy. If you just having this wall of
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.880]   glass in front of you and just being... It's for a classic. You're getting longer and longer.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.040]   Fingernail's getting longer and longer except for the fingers that you operate the phones with.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.440]   I think the Pokemon Go guy actually has the Pokemon Go grandpa has expanded his phone
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.400]   thing. I think he has 64 phones on it now. You want to see?
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.960]   It's like Game of Thrones. It's like the Pokemon Girl's Runeliner.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.600]   By the way, that's Dave Hamilton, the Mac Observer, joining us. Hey Dave.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.920]   Hey, hey. Thanks for having me. It's good to be here.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.360]   Good to have you on the panel. How did you like WWDC? I know normally this is a big deal for
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.040]   you to go out and have a fun time in Cupertino. Did you miss that?
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.880]   Well, yeah. I missed getting to see everybody in person, but I miss that every other day now too.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:35.280]   That's normal. Yeah. But I actually kind of liked the well-produced keynote is something I
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.040]   very much prefer over the let's do it live because they didn't have to spend as much time rehearsing
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.760]   so they could spend that time producing and crafting and delivering the message efficiently.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.440]   Like they were up the cram a ton in. So I like that. The sessions, again, so much more efficient.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.480]   So I feel like there's some things that have happened here that I hope will continue forward.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.680]   Again, I enjoy getting together though. So I hope we get to do both.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:12.320]   Probably separate the events though. Like, have the informational WWDC that's online and then have a
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:19.520]   social event that's not. They don't have to be tied together. No, but would people travel? I mean,
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.200]   some of us would if we knew that the rest of us would travel to a city to get to see each other.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.960]   And like I say, remind each other that we're human. I, you know, even back when we were doing
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.360]   Macworld Echoes, I always said that all of my like valuable work happened after the show floor
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.680]   closed. You know, at parties and dinners and where I, you know, got to, like I said, just remind
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.520]   each other that we're human. So I would like the opportunity to continue to do that. This is fine,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.160]   it's not the same. So, you know, but we can't do the other now. So this is as good as it gets.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:02.480]   So IOS, anyway, welcome all three of you iOS 14 is in public beta, which means a vastly larger
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.680]   number of people are using it, including me. I avoided the developer beta. But I thought, oh,
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.560]   everybody seems to, you know, you and Andy and Alex and everybody seem to be good.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.520]   Yeah, Laurie seem to be getting along fine with the developer beta. And the public beta has been
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.880]   pretty good, except for a few cases like Pokemon go my bank, USA, when I first launched the app,
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.640]   said you're using a jailbroken iPhone and wouldn't run. Yeah, then today, it said,
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.880]   you're using a jailbroken iPhone. Do you still want to go ahead riskily? And now it's just going
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.840]   okay. I give up. And the Facebook SDK went down again and everyone got so angry at iOS 14 beta
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.960]   until it was pointed out, which is basically the K again, please stop using that. Please stop using
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.560]   that. But I have to say, I really there's, you know, there's pros and cons. I really, overall,
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.360]   I like the widgets. I would say the only complaint I have is that unlike Android widgets, they're
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:06.640]   not live. So I can have music playing. And I will, you know, I see that I'm playing dad rock essentials
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:14.240]   on my iPhone. But the widget doesn't show that it's playing, nor does it have a pause or
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.680]   it's live to tape. So like they come from the complications on watch OS, and that's where power
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.400]   efficiency was most important. And these are all swift UI widgets. So they've kept that power
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.600]   efficiency. So basically, the app writes a stack of images on a timeline and send them to the widget.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.480]   Yeah. And the widget displays that picture. And if a new one comes up, they can interrupt the
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.600]   stack or they can inject into the stack. Or if the series suggested one thinks that like the
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.840]   calendar is more important because you have something coming up or the reminder is more important,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.480]   or your music's changed, it can force the stack to update. But they they're trying to do it.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.320]   They brought it all over from the watch. And I think it's sort of like when they brought
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.560]   when they redid I work with the iOS engine and then had to re add all the features that they
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.400]   started with a blank canvas and there's no interactivity to speak of yet.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.680]   I know if you're saying, well, but you're going to get better battery life.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.160]   OK, although I know that a number of people are complaining about the battery life in the
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.520]   human face. It's got a bunch of debug code. But the worst thing is like you can't have peak
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.080]   out. You can't have any of the to do widgets. You can't have like anything that required button
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.800]   interactions inside the widget itself. And to make matters worse, to like give James Thompson a
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.240]   paper cut and pour lemon juice on it. The very beginning of the session says,
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.960]   widgets are not mini apps. I just immediately texted him and said, do you feel attacked?
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.160]   Because these are quite famously. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.320]   That's that's too bad because the more useful they make these widgets, the more
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.560]   they're more adoption they're going to get. And so if they just become, hey, look, here's a way to
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:52.480]   put a picture on your home screen, then it's going to be like, OK, that's nice. But then there
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.240]   are a lot of features that people will use for the first week or two and then realize that they're
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.760]   not using it, then just simply fall out of the habit. But something like here is what here is when
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.880]   your Uber is coming. Well, OK, that's good. That's not that's going to be in applicable for
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.160]   least the next year. But but that's the sort of stuff I'm talking about. These things that are
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:14.080]   interactive just here is here is one actionable button to say here is do. Let me get let me get
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.600]   a quick calculation or better yet. Let me swipe right on my home screen to get at my my scheduler
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.040]   and my to do without having to dip into another app. Well, full interface as useful stuff.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.760]   And the example I gave was the most obvious play pause music. My God, I mean, that's
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.440]   come on. Well, and Andy's point about, you know, it's not we're not going to have that for another
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:42.960]   year. You know, Apple's cycle means that what widgets are today, the iterative design, if anything
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.800]   changes is going to be very minor, adding true functionality to them wouldn't be until iOS 15
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:54.960]   now at best. And that may cause a lot of people to just sort of write off widgets and and
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:03.280]   and lose some of that momentum there, which isn't good. Any. By the way, the clock icon is live.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:09.040]   I don't know why you couldn't make a clock. Well, they did. I can't wait for a while. I did a
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.360]   show with Matthew Castellini Castellini. Sorry. Yes, this morning. And what I love about Matthew,
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.040]   he came from the workflow team that became the Siri shortcuts team. And what he's done that I
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.680]   thought was brilliant is he put all the widgets on his phone. And then behind them, he stacked all
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.240]   the Siri shortcuts for that widget. So you go to calendar, you slide up on it, and you have all
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.520]   your Siri shortcuts. Oh, go to reminders, swipe up. You have all your Siri shortcuts for her. And he
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:39.680]   did that every main app instead of my of a short cut that he has all of that in widget space now.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:46.400]   Which is really you can create on any widget spot, a widget stack by putting multi widgets in the
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.400]   same place. So you put the front facing widget, the image widget, but you could put a shortcut
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:58.160]   as you swipe up that says pause play and all the other things. Yeah, I'm going to do that. That's
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.440]   actually a great workaround. And he's changing his watch face based on shortcuts now based on time
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.720]   and location. So it's like after six o'clock his watch face just automatically changes.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.640]   That's a feature I don't know about because I still am not brave enough
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.800]   to put the new watch OS on my watch. Give it to you.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:21.040]   You're brave enough to put it on your daily driver iPhone, but your watch, which is a fairly
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.880]   huh because you can't. I can. I can. I can. I can. I can. I can. I can. I can. I can. I can
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:33.440]   plug it in and go back, but I can't do that to the watch. Right. I totally. I'm. I'm. I'm.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:40.320]   Just get another watch a few months. Totally the same way. Just get another watch day and
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.960]   night watch. I do want to know if I've washed my hands enough. I have to say I really need that
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.400]   and I want to be able to dance and get that keeps going on while I'm doing dishes. Like I'm
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.720]   doing dishes and it's like 17 more seconds. I'm like the plate is done. No, that's annoying.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.920]   That's annoying. I don't know. Andy, you're. I feel like you have a phone that you can try iOS 14
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:05.040]   on or are you doing on the pad? Yeah, I have a I have it on the iPhone. I don't have the beta on
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:11.280]   the iPad, but I've but I happen playing with widgets. I happen trying to lots of new stuff
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:17.280]   and shortcuts. I really like. So I've been trying to dig into that. I'm pretty happy. What I'm most
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.440]   happy with is just that for some reason, it just seems a little bit tighter. It seems a little bit
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.560]   cleaner. It feels like they've taken a lot of the stuff that has been lingering since
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.840]   the days of smaller screens, lower resolution screens and they've said, okay, well, look,
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:40.480]   everybody has 8K of 16 bit screens, whatever right now. So let's make sure we don't necessarily have
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:46.320]   to make notifications quite at excuse me, we don't have to make make sheets as intrusive as
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:54.560]   they are right now. So I'm liking it so far. I am seriously considering getting an iPhone SE
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.320]   and making it my daily driver for the rest of the year. It's a really nice step forward.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:06.400]   iPad OS is a little bit less 14 is a little bit less exciting unless you really. Yeah, that's hand
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:12.000]   writing. They push the cursor stuff up to the iPad Pro release because I think that it would have
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.960]   been worse to have that iPad Pro release without the cursor support, like less even less impactful.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:22.560]   But it took away from some of the WWDC stuff because I think if we got in cursor and pencil and the iOS
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.240]   14 stuff, we would have thought it was a pretty good update. Right. We just do not behave the same
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:35.120]   on the iPad. They are still trapped in the today view. Yeah, which is weird because you have so
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.680]   much space on an iPad, arguably that'd be a better place to do. Conditions were different. So like
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:45.120]   you can have you can make the icons two different sizes, one that's bigger and closer together and
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.960]   one that has more density and they also change position as you rotate. And they were like a
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.640]   number of factors that just meant it would take a little more time to do it. And they're all
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.840]   sheltered in place at the moment. So it was just it didn't as far as I heard it didn't fit into
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.320]   getting it ready for another. So they're not against the idea. It's just that they had too many
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.880]   things to do and they couldn't do that one. We love it when people are so excited about our
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.840]   features. They want them everywhere. Yeah, that's a good line. Yeah, that's a good line.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:18.560]   Anyway, should people what do you think? What's the consensus? Should people, I mean, as you said,
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:24.160]   Dave, I put it on my main iPad and my main iPhone. I took a chance. Big Sur is not it's not yet in
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:29.920]   public beta, right? No, that one I've had bad experiences in the past using public betas on Max.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:37.360]   I'm a little less likely to do that. I watch the much of an upside yet. Yeah. It's been okay on my
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:44.240]   MacBook Air. Okay. But you know, there are a lot of things that simply aren't built to work with it
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:50.000]   yet. The big one for me is I there's a couple of mail plugins from the folks at Small Cube that I
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.760]   simply rely on. They are a part of my workflow. They're a part of my very fiber of my being
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:02.080]   and not having those available at my fingertips is kind of a deal killer. So for that reason,
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:08.160]   I can't run it for very long on my air. But I switch back to it occasionally. It's like,
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:14.080]   it's relatively stable. Battery life is fine. You know, so yeah, it's fine.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:20.880]   I tried Catalina last year and it was fine for like beta one, two, three, and I think then beta
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.480]   four Final Cut Pro stop working. And I'm like, I'm not putting a lot of data on the machine.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.480]   Yeah, exactly. It's not it's not this beta. It's the next beta you have to watch everyone will tell
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.400]   you this beta is fine. It's working great. Then you do it. And then the next beta just hoses you.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:39.200]   So then our advice would probably be this really isn't for everybody. I mean, obviously,
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:45.520]   our audience is more sophisticated than the average person. I would, for instance, on the radio show,
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.160]   I would say don't don't don't. But on this show, if you're listening to backbreak weekly,
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.880]   you're probably enough of enthusiast. It's you have a spare machine, especially. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:03.120]   Watch it was his own. Don't install it into a second volume. We know. Yeah, that was originally,
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.960]   that's how people got around it and years gone by and done work anymore. Well, it works. It'll
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:14.480]   let you do it. There's no way back. It changes the version of APFS is what happens.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.920]   Ah, that makes sense. Big Sur has to add all these different volume types like backup and those
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:26.320]   sorts of things. And so Catalina sees it and says, I don't know what version of APFS this is.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:31.920]   This is newer than I'm aware of. And therefore, I'm not going to allow I'm not going to attempt
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:38.160]   any updates because updates with APFS mean create a new volume, install the update there,
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.960]   and then roll to that, right, which is awesome because it totally protects you. But Catalina
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.840]   can't trust this version of APFS, so it won't do it. So your Catalina will still run, but it will
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:54.240]   no longer get updates, which is risky. Right. Now a future, I have no knowledge of this,
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:59.680]   but it's possible, of course, that a future version of Catalina likely, in fact, would
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.040]   understand that this version of APFS is OK, but you put yourself in a chicken and egg scenario
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:11.360]   if you update now because then you never get that version. That's not presumably. I mean, I don't.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:19.040]   I think I would say our recommendation is to hold off on Big Sur and maybe watch OS,
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:25.040]   but iOS and iPad OS seem like they're OK. What about TV OS? Has anybody updated to beta TV OS?
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:31.760]   I have. I think I did. It's not a it's not a big deal. I mean, if you want family game center,
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.920]   which I have no need, I mean, it's there. Yeah. So OK, I'm not going to worry about it.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:41.600]   I haven't rely on our TVs too much right now, Leo. We have nothing else to do. Yes, I'm not.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:48.000]   I'm not mucking up my TV. Oh, how 4K YouTube is working. Like did Apple fold? Are they supporting
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.840]   VP9? Are they both doing AV1? Is there something else going on? What is happening?
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:58.160]   So political so much drama so much drama. I think of all of them. iOS 14 is the most
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:04.400]   dramatic change. And I think good. Yeah. And by the way, one little feature that almost makes the
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:12.160]   beta upgrade a must do jiggle mode used to be you had to hold your finger on the icon for a
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:19.680]   feel like a long time to get into jiggle mode. One, two, three, four, five, six. OK,
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:25.120]   long time. Now if you've got free space, you have to have some free space. It looks like I don't
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.840]   have. Oh, yeah, there's some if you just hold it in the free space for half a second goes right
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:37.760]   into jiggle. Yeah. That they didn't really tout that probably not a huge feature. But it's
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:44.320]   isn't it funny how some people like that. Yeah. Can can be an important. It's quality of life. It is.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:50.960]   I have those four seconds matter. Yeah. Well, we're in place. You need them. I'm very impatient.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.920]   Yeah. Again, the thing that I've been experiencing with the iPhone, I haven't I haven't fallen in
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.560]   love with any really new features. I just like the experience. It's a little bit more polished.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.880]   Yeah. I and I really like the widgets, although I don't like announcing the world that I've been
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:11.440]   listening to dad rock essentials, but by yacht rock. Yeah. It's a nice. It's a nice upgrade.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:19.840]   Why a CHT like my yacht? Yeah. You can hear like Brandy and dancing in the moon. Oh, I do like that.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:25.920]   The other thing I really like is the featured photo. I love having a rotating photo. But I don't
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.800]   know how the hell you get something into or out of featured photo in iPhone. I don't know. And mine
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.640]   was trolling me. It was showing me these wonderful pictures from WWDC past for the entire week. I'm
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:41.520]   like, Oh, San Jose, like standing with Lori at the podcast center and you know, having caught it was
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.680]   just the worst. Oh, I thought Renee, you would have a fix for me. Yeah. So you don't know.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.520]   It's the way photos were. It's it's the memory system. Yeah. But I don't know how to hack it.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.640]   Like I don't know how to tell it like to enforce my will upon it. Well, you know,
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.040]   I'm afraid it's going to put something in there. I don't want to see on my front page.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:04.560]   Mine is the repeat. It's like it's it's put stuff on there. Like, like it's like a picture
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.040]   that did meaningless to me like eight times over three days. I'm like, I don't know why you're there.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:14.400]   What are you doing to me? Why can't I? Why can I banish you? Yeah. I mean, it's fun though. And
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:20.160]   you know, this is my new thing anyway in general. I have the Google Nest Hub Max photo frames.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:27.200]   And I just love it that I can have around the house slideshows because I have taken over the last,
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   I think it's the last 20 years, all the digital photos I've taken are in there. And either in
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:38.080]   Apple photos or Google photos. So it's really nice to have these random selections show up. It's fun.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:42.400]   Yeah, it'd be better if we were a little less random. If there were, if you could point it to
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.000]   an album and simply say, here is, here's my wallet. Here are the pictures. I keep them in my wallet
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.520]   because you're right. It's not, it's not so much. It's like there are times where like I'm taking
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.080]   a burst of photos and like I lower the phone. I was like, Oh, great. Here's a blurry picture of
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:02.320]   the ground. Or there's sometimes where, Oh, wow, good. A picture of the, a picture of the parking
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.280]   of the sign in the parking lot in the hospital. So I would remember where I parked while visiting
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.400]   my aunt who's dying three years ago. Thanks. I wasn't thinking about that at all.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.960]   It wants to be serendipitous discovery. So it doesn't want to constrain you to what you want
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.800]   because then it thinks you won't get what you need. But give me a toggle. Let me, like, if I don't
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:26.080]   enjoy serendipitous discovery and having these memories. Oh, I, I, Uncle Bob from 19 years ago.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.360]   So great. Let me just have my favorites. Let me have the safe favorites.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.000]   Would be the obvious, right? Yeah. Why doesn't it do?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.160]   Oh, just a toggle. Just a toggle. Yeah. Beta. Sangers you back, Leo.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.120]   Yeah. That's something easily, easily fixed and probably will be.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.440]   Probably by iOS 15.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:47.120]   Well, that's, they don't, they, you know, they don't generally make those kind of feature
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:53.200]   additions throughout betas. They could, but that's my question. How, how in stone is this? Is this
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   the, is this a test version of the final version? And they're not going to.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.960]   Earlier the better. Okay.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.360]   Like beta one, beta two, get your requests in now because come beta four, beta five,
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.120]   they'll be in like showstopper. So it is conceivable you could get a feature.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.720]   You're more likely to get a bug fixed in a feature, but it's conceivable you could get a
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.400]   feature request. It depends on the complaint volume. Like remember, they changed, like,
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.440]   they've changed the width of fonts because people have complained and stuff like that.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:25.920]   It's true. I hate this font width. Well, it was bad for legibility. Like it was so thin. It was
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.280]   like you, people could not read it. Actually, that's one of my problems with Apple News.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.280]   And I don't know what to do about it. I don't know if I was, maybe I zoom turned on,
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.360]   but I can't read a single headline. It's always you won't dot dot dot.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:45.760]   Third party developer could solve that photos problem though, right? Because they could make
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.800]   a photo switch. They could make a widget that allows you to select where it comes from. So
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.120]   that's sort of a solvable problem and more likely to be solved at least in the next year.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.960]   Yeah. By someone other than Apple.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.680]   Widgets aren't hard either. Maybe I would, I should take that on. The hard part would be getting
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.720]   talking to my photos. Leo, the widget maker.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.080]   I like, I've been playing with it. In fact, one of the cool things, just a little tip
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:13.120]   in the, you know, that last page where it makes an app library out of its own folders.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.560]   If you have any of your own apps on the iPhone, it'll actually give you, you see,
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.000]   I have a Leo LePort folder. It'll actually give you your own folder.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:26.720]   So make your own apps kids. That way you'll have a folder. But when you make the app, make sure that
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:31.520]   you identify yourself properly. Don't just say some doofus because then you'll have some doofus
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.480]   fold. It's all in that. That's a feature, not a bug.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:41.120]   It's all in Xcode kids. It's not the calm dot thing. It's the full name of the company in there.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.360]   So make sure your company name is what you want to see is just a tip, just a tip.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:53.280]   Let's see. What else? Did you read John Louis Gesset's Monday note?
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:23:02.160]   So I saw I was overly effusive about the shift to Apple Silicon until John Louis weighed
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:08.400]   in former Apple president back way back when in the, you know, pre Steve Jobs return era.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.080]   Apple Silicon, he says it's the end for wind tell.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.360]   Oh, I kind of disagree. Yeah. That's uh,
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:25.520]   we're just so glad that you're excited. I'm not sure I disagree with them.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:32.240]   I'm not sure. The thing with the point I feel is like it might like it's not wind tell necessarily.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:37.040]   It might encourage Microsoft to do a better job of windows on ARM. It might encourage
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:42.560]   Dell and HP to make more laptops with ARM processors because they want some of the characteristics that
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:48.480]   ARM delivers like longer battery life. But it's very different. Like a lot of people keep saying
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:53.840]   Mac on ARM and it's it's really not that like ARM is a tiny tiny sliver. It's an Apple's not
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:58.880]   even using ARM cores or using an instruction set as part of a massive SOC with a lot of other
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.760]   components. And it's it's that that's the important part. And I don't think you want better displays.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.640]   Yeah, I don't think you can compete with that because Apple that makes the whole stack.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.840]   So I just have two big advantages. One is they're not a merchant silicon provider,
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.880]   which means they have no profit per loss per chip. They don't have to sell chips. And that's a
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:22.000]   whole different business. And they also only have one client, which is Apple. And so their only job
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.520]   is to run Mac OS as fast as anything on Earth. And that's a much smaller problem to solve than
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:32.160]   Qualcomm saying we have to support open GL on this. We have to support DirectX on that. We have,
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.960]   you know, Samsung is complaining about this. Dell wants us to do that. It's it's it's a completely
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:43.440]   different animal. I let me just read you the the salient last three paragraphs,
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.880]   because he makes really the whole point there. He says, Intel,
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:53.120]   no, they missed the smartphone 2.0 revolution because of culture blindness. And I think we
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:58.960]   agree they couldn't bear it apart with the high margins generated by the x86 cash cow. They couldn't
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:04.000]   see that lower margins could be supported by unimaginable volume. This is, by the way,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.040]   an industry wide problem. Nobody understood what the iPhone met. Steve bomber marketing person
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.960]   in charge instead of an engineer like bomber. Like it's almost exactly what happened to Microsoft.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:18.800]   Now, guess it goes on, Intel's facing a more serious problem. The x86 commands high margins,
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:24.240]   not because of the chip, but because of the Intel windows duopoly, meaning that all other
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:30.960]   things being equal chips, not running windows get lower margins than an x86 CPU. Now this is,
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:35.520]   this is his deep knowledge of the industry. I don't know that, but that's what he says.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:42.240]   Now that union, that advantage, the wind tell, but duopoly is about to disappear. Intel will face
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:49.520]   ARM based SOCs running windows on arm with applications in PC like quantities at lower prices. That
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:54.240]   leaves Intel with one path. If you can't beat them, join them. He says, and I've heard others say
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:26:01.040]   these two. Intel will retake an ARM license. It sold its scale, ARM based X scale business to
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:05.920]   Marvellent 2006. It was a flop. That was their attempt to do mobile and come up with a competitive
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:11.360]   ARM SOC offering for PC OEMs. In other words, Intel will get in the Apple business. They'll say,
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.120]   all right, on what process though? I mean, like if they could do a good process, they wouldn't
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.880]   have to have the problems they have with x86 chips right now. Yeah, I mean, there's a technical issue,
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:23.840]   but then he also says margins are going to suffer because the ARM based SOC field is already
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:29.360]   filled with very sharp competitors like Qualcomm and Nvidia. He hasn't seen Qualcomm's margins.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:36.000]   Right. Not so high. Qualcomm makes its money on licensing, not on chips.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.280]   Well, but they're charging a fortune for their 800 series this year. Oh, are they the new one?
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:46.640]   Yeah. Yeah. That's right. In fact, a lot of phones are going, oh, I can't run an 865. That's
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.720]   just to explore that. Or their prices are going through the roof. Right. And that's, I don't think
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.960]   the market's going to bear these phones getting well above a thousand bucks.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:01.440]   So he also says, watch out for AMD doing the same ushering in it. And this is the important part,
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:08.800]   a new era of PCs based on ARM SOCs. And he says, that's a problem because Intel's margins will be
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.680]   much lower there. So that really hits the business bottom line. It's not that Intel couldn't do
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.920]   ARM SOCs. They just can't get the margin that they're getting right now with the wind tell do
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:23.360]   happily. I don't think he's far off on that. That's an interesting angle that I hadn't really thought
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:29.360]   about. Even if Intel, you raised the real issue, Renee, even if Intel does do that,
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.640]   are they going to be great products? Probably not. And that's why.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.960]   The properly part is maybe salient. Like if he's only saying the alliance between Intel and
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.080]   Windows is what's a problem, then that probably is true because people won't be as dependent on that.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.640]   Even now AMD is getting huge buy in because they're doing such good work with Threadripper and everything.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.720]   So that's already under assault. This probably adds to that assault. But I don't think the separate,
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.680]   maybe I was misreading. I don't think the separate parts are problematic.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.480]   He says, you know, it's not that they're losing Apple. That's 7% of the PC market share. It's not a
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.440]   big deal. He also says, Apple's a pain in the ass to Intel. They make demands and complaints
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:10.080]   way out of proportion with the amount of revenue. He says, losing Apple is more sis symbol than
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:15.520]   substance. However, the impact on Intel and the entire industry, we've felt beyond Apple's small
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.480]   share on the PC market. And I think that's the really interesting thing. And you raised that.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:29.280]   This isn't Apple on arm. This is Apple SOCs systems on a chip that potentially because of
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:35.840]   Apple's tight integration with the hardware and software could make a Mac be something so well
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:43.600]   beyond any other PC that especially with low power. I mean, like the MacBook Air, I mean,
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.360]   it wasn't just the MacBook Air and they were working with Intel, but that defined a generation
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.400]   of ultra books and Intel made a fortune off everything that spun out of Apple being so demanding
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.320]   in such a pain in the butt over that one computer. And that's going to happen with Apple Silicon
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:03.120]   now, not with Intel. And really, you could say, well, AMD Threadripper, but that's not the laptop
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.600]   market. And the laptop market is so much bigger than that's the S top market. The laptop market,
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:16.160]   you want a high performance for power ratio. Yes. And that's what exactly what this Apple SOC could
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:21.040]   do like a 12 inch MacBook with an Apple Silicon would would be able to do 4k. Yeah,
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:27.840]   we'd be able to render 4k and get 20 hour battery life. Yeah, without a fan without a fan.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.160]   Because they're crazy about stuff like that. Right? Like, I mean, that's the thing. So yeah,
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:38.880]   you're right. Intel loses that overly demanding customer that allowed them then to go and sell
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.560]   what they had to develop for Apple to everybody else. Yeah, fair point.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:50.240]   So, well, you know, maybe it is premature to declare the death of Windtell.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:57.200]   That doesn't look good. But yeah, also, also, it's what we're neighboring is up is that this is
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:03.760]   something that Intel Intel and even AMD can't deal with if if Intel were to manufacture an
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.320]   entire notebook from start to finish, they would have they would be in with a chance. It's the
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.800]   integration is the level of being able to make to select every single component that's going to
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:17.440]   work efficiently with the CPU with it with this GPU with everything that's going to work together.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:23.760]   They do a lot of they do build some some hardware that do build NUCs. They also build a lot of
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:29.200]   specifications with a lot of times of every time you see a brand new laptop or brand new desktop or
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:35.040]   brand new form factor, it is actually Intel saying here is the ingredients that you need to build
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:40.560]   a system like the one that we just that we've just deployed. Remember that the the
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:46.480]   dual screen with the hinge in the middle of it. It wasn't just an idea that Microsoft had. It was
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:51.440]   actually prototypes that Intel was showing off to people to manufacture saying please build this.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:55.600]   We think it's a cool idea. But because they can never do that level of integration just again,
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.640]   really made it really really good point. It's not just the CPU. It's not just
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:04.000]   plug out the Intel plug in that's something else and boom Bob's your uncle. It really is we get
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.680]   to build everything all at once as one holistic whole. And that's the sort of thing that no Windows
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:15.440]   machine can compete with. Do you think it's a nice I think it's a very nice balance of power
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:20.160]   against what Apple can't compete with which is thank you. But you you only make six different
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.840]   computers and none of them are suitable for our hardware requirements. We're going to have to
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:31.120]   fund go elsewhere or build our own. Yeah, I mean, obviously now there are plenty of other
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.680]   contrary indicators. One, we don't know if Apple can execute. I mean, there's a big question mark.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:41.440]   That's true. We think they can. It seems pretty clear. They've done so well with their iPhones and
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:48.480]   iPads that they probably can. So I think that's a low risk thing. The other thing that's that
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.680]   maybe is a bigger risk is you cannot you cannot throw away the power of marketing
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:32:00.800]   and the willingness of people to buy crap. You know, so it may it may well be that Apple
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:08.640]   offers this amazing the great combination of features and it doesn't in any way impact
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:13.040]   when tell, you know that they just humble. I don't know why people buy Windows machines today.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:19.440]   It's baffles me. They're demonstrably crappy. I wouldn't say crappy. They're they're
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:24.560]   they just suit a need that Apple isn't telling. There's a whole that's right. That's right.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:30.240]   And also it too. And also I think what what's great about Apple is that they don't make rental
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.800]   cars. They don't make fleet vehicles. They make vehicles that are really, really interesting and
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.120]   exceptional in their own rights. However, there are a lot of people that I really just want to
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:43.280]   Toyota Celica, give me something that's not necessarily high performance, not necessarily
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:47.040]   the most reliable thing, but it's on the lot. I can get in the color that I want. They're not
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.760]   going to tell me that no, you don't need cup holders this season. And that's how it works.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:59.040]   That's that's really the defense. That's why Windtail is not dead is you could have a demonstrably
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:05.520]   betters. You could have a demonstrably better platform. It doesn't but you don't fill all the
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:10.560]   gaps in the industry. You don't make the fleet vehicles. So there's there's plenty of room for
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:16.640]   Windtail to survive forever gamers. There's a lot of places it can continue. There are still
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:21.920]   a handful of people who really like building their computers with rotating LED fans.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.160]   Those people and Regent. I'm not going to get my Regent.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:35.440]   Well, I mean, I feel so sorry for people who are using Windows because it I mean,
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:41.440]   Microsoft can't code their way out of a paper bag. It's just awful.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:47.440]   I wouldn't say awful. I would say again, mediocre. There's that.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.640]   But that's awful.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:52.240]   I think mediocre in your operating system is awful.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.480]   Well, no, I mean, let okay. And it's the right.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.840]   You're right. It runs.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:04.720]   The old Macbook keyboard was awful. That was on his mediocre. I'm saying that it's usable.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:09.920]   It's fine. It serves that I think that one of the key differences though is that
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:17.680]   even though the Mac has its share of boring productive software where how how exciting can
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:23.920]   it possibly be? It's just here to sort of a function. I think that the Mac and iOS apps,
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.880]   the developers are more are more sprung towards.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.680]   Let's find a way to make this a little bit more elegant or let's find a way to we've got a
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:36.640]   successful app. Let's find a way to sneakily make it better as opposed to let's tread water
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.200]   and make sure it's compatible. So that's why that's one of the reasons why the Mac shines a lot
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:47.360]   better. Once again, the I just try not to keep I try to take my eye off of the people that look,
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:53.440]   I'm not excited. I use I always use my my own relationship to cars that I don't care about cars.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.680]   I want a car that's reliable. I want to get in there turn the key. It goes.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.040]   I want to find a place to park and that's really it. Whereas the other people are going to say,
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.840]   Oh my God, I can't believe that you think the Ford Crown Victoria is a cool car. I'm saying
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:10.720]   it is cool. It's simple. It's easy to repair. You can get parts in a junkyard. It's wonderful
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:16.480]   because it's if you people aren't excited about this stuff, it's hard to get to it's hard to
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:21.440]   convince them that there's a reason why you're spending an extra two or $300 say you can tell
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.800]   them that well, you're going to get better support. It's better built. You're probably going to get
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:30.320]   at least at least five years, if not six, seven or eight years out of this versus three or maybe
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.880]   four out of your windows machine. But again, they're into the store. They don't really care.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.960]   And they say that these are the people that say, Oh, this has an L.G. keyboard. Great. Let's get
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:44.240]   this one. Truthfully, it boils down a one word. It's this wind tell will survive for the same
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:50.000]   reason. Android will survive choice. That's the one thing that Apple can't offer is choice.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:58.560]   Right. Yeah. Say again, Dave. Yeah. Apple's product line is intentionally limited, right?
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:04.000]   They know what they want to sell you and they know what you need, whether you believe them or not.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.720]   Right. And for most of us, that's actually okay, right? Like we take what Apple decides to deliver
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.520]   to us, but but there are folks out there. Like you said, that want choice, they want specific options,
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:19.760]   they want to dig in and do things and control things in a way that Apple simply doesn't allow
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:25.760]   you to do with the way they build their hardware and software. And so as we've said many times,
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.720]   what bears repeating, Apple doesn't care about market dominance. Apple cares about revenue
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:38.080]   dominance. Profit to him. They're not trying to share a 95. In fact, it would be a bad thing for
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:42.800]   them to become a 95% market share operating system. They don't want to they don't want that
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.240]   headache. They just want 95% of the revenue. Well, the characteristics of a business that
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.760]   captures that much market is diametrically opposed to the characteristics of a business
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.560]   Apple wants to be in. Yes, they don't want a mass market product.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:59.600]   Yeah. Also, it's it is what drives me is their passion is what they're good at.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:05.120]   When I look at the industry as a whole, there are a lot of companies that are very, very boring,
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:10.240]   but they're doing impressive things like Apple is the restaurant that is exciting. Everybody
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:15.280]   talks about it and every meal is exceptional. However, this kitchen is not capable of feeding
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:20.560]   2000 people a day. We're asked, we're asked Dunkin Donuts. They need to there are a lot of
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.920]   people who need their morning donut and their morning coffee and the morning koolata,
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.920]   and they need to crank them out at volume. And you can't get that from the boutique
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.800]   bakery across the street. Yeah, Apple doesn't want billions served.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:38.320]   They want to make a nice stick. And truthfully, I don't think Apple was the folks that think
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:45.440]   blogged Steve Jobs. Wonderful interview at the De-conference with Walt Mossberg and Cara Switcher
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:51.360]   in 2010. And what was really clear is Steve said it over and over again. And I think this is still
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:55.440]   true of Apple today. It's not they're saying, how do we make more money? They're saying, how do we
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:02.080]   bring the best product to a customer? We want to make the best product. And that isn't a mass
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:06.560]   produced product. That's like the chef in the kitchen who's saying, I want to make the perfect
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:12.400]   steak. I don't want to make a billion hamburgers. And it turns out there's a benefit called revenue.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:17.760]   But I don't think they're saying, what's we take care of it? They believe that they believe they
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.920]   make a great product. And that's worth worth. Exactly. I have a video coming out tomorrow,
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:26.560]   and I'll spoil part of the conclusion. But Tim Cook is always very forthright on the calls.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:32.000]   Whenever he says anything, he's very plain spoken. And when he introduced the idea of Apple Silicon,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.640]   it was very similar to what Steve Jobs said when he introduced Intel. And that led to the MacBook
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.800]   Air. And he said, like, he didn't say that Apple was doing this for faster computers.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.840]   A lot of us hope that they will be. He didn't say they're doing it for better battery life,
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.520]   although a lot of us assume that they will be. He didn't say they were doing it to save money,
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:52.240]   because as much as each chip might cost less, making those chips is going to cost billions of
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:59.360]   dollars. He believes our products that Apple can't simply can't make without doing this.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:03.840]   And he also believes that if Apple does their job right, that the customers will reward them
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.880]   by buying those products. And that's how they'll get their margins back.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:13.040]   That's the feedback you get. If you make a great product, people will love you and love the product.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:18.400]   That's, and yeah, incidentally, you make money at it. But I honestly think they're not driven by
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:25.920]   the money so much. Sometimes they're excited by the money. It's a good thing. Let me put it this
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:32.640]   way. I think they're not driven by the money in the sense that anybody who has that much money in
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.400]   the bank is not driven by. They're free not to be driven by money anymore.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:41.280]   There's no merch store on apple.com. Yeah, exactly. I mean, back in 1996,
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.960]   oh boy, were they driven by? Oh, yeah. When they didn't have it, they should.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.600]   That's when there was Apple merch. That's true. Yeah. So that's interesting. So if
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:54.480]   if you presume that the distinguishing factor between Apple and the rest of the world is
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:59.520]   the rest of the world offers choice, Apple doesn't. Is that a negative?
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.560]   Not in the presence of all these other companies that are offering choice.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:12.320]   You can almost imagine that if you think about the world in terms of a category of desktop
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.800]   computing, desktop operating systems, desktop computing, of which Apple is one,
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.080]   it really makes sense that this is one. This is the option that involves,
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:26.720]   I actually want a sandbox environment. I don't want to be in the driver's seat. I want to be
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.040]   the kids sleeping peacefully in the backseat or watching a movie not worrying about the traffic,
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:36.240]   not worrying about maintenance. Yes. And there's nothing infantile about that.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:41.680]   It's like, I'm willing to give up some control because I would much rather just sleep in the back
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:47.440]   seat. Yeah. And on the other on the flip side, there are people who said, gee, I just, I've seen
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:54.560]   laptops with touch screens with the screens that fold backwards 180 360 degrees. That's really for
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:41:03.280]   me or maybe more seriously for power users. I can either spend $30,000 on a Mac Pro,
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:10.160]   which is a generalized computer, or I can spend $30,000 building a PC that is optimized
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:15.840]   specifically for rendering video or specifically for crunching numbers for statistics, which will
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:21.840]   blow the doors off of any generalized computer. So that's why Apple has a wonderful role to fulfill.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:26.640]   I think that this is why I don't like to go into, oh, well, Windows is terrible or PCs are terrible.
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:32.160]   They are, they have weaknesses compared to Apple. However, the PC industry also doesn't have the
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:37.360]   response. It has additional, the PC industry also has additional responsibilities that Apple
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.680]   doesn't have. And I'm just glad that of all the options on the table, Apple is an option and it's
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:46.640]   the one that I want. Yeah, I'm glad Android exists. I'm glad Windows exists. I'm glad PC is
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:51.360]   exist actually because I don't run Windows. I like Linux. And I don't think I could ever run
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.520]   Linux and Apple Silicon. I'll run an emulation. But that maybe not natively.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:02.800]   Well, window. Yeah, maybe. I mean, on arm, Linux is doable. Oh, totally. It's compatible.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.800]   That's why we can run an emulation. But I feel like Apple's pretty locked.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:11.040]   Yeah, it isn't writing nasty grams about your silicon. Then are you really a company?
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:17.600]   You know, one of the things that excited me about Apple Silicon is exactly this. You know,
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:23.440]   Apple, like you said, has more money than they need. So they really aren't that hungry company
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:29.360]   that they were in 1996. And that hungry company turned out a lot of really cool things like that
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:36.080]   hunger fueled them to become the success that they are today. They basically were forced to,
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:42.640]   right? Because if they didn't, that was it, right? I think you could. I think if you look at history,
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:50.960]   for instance, reason Steve Jobs got fired the first time is because the cash cow was the Apple 2.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:57.760]   And he poured all these resources into a failed platform, Lisa and Mac. At the time,
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:04.640]   the board thought, you, this is nuts. We've got a cash cow. What are you doing this Mac for?
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:09.120]   And I think Steve's only interest was in creating a better product, period.
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:14.560]   It's very different than bombers wanted to hold on to Windows until he wrote every dime of profit
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:19.360]   into the ground. And we should point out, by the way, Microsoft, you may say, oh, no, you know,
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:25.760]   Windows is going to last forever. But Microsoft's business strategy is not relying on Windows by
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:30.640]   any means going forward. Not anymore. Yeah. But when you know, when Steve came back,
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:36.800]   he was driven to make that company survive. And that meant generate cash now, right? Yeah.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.480]   Figue he had to. They were down there last million. I mean, they didn't. Yeah.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:45.360]   But what's cool about Apple Silicon to me is Apple, you know, they're in this comfortable position.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:50.800]   They don't necessarily money hungry. But now they're, they've got to protect their brand. They've
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:56.880]   got to protect their ego. Right. Like they've made a big gamble here of saying, we can do it better.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:03.360]   100% ourselves. And now they've got to show us that they can. I think, I think they can. I don't
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:08.800]   think it's going to be a problem. But I think they're aware of the gamble that they have
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:14.800]   laid on the table here. And I think it's a big thing. But I think it will be the thing that drives
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:19.920]   them. Yeah. And that's it's good to have a spur. Yes. Exactly. Yeah. In fact, maybe they have been
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.760]   too comfortable with the success of the iPhone. That's the innovators dilemma where you have
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:28.240]   this incredibly powerful platform driving their market. I think that's the case
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:37.440]   that what's Benedict Evans made saying that they had shifted from a push strategy where they were
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:44.000]   letting the iPhone push the other products to a pull strategy or maybe it's vice versa.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.080]   They were like the iPhone pull Neil Seibart said that that's right. And above Evelyn.
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:52.880]   Their pull of the iPhone was pulling the other products along like a little choo choo train.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:58.880]   And and now they're all the products are pushing equally into this new world of Apple.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.640]   They spent like a, they spent like a decade building up the iPhone as a platform.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:07.360]   And now they're using everything they built for the iPhone as a platform to build the next 10
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:11.360]   years. That's what you do when you're super instant. If you play Monopoly and you're down to your
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:18.240]   last buck, you can't start building houses and hotels. Your first job is to get the money up so
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:22.400]   that you can do that. I don't think Apple ever lost the vision though to their credit.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:28.160]   And that's a very tough thing to do of creating a better consumer product at every step of the way.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:32.640]   I think they always. And it's you're right. I completely agree with you, Dave, that you've got
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:37.280]   to have that spur. Got us to drive you. Yeah. Yeah. Something to drive you. Yeah.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:44.000]   I know it's true for me. Like in various, not at the same levels as Apple. But you know,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   you can get well, you build something and you get a little comfortable and it's, you know,
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.760]   some of that complacency can be okay. But you know, for me, it allowed me to spend some time with
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:55.600]   my family with it. And it's like, no, no, no, no, got to like kick back in and let's get it done.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.240]   I wouldn't know Dave. I've been coasting for 30 years now.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:01.760]   That's not true. I look forward to those days, my friend.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:08.800]   But on the flip side, it does get the nice thing about having the success and the financial
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:13.440]   cushion that Apple has is that it does allow a certain amount of freedom that there are other
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:18.240]   companies. If you wanted to come out with, if you really are convinced that this thing about
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:26.080]   the Apple glasses or wearable technology glasses is a thing, okay. But all your shareholders and
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:30.800]   all of your workers are saying, you've got one year and a half to make it into a smash success
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:35.120]   or else we really got it. We can't, we can't keep this thing afloat. Whereas Apple can not only
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:39.040]   start saying we're going to work on this because this is an interesting idea. We don't know if it's
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.400]   going to work out because we can't, it's a brand new thing. We can't know if it's going to work
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:46.560]   until we actually build it. So they can already, and then after three years, they can say, yeah,
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.480]   maybe we don't want an Apple branded television. We're canceling this whole thing. And if they
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:54.880]   do think there's something there, they can release it and then say, we don't even care if it's a
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:47:00.480]   financial failure for the first year, year and a half, or as we do, but we're going to use that,
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:05.280]   just like with the Apple watch, we're going to use the information to build the next generation of it
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.560]   and keep building up on it. That's the sort of thing you can do when you have that big of an
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:14.960]   iPhone cushion blow you to break your fall. And that's why I'm always excited when Apple takes
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:18.960]   these big risks, because very, very few companies are in the position where they can afford to take
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:24.640]   these big risks and stick with it until it turns out to be, until it really develops. Very, very
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:31.440]   little, very few devices are, especially when they're a brand new platform, our big success is right
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:35.040]   out of the gate. It takes time for developers to figure them out. Then after developers figure
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:41.760]   them out, that's when users figure them out. So I'll throw a little monkey wrench into this.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:48.080]   So ARM was actually started by Apple many years ago. They spun it off and divested.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:52.000]   It's currently owned by SoftBank. They bought it from the British
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:02.080]   holders for $32 billion four years ago. SoftBank has announced it's exploring a sale or an IPO
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:09.840]   for ARM holdings. Would Apple come along and say, "We'll give you 100% on your dollar. Four
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:16.720]   years, that's pretty good." Here's $64 billion, "We want ARM." Would Apple do that?
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:24.000]   I mean, if Apple were predatory, if Apple wanted to control the market, yes. I don't think Apple
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.880]   cares. But what do you think? Yeah, I don't think they need it. They don't need it, and the
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:34.400]   headaches of owning it would be tremendous. Well, they could basically say, "Now we own it."
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:39.440]   No more licenses. There's contractual obligations, and then there's antitrust.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:43.040]   There's so many headaches that come with owning ARM that they don't need because
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:48.560]   they barely need ARM anymore. If it's convenient and it's great for many things,
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:52.000]   and it'd be a pain in the butt to have to make their own instruction set, but if any company
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.680]   could make their own instruction set, I just don't think it's worth it. At this point,
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:01.360]   all ARM is for Apple's at checkbox on the feature list. Yeah, it's ARM compatible.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:07.520]   I mean, that's all they really... I was joking that Swift ISO would be an announcement that I
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:12.960]   would fully expect to see in a couple of years. Yeah. What do you think, Andy? Would Apple want
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:18.320]   to buy ARM? No, I don't think so. I think the same reasons why I don't think Apple would like to buy
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:28.320]   Disney or buy big Vacher Burn or Qualcomm. That would be sketchy. Antitrust would rear its head.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:35.120]   There's also how do you... It's not just buying ARM and owning it. It's also... You're also buying
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:39.680]   every single contractual obligation that they have to every other company, and that is a very
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:45.520]   wide range of devices. I don't know if that is way too much trouble for whatever it's worth.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:51.520]   It's much easier to use ARM as a way to strong ARM other chip manufacturers into building exactly
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:59.040]   the sort of silicon that you actually want. Dave, you think they should buy ARM? No. I think that
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:05.520]   would... No, no. I mean, it would... Like Renee was saying, they would inherit so many headaches
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:12.560]   that it would either be just a management nightmare or they would have to just try and shut down all
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:19.920]   those deals and then deal with antitrust up the wazoo. I think they are very interested in seeing
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:26.320]   what happens to this here because it might mean that they need to accelerate their path
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:32.880]   away from ARM and develop their own instruction set. But other than that... That's interesting.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:37.120]   So it really isn't even a tactical threat that maybe another competitor would come along and
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:42.480]   snap it up because if that were to happen, they didn't notice they didn't really use the word ARM.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:48.000]   And you have so much notice. Apple is probably going to... I expect they're going to go to ARM V9.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.800]   One of the first people to go to ARM V9 when they release Mac Silicon. And it's taken a decade to
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:58.240]   go from ARM V8 to ARM V9. And I don't think there'd be an ARM V10 anywhere sooner than Apple could
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.560]   make their own instructions that anyway. You know what's cheaper than spending $64 billion to buy
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:09.440]   ARM? Spend a tenth of that and get the engineers. That's it. Yeah. But they might even have the
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:13.840]   engineers they need. I think they have a lot of appropriate. Yeah. I don't even know that they
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:21.520]   need to spend $6 billion to do that. I think there are many other ways most of them better
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:29.360]   to solve this problem. It's not a problem. We have to remember that Apple is not moving to ARM.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:35.200]   They're moving to Apple Silicon. And it's all about building something, not taking an off-the-shelf
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:43.120]   CPU, but building something that really if you took it out of a Macintosh or an iOS device,
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:49.920]   it just would wander the streets alone and bereft. It just doesn't make sense outside of what it is.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:54.720]   So even if Apple were to buy it for the engineers, the engineers would have to spend two years
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:01.360]   learning how to build an Apple CPU. Yeah, I could see maybe Samsung or I could see somebody else
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:05.120]   looking to acquire it. Maybe even Google. There was this savage tweet this morning from
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:09.360]   Ice Universe who's one of the well-known Samsung leakers. And he put up a little diagram saying,
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:14.640]   the world tells Samsung to make, to change the gap between Qualcomm and Samsung. Samsung said,
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:21.200]   okay, and it shows Exynos even lower down compared to Qualcomm. And that breaks my heart because
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:26.960]   I want to see, again, Qualcomm's costs are so high that that whole industry could stand a lot of
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:33.600]   competition. Yeah, yeah. Boy, it's hard. Or just one CPU with a name as cool as ThreadRipper.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:40.160]   You'll want to show a room. It's like saying this. Well, this car has a standard V6. This one has a
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:45.440]   V6 with a Hemi. Like, okay, don't know what that is. But here's my checkbook. There's a good example,
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:51.840]   though, if you don't have a lot of cash, the choices AMD had to make between developing
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:53:00.000]   Radeon into a better GPU or making a better desktop processor, they put their resources into the
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:07.440]   latter and fell behind in graphics. And that's where that's an example of where it's nice to have
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:15.280]   a piggy bank. Because AMD is a little precarious at this point. You know,
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:18.880]   enthusiasts love it. Anybody, anytime I say anything against them, people are going to go,
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:24.480]   no, we love our ThreadRipper. And it's true. They made amazing stuff. But that doesn't mean that
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:30.320]   they're not a precarious position, right? Any competent silicon team given enough time and
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:34.240]   money can make the most performant, efficient chip in the world. It's just that not a lot of
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:40.240]   them have the money and none of them have the time. Just out of curiosity, Apple's going to fab
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:46.560]   this probably at TSMC. That's where they'll make it. And these guys are spun up and ready to do it,
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:50.720]   right? Five nanometer. I know it's amazing what they can do.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:58.400]   Is TSMC only in Taiwan? Because one of the things we've talked about, Foxconn's starting to build
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:04.320]   factories in India. I think a lot of countries given the trade war going on and the political
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:10.160]   issues going on in the US right now are we're looking at ways to move manufacturing out of China.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:15.360]   Taiwan, I would be a little worried not because they're part of China, but because China doesn't
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:20.480]   like Taiwan and they're right there. I feel like that might be a little precarious.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:26.240]   I think it's less like it's, I don't want to say less important, but Apple basically funds their
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:31.760]   process. Apple gives them so much equipment and money to get first access to it. And then they
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:38.720]   can sell to other people that that's more movable than Foxconn's money because the Foxconn manufacturing
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:43.840]   is really like it's a lot of components. Not that this isn't complicated, but I think it's
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:46.640]   it's more resilient to be like to setting up fabs in more places.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:50.880]   There are a lot of suppliers all over the world that they're really an assembler as much as
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:57.600]   anything else. TSMC makes the chips. They're the supplier. They're the ones down.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:04.160]   It's the same way Samsung manufacturing makes Exynos or Samsung Silicon makes Exynos and
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:08.400]   Samsung manufacturing makes OLED panels and all of these suppliers.
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:14.400]   It's an interesting world. One more arm story, then we'll move on.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:24.240]   Apple, yes, could be could be other appendages soon. We don't know. Apple promises that they're
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:30.160]   going to support Thunderbolt in the new arm max, which is a relief for those of us who have invested
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:35.520]   in Thunderbolt. But that that's not inconsistent with what what I was thinking, which is USB 4.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:43.440]   Right. That's the same thing. Inside USB 4. Yeah, it's like it's part of the spec. So
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:48.560]   it would have been really weird if Apple said we will never support USB 4.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.920]   It would have been weird if Apple had said we won't support Thunderbolt. I mean, they helped
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:56.880]   develop that technology. It's partly there's partly Intel's. This is the statement Apple gave
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:01.760]   the verge over a decade ago, Apple partnered with Intel to design and develop Thunderbolt.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.360]   Today, our customers enjoy the speed and flexibility it brings to every Mac,
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:10.720]   although good luck finding in an expensive Thunderbolt peripheral. They're all so expensive.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:18.320]   We continuing with the quote, that was me not Apple. We were man, they're expensive. We remain
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:21.920]   committed to the future of Thunderbolt and will support it in Max with Apple Silicon.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:27.120]   Now that's that could leave that leaves room for saying, well, yeah, what we mean.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:30.480]   I got the same statement for what it's worth. Okay. So I'll give you credit.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:34.880]   No, no, but I'm just saying like that that was literally their line because people saw the
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:38.720]   Thunderbolt for announcement. And I think Apple was and people like, why didn't Apple say anything?
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:43.920]   I think Apple was waiting on the Thunderbolt for announcement because Thunderbolt 3 was licensed
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:48.960]   by Intel and it was exclusive to Intel for a while. And then they started licensing it. You
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:52.800]   have to buy a board if you wanted to use it with AMD that supported Thunderbolt. And it was a little
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:58.960]   bit of a thing and Thunderbolt 4 as far as I can tell is just openly licensed. So I think people
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:03.280]   were sort of worried that Apple was going to abandon Thunderbolt or that Intel would be belligerent
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:07.120]   and say, no, you're leaving us. We're taking all our toys with us. Well, because we've
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:12.560]   those of us who have bought Thunderbolt peripherals and I have at great expense would be kind of
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:18.320]   devastated. They didn't work. So Thunderbolt 4 is compatible with USB 4. Does it go the other
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:25.040]   direction if I have a USB 4 to chip? Is that word? It's so complicated. USB 4 is the name. So USB
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:30.480]   4 is the name of the plug. So USB C is the name of the plug. USB 4 is the name of the protocol.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:35.440]   Thunderbolt is an option on the protocol as is power delivery. And it just makes consumers nuts.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.880]   Yes, because you can't look at the port and know what it is. And we're supposed to
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:43.440]   silkscreen stuff on there, but nobody does. Yeah, a little underbought. Who knows? Like my
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:46.480]   parents have no idea what that is or need to look for it. It's the most confusing thing ever.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:51.040]   I actually did a whole ask the tech guy trying to explain this and I got I couldn't
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:57.040]   was confusing me. The one thing that's easy to remember, it doesn't actually make this easier,
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:02.800]   but it makes it feel like it's easier is that letters are with USB letters are for the shape of
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:07.120]   the connector. Numbers are for the protocol or if you really want to like simplify it,
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:13.520]   the speed of the data transfer across the connector. That's it. So it gets really confusing from there.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:20.800]   One. So what you're going to look for is a lightning bolt with the four. And that will be
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:27.920]   support us. That will support us. Look at this USB. These are all type C by the way.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:35.440]   This is simplification to that. Yeah. Simplification one cable replaces other cables. USB two, USB 3.2,
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:42.720]   which is a five gigabit standard, USB 3.2, the 10 gigabyte standard, gigabit standard, USB 3.2,
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:51.760]   the 20 gigabit standard, USB three with power delivery, USB four, 20 gigabit, and USB four, 40 gigabit.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:58.240]   So it's presumably Apple will support the number four.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:04.960]   Right. So that way you get it all. And you get power delivery, you get video, you get all the
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:10.880]   other stuff. Until your sweaty fingers on the job site rub off the label on the cable.
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:17.680]   Because nobody wants to still screen it on the computer because that's ugly. And there's no room.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:22.400]   It's still a place to put it. There's no place to put it. It doesn't matter because if you buy
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:26.800]   the wrong cable, you're hosed anyway. Oh my god. It's so crazy. That cable doesn't support power
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:30.000]   delivery. That's only going to turn on your monitor, but it won't power. I think God's dog.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:38.240]   I just bought from other world computing. I have a SEP, I'm a pro in a separate data drive,
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:45.520]   external data drive. So I did not, you know. And my data drive died. It was USB 3.2. So I thought,
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:54.080]   well, here's a chance to upgrade to Thunderbolt 3. So other world sells a enclosure that holds
[00:59:54.080 --> 01:00:02.800]   four NVMe M.2 SSDs in there. Right. That should be fast. Right. And I got four Samsung 970 Pro
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:11.040]   Evo SSDs. So terabyte each. And then I get the thing they say, oh, and if you want to use this
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:18.000]   in RAID, which I did, you have to buy soft rate for $179. It's like, what?
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.640]   So you have used Apple's built in. Yeah, Apple only supports RAID 0 and one.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:30.640]   So I am using Apple's raids because I don't want that. One other thing about soft rate,
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:36.640]   you have to turn off the security extensions because Apple won't let you install it otherwise.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:41.680]   So you have to go and make your whole machine less secure to run this third party driver at
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:48.720]   $179 so that I could use it as RAID 5. So I'm using it in scary RAID, which, which this utility
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:54.720]   supports RAID 0. It's striped across all four. It's a four terabyte drive now, which is nice.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:00.160]   And I back it up. So I figured it's scary. Yeah, I back it up. I actually back it up automatically
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.680]   with Superduper and Chrono Sync to a big Drobo, which is, and then I also back, I back it up
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:11.200]   four ways. I back it up in the cloud. I back it up in my NAS. I back it up locally. So if it dies,
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.800]   you know, or I, you know, that's fine. If it dies, mostly I'll be pissed off because it's expensive.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:23.840]   But the good news is that I'll work with my new Silicon, Apple Silicon Mac, right?
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.960]   As long as it's not the developer kiss, you can go. Oh, crap.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.560]   Really? That does the support center with Thunderbolt 3?
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:35.040]   There's no PCIe lanes out of the iPad chips. Oh, interesting.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.680]   Well, no wonder people were worried.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:42.960]   Correct. Yeah, that's why. Oh, so they will wait.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:50.880]   It will definitely. Okay. It's not your Mac anyway. You're just you're just borrowing it for 500 bucks.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.240]   You're renting it. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:57.760]   Did anybody going to get that? I was I thought, oh, I should do this. And then I said that, well,
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:01.920]   what's the project you're working on? Well, it's this little Leo Laport icon I have.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.440]   I don't think they would. It's for a folder.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:10.320]   I wanted a folder. That's my project.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.520]   We're going to do it. We couldn't talk about it, Leo.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:17.920]   Oh, really? They that's that's NDA.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:22.240]   That's what I hear. Oh, okay. I know you don't because you would never.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:26.800]   But good to know. Okay. So that's another reason why I didn't do it because I wouldn't have
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:31.360]   been able to talk about it anyway. So what's the point? I know you're not supposed to benchmark it.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:36.640]   Oh, all you have to do is look at Geekbench. You can see people are doing it, but they're not
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:43.440]   announcing it. Well, those benchmarks are also run through the translation. Yes, not even a good
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.920]   it's not even a good. Yeah, it's emulation. It's an interesting as long as you read it for what
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.920]   it is. It's actually a really interesting day. It's pretty freaking fast. Yeah. That's
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:58.400]   Rosetta to work. Yeah. That's good. Good news. Yeah. Yep. Our show today brought to you by Last
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:04.720]   Pass. Here we are in the lovely confines of the Last Pass studios. I'm the only guy who gets to
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:12.160]   use it now, which is really nice. I love it all alone in my Last Pass studios. But we do we are
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:17.120]   very grateful to Last Pass because not only do they buy studio naming rights, but they protect
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:23.360]   every entry point to our business. We sell employees home, right? All of a sudden,
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:29.280]   you know, they got the keys to the kingdom. The logins to the bank accounts and the databases
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:33.120]   and the websites and all that stuff. That's a little nerve-wracking. Thank goodness.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:38.640]   Thank goodness we've got Last Pass Enterprise. We converted to that a while ago. It was just that
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:44.080]   this is actually wild. I knew I'd been using Last Pass for a long time, practically since they came
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:50.240]   out. So that's maybe 12, 13 years. I can't remember. I know it's a long time because this is the 10th
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:57.040]   anniversary of Steve Gibson's Last Pass security now where he talked to Joe Seagrest, the author,
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:01.360]   looked at all the code, Joe shared everything with him, how it's being done, and said, "This is
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.040]   great. This is done the right way. It's still being done exactly the right way. Of course,
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:10.880]   it gets better all the time." So we've been using Last Pass a really long time here to it.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:19.120]   And it's saved us. If your IT department is facing people working from home, more devices,
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:26.800]   more applications, new threats, new regulations, all making strong security extremely complex,
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:32.320]   they need to know about Last Pass. Last Pass provides IT with strong security that is easy to
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:37.360]   use. That's important. If it's not easy to use, your employees won't do it. It's also easy to manage.
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:43.760]   And that's just as important. Secure every entry point from shadow IT to apps to mobile and cloud
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:49.120]   services. Last Pass's solutions give you visibility and control over every access point to your
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.760]   authentic organization. That's so important. They do it, of course, with the best password
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.560]   vault in the world. But there's a lot more going on. For instance, Last Pass identity offers a
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:04.000]   simple and integrative view across all access and authentication tasks. So IT can see exactly
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.080]   who's accessing what, when, and where. You can increase security. This is the holy grail.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:14.320]   You can increase security and convenience. Normally it's one or the other.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:19.600]   Increase security that slows down employees, hinders productivity. But at the same time,
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.880]   you need that security. And that's why Last Pass is great. It makes it easier for employees,
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:30.000]   for instance, single sign on. They have over 1,200 single sign on apps. They have multi-factor
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.840]   authentication, not just fingerprint and face recognition. That's true. That's in there.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:43.920]   But also, contextual authentication. Things like location or IP address that really
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:48.160]   reduce user friction and improve security. It's kind of magical.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:54.800]   Look, spreadsheets and sticky notes for your passwords. Just not a good idea. And nor is
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:06:01.520]   nor is emailing passwords to co-workers so that they can share a resource. Last Pass lets your
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:05.760]   employees do their work securely, no matter where they are in the office or at home.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:11.440]   They never transmit your master password. They don't have access to it. Data is only
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:18.000]   decrypted on device. It works everywhere. Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, every browser. They
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:25.600]   use 256-bit AES encryption. I mean, you know, everything they do, PBKDF2, which makes it much
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:31.680]   harder to breed brute force, virtually impossible, and on and on and on. We love Last Pass.
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:35.440]   That's why we're so happy to be partnered with them. And we encourage you, if you are

[01:06:53.120 --> 01:07:01.120]   Lastpass.com/twit. We thank them so much for supporting Mac, break, weekly, and all of our
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:07.920]   efforts here. These are tough times and Last Pass has really come through for us, so we really
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:16.720]   appreciate it. What about this rumor that Apple is making thousands of semi-transparent lenses
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:26.240]   at Foxconn? This comes from the information. Apple reaches new stage in development of AR devices.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:34.240]   They're working with Taiwan's Foxconn technology. And they are in a pre-production mode, I guess.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:41.440]   The information says, of course, Apple refused to comment, but the information says their sources
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:46.880]   say the lenses are at least one to two years away from mass production, as is in all likelihood.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:53.600]   The AR product. But you've got to ramp up production, you've got to make tests,
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:58.800]   you've got to get them to developers, and that's what they're apparently doing right now.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:09.280]   Depends on how many thousands, doesn't it? Yeah, it's not millions. It's definitely a test run.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:14.080]   It could mean they're making enough to test in-house. It could mean they're making enough that they
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:18.400]   could send some to a few close friends. It could mean they're just literally just testing the
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.720]   manufacturing process and that none of these are intended to be really tested by anybody.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:32.400]   So according to a person familiar with the matter, the lenses had passed the prototype stage two
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:38.560]   months ago, and they've entered trial production, which would be how you would prove the process,
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:43.760]   make sure you can do them reliably, and as you say, in great quantities, perhaps make sample units
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:51.920]   to send to executives or developers. We just keep hearing this drumbeat that Apple's going to do this,
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:56.960]   then they're going to do it in the next couple of years. That'd be interesting.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:02.880]   If they're saying it's semi-transparent, that does suggest that they're using some sort of a
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:10.000]   side projection where you have essentially beams are going from left and right, and it shoots into
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:17.920]   the glass and then is diverted 90 degrees into the eyes. I've always been... My big mystery with
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:24.160]   this project has always been, are they intending to do an Apple watch in the eyeglasses sort of thing
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:28.400]   where here is a notification or here is something actionable or here's a way to interact with Siri,
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:33.920]   or are they intending to do something that is closer to augmented reality? And if it's the latter,
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:39.280]   it would be quite a thing if they were able to put that into a pair of glasses that don't make you
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:45.040]   look like @best Charles Nelson Riley, and at worst like, you know, I don't mind looking like Charles
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:50.480]   Nelson Riley. Jordy, I don't know. It's quite cool. Yeah. The lens is... This is the information,
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:56.080]   by the way, they're in what's called EVT or the engineering validation test. That's when they
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:01.040]   start making a lot of them. The design is locked down and they're now testing its suitability for
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:07.440]   mass production. The lenses use a polarized system similar to the technology in 3D movie
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.040]   glasses. Now there's active and passive polarization, so they don't describe which.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.920]   But that's what gives you stereoscopic, you know, 3D imagery.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:23.680]   The AR lenses are tough to make according to the source because they're composed of multiple
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:29.440]   extremely thin layers of different synthetic materials, each of which is susceptible to bubble
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:35.680]   scratches and other marks. They must be manufactured in clean rooms. And the person said,
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:41.600]   "This might confirm what you're thinking, Andy. The lenses are slightly larger than those
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:49.440]   found in eyeglasses, typically." Slightly larger. There's so many problems. And again,
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:54.800]   you put a scratch in one of these things. Remember how mad that Steve Jobs got when he was carrying
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:11:00.400]   around the first iPhone with a plastic screen and said, "Fix this. That could be a deal breaker."
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:05.840]   Well, you could seal it with a glass lens. So I think now we have to put a screen cover on it.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:11.040]   Yeah. I feel like with your mask, your mask.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.880]   My snapchat spectacles. Oh, it's just after what I came to be an eye stack with something to it.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:18.960]   Yeah. No, no, actually, I think it's I need a bowler. I think it's the Roger Stone look is what
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:25.760]   I'm going for here. The red light. The red light. The red light. The red light. The red light. The red light.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:35.040]   Yeah, bigger lenses. I don't think bigger is bad. Bigger is more stylish. And it's interesting
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.560]   they may make in bigger lenses because that's a bigger field of view as well.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:41.280]   Can they be heart shaped?
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:53.760]   It's exciting because the thing is you can either have glasses that don't do a whole lot,
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:59.600]   but they are wearable and they last a good amount of time. Or you can have something like magic leap
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:04.880]   where they're awesome and they do incredible things, but you need to have something on your belt.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:10.800]   You need to have a device that's a lot more nimble than even an iPhone, I think, in order to
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:18.640]   keep it working. It's interesting to think that whatever Apple does, it's going to be a lot like
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:24.000]   the original iPhone where we've seen touchscreen devices before. We've heard of multi touch before,
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.560]   but we haven't seen them put together very, very effectively until the iPhone came out.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:32.400]   I think that we're going to see a lot of random technologies that we've heard of and a lot of
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:38.160]   almost their products that we've seen and it will come together into an actual productive product.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.800]   But if they decide to ship it, which is still very much an issue.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:46.800]   Well, Apple's not going to ship something that they feel is hamfisted just to get it out there.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:54.560]   Right? I mean, of course. So, yeah, I think you're right. I see it more along the lines of what
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:59.360]   we experienced with the first Apple watch, not necessarily the first iPhone, although you may
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:03.360]   be right about that, that it's like, "Oh, I never thought about putting these things together this
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:08.160]   way." I mean, that's Apple stock and trade, right? Taking a look at products that are out there and
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.840]   saying, "We have a better way of doing this and here's what it looks like."
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:18.560]   The iPhone has enough power. I think to power those kind of features in its own display,
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:23.760]   the question is, could it maintain? If you're doing it via Bluetooth, you're doing it even via
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:29.760]   direct Wi-Fi. Could they maintain that link with little enough latency and with enough
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:37.200]   reliability that you wouldn't suddenly be... Wait, where do the little flash of choice be
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:43.760]   generating? Yeah, you can't have things saying, Bluetooth audio fades out for half a second,
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:48.720]   it's a fraction of a second, it's not a big deal. But when you're counting on looking at a certain
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:53.200]   piece of information and suddenly disappears and you see a spinning whatever for half a second,
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:59.360]   then comes back. That's the, "Why did I spend $800, $1,000, $2,000, even $300 for this thing?"
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:04.880]   Well, that's why I think the watch is a good analog here because the watch,
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:10.480]   not basically, it connects exactly those ways, right? It's either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi,
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:19.200]   direct Wi-Fi to your phone. And if it loses that connection, the watch still is doing enough
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:23.680]   on its own so that when you're looking at it, you aren't really aware that it's lost.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:28.320]   There's sometimes where it's like, "Oh, wait a minute, something's wrong here."
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:34.320]   But otherwise, the watch is a pretty fluid, seamless experience, even though it's relying on
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:40.240]   Bluetooth, which is so unreliable, it's ridiculous, but it sure is low power and that's good.
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:50.000]   Apple had started opening its stores. Now they're going to close them again. And now they're even
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:58.320]   saying we may not get a full return to work this year in our US offices. They're trying to get
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:05.280]   retail folks to work at home. A lot of the stores, stores in hotspots, re-closed.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:15.040]   So that's a lot of Southern California. If your store is closed, they sent this message to employees.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:20.800]   Please sign up for retail at home. Please talk to your manager because we really need to make
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:27.360]   sure we shift our teams to greet our customers remotely in this time. We may need to be working
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:34.640]   remotely for some period of time. That was in a video created by Didro Bryan, the Senior Vice
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:40.720]   President for Retail. This is not the experience she said we want to have for our customers,
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.240]   so we really want to make sure we're moving to where our customers are to help them during this
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:49.520]   very challenging time. As you know, people are really dependent upon their devices, especially
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:54.640]   right now. They'll get name tag lanyards they can customize with their own emoji.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:16:02.000]   That will help retail staff be more recognizable when they're wearing face masks.
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:09.520]   90 re-closed of the 271 locations due to COVID spikes. They've also shut some stores in Australia.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:14.880]   For locations that remain open, of course, the company continues to require face masks,
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:19.600]   both for customers and employees. Temperature checks upon entry. They're also
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:29.520]   sending COVID-19 tests home. They've started a program that allows retail and corporate employees
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:36.720]   working remotely to get tests mailed to them. Then you can do the self-test and then send it
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:42.320]   to a testing site. This is all from Bloomberg. Last month, Apple started letting corporate
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:48.800]   employees returning to its offices take on-site COVID-19 nasal swab tests. They're testing people
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:58.560]   at home now as well. It's got to... Their story is no different than every other business in America.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.760]   Right now, it's just everybody's struggling a little bit.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:04.160]   These are not so open like Disney.
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:11.840]   Have you seen the pictures of people in line at Disney attractions?
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:18.400]   The terrified workers just tweeting out their helplessness.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:24.160]   They've got to work. They don't make any money otherwise. They're not going to get unemployment
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:31.760]   if they say no. I'm not going to work. Meanwhile, Tim Cook took home $133 million last year.
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:37.760]   Not that he didn't deserve it. Tim's compared to Founders Money Leo. Tim is just never going to
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:45.600]   have Founders Money. No. In fact, he was only number two in the US. Elon Musk got more than half a
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:52.000]   billion dollars. A lot of that was stock. He got Founders Money. Several times over.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:58.880]   He can only be part owner of a soccer team, not a professional football team. It just sticks at him.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:05.840]   Oh, man. Cook is number two. He's a little higher than Tom Rutledge, chairman of Charter
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:12.480]   Communications. Cable companies, that's a low margin business. He only made $116 million last year.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:16.000]   But Tim is giving most of his to charity after he puts his nephew through school.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.400]   I know. I love that. More. He gets the better. Don't you love Tim?
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:26.000]   His base salary is $3 million a year. That's fair. You can live on that. You can live on that.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:32.480]   $7.7 million in incentives. There are people who get paid far more and achieve far.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:38.160]   Oh, yeah. CEOs are vastly overpaid. The rest coming from stock that vested during the year.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:44.480]   So over time, Tim's got a lot of stocks vested. Yeah. Senator Panchai.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:50.640]   Panchai and his apples problem with him. Remember when Steve Jobs said, "I'm only going to get paid
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:56.960]   $1. Oh, and I want a private jet." Yeah. No, my favorite story was when he kept buying
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:02.720]   Scott Forest all lunch. I have to buy you lunch. I was like, "No, Scott. I only get $1 a year salary.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:06.880]   I don't know where all this money is actually coming from." And then everyone just assumed it
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:13.920]   was Woz's account. It's magic. It's magic money. Nobody asks. Certainly nobody wanted to ask Steve
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:20.160]   about it. No, Steve, where the hell are you? What is you? When you get running up a tab? What's the deal?
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:27.040]   That's the jobs we have to talk, sir. Mr. Jobs, you haven't paid your lunch fees in 16 months.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:31.120]   Yeah. They maxed $18,000. There you go. There you go. No more grilled cheese for you, sir.
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:34.640]   Alphabet with a baseball bat's coming up by his door.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:40.480]   Here's a $20 dollar bill. I bet you haven't seen one of these in a long time, have you?
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.960]   Alphabet's. You can crumble the dry ramen on top of me. It's extra delicious. And crunchy,
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:53.360]   which is good. Who does it like a little texture? Wouldn't that be sad? Actually, you know what?
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:56.800]   Steve Jobs probably would be happy to live on ramen. That would be like his dream.
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:01.280]   I don't know. It's got a lot of sodium in it. I think he probably wants that.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:07.360]   Yeah. He had some for a person who liked ramen. He had an awfully nice car.
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:13.040]   Somebody didn't pay for that either. Never with a license plate on it, though. Right.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:18.080]   Got to get new one every six months. You can see the biggest piece of life.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:23.920]   Forstall bought his used cars every six months. Oh, really?
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:30.160]   Maybe not every six months, but Forstall was known for driving, you know, Steve's old
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.920]   eaters. Oh my god. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:39.760]   Well, you were surprised. Like they're like, if you really like working here, Scott,
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:44.560]   he would. Well, the hilarious thing was like the story about like Apple is famous for its cars
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:50.320]   club. And like you already have like Phil and Eddie buying singers, which are like million
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:56.080]   dollar restored pourshes, you know, and other people driving Mercedes and then Jeff Williams
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:00.880]   driving like a 13 year old on good for Jeff. Good operation guys. Never spent any
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.760]   money on. No, he knows money. He knows the value of a dollar.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:09.680]   Also, that's got to be a bad idea because I mean, I didn't know Steve jobs personally, but
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:13.520]   if there's one executive at Apple that would be rolling back in a domino, it would probably be
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:19.120]   Steve. That's my guess. Honest, I only drove it 15 miles on Sundays.
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:25.360]   Yeah. You drove it. I feel like the odometer on a Mercedes. Why is that Steve?
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:30.800]   What? Why do you have an intern just driving your car backwards in the parking lot all day?
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.920]   Got to buy her. I got to buy her.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:41.440]   Cook just just to put this in perspective, $133 million this year, most of it really,
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:48.880]   really his salary was 10.7 million. The rest was stock. Senator Pichai stock salary all in 86
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:56.000]   million dollars. Alphabet CEO Intel CEO Robert Swan, $99 million. Satya Nadella,
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:02.160]   Microsoft CEO, $77 million. It's not like anything over, I don't know, 50 or 60 million is probably
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:09.840]   enough. So it's not like they're poor. Yeah. It's just a little bad for them.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:13.360]   It's that stock though. Did you see what Apple closed out yesterday?
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:18.720]   Oh my God. Is this still going up? It went down last night, but I don't know what it's doing today.
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:27.040]   It's a little bit, I think it's up today. I feel like such an idiot because when this thing started,
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:33.680]   actually, January and then later, I think in March, I got out of the stock market. I said,
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:40.800]   this isn't good. This is going to be bad. To January was early, so we managed to lock in all the,
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:47.600]   that was for our company, pension fund. Got all of that out of stock. Thank God.
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:55.120]   And then I got out of all, I don't, I don't have index funds, but I got, I sold all my index funds.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:23:01.440]   And then the stock market, how dare it goes? It has no correlation with reality, Leo. These are
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:07.680]   not the same people. These are suffering. You and me, Leo, we are, we are perfect at
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:13.760]   predicting the peaks of the market. Yeah. And getting out at the wrong time. Getting in at the
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:18.800]   wrong time, getting out at the wrong time. I'm a master of this. Anybody wants to know, sign up for
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:24.320]   my newsletter. It's just a fine and porous compliance. We learned that last week. So depressing. Look
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:31.120]   at the, I love this Apple stock chart when you go from the day it started because it's such a low
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:36.400]   number compared to the current value that it's basically flat. And then it starts to go up and then
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:43.280]   currently doing quite well. And yeah, the COVID doesn't seem to have, year to day, took a little
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:51.440]   dive in April or late March. It was a pretty big dive. It's recovered fully. It's higher now that
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:57.120]   it was, you know, the beginning of the year. Double what it, what it was, right? Yeah.
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:06.160]   I'm so smart getting out of the stock. Now, to be fair, I own no Apple stock. So, or maybe I did,
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:11.680]   I only owned S&P 500. So, you know that because I didn't want to have any text. I didn't want to
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:20.320]   have any investment in tech company's success. Just in America's success. Who knew America
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:24.560]   went on being successful when the rest of us are suffering? I don't understand it.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:34.480]   Apple's maybe closing stores in the US, but they're opening the big new Beijing flagship store.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:46.320]   Gonna be pretty. It'll open soon in Beijing. This is the new flagship design language, large glass
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:53.200]   walls, slope metal roof, elaborate stonework. It's similar to the Chicago Michigan Avenue store,
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:58.560]   apparently. And but gorgeous store. Yeah. Let's all go to Beijing.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:05.920]   Do not. I feel like by using TikTok, I'm already there. I know. Right. Well, they're already with
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:13.760]   you anyway. We're not wanted. We're not allowed. Can't come in. Apple says, do not cover your MacBook
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:20.720]   camera. Do not put band-aids on it. If you're going to put anything on it, make it as thin as a
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:26.960]   piece of paper, the reason people are bringing in laptop screens that are cracked. It's a very
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:33.520]   distinctive, apparently, very distinctive crack a line straight down because they're the tolerances
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:38.400]   when you close the laptop are so tight that you're actually cracking it because of that cover.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:47.520]   So Apple's saying, do not put a sticker tape anything over your camera. Don't worry, Apple says,
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.800]   there's no way to turn on that camera without that green light coming on.
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.720]   Yeah, but still, but it can come on in an awful hurry.
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:04.080]   They did save. If you've got your micro calipers, anything that's 0.1 millimeters is fine.
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:11.760]   So I always, one of the first things I do to a notebook is to put a little strip of tape
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:15.680]   over it enough so that I can see the light, but I can't see, but it's blocking the lens.
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:22.320]   And so I can see the green light come on, but I'll hear. Andy, I can't do something wrong with
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.280]   your camera. It's weird to be camera. It's like, nope. Yeah. That's it. That's a good point.
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:32.160]   So if as post it, no, it would be OK. Probably. I would imagine so. Yeah, something that's going
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:36.800]   to be really thin. But it's not really. You can't help it and, you know, pop that thing out of there.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:42.640]   You'd be good to go. Yeah, or remove it before you close it. Yeah. I don't care if somebody sees me
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:49.040]   dancing around in my jammies. I don't like it. It worked for Tom Cruise. I mean, yeah, but I don't
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:52.640]   have Tom Cruise's butt. He doesn't have any more than Andy.
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:58.720]   Yeah. There's your TikTok channel. Leo, you dancing around in your jammies.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.560]   That'd be perfect. Actually, that's already. This is Leo, the port.
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:13.840]   Battery gate settlements. Get ready for your bag of pop chips. If you know the serial number of
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:23.920]   your old iPhone 6 6S SE or 7, you can submit a claim. You may get as much as $25 back. This is
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:32.080]   because as Apple revealed in 2017, they slowed down iPhones. Apple said it was to keep them from
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:41.120]   crashing as the battery life dwindled. They got dinged. There was a class action lawsuit.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:47.600]   Apple agreed to pay up to half a billion dollars, although denying any wrong doing.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:52.960]   Submit your claims to a website set up by the United States District Court for the Northern
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:28:01.760]   District of California, but you will need that serial number. In Ray, Apple Inc. Device Performance
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:08.000]   Litigation Case Number 18 Stroke MD Stroke 2827 Stroke EJD.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:16.160]   I got the Quebec one a year ago, I think. We had a distinct one to get back.
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:21.120]   Did you get money? Yeah, it kept spammy with money, but it's like it's so little money for so much
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:24.880]   effort that you don't do it. And then I assume that that's their plan to begin with. Right.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:32.800]   So if you don't know the serial number, you may be able to locate your serial number by filling
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:38.960]   in the information like Apple ID, device type first name, last name, street address, city, state,
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:43.920]   and zip code. And then maybe they can find it for you. So that's good. You don't have to remember
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:49.520]   your serial number. They have the database. They can perhaps do the look up. They see it.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.320]   Sir, that's a Samsung phone. Can you please stop submitting it? Sir, please stop. Just
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:00.880]   let me just try to slow. I thought that's what this is supposed to do. It's Apple's fault.
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:06.960]   They should pay. I had all of these. Does that mean I have to do seven of them? Yes, sir.
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:17.520]   If you want all 75 bucks. Oh, okay. First name, last name, street address,
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:26.400]   oh my God. All right. Search. Yes. I would like to use that corrected street address.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:32.080]   Do not does not match our database. Please double check. Okay. Let's see. What else did I have?
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:38.640]   Exterminate. Exterminate. I can only I only have to do the no does not match our database.
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:46.800]   Exterminate. How about you want this money? Okay. Okay. I only had the plus sizes. So that
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:53.440]   should not match your first does not match your database. None of them doesn't match. So
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:30:02.160]   you lose Leo. No $25 for you. Yeah, the attorneys get to keep your money. So I never use my home
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:10.560]   address. I always use the company address. Oh, the brick house. Of course, I wasn't here.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:18.240]   When was this? When was this iPhone seven? This was a long time ago. Yeah. Was was the brick house
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:26.880]   address 140 Keller? Oh, I'm going to get my money now, man. Oh, here it goes.
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:36.720]   We do not compute does not need to not match none of it. None of them. I can't get any of them.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:39.440]   I wonder if you'll wind up making more than minimum wage on this three.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:46.560]   You get it. None of them match. Okay. What else could it be? I never did mine. Oh, my God.
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:51.680]   They're counting on that. I mean, who would have your serial number unless you still had the phone.
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:57.440]   You don't keep a database of all your serial numbers, maybe in a last pass note or something.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:04.080]   Actually, I do now believe it or not. I actually do now. No, no. You know, my mom still has her. I
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:12.480]   six. I can probably get some money from mom. No, no recognition at all. None. So there you go.
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:20.320]   Just I did it. So you don't have to. Well, it's it's really, really important that the people who
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:27.680]   have been aligned by Apple on this aren't allowed to in exchange take advantage of the situation
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:32.480]   by doing something that no one can possibly figure out what they would possibly do under
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:36.560]   whatever motivation. But still, it's important that you do these validations correctly.
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:45.040]   One of the features of iOS 14 that I have not yet encountered is that when somebody's looking at
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:50.160]   your clipboard, Apple says, Hey, get out there. Look at your clipboard. Oh, I get that all the time.
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:55.680]   Like, do you? Yeah. What about the malicious one? I never got the malicious one, but I got like,
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:59.280]   Oh, you're if you pace between two different apps, it should come up or different devices.
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:04.560]   So of course, TikTok got busted. They said, we're going to fix this LinkedIn said it's a bug.
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:11.840]   And it's an SDK now that there was an SDK that they were all using that was doing. It was
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:18.880]   a good idea to go ads SDK. Yeah. And I think what it really means is that Google's ad
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:26.000]   service was snooping your clipboard looking for keywords so that it could target advertising.
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:35.040]   I'm willing to bet that's what that was. So yeah, it was a Google ad SDK. So bug or feature, you know,
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:40.720]   anyway, LinkedIn is now being another great class action lawsuit being so everyone copying and
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:45.680]   pasting their favorite and nude facial concealer makeup was getting the worst ads imaginable.
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:50.480]   They were not looking at your passwords or not looking anything else. We're not exfiltrating it.
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:56.400]   Google's just going through your clipboard. Looking for stuff you might be looking for an ad for.
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:03.360]   Oh, yeah. I really think that in addition to all the really great security stuff and privacy
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:08.320]   stuff that Apple's putting in to the operating system, I would love for them to have a standalone
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:12.400]   security app that simply will do things like I'm going to scan everyone of your apps to let you
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:18.400]   know here is here SDKs and here that we are. We understand who have been operated, but
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:24.000]   they're not necessarily dangerous, but we would like you to know that that every that when you
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.040]   use an app that's using this SD that's using this code, you might it might be a really nice
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:34.800]   pop the bubbles game, but it's also sending it's also saying information to these ad networks,
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:39.680]   not just by network tracking, but simply saying here, we recognize this code. We recognize this
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:45.760]   package. This is why Apple had a good had some good results when they decided to start naming and
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:51.040]   shaming battery hog apps. And once they simply say, Oh, no, no, we're we're not going to ban you
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:54.800]   from using these API's, but we're just going to put up a little pop up that says, Oh, by the way,
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:00.160]   you're you're you're you're happy little fishy bubble game is doing something that you the user
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:05.360]   might not take a Bravo Apple. They deserve a lot of credit for that. Have you seen Greyhound yet?
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:13.760]   No, no, so good. I heard I have to watch it like as big as possible and as loud as possible. Yeah,
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:23.520]   it's kind of like 1917 or, you know, it's one of those big war movies, but like 1917, it's a small
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:31.680]   it's only like 36 hours. It's very condensed. It's I Apple paid $70 million to run it exclusively
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:36.720]   on Apple TV plus, which means you don't pay the $20 rental fee that you pay for other first run
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:42.160]   movies. So that's good. You have to subscribe to Apple TV plus, but most of us, I think, are getting
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:46.720]   I saw a ton of people doing that just to get just to watch the movie. It's a good show. I think it's
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:52.800]   a really good movie. Tom Hanks wrote it besides starring in it. And it's historically, I think,
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:58.800]   very interesting. Apparently, Apple is as a first look agreement with Idris Elba
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:05.200]   for TV shows and movies. I think that's a good thing to buy. I love Idris Elba. He was rumored he
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:09.920]   was going to be the next James Bond. I think this I would have loved that. Yeah, he'd be so good.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:20.640]   So we'll see Apple TV spending the money. They they they they they landed the Snow Blind.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:26.640]   Are you a snow blind fan? I'm not familiar. Oh my God.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:33.280]   I'm more has denied me access. What is it? Maybe your system is out of control.
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:39.280]   Access to the now I'm not you are not authorized to access this page.
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:45.760]   I was just going to read your your story about Jake Gyllenhaal and Snow Blind.
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:50.640]   Let me go to the front page. Maybe I can get there that and Lori Gills not here to answer for
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:59.040]   herself. Now there's so many good things in here. I just want to stop and reveal.
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:03.600]   This is good. You guys are good. I mean, you you you're former guys.
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:08.000]   Yes. I was there. I think when they did this new homepage, I think I was there. I don't know if
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.960]   they've changed. You still write once a week for I'm more so yes, it's still you.
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:18.800]   It's still blamed. I get zero credit and all the blame, which is I think exactly what they wanted.
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:24.240]   Let me search for Gyllenhaal. That's going to be a unique.
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:30.000]   I just figured last last week, I put my foot so far through my mouth that I could walk on it again.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.280]   I'm going to just stick a stick out of the Apple TV plus stuff this week.
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:39.840]   Deadline has the original exclusive is saying that in a six way bidding war Apple Studios,
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:47.120]   of course Snow Blind, which is the boom studios graphic novel. I thought I thought it was a
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:53.520]   different one that I that was made into a not great movie, but I don't I don't remember that.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:59.280]   Yeah. Okay. They're buying up stuff like crazy. They want another bidding war
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:09.200]   for the it won't even be the movie won't even be made until next year. Antoine Fukua and Will Smith,
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:14.480]   a story about emancipation. I think it's called emancipated or emancipated,
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:20.960]   but it sounds like a really good and topical story. What did they bid? It was like a hundred
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:27.040]   20 billion. They were in a final final bidding war between Sony and Apple TV. They want this
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:31.840]   prestige stuff. What I like about it is I as an Apple TV plus subscriber, I don't have to pay for
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:39.200]   this. It really irks me to watch a first run movie for $20. I know it costs more to go to the
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:44.960]   theater, but you don't know with a group of people. I know. You don't know if it's going to be
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:48.640]   good or not. I would love that because I don't want to go back to the age. I'm soon.
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:53.760]   The Bobcat's much better at my house. Yes. I would pay a hundred bucks for a first like if
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:38:01.120]   they were to put Black Widow or Wonder Woman 1984 or James Bond, whatever your soul is worth left
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:04.960]   to you. I don't know what the next one is called. I remember, but any of those, I'd pay a hundred
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:08.800]   bucks to watch them first run at home that I'm going to go to the movie theater day and date.
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:16.880]   I would love that. I don't know about a hundred bucks. Even at 20, my thinking is how patient can I
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:20.480]   be? Yes, for 20 bucks, I can buy it. I have zero patients.
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:26.960]   20 bucks is right there. Given that I'm not going out to the movies much anymore,
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:30.800]   that if there was a movie that I would definitely pay $20 to see Wonder Woman first run,
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:36.960]   basically to avoid hearing spoilers from other people and be able to enjoy it as is.
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:43.440]   We're trying to find our own level of water at this point. Also, me and Andy are single people.
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.920]   If you have a family of five, it's probably a much different set of math.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:48.640]   Exactly. It was just going to save with four of us in the house.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:53.520]   20 bucks is, I mean, wow, we get to go to the movies for five bucks. That's great.
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:57.520]   Let's do it. It also depends on how desperate for entertainment you are.
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:00.960]   So desperately, oh, yeah. Routine.
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:05.600]   Well, I feel like there's a lot. It was really good, but I need more.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:10.960]   I'm going through old crappy reality show. All sorts of, I don't watch anything.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:17.440]   It's not a 20-month procedural. Yeah, procedural. I'll see every CSI before I'll pay 20 bucks for
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:23.200]   the new Steve Carell movie. Finally, time to start on the wire, if you haven't seen it.
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:29.040]   All these other movies. There are a lot of series that I, oh, yeah, that too.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:37.840]   The time is ripe for someone to release the actual original, unedited WKRP in Cincinnati.
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:44.160]   Was the actual music? The actual music. And I know they've gotten close to like 90%, but 90%
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:47.760]   means the Beatles and the Eagles and Michael Jackson and like those aren't in there.
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:52.240]   Isn't it a clearance issue or a cost issue? Clearance issue. Yeah.
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:55.920]   So they, so they can't get clearance at any price.
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:02.160]   Or they could, I mean, they could fly the rights for the Beatles catalog and then that.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:11.120]   Any price is pretty, pretty broad term. Any reasonable, there's no friend licensing
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:21.440]   on the Beatles music. No, no, alas. Apple has made a commitment to $2.5 billion to combat the housing
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:26.880]   crisis in Silicon Valley. They're allocating now 400 million of that towards affordable housing
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:32.480]   projects and homeowner assistance programs in California. Thank you, Apple. So they're spending
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:36.240]   money on movies, but they're also spending money in the community. And I think that's really good.
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:41.920]   They're sending the money to the Housing Trust Silicon Valley, which will create more than 250
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:47.760]   units of affordable housing across the Bay Area, as well as mortgage and down payment assistance fund
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:52.160]   and affordable housing investment support program that they're doing in conjunction
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:59.200]   with Cal HFA. Thank you, Apple. That's great. I think that Silicon Valley companies like Apple
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:07.440]   get a lot of blame for the high cost of prices housing in the Silicon Valley and probably rightly.
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:11.760]   So, so. Isn't it also that they won't let them build new housing? Nobody wants it in their
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:16.000]   neighborhood and also people who have suddenly found houses or worth millions of dollars want
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.920]   to protect their investments by not increasing? Yeah, there's all seems like a multiple.
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:24.480]   Yeah, it's also sufficient. Yeah, absolutely. There's a lot of things going on. There was
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:29.760]   a I think a New York Times article a year or two ago about how someone wanted to turn their
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:34.160]   eternal wandromat that was doing okay, but they figured, well, this property would be more useful
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:40.400]   to people as like middle income housing and the amount of bureaucracy and also like neighborhood
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:45.600]   opposition to new housing in the neighborhood was so great that I don't even I don't even know
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:51.600]   like where it wound up where it was so expensive that he was just of all the people and all the
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:55.040]   activists who were saying we need more housing, we need more housing and then being confronted
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:59.760]   with wealth. No, it's not just the people who want to take an apartment building and turn it into
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:05.600]   like a three story private home with a pool and a bowling alley on each floor. It is sometimes just
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:10.640]   a more practical thing that's really hard to do. It's a hell of a problem. If you too would like a
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:19.840]   folder with your name on it. It's not hard to develop for Apple. They give away their resources
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:26.960]   like Xcode. It's a lot of fun. It's a lot to learn. I actually am working through the Big Nerd Ranch's
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:33.360]   seventh edition of their coding and iOS book. It's really, really good stuff. I've also started
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:40.720]   taking the Stanford Computer Science course 193, which is a really good course in iOS development.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:47.120]   That's a little faster pace and tougher, but Apple also has their own resources. They have new
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:53.440]   development Swift and everyone can code curricula. This is the easiest of all because it's aimed at
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:59.440]   students from grade school to college. My biggest problem with a lot of the stuff like Swift Play
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:05.840]   Grounds is you spend time learning Swift. At least for me, that's the easiest part of it.
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:14.480]   The hardest part of it is learning all of the GUI commands and stuff in coding for Apple.
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:23.280]   There's a very high learning curve for doing that. But I imagine if you're trying to learn Swift that
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:28.640]   these development Swift will be great. Everyone can code introduces coding to students in grades
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:35.440]   four through eight. It uses puzzles and games. The Swift Play Grounds app, the Develop and Swift
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:44.000]   curriculum is for older kids who are looking to develop skills that employers might be looking for.
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:53.680]   It certainly is a skill that is in demand. Check out the new inexpensive curricula. They're all in
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:59.920]   Apple Books. Develop and Swift curriculum has four books. Develop and Swift Explorations. I'm
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:04.320]   going to definitely take a look at these. Develop and Swift APCS principles. That would be for,
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:09.600]   I would guess, high school advanced placement classes and Develop and Swift Fundamentals all live
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:17.360]   today. Looks pretty good. You can do it through Xcode. Xcode has a nice Playgrounds feature,
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:24.080]   which really lets you mess around with this stuff. There's everyone can code adventures,
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:30.240]   everyone can code puzzles. Swift is a nicely designed, well done language, but there's a lot
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:38.560]   more to coding in iOS than there is just learning Swift. All right, time to wrap things up with
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:44.080]   your picks of the week. Let me start on my right, Renee Richie, your pick of the weeks.
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:49.040]   My pick of the week is in homage to Alex Lindsay not being here.
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:56.080]   Canon has announced two new cameras. The EOS are five and EOS are six.
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:45:05.920]   But they have some caveats. They're an amazing amount of technology. They can shoot 8K raw
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:14.800]   with C log internally with really, really good codecs, which is almost science fiction at this
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:20.560]   point. It's the power of a Cine camera into the body of a tiny, normal looking camera.
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:23.920]   There's places in the world that would never let you in with a Cine camera, but will absolutely
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:28.800]   let you in with what looks like a small mirrorless camera. It's slight enough that you could put it
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:34.800]   up in drones and capture 8K in areas where you were like Niagara Falls, areas you just couldn't
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:42.160]   normally get to or does 4K 60, sorry, 120 as well. So you can get down sampled 8K to 4.
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:43.760]   I'm sorry if I'm throwing one a lot of jargon.
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:45.360]   No, this is good. This is good.
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:50.480]   The 8K sensor will down sample to 4K and give you amazing, amazing imagery.
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:57.600]   It's expensive. It's around $4,000. The R6 is cheaper because with Canon, the higher numbers
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:01.760]   are lesser cameras. But it'll do the 4K stuff.
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:06.080]   The R6 is not full frame and the R6.
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:10.160]   They're both full frame. I believe people are arguing about whether there's a slight crop or not
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:14.640]   on the R6. Some people say there is. Some people say there isn't. There's a lot of prototypes,
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:17.760]   like Peter McKinnon has one of the prototypes, but we're not sure if that's reflective of a final
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:23.440]   hardware or not. So we're waiting to see. The only drawback is that some people are incredibly
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:29.680]   impressed that this technology can exist at all. And others are kind of upset that the camera
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:36.800]   generates heat and will stop recording after about 20 minutes of 4K 120 or of 8K.
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:41.600]   And then it has to cool down and then it will record less. Other people point out that at 8K
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.440]   with that bit rate, you are not going to find a memory card to record over 20 minutes.
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:46.240]   You filled it up.
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:52.320]   Or a battery that's going to last anyway. So it's like the least of the problems.
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:47:00.000]   Like this is for very specialty use. But it is so light. It is so portable. And the Canon RF
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:06.560]   glass is just so modern and so good that it's almost like you and it's got the flip out screen,
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:12.480]   which a lot of people like it's almost like a YouTuber's on your own cinematographer.
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:14.880]   You could be Mark his brownie in other words.
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:19.520]   Well, no, because he's like he's doing a k raw already. But I mean, like some people were saying
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:27.840]   also like a crash camera before you would blow up a $100,000 iMac camera or sorry Alexa camera
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:32.080]   to get that crash footage. And now you can get 8K crash footage of a $4,000
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:39.600]   EOS. So it's I'm not sure if I love this camera yet. I'm going to have to wait for the reviews.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:45.280]   But I love that it's showing and Sony is going to be hugely competitive with their next camera too.
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:50.800]   I love where what I would call not even pro-sumer anymore. Like it's still expensive, but it's
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:56.400]   attainable beyond what anybody used to pay like $100,000 for these cameras ever imagined.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:01.520]   And I love that all of this technology is coming into consumer to like consumer level cameras.
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:08.320]   There's an 8K video you can watch on YouTube if you really if you have the capability.
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:13.920]   We'll stream it out at 720p so you can enjoy it and pretend you're seeing it.
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:17.760]   I love Canon color like I know people have very different paintings of it, but I love the way it's
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:23.440]   a little bit more magenta, but it's I love it. I love Canon and I have to say I switched to Sony
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.440]   because I like the size of the mirrorless and so forth, but I still have a lot of Canon glass.
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:31.920]   Unfortunately, it's the EF glass so I'd have to use an adapter with this new body, but that's
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:36.160]   there's two there's one that's super cheap. I have it. It's like $79 I think and there's also
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:43.120]   like a $300 one that includes ND filter. So you can you can slide the ND filter in the adapter,
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:50.480]   which is really nice. So since I have all that Canon glass, it's about the same prices of 5D
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:56.080]   mark 4. It's not much more expensive than that. So no, and again, like the the cinema cameras that
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:00.800]   came out this year are 10 to 20,000 and this does those can record indefinitely. That's the
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:04.560]   huge event. Just what you're paying for the cinema camera for. But if you're if you don't need to
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:10.240]   record 60 minutes of a roll, like some of us idiots do these cameras are going to be fantastic.
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:15.520]   And oh, incidentally, it probably takes pretty good stills too. Yeah, 45 megapixels. That's a huge
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:18.800]   argument. It's funny because the same stuff we were arguing about cameras for years. They're not
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:23.680]   like Sony said their next camera is probably going to be 12 megapixels and people are freaking
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:28.000]   out and they're going, no, no, you want good 12 megapixels. Right. That's an a seven or you mean
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:35.200]   on the yeah, talking about a seven S three or talking about on the phone. Yeah, you shouldn't
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:40.000]   go crazy over the size of the megapixels, although I kind of do. Yeah, unless they're pixel binning
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.920]   and that has other trade. I mean, it's a whole big thing. Yeah, no, it's it's interesting because
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:49.760]   for a long time, I thought Canada Nikon would basically give up the mirrorless cameras to Sony.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:58.160]   Yeah, because they had to preserve their existing business of DSLRs. This shows that they're
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:02.720]   willing to be aggressive. You know, this is they finally and by the way, unlike the Sony,
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:06.800]   it has a complex flash slot as well as an SD card slot. There's some real, you know,
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:13.760]   a CF express on the R5. So like I have a C 500 Mark II and that's use a CF express and you forget,
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:19.920]   like I forget how fast it is until I have to pull off an SD card and it takes like 30 times longer.
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:25.360]   Yeah, that's something for your Thunderbolt port. Yeah. Yeah. Very nice. I wish you hadn't
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:30.480]   mentioned it. I'm trying to pretend I don't know about it. Alex would have done it if he was here.
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:34.400]   No, he wouldn't. Yeah, it's really interesting what it's going to do for video. That's what's
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:37.920]   surprising. Yeah. Andy and I go pick of the week.
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:44.240]   One of my three favorite word processors for the Mac and iOS has just gotten a really big upgrade.
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:50.240]   Ulysses is now up to version 20. It was released just today and it adds something that I've always
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:56.880]   kind of wanted for Ulysses, which is a sidebar, they call it a dashboard. But now as you're editing,
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:01.920]   as you're editing text, there is like a static third column to the right of what you're editing
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:06.480]   that will give you pretty much whatever you want, statistics on like what your word count is,
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:10.960]   how much time you've been working in this session, what your notes are and outline of
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:16.800]   a line that I can be working on. It's a simple thing and it's something that we've been seeing
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:21.840]   in my other one, my other favorite word processors, Privener, pretty much since the beginning.
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:27.120]   But it really is what makes this a wonderful full screen experience, whichever one that you're
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:32.640]   using. Ulysses, it's hard to explain the difference between Ulysses and Scrivener.
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:39.040]   They both have a strength in which they're really, really great at working on a collection of
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:43.920]   documents as opposed to like pages, which is open a document, close it, open a document, close it,
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:48.960]   open a document, close it. Ulysses and Scrivener are both really great when you're working on like
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:53.040]   a book. We have several, several chapters to work on. Or if you're preparing a report for
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:57.280]   somebody and you have lots of different sections and you want to do a little bit of collaboration,
[01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:01.120]   basically you need to organize notes, you need to organize things while you're developing the one
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:05.520]   thing that you're trying to develop. The difference between the two is I think that Ulysses is a
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:12.080]   little bit cleaner, particularly when you're using it on iOS, particularly on the iPad.
[01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:17.840]   Scrivener is a lot more powerful. Scrivener is the one where all I'm doing is,
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:22.560]   I have no idea if I want to write a book about this, but I keep having these ideas and I keep
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:27.120]   up coming across these facts and these photos. I just want to toss them into a place so that
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:35.360]   just like the FBI murder specialist who's got, I'm just tapping, I'm just putting photos and
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:40.320]   things on a big corkboard and tying a screen to them. Scrivener is the good thing to look at what
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:43.600]   you have and figure out what you're going to be building from it. So it's a little bit more
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:48.960]   complicated, but a lot more feature-rich than Ulysses. But again, if you're just looking for a
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:53.840]   text editor that is good at managing even a larger project, Ulysses is pretty darn great.
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:53:01.280]   They've added a grammar and a style checker. That's nice. And of course, I haven't checked
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:06.960]   this out yet, but they've done a dedicated revision mode within the dashboard that combines
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:11.760]   in text annotations, spell check and grammar and style check. Okay, I tried the other stuff,
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:18.160]   I haven't tried that yet. But this is great to see an already great app continuing to mature and
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:24.400]   continue to grow. The only other thing you need to know between an app like Ulysses and Scrivener is
[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:32.560]   that Ulysses is a subscription-based app. So they charge $50 a year or $6 a month for it.
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:38.400]   So every year you have to renew it, whereas Scrivener is just a flat 50 bucks, I think,
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:43.200]   for the app. I think you own it. They do charge for upgrades in the future, but you don't have to
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:48.240]   keep if you're happy with the old one, you can keep going. But again, really great upgrade,
[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:54.560]   really solid stuff. I've only been using it for now about three or four hours. But again,
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:59.200]   it's one of those things where you add this one little feature and suddenly it becomes a much
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:04.080]   better and much different product. Looks good. Looks good. Yeah, I had a Ulysses subscription
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:08.800]   for a long time. And then I thought, well, am I using this that much? But I really like
[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:14.160]   Markdown editors. And I'm always looking for the piece of Markdown editor. It's good because you
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:18.240]   can make it into a very, very minimalist sort of approach where you're just getting stuff down,
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:21.680]   which is one of the most important things about when you're writing for distance as opposed to
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:27.120]   speed. Yep. Good pick, Ulysses.app if you want to learn more Mac and iOS.
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:35.760]   Mr. Dave Hamilton of the Mac Observer. What do you got for us? Yeah, I have one that came out
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:41.840]   on April 1st. And I missed it when it did and it's cloud flare for families. And it's their DNS
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:48.480]   service. So cloud flare offers their own DNS at 1.1.1.1. And then they also have an IPv6 version
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:55.360]   that's not quite as clean because that's how IPv6 works. And it's that service at 1.1.1.1.1
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:55:05.360]   is a service for just fast, efficient DNS lookups. They added two more. They added 1.1.1.2
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:15.280]   and .3. .2 adds malware blocks to the list and .3 takes the malware blocks and to them adds adult
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:22.720]   content. So you can put this into your router. And now you've got cloud flares, malware and or
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:29.200]   well, not and or, but either malware or malware and adult content blocking built right in.
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:35.600]   You don't have to think anything about it. And they do have IPv6 addresses for both of those
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:40.320]   so that you're actually covered because a lot of these DNS things, if you're running IPv6 on
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:47.920]   your network will if your browser, if your computer does a an IPv6 lookup, it'll bypass the IPv4
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:52.640]   address that you put in there and carefully crafted and then it doesn't help. So they've
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:57.760]   thought of and have been using this for a couple of weeks now on the on the malware blocking.
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:01.040]   And it's it's picked up some things. It's actually been pretty good. And it's free.
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:06.720]   And it's free. That's really nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is a this is a great way to
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:12.160]   keep your kids safe without getting in and without them being able to get around it on any of their
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:18.160]   devices. Well, that's it. Well, if you're kids are smart enough to use Firefox, that has DNS
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:24.320]   over HTTPS. Oh, man. Yeah. Dang. That's shit. You know, yeah. Right.
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:30.080]   Actually, everybody's going to offer that even Safari's doing that now DNS over HTTP is.
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:37.840]   Thank you, Dave. No, it's a good thing. It is, but it does kind of add confusion gets gets around
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:44.240]   dad. It means you can't parent by technology alone. Well, that's there you go. Good. A
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:49.280]   reasonable thing. Macobserver.com. Dave Hamilton. Great to have you.
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:54.800]   Always a pleasure. I really appreciate your your perspective, especially on the ad tech stuff too.
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:59.520]   We got to keep talking because I just don't know what's happening in the world. It's
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:04.480]   crazy. It's changing as we speak. Andy and I go when are you going to be on GBH this week?
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:10.240]   I'm on a day early. I'm on Thursday. It looks like 11 30, but as usual, go to my Twitter at
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:15.960]   an not go and I will usually tell people about the night before. Awesome. And not go.com. I H
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:22.400]   N A T K O is also a not going Twitter. And Renee Richie weekly at i'more.com. And of course,
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:28.320]   pretty much every day at youtube.com/Renee Richie soon to be a K. I have a feeling.
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:33.680]   I'm trying. No, no, I think that kind of thing. I'd like to be able to I'd like to be able to
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:38.880]   punch in to 4k out of an AK frame. That'd be great. Oh, that'd be nice. Yeah, you get all that extra
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:43.280]   room. And then you could say I want this. I can fix so many mistakes. Yes. Crop that out.
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:48.480]   Crop that out. Yeah. But of course, for your 8k workflow, now you'll need a Mac Pro.
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:55.600]   Oh, God. 6 Silicon Apple Silicon will handle 8k as well as Intel. I bet it will.
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:58:00.000]   Yeah, it'll handle it better. I mean, they've handled 4k better than Intel for years. They built
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.480]   their own custom encode and decode blocks for it. And they could do three streams back when Intel
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:10.160]   couldn't do one. And they're going to have Final Cut running and Final Cut. They'll have ProRes 8k.
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:15.280]   I'm certain and it'll just it'll be a beast, but it'll be a man. It's going to be everywhere.
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:20.080]   Video's so high quality. It hurts your eyes. You show you the one that's written Vincent.
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:25.920]   Vincent Delafire is going to do his like 4k fusion red hybrid system again and fly over
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:30.080]   New York and we'll have to read down in our lives. Yeah, he's a cannon shooter, I think.
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:34.400]   I think he might be. Yeah, but he, well, he was doing reds like and they were in helicopters and
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:38.000]   putting like five of them together to get a bigger frame. It just like it never ends.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.640]   You know, it never ends. That's right. You just can't keep up. That's why I'm a stop buying
[01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:48.160]   cameras now. That's it. I'm done. Go back to analog words theoretically on the film. I still have my
[01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:56.000]   Leica M3 and a roll a triax and I'm not afraid to use it. It is. It's a fun camera. It's a fun camera.
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:59.840]   Thank you, Andy. Thank you, Renee. Thank you, Dave. It's great to have all three of you. Thank you
