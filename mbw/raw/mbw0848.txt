[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly as we go to press the biggest story of the year, perhaps.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.400]   Apple's going to allow third-party app stores. We'll break that down.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.200]   We'll talk about the new iOS 16.2 and freeform the new Mac OS 13.1.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.040]   And yes, one feature that's surprised everybody.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.320]   Apple adding end-to-end encryption to your backups.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.560]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.760]   And today is a news day. Not a snooze day. We'll get right to it in a moment. But first our panelists
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.400]   hailing from Detroit, Michigan. He's 53 pounds and an expert in all things plastic. Mr. Jason
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.640]   for where John Ashley is going. I don't know who you're going to on that one.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.240]   No, there's no way to know when you just lie. That's what I never won.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.080]   That's right. Well, it's great to be back here on the tech guy or whatever the show is called.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.440]   No. Oh, he's getting me back. He's getting me back. Hello, Jason. Sixcolors.com. Yes.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.960]   Accuracy now begins. It's good to be here on what was supposed to be a sleepy December Tuesday.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.280]   And instead is all hell breaking loose. There's news of plenty. News of plenty. I mean, a plenty
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.520]   plenty. Andy Naco here, WG, VH, and Boston. Hello, Andrew. Hello, Jason is the new motor city mad
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.840]   man after after 10 new, just let the trademark lapse. He just zoom broke right in there. So that's
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.760]   why that that explains the, you could be the motor city mad man. If you want,
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.680]   I could. I'm not sure if I could afford property in Detroit, but
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.360]   I'm actually one of the MC five. Actually, I'm all five of the MC five. I've decided that's what I
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:05.040]   am. I'm all five. All five of the MC five. And then finally, in this corner and the blue trunks,
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.320]   Alex Lindsey from 090.media and of course, office, our stack level. Hello, Alex.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.800]   How would they know? Blue trunks. They can't know. They cannot. That's why it might be a lie,
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.880]   but it might not. It's the best part of online. Yeah.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.600]   Shouldn't enter. Don't you make us? Don't you dare make us show our pants, Leo? Don't you do it?
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.400]   No one wants to see that. All right. On the count of three, everybody stand up. No, no, no,
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.120]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not necessary. All right. So just to let you know, we will cover all of
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.920]   these. There are three big stories this week. There's a breaking story from Mark Gurman that
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.200]   Apple's going to allow third party app stores. Apple has announced end to end encryption and
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.560]   iCloud backups. By the way, Steve Gibson will do a deep dive on that later today.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.400]   iOS 16.2 is out as is Mac OS 13.1 with free form. So I don't know where to start, but I think we
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.440]   should start with a story that just crossed the wire as they say, although there is in fact no
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.840]   long the terminal as they say Bloomberg on the terminal. They're weird. Mark,
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.160]   Gurman read, rip and read filing. It's good. We started late following at 11.02 Eastern,
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.520]   a Pacific rather, which is normally when we would start Apple to allow outside app stores
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:26.000]   in overhaul spurred by EU laws. Subhead major project will help company abide by digital markets,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.400]   act Apple has planned side loading as a threat to use or as panned, not planned, panned side loading.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.520]   Remember the strong comments from Tim Cook and others saying, "Oh my God, side loading is a
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.200]   security nightmare." Well, maybe that's what's going to happen. So let's dive in because I haven't
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.120]   really had a chance to read this. Has anybody been reading while we're in the futzing?
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.040]   Yeah, a little bit. First, this is Mark Gurman. He has great track record, great results. I think
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.320]   that we should believe this story. I think it's also very interesting that it is such high level
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.960]   that it feels like he has very, very good sources, perhaps even official sources here,
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.520]   even though it is not a official statement. It's so detailed.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.840]   Down to the point of which executive is responsible for which part of this.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.840]   The article says a spokesman for the Cupertino, California-based company declined to comment.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:25.120]   It really feels like this is almost a press release. The changes on the way within Apple
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.520]   are being led by Andreas Vendeker, a longtime software engineering vice president, reports to
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.560]   Craig Federighi, Jeff Robin, Apple's top engineering manager for its services,
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.680]   who reports to Ed E.Q. is also involved. Go ahead, Jason.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.680]   Yeah, so the story, as Gurman tells it, and it does seem like this serves Apple in the sense that
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.280]   it does get out there. The idea that Apple is considering changes without them committing to
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.960]   anything. The idea seems to be spurred by this law that is expected to go into effect in 2024
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.720]   in the EU, called the Digital Markets Act, that Apple is going to basically be forced
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.880]   to change some of its business practices in the EU. Another point that Gurman's story makes is
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:13.600]   that while Apple intends to be sort of like nimble about other laws in other countries,
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.320]   I think the implication there is that if Apple does this, it's going to be where it's mandated
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.000]   by law and nowhere else, which is an interesting thing if that comes to be the case.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.400]   Because the idea here is that it's not, but in the EU might be the start of it,
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.560]   although by the time one thing that happens is the ball starts rolling, right? So the EU does this
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.960]   and everybody else goes, "Okay, well, if the EU is going to do that, maybe we should do something
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.280]   like that too." And you may end up in a scenario where the world kind of catches up with the EU,
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.760]   but the big story here is that Apple is apparently putting their engineers to work and they're
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.760]   grumbling about it, according to Mark Gurman, about like, "We've got features to write." And instead,
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:58.240]   we're overhauling the back-end structure of the operating system to support presumably side-loaded
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:04.560]   app stores and other apps, and then the ability to have basically third-party app stores
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:10.560]   inside of iOS and iPadOS. And then also, it's gigantic. And then also looking at whether
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.440]   that means they also need to offer third-party payments in app store apps or not,
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.160]   whether that's covered, whether they need to open up iMessage based on the EU regulations.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.560]   They're apparently not currently planning on doing that and feel that that's not required.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:31.680]   Nor are they planning on supporting alternative texting, you know, green bubble kind of stuff
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:39.520]   that Google wants them to do. So that's still a place where they're maybe not going to go full
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.200]   force here, but like the top line is Apple seems to be throughout its engineering group
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:52.720]   working on a plan by 2024 to be in compliance with the EU regulations. And that means that
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.200]   the app store can't be the only place you get apps on your iPhone and your iPad.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.960]   Let me put some meat on the bone before we continue. Some engineers, according to Gurman,
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.920]   are working on the plan. Also see it as a distraction from typical day-to-day development
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.640]   of future features, according to the people. The company is aiming for the changes to be
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:16.720]   ready as part of an update to next year's iOS 17. So that's about a year out, which would be in line
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.000]   with requirements to help protect against unsafe apps. Apple is discussing the idea
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.200]   of mandating certain security requirements, even if software is distributed outside its store.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.520]   Such apps also may need to be verified by Apple, a process that could carry a fee.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:39.360]   You can see a model for it and what they've done in the Mac in the last few years, right,
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.520]   where they've added notarization, where you actually upload your app, your registered Apple
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.120]   developer, and you haven't been notarized. It's actually scanned for a very high level of like,
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.520]   is there anything dangerous in here? And then it's cryptographically signed, which also gives Apple
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.800]   the ability to flip a kill switch. If it turns out that it's malware and by default, it won't,
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.360]   there are various security defaults. So you can run everything on the Mac or you can run only
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.000]   signed software, notarized software, or you can only run things in the Mac app store.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.080]   And so it feels like training wheels for this, right, where they have, they know what it looks
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.240]   like. And they've got, or at least as a possibility, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. According to German,
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.200]   Apple has not made a final decision on whether to comply with one component of the Digital Market
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.880]   Act that allows developers to install third party payment systems that is still up in the air.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.360]   And Apple's also,
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.600]   Oh, it's NFC chip is the other big thing, right? Like access to NFC.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.240]   Yeah, they're being hit by that. They're working on opening more of its private application
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:48.560]   programming interfaces, APIs to third party apps, which is huge. Those have always been
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.960]   restricted. For instance, as we're going points out, Chrome has to use WebKit,
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:58.240]   basically, Apple's Safari as its browsing engine under the plan to meet the new law. Apple is
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:04.880]   considering removing that mandate. Yeah. It is also working to open up other features to third
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:14.240]   party apps, more camera technologies, the NFC chip. This is this is a complete revamp of the platform
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:20.320]   in a direction that the the EU would prefer. But Apple as long held makes it insecure. Alex,
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.560]   are you unhappy? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't I think it's going to be. I think that what's
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.240]   interesting about it is that I think Apple is going to by showing that they're moving towards
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.080]   this. I think if you were talking to lobby, if you were lobbying in the United States, what you
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.680]   would probably tell people is, "Hey, we should see how it works in the EU." Yeah.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.760]   That stalls everything for years in the United States, which is, of course, their largest market.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.800]   So I think that there is some advantage to Apple doing this and kind of begrudgingly kind of going
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.360]   that direction. And showing that they're covering as many of those little pigholes as
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.480]   possible, it's really hard to because I think they're just going to say, "Well, we don't know how
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.720]   this is going to go. We don't think it's going to go well, but let's try it in the EU." And so I
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.120]   think that that could be kind of where they get started. That could stall any kind of legislation
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.400]   in the United States for years, which would probably be good for Apple. I think that the issue really
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:16.720]   is, I know it sounds inverted from this, is the user choice, is that if we get forced out of the
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:22.160]   Apple ecosystem so that we have to download Netflix on a third party, if we have to download
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.760]   Epic Games on a third party, we are, as users, are getting forced to use something that we don't
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.320]   necessarily want to use. And I think that that is the other side of this.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.960]   If I were Epic, I'd made the same argument Apple makes, which is, you can always go to Andrew.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.600]   If you don't want Epic Games, you don't have to install our games. You have a choice.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.800]   No, no, no, and that's what people will do. It'll just be frustrating that as the Apple user
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:53.680]   that I bought into this, we paid for all of this, and that's working perfectly fine for the user.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.880]   It will probably, though, Alex, be a switch, right? You will probably, giving your choice,
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.120]   doesn't mean forcing you into it. There could be a switch that says, "Take everything as it is."
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.640]   But on the Mac, right? I think the Mac is the model here where it'll probably be
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:12.800]   allow only App Store, allow only approved, like gradations of security with default,
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.760]   depending on what the law says. But again, I think that there'll be apps that, again,
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:23.520]   it'll be frustrating for the user. People like me will just spend Twitter just pounding on
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.600]   everybody who doesn't release in the App Store. And it won't be, it'll be...
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.880]   You could pad all you want on Twitter. I don't think anybody's be reading it.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.640]   No, it'll be there. No, it'll be there.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:39.360]   But I'll have 4,000 characters to do it in. But the point is, is that the...
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.200]   There are some massive... I'm gonna sit on instances that give you 5,000.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.760]   So if you really want to write a screen... No, thank you.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.960]   Like literally, just as a sidebar, I was fine. I was not fine. I was upset with a lot of
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.560]   things Twitter was doing, but I was willing to stay on the 4,000, the character lemon. I was like,
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.720]   "Well, I think I'm gonna be gone." That would be a killer.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.080]   Like anyway, so the... I think...
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.240]   I think... Do you, Alex? I'm sensing that.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:10.080]   No, I just don't like things that are not the center of my life. I don't like them to take time.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.760]   That's the big thing is that... So when people make things complicated on the edges of what I'm
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.200]   doing, I don't like to expand extra time on something I don't think is useful.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.520]   Focus on what you care about and not have to worry about this stuff.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.680]   So that's my whole thing is I like security just to work because I don't want to think about it.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:30.560]   And so the thing is, is that I think that what Apple will probably do is... We'll see,
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.280]   but we all get to look into our own globe. They're gonna let this stuff go through the EU.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:42.880]   Every problem that happens on the outside of their App Store, they're going to make sure
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:48.240]   everybody knows. Like, this is because we did this. This is because we did this. This is because
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.800]   we did this. And it's gonna... I think that if I was Apple, and I think that you're also gonna
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.880]   see a biification of the way they treat developers. And while the laws are... There's lots of ways
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.720]   of hedging things different ways. But if you're not building for Apple, if you're not building for
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.680]   the App Store, good luck on getting as much support. I think that's probably what's gonna happen.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.240]   A lot of that stuff's subjective. It's very hard to measure. So it'll just be kind of like,
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.480]   "Well, we'll get to you when we can." But I don't think you'll matter as much to Apple once you go
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.400]   out of the... I do feel for the folks inside the...
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.960]   Apple Campus who are coming up on the holiday break. And suddenly...
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:35.040]   Can you stay for the weekend? Work on those little features. Andy, what do you think?
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.640]   Well, directly to what you're just saying. I think there are a lot of developers out there,
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.360]   a lot of Mac and iOS developers that there's like, "Thank you, Apple." Finally, you get a taste of
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.280]   your own medicine where, "You know what? We don't want to have to spend like three months of our
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:54.080]   production time supporting iCloud in a feature that doesn't affect our app whatsoever, but you're
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.480]   making that a requirement for a continued access to the App Store. How do you like having to spend
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.400]   all of your time on things that aren't cool features? They're just here to satisfy some
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:09.280]   requirement that you don't even agree with. But now, obviously, at this point, the news is literally
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:15.680]   55-0 minutes old in terms of when it actually hit the Bloomberg site. And all we really know...
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.800]   All we really know is that we have a very reliable reporter who's talking about this in broad terms.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:26.560]   We don't know everything's going to be about how it's implemented. I like what Jason was
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.800]   suggesting that perhaps it will work pretty much the way that the Mac side works, where
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.840]   it will prevent you from doing it, or it will basically send you a look. I'm not going to let
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.920]   you do this unless you go into settings and do this. And even then, we're going to basically give
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:45.360]   you a few warnings about why this is a bad idea and then just let you do it. I don't think it'll be
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.480]   as... I don't think that as a binary construct, having an external App Store is going to be
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:56.800]   by definition destructive. I think that the first time that I... When I update my
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.080]   Comixology app or my Kindle app or whatever, and I can actually make purchases inside the app
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:09.760]   without Apple... Apple never had justification for taking a double digit percentage of a
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.080]   comic book that they had nothing to do with the production of, nothing to do with the distribution
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:19.280]   of... Nothing. I would have... I'm here because I'm a customer of Comixology, not a customer of Apple.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.440]   There was no reason for them to take that money. That's the reason why you can't buy stuff
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.920]   directly through apps, even in places where it's a really, really good idea. And as to
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.560]   other companies may be abusing this and saying, "Well, from now on, if you want Netflix,
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:38.400]   you have to do it through our Netflix App Store." I'm not... See, the problem with that is that
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:47.120]   we forget that the normal user wants simplicity. They are going to look for everything inside
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:54.480]   whatever the built-in App Store is. And if you... If they are told that, "Hey, look, we're not
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:01.440]   available in the App Store, please go and go to this site, sideload this app or go... God,
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.800]   God, do you think there's any chance that Apple will allow these external App Store apps to be
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.400]   available in the App Store?" I don't think so. But here's all the steps you have to do to install
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.440]   our app before you can actually get the app that you actually want. I don't think that's going to
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.640]   really fly for a lot of people. It's safe to assume Apple will do the absolute minimum required by
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.680]   law, is that what we're saying? Sure. Well, I think they'll do it to comply. This is...
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.560]   They really are facing the facts that this is not a proposed thing. This is not an actual thing.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.080]   And if they want to continue to be able to do business, they are going to have to be ready to
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.920]   pull the switch on this if they have to. Now, as to the... That's the idea of Apple blaming
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.160]   everything on, "Well, this is why things are going wrong." That is typical, like, huge corporation
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.120]   behavior. Just like if you want to close down a bunch of stores that are underperforming, say,
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.640]   it's because of shoplifting. If you want to increase the price of your content, say it's because of
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.560]   piracy. These are things that you probably wanted to do anyway, but now you're going to use this
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.560]   X... You're not going to say that it's not because we're no good, unfair, mean-spirited
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.880]   Sputnik's. It's because, "Oh, gosh, we tried. It looks how horrible these things are working."
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:12.400]   I would love to see Apple expand this if it works. I do believe it's going to work.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:18.720]   And I do also believe that once it's up and running in the EU, so long as... I believe
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.960]   that they're going to get it up and running in the EU, the world is not going to come to an end.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.520]   And they're going to have one less reason when well-meaning lawmakers in the United States say,
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.520]   "Why are you not allowing app stores here?" You actually made it work in other places, and now
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:37.440]   we have the data that says that the world continues to spin. There are a couple of sharp edges that
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.280]   need to be sanded down, but it works. Why are you not doing it here, too? It's going to make it that
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.800]   much more difficult. So the fact that they're actually giving those proposed laws that extra
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   push to say, "We don't have the excuse that we don't know how to do this," that shows how
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:56.000]   much Apple is confronting that this is going to be a fact of life as opposed to something that can
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.280]   continue to hold to wish into the cornfield. And on the other side, the risk is,
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:07.920]   if anything goes wrong in the EU, it'll be dead everywhere, forever. If it unwraps, Apple will...
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:14.160]   I know I would. I'd spin the whole thing up into a make-the-you-look-stupid, make-the-hole-thing
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:19.760]   look dumb. You know what our legislation is in the Congress right now, the OpenApp Markets Act.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.240]   And that could be sped through, but I think you're right, Apple, probably make the case.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.080]   "Wait, let's just wait and see how that goes."
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.320]   Again, if they can use... I think that they can use their actions here to stall that into
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.480]   a long... until it's not really there anymore.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:42.880]   Reaction started to come into German's initial tweet, Florian Mueller of Fospatent says, "Epic
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:50.240]   Games Store, Steam, Microsoft Store, possibly an Amazon App Store, etc. will come to iOS, at least
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:56.640]   in the EU. If Congress passes the OpenApp Markets Act sooner or later, it will happen.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.480]   Tim Sweeney, Epic will defeat the evil Empire sooner or later."
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.440]   Oh, spare me.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:09.040]   Now, there's also tweets from people who are not so happy. Sebastian DeWitt
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:16.400]   immediately tweeted, "As a developer, just honestly, just sucks. It's not going to make things better
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.920]   for us. Just more complicated. Same goes for consumers. Side-loading is perhaps fine,
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:27.840]   but this sounds awful to it as the very famous halide camera designer."
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:34.000]   A point that I've heard from a lot of the people I know who are developers is they...
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.720]   there's already a surprising amount of piracy on iOS via jailbreaking.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:45.440]   They look at this and they say, "We don't like that Apple's leaving 30 or 15 percent
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:52.880]   depending on their business. But if this happens, it will increase the ease at which
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.920]   pirated iOS software will be handed around."
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.320]   And they don't love that. Whereas for Tim Sweeney, it's like, "Oh, man,
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.080]   I control all my in-app purchases of all my games. I'm going to make a lot of money.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.760]   It's going to have different impacts on different levels of developer. I think some small developers
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.040]   could actually be really harmed by this." In terms of the user story, yeah, I think Andy's
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:20.480]   exactly right. People like Simplicity. We've actually seen it happen on Android, where I believe
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:25.120]   Epic Games left the Play Store because they were going to take their ball and go home.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.880]   They put Fortnite. And they came back with their ball.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:33.600]   They put... Yeah, that's actually a sorted saga, which is because Sweeney and Epic did not want
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.400]   to pay the the VIG to Google. They couldn't do this on Apple, but they could do it on Google.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.880]   They allowed sideloading. Within a few days of allowing sideloading a Fortnite,
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.760]   malicious copies of Fortnite appeared, and people were getting infected.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:52.400]   I think they also... I mean, reading between the lines, but I think they also discovered that this
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.560]   wasn't a great path to revenue. Yeah, you know, it really hurt their sales because so many people,
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.920]   like Andy said, really do prefer the simplicity of it. And if you look on the Mac, again, I keep
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.560]   bringing it back to the Mac here, but the way Apple has approached this on the Mac is they are
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.160]   really good at writing scary dialogue boxes that warn you that if you're going to turn this thing
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.000]   on, everything will happen and that cats and dogs are going to rain from the sky. It's very bad.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.040]   And some people will still do it. And there will also be shady apps that walk you through the
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.200]   process of saying, "Oh, no, turn off your security. That's what you need." And they're going to get
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:29.600]   behind it. But some people will do it and some people won't do it. And I think most people won't.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:34.560]   Most people won't bother. But if there's a motivation to do it, the beauty of this, and the thing that
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:40.000]   I'm actually most excited about, is the idea that there are whole classes of apps, whether it is,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.720]   yeah, alternate browser engines or virtualization is one of those things that I always keep thinking
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:49.440]   of. And who knows what other kinds of apps were. Apple basically said, "No, forget it. You can
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:55.040]   never do that on our platforms." And how many wonderful apps that Apple might have actually accrued
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.080]   value to the Apple platform if Apple had allowed it, but they just refused, might bloom here,
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.720]   where that's going to make it worth it to turn off the production because you want to go get
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:09.360]   different browser engine or you want to run an emulator and you'll be able to do it.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:15.600]   Like I've got an M1 and an M2 iPad, right? Like emulating software on there is something that's
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:21.440]   completely possible and done by a jailbreak. You can do it now. But I haven't bothered a jailbreak,
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.280]   but I would be interested in sideloading some of that stuff. Let me show you what it looks like
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:31.040]   just for people who don't have any experience of this on this is a Pixel 7. So this is what
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:37.120]   it looks like on Android. You can't just sideload. You have to first go into the settings and go
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:45.120]   down to security and you have to enable sideloading. I don't even remember where it is.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.480]   Yeah, Apple will put it several levels further down than that.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:54.320]   Okay, it's here somewhere. I should have probably tried to remember that for safety and emergency
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:03.040]   passwords and accounts system. Maybe it's under system. Do you remember Andy? You're using
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.120]   cheese. All right, you know, I'll just search. I'll just search.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.320]   But I don't even know what it would be called. It's not called sideload.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:18.720]   No, that's allow applications from third party maybe.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:23.280]   Yeah, this happens. It's funny. My wife actually just did this yesterday because she's a librarian
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:31.200]   and a patron brought in an Amazon fire tablet and they what is it? Overdrive is no longer
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:36.480]   supported, but there's the Libby app. But Amazon for obvious reasons doesn't want you checking
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.600]   up books from the library and hasn't put it in the Amazon App Store. And so my wife,
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:44.640]   who is not a super technical person, she said, I sideloaded an Android app today because that's
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.440]   what they had to do is sideload Libby in order to get it on that patron's fire tablet.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.240]   Well, clearly it's a terrible experience. I've done it, but I've put it in the life of me.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.960]   Well, this is the point, right? It's like, let's not get ahead of ourselves here. Apple,
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.920]   unless Apple has shown that in all cases where it's forced to do something by law,
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.480]   it will do it to the minimum extent required. It will drag its heels and it will make it painful.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:13.040]   So to the extent that it's possible to make it hard to find that switch, to the extent that it's
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:18.080]   possible to scare you with the dialogue box, to make it inconvenient when you open it, that you
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.520]   have to like do a second approval and put in your password and all those things, Apple will do all
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:29.520]   of that. And the fact is, most people won't get to that point, but some people will and the
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.160]   alternative app stores will have, I mean, this is unless the EU comes out and says, you've got to
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.400]   put out alternative app stores in the app store, you just have to do it that way. But I imagine
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.200]   there are lots of loopholes where Apple is going to make this enough of a hurdle that most people
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:50.320]   won't go over it. Well, plus, you know, it's a great opportunity for the bloggers and folks that
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:57.440]   inside Mac, how to turn on sideloading. So I have just looked up from an in Android
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:04.240]   blog how to do this. And I had to my the promise with Android, it's everybody has different
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:09.280]   things. Now this is Android seven. So this install, it's search for install unknown apps.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:15.040]   So there you go. Unstalk unknown apps. Okay. That's the promise you need to know what to search for,
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:21.120]   install. And where is it, Andy? I guess it's different on every phone, but this is the
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:29.600]   you're giving under app special app access. So and you're giving it app, you're giving it an app
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:37.600]   permission to install other apps. So then you install unknown apps, click that. And then these
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:45.840]   are the these are the install unknown apps. Huh? Wow. I tell you what, it's not they've made it a
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:51.200]   lot harder than it used to be. Yeah, I don't even know how to do it anymore. But they've added a
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:56.960]   little extra layer security. Yeah, well, security by obscurity, like I have no idea where to do this.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.440]   So I will certainly do that. It's interesting that Google has chosen to do that.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:06.400]   Whether it's for security or play store, I don't know, but that's interesting.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:12.640]   And it'll a lot of it will depend on like things like the the new, whatever they were
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.120]   what have been called XR kit or XR OS or whatever. It doesn't apply to them.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.440]   Just apply to the new reality. The new reality is that is that is that the
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:28.000]   so so Apple can set up a whole new set of rules for that. You know, so I think that there's a lot
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.760]   of things that, you know, if they can stall if they can stall legislation, especially in the United
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:37.440]   States for the next two or three years, and then they make it hard and take some of the two or three
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.880]   years, they'll be onto something else by the time it actually matters.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.520]   So well, I mean, it's a it's a basic thing. It's about having control of your phone. And there's
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:51.200]   and as Jason said, Jason said, there are a whole bunch of apps that I think they're kind of dogmatic
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.840]   apples refusal to allow these apps to do these categories of apps to be installed. I mean,
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.960]   there can be a secure there can be security issues, excuse me, security considerations and
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.200]   installing certain kinds of apps. But nonetheless, it's time to revisit those kind of questions.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.880]   I'm really keen to see if again, we have no idea how this is going to be implemented. If it's
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.960]   going to be something where it's going to be even attractive for someone to install an additional
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:18.400]   app store. But I would in a best case scenario, it wouldn't necessarily be that users can install
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:24.320]   apps from anywhere. It's that a developer who has a new app can decide which app store makes the best
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.480]   sense for their product and their company, the way they do business. Just the fact that oh, by the
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:34.400]   way, if a very, very if a team of developers were to get together and design their own app store,
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:40.320]   that is sort of apt to sort of balances not just the users needs, but also the developers needs,
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:45.040]   it says, by the way, if you want to talk directly to your users, we will let you talk directly to
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:50.480]   your users. If you want to get broad, non-person identifiable metrics on how people are using your
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.840]   apps, we will let you do that too. We will let you send special offers out on a very, very strict
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:00.000]   option basis. If they do all this sort of stuff that basically makes it a better experience for
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.880]   developers to be able to make the apps they want to make, then if Apple has now compete with another
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:12.640]   app store where all of a sudden, not a large percentage of cool apps are available through
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.680]   external app stores, but enough of them that, wow, I really want halide, right? Wow, this is,
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.960]   I really want this one particular app, but it's only it's only available through the United
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:28.640]   Artists, so to speak, version of the App Store where 12 really significant developers decided to
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.880]   make an app store just for their own products. And then that's when you find that almost that a
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.360]   lot of people will have this external app store installed. And that's when Apple will say, well,
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:42.160]   once the once it if it cuts into their their numbers in a significant way, that's when Apple
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:48.320]   say, good news for no reason whatsoever. We suddenly decided to allow developers to communicate
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:54.560]   directly with their users. You're welcome. So just to, I don't know how important this is,
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:02.400]   but the market reaction, Apple stock, basically unchanged by this news at least so far, Spotify
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:08.320]   stock up 1.24%. But you know, really went up a lot. And it maybe there's other influences.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:14.480]   The match group, 7.21%. Of course, that's the dating all the dating apps are on the match group.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:18.880]   That's where it's around the world are cheery. But the matter, remember, it was the match group
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.840]   that was upset in Holland. They were the ones who got the Dutch authorities and then the other ones
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:32.640]   to force Apple to run in. So seen as good news, I think now up 8.6%. So seen as good news for some,
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.880]   I wonder if Sebastian Dewitt, though, might not feel so bad if he did what Andy, what you suggested,
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:44.400]   which is, you know, they could create kind of a humble bundle style app store from, for like,
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:49.920]   the best possible apps. Yeah. I don't know. Interesting. I mean, you got me thinking about
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:54.720]   different ways that Apple might have avoided this. Like if they had simply said that, you know what,
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:00.240]   we like, we like getting as much money as we possibly can from developers, but we agree that
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.920]   subscriptions, we that we have not earned a penny out of people who buy subscriptions through your
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:11.200]   through the app you create, we agree that we have not earned a penny of every comic book that you
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:15.040]   sell or every book or every audio book or every album that you sell through your thing. We will
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:22.560]   now basically uncouple that from from the from the revenue model so that we will we will basically
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:28.800]   try to address the complaints you have about app store exclusivity so that you're no one will
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.720]   see a point to wanting to have an external app store to all be bothered with very little upside.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.600]   So I wonder how much discussion would be going on inside of Apple about that about that instead.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.040]   Did you notice? I don't know if you've noticed. I don't know when it happened,
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:48.400]   but have you seen the points underneath Amazon? Amazon products? I didn't see that before until
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:53.280]   like this week and maybe this has been there and in a bunch of my Amazon stuff, it has prices
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.840]   and underneath it has points and I was like, Oh, what points are is that we don't want to,
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.680]   we don't want to have transaction fees points or don't we don't want to have transaction fees.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.160]   Oh, so this is only when you're doing this in the
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:10.400]   right now it's a web to or no, it's only in the app store. No, I only noticed. I'm just saying
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.840]   that when you start seeing points, so when you start seeing something that isn't a dog
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:19.040]   by my points. Yeah. Yeah. When you say when you anytime you see that that is a that is a moving
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:23.760]   around transaction or you know, transaction. So Apple doesn't if I buy with points, Apple doesn't
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:29.520]   get any of it. You know, getting Amazon points. If you went if you went to if you if you were
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.800]   buying something in World of Warcraft, you'd be charged for the money that you put into it,
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.280]   but you wouldn't get charged for that. That's what but see, that's what Epic tried to do in Fortnite
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:42.160]   was was create, you know, Fortnite bucks. And that's where Apple drew the line and said you can't be
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.400]   doing that because we want 30%. But they couldn't do it through the phone. I mean, if you if you went
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:52.000]   to Amazon on the web, right, right, and you put in $100 and got points out of it. And obviously,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.920]   that's why they try to keep Epic from doing it. But no, but I don't think that's not what Epic
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.520]   wants. It's not what Microsoft wanted to buy. They want to buy through the stores. They want to
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:04.800]   have a store. Yeah. Well, not just not just we get we don't have to give Apple 30%. They want to have
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.040]   their own store and if they want to get their own 50%. They get their own face. They're like,
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:15.920]   a lot of this is over the big thing with Epic is it's an existential when you when you look at the
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:23.040]   Epic ecosystem, they have this massive ecosystem for their games and for their development for
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:28.000]   Unreal development, where I can buy a house. I can buy a chair. I can buy a car. I can buy all these
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.720]   things. And they want that ecosystem to be to live inside of the the iPhone, of course. And and they,
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:39.600]   you know, it's a huge part of their business model and all the companies that are talking about NFTs
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:45.600]   and want to pay Apple 30% of their NFTs either. And so so NFTs and app stores, especially
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:50.640]   around assets, I'm going to buy and sell a bunch of assets and building a marketplace for it's less
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.800]   about apps for Epic, I think. I don't think they're trying to sell more games. Maybe they are. But
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:00.320]   what they really want to sell are the assets that you need for those games. And they want that to be
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:05.920]   frictionless on the phone and they don't want to pay 30% to do that. And that's why I mean,
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.960]   that's why they're so upset about it. Probably the same when many of them is that if you have a
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:16.320]   virtual world, there's a lot of things there. Their issue is that you want to buy and you can buy
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:21.520]   and sell things without Amazon can buy and sell things on the phone without being charged by Apple.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.720]   But that's not a reason. Well, if I created a, let's say, a virtual reality world called,
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:34.080]   I don't know, Third Life. And we had in in Third Life stores and you could buy, you know, free
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:40.880]   outfits and house appliances and stuff. Why should Apple get a piece of all those transactions?
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:46.800]   If really the vast effort was to create this whole Third Life ecosystem, it should have its own
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.120]   ecosystem, shouldn't it? Yeah, but the thing is, is they built the platform that made it possible.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.880]   Yeah, I think, you know, they don't invest in the other ones. They don't live in the other ones.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.800]   Yeah, it's, it's, it's, you know, it says, yeah, you built the platform that makes it possible,
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.920]   except we're the ones streaming all this stuff. Same thing with Spotify.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.920]   Yeah, but the issue though is that it is,
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:11.280]   it's tonological to say that, Alex. It's because you're saying, we're super successful.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:16.480]   And because we're super successful, we want to keep being super successful. And you all was
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.640]   because we're super successful. You know, I think, but I think that the issue is, and it was,
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.720]   it was said, no, that's not going to work. And if they had 70% of the market,
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.760]   then we would start talking about monopolies. It's just that they have much less than that.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.120]   And usually you're, you're, you're left to be able to do what you want to do until you reach
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:35.360]   a monopolistic position. And they're just not in a monopolistic position because there are more,
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:39.440]   there are other, there's another phone. So it's funny. I had in order to make it a debate in Windows
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.480]   weekly last week, I had to channel you on this, Alex. And I even said, I am now going to channel
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:49.920]   Alex Lindsey, but that's exactly the debate we were having. I said the same thing. And Paul said,
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:55.600]   well, no, but they have 100% monopoly within. Yeah, but I, okay. So what about, what about Sony
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:00.400]   PlayStation? What about the Xbox? There's 30% I did a good job channeling you last week.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:06.240]   Because it's exactly what I said. They charge 30%. He said, yes, but they don't have 100% monopoly
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.720]   in the same way. You could play a PlayStation. I can play it. No, no, that's not true. No,
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.560]   I can buy a game and play it on PlayStation without Sony's involvement.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.960]   If I'm buying it, yeah, if I'm buying it for download, but if I go down against
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.640]   stop, I can buy now maybe Sony has the manufacturer giving them a big.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.080]   Or maybe not. There's in, I mean, maybe not.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:32.960]   It's not a completely transparent. It's 30%. If you're, if you're able to,
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:38.080]   if you're able to run on a PS5, you have to give me a new page. You're paying 30% as well.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.600]   And I agree. And I think that's where the 30% for Apple came from is that Microsoft
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:46.080]   to Sony have been doing this for years long before Apple, Frank. So speaking of fees,
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.440]   speaking of fees, though, this is, this is a part that we haven't really covered yet,
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:54.080]   that is part of this is how Apple will find other ways to get their money. And I also agree in
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.600]   terms of them taking a cut that one of the, the big reason they should take a cut is because it's
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:02.560]   convenient. Like to say, in the end, you can offer whatever system you want, but the Apple in
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.320]   app purchase is just so slick. And we've already got their credit card that you should use us.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:11.040]   And that I think a lot of people would honestly, but it probably increases sales by more than 30%.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.400]   I'm going to guess it might, it might, but if you want to, but right now there's no choice,
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.120]   right? So you try it out and see, but I think that a lot of people would stick with Apple's
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.960]   payment method anyway, just because it is so convenient and Apple's got it wired in and it's
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:25.200]   a first party thing and it's like super easy. But what Mark Herman says also is,
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:30.480]   so to protect against unsafe apps, Apple is discussing the idea of mandating security
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.240]   requirements, right? They're going to be rules about that. And you might have to pay them for that.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:38.560]   They need to be verified, a process that could carry a fee. And I will say that in some other
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.640]   arguments that Apple has made over the last year, they have talked about how Apple gives away its
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:48.080]   developer tools for free or for $100 a year, and that they don't do anything to do that. But that
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:53.120]   some of these outside app store things that they've said in certain countries, like in, I think,
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:59.280]   Japan or South Korea, they've said, okay, you can use a third party payment system, but you still owe
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:04.400]   us a percentage of your, as a part of being an Apple developer, right? They've gotten around it
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:10.320]   that way. So when Mark Herman mentions a fee here, let's keep in mind, Apple will try to find a way
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:15.520]   to recoup some money from people who try to avoid Apple systems. And I'm unclear about what that
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:20.720]   might be. But some options are they might say anybody who uses the iOS developer kit owes them
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.480]   a certain percentage of their revenue, which by the way, if you use Unreal, once you go over a
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:29.920]   million dollars of revenue, you owe them 5%. Yeah, so that's a possibility. Another possibility
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:35.600]   is that they might actually say to become a member of the program, you have to, you know,
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:40.400]   and based on the number of downloads or whatever, you have to enter into Apple's developer program
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:46.640]   or Apple's integrity program at a certain level that's based on the amount of revenue your company
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.880]   generates from the platform. And they might say, okay, you can sell as many as you like,
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:57.120]   but because of the level that you reached, you owe us $10,000 a year or $100,000 a year or whatever.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:02.240]   So they're going to try to find ways to make the money a different way if they can. And that's
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:07.280]   more of a concern for Tim Sweeney, probably than anybody else. All right, we're going to take a
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:12.480]   little break. There will be much more to talk about as the details of this become clear. We should
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:17.120]   once again point out we're treating this like it's a fact it's a leak published by Mark Gurman.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:21.040]   Who knows? We could have just wasted the last half hour for
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:25.760]   his got a good track record, though. Yeah, good to talk about the details. Once the details were
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:31.120]   filled in in this article, it looks pretty clear that he either has a very good source inside of
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:36.000]   Apple or Apple's feeding them this stuff. I think this is probably the latter. I mean, this is
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.600]   too detailed. Again, if you it would be really useful to leak if you wanted to make sure that
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:46.880]   before this Congress didn't the close, they didn't slip in those little laws. If Apple looks like
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:51.200]   they're already going that it takes a lot of the wind out of that sale. So if you went into December
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:54.960]   and you released and it just happened to leak out that you're already going to get that direction.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:59.920]   It could be that you get Senator Klobuchar says, well, we don't want to be second fiddle to Europe.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:05.360]   We're going to pass our bill too. I mean, maybe it could backfire. Well, remember that there there's
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.640]   a must pass bill that's closing this this this term so that yeah, that that is an interesting
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.440]   observation that if they managed to get the didn't get it under the snide,
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.360]   we're like, are we going to read are we going to remark up and renegotiate this entire this
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:22.560]   entire package? Or are we just going to let you let you have your $80 million bridge from your golf
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.160]   course to your house? Guess what? You get your free bridge because we can't we can't shut down
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:29.760]   the government. We can't shut down the defense department. Yeah. All right, let's take a little
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:34.480]   break. I have a feeling there will be many more conversations. Just a program note, we will be
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:40.800]   here next week is I think Rich is joining us next week, Rich Segal. Yes. All right. So that's good
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:46.000]   news because he is of course the independent and very successful developer for most of the life of
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.120]   the Macintosh of BB edit at barebone software. I bet you Rich will have some things to say
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:56.880]   in about all of this. He he's gone back and forth with having BB edit on the app store.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.880]   Is it currently on the app store? I think it is. I think it is. Yeah, I think it is. Yeah, for a while,
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:05.520]   it wasn't because it he couldn't do everything he wanted to do. Right. And then he read and then
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:11.360]   he relented after Apple made some changes. So Rich will have much to say. So the developer's
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:16.320]   point of view next week on Macbreak Weekly. And then we will be taking the 27th off as well,
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:24.160]   all the shows that week after Christmas, the 26th through a New Year's, no New Year's Day,
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:31.040]   we will be doing best ofs. So the best of Macbreak Weekly will be on the 27th and we will be back
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:36.560]   with an all new show in the New Year, January 3rd. Is that what you said? I think that's what you
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:45.360]   said and I think you were right, Jason. So and I will I will be tanned by then. I hope I pray
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.960]   and I hope I can go to some beach somewhere.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.600]   And I'm not talking North Beach in San Francisco. Our show today brought to you by actually,
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.840]   that's not so bad. David, great for God. You brought to you by policy genius.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:06.720]   I just went from my own life. You know, when I when I had kids, everything really changed. You
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:12.160]   know, I suddenly became more responsible. It was good for my career because I started to pay more
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:17.760]   attention to it. That's how I that's it was right about then that I started doing a computer talk
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.760]   radio and tried to get a national show and all that stuff started doing more TV.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:27.120]   The other thing though, that I did as I decided, you know, I better take better care of my family.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:32.240]   You might think you started saving for college. No, I didn't. But I did something probably more
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:36.640]   important. I got a life insurance policy because remember, if something happens to you suddenly,
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:42.560]   if you're a breadwinner, the mortgage payments don't go away. All of a sudden,
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:47.440]   child care, other expenses don't disappear. You're still on the hook. Your family is on the hook.
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:52.640]   Now you want to take care of your family. You want a life insurance policy. A lot of people say,
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:56.400]   well, I got it through my work. But look at what you get through your work. It's probably not enough
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:03.120]   to last more than a few months or a year. And if you leave your job, it's one reason, one way
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.640]   they keep you. They hold on to you because if you leave your job, you lose your insurance.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:12.080]   You think you need your own life insurance. And one more thing to add to put the pressure on you,
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:17.360]   life insurance gets more expensive as you get older. So it's never going to be as inexpensive
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:23.920]   to get it than right now. And the best way to find it policy genius, the smart way to buy the
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:28.880]   right coverage for you and your family, they're not, they don't sell insurance. They help you find
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:35.120]   insurance. Now, they, when you talk with them, if you call them, they're all of their people on the
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:39.440]   phone are licensed agents. They have to be by law. But remember, they don't work for the insurance
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:44.320]   companies. They work for you. So they have no incentive to recommend one insurer over another.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:49.440]   You could trust their guidance. Policy genius was built to modernize the life insurance industry.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:54.400]   And their technology makes it so easy to compare life insurance quotes from all the top companies,
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:59.440]   AIG, Prudential, whoever, in just a couple of clicks, which helps you find the best price. And
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:06.560]   trust me, you really should be shopping. There is a huge variety of coverage and prices.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:11.520]   But with policy genius, you can find life insurance policies that started just $17 a month for
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.440]   half a million dollars of coverage. Obviously, that's going to vary depending on your circumstances.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:22.400]   But it's really worth checking. It really is. At policy genius, will help you, they'll walk you
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:28.480]   through it. There are no added fees. Your personal info is kept private. No wonder they have thousands
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.960]   of five star reviews on Google and trust pilot. This is a really good solution. By the way, while
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:37.840]   you're there, I'm focusing on life insurance because I think it's so important that everybody
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:43.280]   be thinking about it. They also do home, auto. They've got pet and renters insurance, lots more.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:48.480]   So they will help you find the right coverage from the right company at the right price
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:54.640]   for all of that. But let's just say your loved ones deserve a financial safety net and you deserve

[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:36.320]   Thank you so much for their support. So that was just one of the three huge stories.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:42.000]   Later today, Steve Gibson tells me he's going to talk about Apple's promise to add end-to-end
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.960]   encryption iCloud backups. He will give us a more technical break. But this is another huge shift
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:55.840]   from Apple. They've had this capability. It is said for years, but the FBI talked him out of it
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:02.160]   because of course the FBI would love to be able to see what's in your iCloud when Apple, in the
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:09.760]   San Bernardino case, when Apple refused to help the FBI unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:15.600]   terrorist, they did say, but if you bring it back to his house, it'll probably sync with iCloud and
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:22.480]   we can give you that. Apple has historically, it's come up in many, many cases, been able to give
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:29.840]   the unencrypted iCloud information to law enforcement. In fact, I guess we've all thought maybe they
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:38.640]   keep it that way for that reason. But on Wednesday of last week, they announced something called
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:43.440]   advanced data protection. Actually, they've had that for some time. They're going to expand the
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:52.080]   categories and it will finally include end-to-end encryption for backups on iCloud as well as photos
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:59.600]   and notes on iCloud. Your thoughts? It's funny to think about it this way,
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:05.920]   but in many ways, this is not an enormous technical change because what the truth is that everything
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:11.840]   is pretty much not like not mail or calendars or contacts, but almost everything that you do
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:16.960]   is stored at Apple in an encrypted fashion. The difference is that Apple also has a key to it,
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:21.280]   right? You've got a key and Apple's got a key. So Apple can view it and you can view it.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:27.600]   And with this new feature, what Apple is saying is for this class of stuff that has previously not
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:35.600]   been just your eyes only, we could also access it, we're going to not have the key. We're not going
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:40.320]   to keep that encryption key. That means you'll have to generate the key on your phone. It will be
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:46.560]   encrypted on your phone and in transit and sit at rest on Apple's servers, but they don't have a key
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:50.880]   only you do on your phone. Right, because what was happening is those iCloud backups are encrypted.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.640]   It's just that Apple has a key to decrypt them. And what Apple is saying is, okay, if you turn on
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.640]   this feature, we are throwing away our key. We don't have our key anymore. We should point out.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:06.320]   This is how Dropbox works. This is how almost all cloud services work the way you've said before,
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:10.640]   which is that the service has the key. And there are reasons we've talked about this. Lots of
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:15.520]   reasons. There are reasons besides simply handing your information over to law enforcement.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:19.120]   It gives them more capabilities. If they can see it, they can dedupe, they could do all sorts of
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:24.000]   stuff. Google does is Google scans for CSAM on your Google Drive. This is well known.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.360]   That's because they have the keys. And it's funny because there's actually some information that
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:35.600]   is not encrypted. My understanding is actually a lot of the fingerprinting, the the dedupping.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:42.320]   That metadata is not necessarily encrypted. So Apple can still do dedupping, but they can't
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:45.840]   see what the file is, which is interesting. They could see certain attributes of the file.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:49.920]   Which means that they could potentially do CSAM scanning if they wanted to.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:55.760]   But like side issue, the big issue here is what they're saying is if you flip that switch,
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:00.160]   a couple of things are happening. We don't have your key anymore, which has a huge impact
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:05.840]   on a lot of people who lose their phone or they forget their password and they can't get into
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:10.000]   their system. And right now they call up and say, and it's a proverbial story, but it's totally
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.360]   happened, which is I lost all the pictures of my grandkids because I lost my phone. And Apple
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:22.400]   takes them through a process and unlocks their account. Or my mom died and I would like to get
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:28.800]   into her stuff. So Apple added a thing called the legacy contact, which actually allows you and
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:33.840]   Apple to work together to unlock a third party account. This is actually part of this as an
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:38.320]   extension of that. So now if Apple throws away their key and you're like, well, now if you lose
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:43.360]   your stuff, you lose it forever. And there's no way to go talk to Apple about resetting it.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:47.760]   Because we part of the deal here is that we can't do that now, but they had the system that is
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:53.440]   similar to the legacy contact where you basically can say, I want to identify an Apple ID and say
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:58.640]   that they can work with Apple and me all together. They've got a piece of the key. Apple's got a
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:02.800]   piece of the key. If they work together, they can unlock my account for me.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:10.080]   So by the way, I just I am a giant string. I just uploaded it. I downloaded rather the latest 16.2,
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:14.320]   and it is now on. So they are distributing us now in the US.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:19.120]   Here I am on the screen that says advanced data protection. And it's all of those things,
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:23.680]   just as it shows in the Verge article. And you can turn it on. But Apple says, because Apple will
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:29.920]   not have the keys required to recover your data, you will be guided through verification of your
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:34.400]   recovery methods in case you ever lose it. In other words, you're going to try to make you can
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:38.560]   you zoom in a little bit on that. They're not going to let you turn this on without having that
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:43.120]   backup because they know that this kind of thing happens. So like, yeah, and if you don't have a
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:48.000]   person you trust with this, you can do that thing that a lot of other sites will let you do. Like
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.200]   one password did that and I have that somewhere is the the long, long, long code that you can put
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:58.080]   in the safety deposit box. And if you enter in that code, it will also unlock your account. It's
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:02.320]   an alternate key. This is interesting. But for most people, you use another person.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:08.000]   In order to do this, you have to make sure. So I've only updated this. You have to have everything
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:16.240]   updated your Apple TV, your devices, your whole pods, your iPads, your everything, your watches,
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:22.000]   free single device that's attached to your Apple ID, which is why this is probably a 2023 or
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.520]   let's be honest, 2024 kind of thing. I even have to update to the latest version of iCloud for
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:33.120]   Windows. Yeah, of course, yeah, makes sense. Yeah, otherwise, how would they be able to access
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:41.040]   this explains why because everything got pushed today. iPadOS, iOS, MacOS. And I realized home
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:46.000]   pod OS and watch OS have also been updated. And that's probably much of it is to support this
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.440]   new advanced data protection. And good luck if you have an older phone that doesn't run the very
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:56.240]   really software either. Yeah, you can't do it. Yeah. And and I think that some of the stuff starts
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:00.160]   to come into light because a lot of this, you know, nothing like this gets done in a month,
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:04.400]   right? This has been probably something they've been working on for a couple of years now. And,
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:08.320]   you know, the CSAM scanning that we that we talked about earlier this year, the,
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:15.440]   the all those things are kind of connected to this, like we have to make people feel safer,
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:20.160]   that, Hey, we're about to cut all the access off to everything to be able to see everything.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:24.960]   And but because the number one thing that's going to come up is terrorism.
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:30.800]   You know, well, what do you think is going to have about China? Was China's response going to be
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:39.520]   this? They don't want this. The phibis don't want this. No, I mean, the UK has a law against this.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:45.440]   Australia has a law against this. Apple's going to be facing a lot of governmental requests at this
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:50.400]   time. Yeah, I feel like their strategy here is basically to say, we're going to do this
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:55.600]   because it lets us say this is what we think it should be. We don't think we should have that
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:53:00.400]   information and that law enforcement that's using this. It's sort of a weird effect of how we built
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:04.800]   the cloud, but in the long run, it's your data and we shouldn't see it. That's right. And they,
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:10.240]   I'm sure would love not to have to comply with those requests. And if they are forced to,
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:15.200]   they're going to be like, it's not us, right? It's not us. Yeah. The government made us. We
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.960]   want to protect your stuff, but they're not going to let us and they're going to force the
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:23.040]   government to make that decision. It feels like it's big a turnaround for Apple as the app store
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:27.840]   thing. And this one's not being compelled by anybody. I think this is really an interesting
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:31.600]   turnaround. I don't think it's a turnaround. I think it's an evolution. I think that it,
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:35.840]   I think that this is where Apple, there's this Apple, you know, again, if Apple did everything
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:39.840]   it wanted to do around our own personal security, people would get freaked out because they're going
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:43.040]   to lock this whole thing down. They're going to keep on locking things down. They're going to keep,
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:48.240]   what they're doing is they're kind of closing one hat drill slowly. It's what we call sneaking up
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:54.400]   to a horse. You'll move very fast. I just agree. I think Apple didn't want to do this. Clearly,
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:54:00.080]   they didn't. They've had this technology for years. I don't think they wanted to do this,
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:05.920]   but I think they had to because at this point, this isn't a way to just don't worry about the ads
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:11.520]   we're selling and the information we're gathering. See, we really do care. There was this tendency
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:16.080]   over the last few weeks, we've talked about it, to start thinking Apple's only playing lip service
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:21.600]   to privacy. So this, by doing this, maybe they always wanted to, but by finally saying,
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:26.480]   we're going to take a chance with the US government, the Chinese government, the English government,
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:31.040]   and we're going to do it because it does really, at this point now, you say, "Yeah, I guess Apple
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:34.320]   does care about it, privacy." But we've talked about this for a couple months, but to do what
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:40.800]   they're talking about is $100 million in three years of work. This isn't like, "Hey, let someone
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:45.280]   close this off or do whatever," for them to actually release it is an enormous amount of money.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.480]   Especially because I'm sure they're going to do it. I'm really conservative. It's probably closer to
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:53.520]   billions of dollars to make the infrastructure change that we're talking about at the scale that
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:58.480]   Apple does, any of this stuff, this is the kind of thing that can't fail. So it can't be like,
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:04.160]   we're just going to throw it out and see how it goes. It has to be very slowly tested and managed
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:11.040]   by very large teams. This is a massive operation to do this. And so this is not something they just
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:15.040]   decided to do this fall. This is something they decided to do in 2018 or 2015.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:20.880]   Yeah. I think that they had to get the weather report very, very, very carefully before they did
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.640]   that, meaning that what if they put in all this time and all this trouble and all this effort
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:29.440]   and all this risk to our current way of doing things, only to find out that, "Hey,
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:33.680]   right now, and looks like Congress is about to pass a law that makes it impossible for us to do
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:38.960]   this. That's a waste of time and money." Also the ability to make sure that they can support this
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:46.160]   correctly, they're going to have a lot of people who are going to be... If they had lost their phones,
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:51.360]   as we were saying before, if a loved one had passed away and they had not set plans for what
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:56.800]   happens to their data after they go, Apple had a long bureaucratic paperwork involving process
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.400]   to get that data and those photos back, but at least it existed. Now they're just going to have
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:04.000]   to tell a lot of people that, "I'm sorry, all of your Christmas videos from 10 years,
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.720]   so the past 10 years are just gone and there's no way we can get them back." But finally,
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:14.000]   this has always been something that has kind of bothered me that there is always this big,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.720]   big loophole in we think that privacy is a basic human right. If they can lock it, lock down our
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:24.640]   backups, why are they're not doing so and what is their reasoning for not doing so? Because it's not
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:31.920]   just privacy against being observed by companies or other people. Privacy is privacy for everybody.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:37.280]   Our privacy against our own governments is just as important as our privacy against our employers,
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:42.080]   privacy against Google and Facebook and all these other people. So it's no good if you're just saying
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:46.800]   that we're not going to defend your privacy against the most, the people who have the greatest
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:50.400]   amount of power over you, which is again, the people who own the army, the people who own the
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:59.520]   police. According to, hold on, according to Reuters, in 2018, four years ago, Apple was planning to do
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:04.240]   this. I remember this story very well. We talked about it. And according to Reuters, who had said
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:10.800]   that we have six sources that said the FBI asked them not to and they did not. So I think it's BS
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:15.120]   to say, oh, yeah, Apple had it took all this time. We had to really do it right. Apple was
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:18.960]   willing to do it and wanted to do it because obviously they don't want to hand over this information.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:25.440]   And the FBI asked them not to. And so you're giving an awful lot of credit that I don't think
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:29.760]   they deserve. I think this is something I give them credit now. I don't know what's changed,
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.560]   except that I would say what's changed is there is the reputation.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:36.320]   They're ready to do it in 2018. It just means that they were working on the 2015. This is not a
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:41.040]   minor thing. Well, I don't just point out unless Reuters got this completely wrong, which is possible
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:46.480]   that they could have done this four years ago and didn't. So they've had they had they had they
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:51.120]   had, you know, the thing is, is you got to find the right time to do it. And then you have the again,
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:54.960]   all the other implementations, you have to piece all these things together over time.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:58.240]   You know, I think that the thing is, is you have to say, okay, we have some kind of
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:03.760]   CSAM scanning. We have this thing. You can see that these those pieces make more sense in the
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:07.600]   context that we're going to close everything off. You know, and so the so I think that the,
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:14.000]   that those there's a lot of things that have to get put into place. And you can't do it after
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.640]   something that when the FBI's rattling sabers is not the kind of one current.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:24.320]   This is from this is a story from 2020 and Reuters. More than two years ago, Apple told the FBI a
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:28.560]   plan to offer users end to end encryption when storing their phone data on iCloud according to
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:33.680]   one current and three former FBI officials and one current and former Apple employee.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:38.000]   Under that plan, primarily designed to thwart hackers, Apple would no longer have a key. This
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:43.120]   is exactly what they've done. In private talks with Apple soon after representatives of the FBI's
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:47.600]   cyber crime agents and its operational technology division objected to the plan arguing it would
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:51.920]   deny them the most effective means blah, blah, blah. When Apple spoke privately to the FBI about
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:56.080]   its work on phone security the following year, the end to end encryption plan had been dropped.
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:59:01.680]   So yeah, maybe, oh, maybe they dropped it because it was too hard or they hadn't weren't ready,
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:07.680]   but it sure sounds like the FBI talked about it. And that was in 2018. And also the incoming
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:12.320]   Congress is not for FBI friendly. And so the thing is, is that they're not, you know, so the other
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:15.520]   thing is that they've made obviously they put their finger to the wind at some point and said,
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:19.280]   I think we can get away with it now. Because now that the, you know, with the Republican Congress,
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:23.280]   there's no laws that are going to go in that are going to, you know, we give the FBI any more
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:27.280]   control than they have now. And so the thing is, is if you're going to drop something, this is,
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:33.280]   you drop it right now. So the time it is, you know, no, no, they dropped, which is very interesting,
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:38.080]   is their plan to scan on your phone for CSAM, which was very controversial.
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:42.080]   Well, a lot of us didn't like, yeah, again, we understand what what they're coming right. It
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:47.680]   just felt weird, you know, to, to, you know, yeah, so we know it was a bad idea, but it's interesting
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:51.200]   that they've now said, first they said we're going to delay it, they have now said no, we're
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:56.480]   not going to do it. They also say they're improving two factor authentication by allowing users to
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:04.000]   use hardware keys like Yuba keys, which I use early next year. Furthermore, you can put recovery
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.560]   information. In fact, probably should. You'll get a, you'll get recovery codes. You should
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:15.520]   probably put those somewhere safe, like in a passive, you know, password manager, maybe even
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:22.080]   print them out and put them in a safe, because there is no more recourse to Apple. And I think if
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:26.080]   you want to be generous to Apple, you could say that was the reason they didn't do it, not the FBI,
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:30.720]   but just that was going to be hard on users, because I'm sure they get, you know, thousands of
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:35.200]   requests every year from people have lost their, you know, I think that story you quoted Leo,
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:38.240]   you know, they said they intended to do it, right? So I don't think it was ready then, but it was on
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.000]   the roadmap and then the FBI is trying to talk them out of it. It looks to me like your later was
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.320]   off the roadmap. So yeah, or they, or they weren't talking about it with the FBI, right? But that
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:52.320]   legacy contact feature, like that's basically this, right? That is a part of this, which is we need,
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:56.160]   if we're going to do end to an encryption down the road, we got to find alternate ways for them
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:01.200]   to decrypt their account, because otherwise it's just way too dangerous if Apple can't do it.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:06.400]   Somebody else needs to. So they came up with this idea and they rolled it out first as the legacy,
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:11.520]   so that so that a trusted person could go to Apple and say, this person has died. I need to
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.160]   get into their account and they work through it and they've been authorized and it happens,
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:23.840]   but that same flow is basically what happens for this. So they were building the pieces in the
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:29.040]   background, I think, but yeah, they all also politically, somebody asked me the other day,
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:34.240]   why announce this now and not at WWDC? And I thought, this is the kind of thing you don't announce
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.720]   where you give governments and law enforcement lots of time to think about it, really, right?
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:43.520]   Like you announce it now and roll it out and then say, now tell me what you're going to do about it.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:49.760]   And they may, China may do that and the US may do that and who knows, but it's not the thing you
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:54.720]   give people six months to think about. And so they didn't. And we always have to provide,
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.360]   when we talk about security, is that the reason that we don't have in the United States,
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:04.000]   for those of us in the United States, the reason we don't have a 911 every week is because of
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.120]   signal intelligence. Like, let's just be clear, like, this is like, we are safe because there is,
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:14.560]   there is an NSA and a CIA that is doing what it does to gather. And so we want to, we never want
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.160]   to say, okay, we can't let the government look at anything because it is what keeps us from having
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:22.080]   walls around our house that have broken glass across the top and, you know, machine guns at
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:26.640]   every corner, which I work in countries that do have that, right? And so, so the thing is, is that
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:32.560]   in signal intelligence is the thing. And the problem is, is that, you know, Edward Snowden very,
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.840]   very clear to us that not that humans have access to the data. Like, you know, humans, it's not like
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.280]   nobody can get ahold of it. Anybody can get ahold of it, you know, or not anybody, but there's
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.360]   people that can get ahold of it and use it for leverage. And it's not even just what you, what you,
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:49.040]   the thing you have to think about as well, if you're not breaking the law, but what if you're
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:54.400]   just not doing something that you want to necessarily make public, that can be used against you, you
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.240]   know, and, and so the thing is that then that's not breaking the law and it's not warranted,
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.400]   but it is, it is still something that would make you embarrassed and that puts you in a point of
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.400]   leverage. And these are all things that we don't want our governments to be able to do.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.400]   And then maybe our government will do fine. I don't know, but, but we definitely don't want
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.920]   all the governments to be able to do that. So I think that it's a very reasonable thing for
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:18.880]   people to have that, that that internal, you know, I understand what the risks are, is that we might
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:22.320]   have, you know, they're, you know, the, the eyes are going to tell us more people will die,
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:27.040]   because we weren't able to figure this out. And that might be true, you know, and we have to, we
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:32.320]   always have to wait for you to inverse the safety. Yeah, simply put people, people don't even need
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:38.480]   to have a reason why they want privacy. It's they can simply say, I just, if I have the ability to
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:43.600]   secure my information, I will secure that information just in principle. And that's, and it is important
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:49.920]   that as we have these conversations, as, as important as I, as important as I think that this kind of
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:55.600]   freedom is to everybody, because otherwise you have the, otherwise you were going to establish a
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.720]   legal principle that it is that the individual here in America, the individual American citizens
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.720]   does not have the right to have a secret from the from its own government. That's bad. We also have
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:10.240]   to acknowledge just as you say that this is not just, this is not just three letter agencies who
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:17.120]   just want to snoop in on us for their own jollies. This is a very, lives get saved, disasters get
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:23.840]   averted, bad people get incarcerated and discovered because of ability to essentially pry into private
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:28.720]   affairs. And so this is going to make it more difficult for law enforcement to do their jobs.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:32.160]   That's not, but that's not the end all be all to every single argument.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.920]   And it's never been, I mean, it's from an information perspective, it's never been better for law
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.240]   enforcement because of these phones. Yeah. It's, it was described to me once that
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:46.640]   by someone that would know that, you know, it's like you have a 1920 by, by 1080 screen that is
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:51.760]   completely in, in focus. And there's one pixel missing. And that's your, like, there's, like,
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:55.200]   that's how much data they have about us, about our behaviors, about who we're talking to, about
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.960]   when we're talking to them. It's just this one little pixel and they really frustrated about that
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:04.400]   little pixel. Like, one last one and all. Oh, no, no, we're going to have to fill some of them in
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:09.840]   the creator PGP said that he said, yeah, he said, they want 100%.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:15.520]   Just a few missing pixels, bug down. And I get it, I get it that like, if you're a law enforcement
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:20.080]   agency, you want as many tools as possible, but it is true that there's a spectrum that runs
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:24.320]   from them having nothing to it being a police state. And the idea is you have to find some
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:29.760]   place in the middle. And I think as a function of the growth of technology, we've entered a place
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:34.480]   where our personal private disclosure is way greater than it ever used to be, right? The idea
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.880]   was it was in your mind or it was in your house. And if it was in your house, they had to get a
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:42.640]   subpoena to come in and look in your house. And if it was in your mind, they couldn't do anything.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:46.560]   It was protected. But we offload so much of our brains, our backup brain is our phone and we
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:51.840]   carry it outside our house, or we put it in the cloud. And like, that's why I feel like there's
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:56.800]   one way to view this, which is Apple's approach to cloud data is it really does belong to you and
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:01.680]   we shouldn't see it. And the only reason we've seen it up to now is a function of the way technology
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:06.160]   has progressed. But we've reached the point where we don't need it, we don't need to see it anymore.
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.920]   And we don't think just because we used to be able to see it, we should continue to see it.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:15.040]   And I get how law enforcement would look at that and say, oh, you're taking away one of our best
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:22.320]   tools. And I get that. But on a higher level of philosophy, it really isn't anyone's right
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.800]   for the tech companies to be able to look at our stuff.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:29.040]   Well, this is why it's really well. But you have to recognize law enforcement would love to have
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:34.320]   a camera in our houses at all times as well. And it certainly would cut down on crime.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:39.760]   But that doesn't mean they get to, right? And this is why this is part of what I love about
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:45.840]   technology in general, that it forces us to think about the reasons why we have the principles that
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:53.040]   we have that we have when the Bill of Rights was being assembled, we never had a they didn't write
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:59.920]   down article article 11 is that individuals have their right to have to have a secret from the
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:05.440]   government, because it was inoperable. There was there is no there was no way that there was
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:10.640]   there's no way that you could create a secret in a written form so that you didn't so so that
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:14.800]   the government could not at some point retrieve it. You can put it in a safe lock inside another
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:18.800]   safe buried and concrete under the sea. And if it's important enough, the government could send
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:24.000]   divers down or a camera it open and drill it over as one of the founding fathers said in Franklin,
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.120]   a secret can be kept between two people if one of them is dead.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:34.640]   Right. And now and now we have and now we have the technology to have a secret that's written down
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:39.760]   as part of a storage so that I have a gigabyte birth of secrets that the government has no
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:44.000]   has no ability to to think they can get the they can get the they can have it on a key chain on
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.120]   on a drive on my key chain and the government can get the key chain but they can't get into that
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:53.600]   secret and now it's like it's frustrating to them to think that but it's right there it's a file
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:57.680]   we don't have to interrogate him. He doesn't have to plea the Fifth Amendment has nothing to do with
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:02.480]   this. It's a file. We should be able to open this file so that and this is why again it comes down
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:08.720]   to the discussion. Do we want to think that there is an there is an unwritten article in the Bill of
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:12.400]   Rights that says that we have the right to keep something secret from the government that the
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:19.840]   government does not have a right to every single record that we write down or if that's true what
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:26.880]   is privacy anyway. Let me get Ben Franklin's quote correct. Three can keep a secret if two of them
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:32.400]   are dead. Three. Thank you. Well and again you know we're not just talking about people breaking
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:36.560]   laws we're just talking about people having you know doing things that they don't necessarily
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.800]   want to you know project out to the rest of the world and they may not nefarious at all.
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:45.120]   And that's the problem with law enforcement. They affirm that anything that's kept secret is
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.560]   illegal. Well but but it's and it's worse than that because law enforcement will use that against
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:55.040]   you. You know like so the thing is is they'll go well you know this was happening and this was
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.560]   happening. Do you really want that to come out in court. You know and then everyone's like okay
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:05.360]   I'll I'll I'll I'll cop to the whatever it is to get out of the fact that I don't want this to go
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:10.000]   to get public. You know and so I think that that's the and that's where you get leveraged by having
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.400]   information that's that's there. And you know and so I think that I think it's a I think it's a great
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.520]   thing. I think that you know a lot of governments are going to fight it but I think it's going to
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.640]   be really unpopular. Like now that it's available it's one thing that was was theoretical but now
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:25.920]   that people have it they're going to be like why can't I have that. Why should I.
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:32.240]   Didn't take long. Didn't take long the last Wednesday late Wednesday the FBI said it literally
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:38.800]   a few hours later. It was deeply concerned with the threat end to end and user only access encryption
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:45.680]   poses. This hinders our ability to protect the American people from criminal acts ranging from
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:51.840]   cyber attacks and violence against children to drug trafficking organized crime and terrorism.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:57.680]   In this age of cyber security and demands for security by design the FBI and law enforcement
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:03.600]   partners need lawful access by design. And the reality is again if it doesn't happen in the next
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:07.120]   six weeks it's not going to happen in the next two years. So it's you know it's you know so I think
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:12.960]   that Apple picked a pretty good time to put it in. Yeah. Yeah I mean everybody everybody but
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:19.280]   law enforcement and the Chinese government think this is a great idea. I wonder if this is if this
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:24.080]   is by the way the most going to be the most interesting part of this to me Apple has basically
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:29.280]   given into the Chinese government every step of the way. Will this be the line in the sand Tim Cook
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:34.880]   does not want to cross. I doubt it. I doubt it. Yeah. This is not going to be the one that
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.280]   this is not going to be the rocky. Yeah. All right let's take a little break come back. We
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:47.120]   okay the third of the giant stories of the week. For you. And Apple music sing are here we're
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:54.480]   going to do some karaoke. No please don't. No. Come on. Come on. A long time been a long time
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:11:03.840]   been lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely. Okay maybe we want Andy and I will do it privately.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:10.880]   I showed it. I brought to you by Zachtok. I just used Zachtok as a matter of fact yesterday.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:16.960]   This is such a great service before you book any brunch. You and I'm excited because at least
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:24.640]   already asked me I get my first Saturday off in 20 years in on the two Saturdays from now. My last
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:30.160]   radio show is this Saturday. So I'm going to brunch right Lisa said where do you want to have your
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:37.520]   first brunch. What do you do you go to Yelp or Google reviews you look at all the reviews you
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:45.200]   pour over the menu pictures. Why is it. And when we choose a doctor we just go yeah you.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:51.200]   I'm looking for a new doctor. Okay I'm not I'm not thrilled by existing doctor because he's kind of
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:59.200]   overlooked a few things. And I thought oh I know Zachtok was Zachtok. You can see real verified
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:04.480]   patient reviews. That's really handy. So you can find the right doctor in your network
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.400]   and in your neighborhood. Best of all finding the right doctors just
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:16.080]   just as easy as finding the best eggs Benedict. But maybe I would say a little bit more important.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:21.040]   All right I'm just saying although I am looking forward to my my first eggs Benedict in 20 years
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:26.800]   that is going to be fun. Zachtok is a free app. I think I'm kidding I'm not. Zachtok is a free
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:31.520]   app that shows you doctors who are patient reviewed. Take your insurance and are available when you
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:36.880]   need them. It was so great. I went to Zachtok. I chose the specialty I wanted. I'm looking for
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:42.240]   somebody. Okay don't laugh at me. But I'm looking for somebody who could do geriatric as a geriatric
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:47.680]   practice because as I get older a lot of times doctors I read this great book a wonderful book
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:53.360]   called Being Mortal. And he says this is a problem because there are not enough people practicing
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:59.920]   geriatric medicine anymore. I found one in Petaloma takes my insurance available taking new patients
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.400]   and I found that all on Zachtok. You can find any that's a crazy one but you can find any specialist
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:09.280]   under the sun. Whether you're trying to find an orthodontist to straighten some teeth. Look out
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:14.240]   for a chiropractor to fix an achy back a dermatologist to get your mold checked out or anything else.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:19.920]   Zachtok has you covered even has acupuncture and other non-traditional medicine. Zachtok's mobile
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:25.440]   app is easy to use. You search fine and book doctors with a few taps. I was actually really
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:29.600]   impressed. I've been talking about Zachtok for some time. They've been a sponsor for some time
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:35.680]   and I finally needed to use them and it was great. Find and review local doctors read and this is
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:41.200]   really important. Reverified patient reviews from real people who made real appointments. They really
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:46.720]   do this so that when you walk into the doctor's office you're going to see someone in your network
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:51.680]   who gets you. Who does it the way you want. Different you know I was reading this different
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:55.760]   doctors have for instance different ways of explaining things. Some people want a doctor just to tell
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:00.560]   them what to do. I don't need to know the details. Just tell me what to do. Some people say I want
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:04.640]   to know all the information and different doctors have different styles. You could find one that
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:10.560]   gives you what you're looking for. Zachtok.com every month millions of people use Zachtok.

[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.920]   the way that you want. I love that. Thank you Zachtok.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:59.360]   Yeah the good thing about the geriatric physician is somebody's point out in the chat room. They
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:05.200]   always have openings. That's terrible. That's terrible. Well not if they're good.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:13.760]   That's a great book. Sad because there was going to be a movie about I don't know how the movie
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:21.920]   would be. It's an on fiction book and the movie got stopped because Bill Murray did something terrible.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:28.400]   But the book I highly recommend being mortal by Atul Gawande. He's a physician.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:37.360]   It's about our final transition and some people aren't going to read it because it's depressing.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:43.120]   But Lisa read it first I think because both of our parents are getting on and I read it
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.760]   and put a great book. What a wonderful book. Highly recommended.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:52.080]   Yeah it's about being mortal. And one of the things he says is not as the fewer
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:58.720]   physicians are specializing in geriatric medicine which people my age need. I'm over 65 now.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:03.520]   I know I don't look at do I? Thank you. Thank you very much.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:10.880]   It shouldn't be fishing like that. IOS let's start with iOS 16.2. It is out today.
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:18.000]   I'm very excited. I immediately launched it and welcome to Freeform. The new app is here. The new
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.480]   app is here. Freeform. Get creative. Sketch out a project. Design a mood board. Brainstorm ideas.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:30.640]   Build your board. Collaborate with others. It's one of those apps where it starts with a white page.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:36.960]   So it'd be great for flashlights. I guess you can I don't know if you can't do anything. Oh yeah
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:42.080]   there's drawing. Yeah there's drawing and you can drag you can drag things in and import media and
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:47.120]   type things. And it's gonna sink to my Mac too. Right because Freeform is on the Mac as well.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:50.960]   Yeah it's gonna sink to all your devices and it's I think they built it because they've got
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:55.040]   these new collaboration tools on the Mac and the iPad especially that are all tied in with iMessage
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:59.760]   and FaceTime and they needed they realized that like they didn't actually have an app that's just
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:06.240]   like an infinite sketch book or whiteboard and so they built it and I love that they built this
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.160]   thing because it's not going to set the world on fire or anything but I love that it's kind of
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:16.000]   quirky and that they're trying stuff and it is a fun feature and on an iPad with Apple Pencil it's
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.120]   actually really nice because you get to take advantage of all of the infrastructure they built for
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:28.800]   like markup and notes involving drawing tools for Apple Pencil plus you can drag in links and photos
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:35.520]   I just scan the doc and all sorts of stuff. This is really cool yeah. So maybe I will start to
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:41.600]   play with this. This is kind of and I'd be nice if they just put this in a notepad but it's kind of
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:47.040]   an interesting adjunct. I think I think they wanted it to be a little different from notes and
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:51.040]   especially because of the collaborative aspect of it too where like what they really want you to do
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:57.200]   is share this with a bunch of people and work together on a shared board and use it as a you know
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:03.920]   a mind map or a brainstorming session or something like that and I actually think it could be pretty
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:09.360]   good as that. Yeah all right but that's just one of the things we can also sing. I haven't played
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:15.360]   with this yet. This is the this is the Apple Music thing so I guess what go into Apple Music and
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:20.480]   Andy and I can play. You play a song and you should get the special control that lets you drop out the
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:26.560]   Oh there it is. It's in the category so we know we go immediately with Apple Music's sing. It's
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:32.960]   your turn to be part of the music. What do you want to sing? Let's sing the hits. Let's see
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:39.920]   California Love Into Club. Come on Andy you and I should do In The Club. Yeah here we go. Fiddy scent.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:46.320]   Uh as a plan it is. I have I can't play the sound so you're just gonna but we're not oh here's the
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:53.440]   sing part. My fault is my after not like that. I'm not sure if we don't know we you find me in the
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:59.840]   club bottle full of bub. Look Mammy I I got the X if you into taking drugs. I'm into having sex.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:05.760]   I ain't into making love. So jeez I can't read this. This is terrible. I was a little surprised that
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:09.600]   you picked that one. I was gonna stop. I'm gonna stay out of that. You know like it was.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:17.440]   Not not exactly the muppets. I mean yeah when I pull up out in front you see the bends on
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:23.600]   dubs when I roll 20. Oh never mind. I can't keep that. He's very fast. He's a very fast. I would
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:29.440]   have joined in but you're just doing so great. I want to just sit back and enjoy the rap city.
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:34.320]   Anyway that's cool. So it shows you the lyrics. You have a choice of vocals how much of the vocals
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:40.000]   you want and so forth. And now you too can sing Fiddy Cent. How about something like
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:46.640]   Dancing Queen by Abba? That's good. You and I could do that. So you have to press the sing button.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:56.080]   Ooh ooh you can. Ooh you can dance. You can drive. Oh and by the way I wasn't sure but now I see
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:04.320]   I can use my phone as a microphone. Right? So that's cool. Oh here we go. Ooh you can dance. We're doing
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:16.960]   it I could tell you. You can drive. You can drive having the time of your life. Ooh see that girl. Watch
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:24.480]   that see. Digging the Dancing Queen. I'm trying to sing harmony but I can't. That's a very.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:29.840]   Gonna change. Gonna change. Gonna change my life. I could tell you that. Right now.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:33.120]   It's gonna give you plenty of room on the bus. That'll be true.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:39.440]   Advanced data protection. We already showed you that. There are some apparently changes to the
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:44.560]   lock screen and iPhone 14 Pro is always on display. Do you know what those are Jason? I don't
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:50.000]   know what those are. Yeah. Or anything. It's not turned off the wallpaper you can turn off. Oh that's
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.200]   the one where it's always on so it's less notable. So it's black. Yeah.
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:02.640]   Yeah. Actually that's nice. I actually prefer. You can see it's cool to set Android eyes because
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:09.680]   that's unfortunately I'm unlocked it by my face but it's a very clean thing when you have it locked.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:15.600]   Let's just lock it. I'm not looking at it. Oh it's down here. We'll show my screen too. See I was
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:21.440]   gonna show the so that's the Android look and now on my screen that's the iPhone look. So it is
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:26.800]   Android eyesing it. Yeah. I was on the 14 Pro. I have to admit that I was getting. I was
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:32.480]   I was so used to what a sleeping phone looks like that when I see like just looks like the
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:36.160]   regular lock screen I'm wondering oh should I be turning that off? Did I accidentally
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:41.280]   did accidentally turn off like a sleep time for this and yeah it's nice to it's nice to have a
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:45.920]   little communication of no it's not doing anything and there's nothing wrong. Oh this is hysterical.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:54.480]   I was just looking at the always on screen and I have a slideshow of Lisa and it's added some of
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:59.760]   the stable to I can't show you some of the stable diffusion pictures to my slideshow because I
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:04.160]   guess it's always updating it from pictures from my photo gallery and she's there. So that's good
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:09.520]   and I'm going to see AI Lisa every once in a while as well. Actually it's interesting because
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:15.360]   Lenza which I don't know if that's a pick of anybody this week. No it's not. Lenza which has
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:23.200]   become very popular as the generating avatars is starting to take some heat and I noticed this
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:30.800]   right away because I did myself first and they were great they were nice you know normal things
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:36.800]   and then I did Lisa and I can't show you those right they identified her.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:42.640]   A Wired magazine had a nice article about this about how it's about one of its female journalists
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:48.960]   about how it tends to come up with sexual hyper sexualized nudes stuff like that but also things
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:54.160]   like for it's it's optimized towards what it do. Did that a little bit for me? So I mean I think
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:23:00.000]   that's pretty sexy that's the that's the new Lea but nothing that's as bad as bad as it got.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.960]   Lisa well again I can't show you now I think. Exactly. I think they might have caught on because
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:11.440]   on Saturday I thought well let's try it again I had done this with Lisa on Thursday and it was
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:16.960]   pornified and so we did it with Kim Shaffer who does her phone answering and they took it it was
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:22.400]   absolutely not pornified so I think Lenza you could show these yeah he's asking me so these are
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:26.960]   all these are all and they're fine they're headshots you know they're cute there's some anime stuff
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:34.080]   and so forth but it's it's pretty straightforward so not a little sexy but not as completely
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:40.960]   pollingly sexy I showed we were at a work function when I did it and I showed I probably broke some
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:47.840]   rules I showed some of the employees how my wife looks according to Lenza they were what would
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:56.080]   you say John Ashley shocked shocked I plead the fifth so I think that they have the sponsors
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:00.960]   have not got out yet yeah yeah yeah I think that they have I honestly think they've toned it down
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:05.840]   they've immediately toned it down but it's there are also some problems where people
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:09.920]   people of color have noticed that like your skin has been lightened oh yeah and people who are not
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:14.880]   who are not white have been noticing that their features have been Caucasianized it's it's it's
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:20.400]   the same problem that works with law this generative AI that they're they're fed by content that they
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:25.920]   can find online and it is almost it basically creates a quote standard unquote image of a white
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:31.520]   white dudes are the are the standard glam of whatever you see most of in terms of how women
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:35.440]   are depicted that's what the standard is going to be and that's what the generative AI is going
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:41.040]   to create just what's trained that that's what it knows yeah so it's a hard thing and I understand
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:45.840]   I don't I don't completely blame Lenza they're using stable diffusion I will show you as my pick
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:51.920]   of the week where you can do it for free if the iPhone is apparently fast enough to do stable diffusion
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:58.080]   locally which is kind of amazing I think it did a pretty good job of of my pictures I'm starting
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:04.640]   to use these for for getting yourself isn't there like a pretty big cost for that for the so to
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:11.760]   subscribe to Lenza was 35 bucks a year and then you get half off on the avatars so I generated 200
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:16.800]   avatars for eight bucks it's not good right and I gave it you know that it's easy on your phone
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:20.480]   because you already have all your salt you keep showing please keep showing my beautiful pictures
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:27.680]   you have all your selfies already on the phone so it's easy to give it 20 shots
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:33.040]   a lot a lot of these are like Forbes magazine cover interview I know I love you you know I'm
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:40.000]   actually using this is my login shot instead of an emoji on my uh on my uh computer some of
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.600]   them I'm a little fat but that's okay some of them a little thin some of them I'm a little weird
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:50.960]   anyway uh I thought this was a lot of fun it was a lot of but I'll show you another way you could
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:58.880]   do this in a little bit but let's go on with 16.2 anything else new lock screen new um
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:06.720]   uh limitations for airdrop that's that everyone thing right which we talked about that that's
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:12.080]   the if you leave it on uh it'll turn itself off after 15 minutes so that you're not going to get
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:16.960]   unsolicited private parts pictures while you're on an airplane or something initially Apple had
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:21.440]   said they were going to do that next year so I wonder it's suddenly out maybe they maybe they
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:25.520]   maybe they may be there now I don't know slid it into that version I was sitting I watched the
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:31.200]   Giants game um last spring and I I had for some reason contextually like a couple days before I
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.200]   had to turn on airdrop for everyone and then I forgot to turn it off and I was sitting at a
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:42.480]   baseball game and somebody texted me a picture and I thought oh jeez or airdrop me a picture I thought
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:48.880]   oh jeez but it was great it was a picture of Dick Van Dyke and it said you just received an
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:56.320]   unsolicited dick pick and I thought that person is a genius and uh let me turn airdrop back off
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:00.080]   yeah now turn off everyone it's a good idea that was a good way to spread the word right like
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:05.600]   you should probably not have yeah except for everyone on a public event yeah it just shows just shows
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:09.600]   you how exciting a baseball game is that you know what I'm just going to randomly pry
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:16.800]   other people with Dick Van Dyke it's designed to give you time in between moments of action to
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:21.840]   to enjoy life have another beer and hot dog sends him to the pics you know you got plenty of many
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.480]   minutes between the innings and when there's a pitching change there's lots of opportunities
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:31.120]   there is all sorts of things you can do I think it's actually Dick Van Dyke's birthday today he's
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:39.200]   like 97 amazing happy birthday Dick Van Dyke hope I proofed a memory uh improved improved searches
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:45.600]   in messages this is cool allow you to find photos based on their content I guess photo i photos is
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:51.120]   already doing that so why not add it to the search and messages I'm always kind of amazed by that
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:55.840]   actually is is an i photos you can just earn photos you can just search for stuff I mean
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:01.920]   all these things and it's surprisingly good yeah yeah yeah find a topless pictures of Leo you know
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:07.760]   there's there's a few turn off hide IP address settings enables iCloud private relay users to
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:13.200]   temporarily disable the service for a specific site in Safari this is in response I think a lot
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:18.960]   of people are having trouble with iCloud private relay in certain situations in fact it's become
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:24.320]   almost a default now when people call the radio show to say hey try it without private relay turned
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:30.560]   on although it's a great service and and privacy is nice so now you can say specific sites yeah like
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:34.640]   they can know who I am news articles and weather display information relevant to the weather in
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:40.800]   that location participant cursors in notes allow you to see live indicators as others make updates
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:46.640]   in a shared note yeah you mentioned you know being able to share free form but notes is shareable
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:53.680]   too and I yeah it was Alex who said yeah everybody use notes don't you know it's a powerful tool I
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:59.920]   use notes with my with my wife to do to do shopping list I'll make a list I'll share it with her
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:06.320]   while I'm at Whole Foods she's like putting added new things over to Safeway and buy this thing
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:12.400]   crash detection optimizations I'm guessing that means you can ride the roller coaster now I'm
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:17.840]   just oh yeah there you go yeah and fixes an issue that causes some notes not to sync with iCloud
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:23.520]   after updates are made so the usual stuff but but some significant new features which I think is
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:30.080]   is interesting yeah I wonder what people can be using whiteboard for I like the fact that Apple
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:35.120]   didn't seem to overcomplicated it really is just that here's an infinite canvas that you can drop
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:40.640]   pretty much anything on and you can collaborate on it I can imagine how nice it would be to like
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:45.200]   just have a family whiteboard that's just not just a scrolling list of text and pictures that have
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:50.400]   been splattered in but people who are like putting in a picture and then adding notes and arrows circles
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:55.360]   and arrows and a paragraph on the back each one that could be an interesting thing that a lot of
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:58.880]   people could use not just for collaborative work but for just collaborative existing
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:08.080]   Mac OS 13.1 also shipping everything shipping as we figured that out freeform is in there
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:14.960]   what else what else have you been have you been using it Jason as a as a beta yeah I mean it's a
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:19.280]   super subtle data right there's only a few things that freeform is mostly what I spent my time with
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:24.320]   just to try it out and and think that it's kind of adorable and people should just give it a shot
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:29.840]   if they've worked with people who also have iPads especially or Macs it's a little tight on the phone
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:35.920]   right but on an iPad or a Mac it's it's uh it's pretty fun and yeah the other big thing is just that
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:40.400]   for people who really get creeped out by the always on display being so bright and full of
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:45.920]   information you can blank that out and just not have any fun and it's fine it's fine too but it's
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:51.440]   this is them clearing the decks with some long running projects like that the encryption stuff
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:56.320]   and just to get everything kind of reset for the new year so that they because they take they take
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:02.640]   time off around Christmas and so this is like their last last gasp and they'll start working on
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:08.560]   their spring release it's it's super nice uh for the employees to just say we're gonna sprint really
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:12.080]   hard we're gonna get it done before Christmas and then there's two weeks there's nothing really
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:18.080]   hanging over us until that's what I do I record all the best ofs record all the ads
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:22.480]   I still do office hours on Christmas do you really you gonna do it on Christmas
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:26.480]   no we don't yeah we don't stop we don't stop you should have a new year's party we used to do
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:31.280]   that remember uh why don't you do 24 hour new year's party in office hours oh i like doing things
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:36.800]   every day i don't we don't need to get crazy here i've done that practically killed this with this
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:42.320]   there was this podcasting company that did it 24/7 and it's really long that's what i learned
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:48.880]   it was really long and took a lot to do and i already i have an idea to do for 24/7 yeah it's like running
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:53.040]   a marathon it's terrible while you're doing it but when you're at done you go wow i feel good i i
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:57.520]   did it you know it's funny i i had fun i had fun doing it for an hour or two but i thought to myself
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:00.960]   i'm really glad i'm not doing and we've done streams for other people that have been 24 or
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:09.200]   48 or 72 hours and they're just grueling like it's just like the birds yep uh so besides uh free
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:16.080]   form uh and of course advanced data protection for iCloud coming to uh Mac OS ventura uh you also
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:21.840]   get that message search feature participant cursors and notes so you know who's doing what
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:27.120]   play sound and find my app can now help you pinpoint the location of nearby air tags airpad
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:35.120]   pro second generation case and find my network accessories fixes an issue this is all the same
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:44.080]   stuff pretty much yeah watch OS unified platforms yep yep uh i don't know what's the matter the
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:50.000]   matter stuff is in here too so like if you want to be a matter astronaut and start like embracing
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:56.160]   the future of home uh technology today you can update your to the new sort of matter savvy
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:01.040]   infrastructure mode of the home app but again like with the encryption thing you really need
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:07.920]   everything updated to the new OS's to in order to really take advantage of that feature ideal and
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:13.040]   that means like your apple tv and your home pods and your watch and you're like the all of the things
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:17.840]   i wonder do they have like they have champagne and a party when they push the button for this look at
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:24.720]   look at all the things they put out today iCloud for Windows 14 one Safari 16 to Monterey 1262 Monterey
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:36.000]   Big Sur 1172 TVOS 16 to watch OS 9 to iOS 1572 iPadOS 1572 iOS 16 to iPadOS 16 to so by the way
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:43.760]   yeah these are older versions are also being updated event or 13 one on iPhone 8 and layer 16.1.2 for iOS
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:52.240]   on Xcode 14 1 i hate it when they update Xcode oh as a scooter X points out too that this has
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:57.840]   some of those watch feature drops that they were uh promising before this is that mode
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:04.320]   that is the new low power mode for the ultra watch that is beyond the regular low power mode that
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:09.920]   was standard across all the watches and watch OS 9 so that's in here along with um it looks like
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:14.560]   some new uh running features they they made some promises about like later this year when they
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:19.440]   announced the apple watch and watch OS 9 and there were a few things that were kind of outstanding
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:24.480]   that have been rolled in there too so again all those later this year promises are kind of this
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:30.480]   is coming true now except for this classical music which they didn't that they said they were gonna do
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:36.720]   there's a couple that they didn't get to but mostly and completing the apple silicon transition
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:42.400]   where you know i think they got reasons but uh mostly stuff that they promised for the fall
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:47.760]   and the winter that they're clearing out now like like the apple watch stuff to just get it out
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:55.040]   be done with it move on hey look if google can put out the blobs playing bait hovin for the holidays
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:02.640]   you you can you can you can get your prime fonic back so you tap several times in your space bar
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:10.560]   this is from the google arts and culture program one two two do do do do do do there's some taps
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:16.240]   and now here's a sonata you can play this i'll turn it on sonata that matches my rhythm
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:26.000]   the sonata number 31 and a flat major opus 110 3a adagio manon tropo
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:32.160]   that's i mean you can play the full thing but that's what matched my rhythm isn't that wild
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:37.200]   we've been gone there we haven't seen a lot of ai music yet i think that that's the next
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:43.440]   stuff yeah i think right they did they've done gp now with text we've done art what's left
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:50.400]   play me enter the sandman in the style of oh oh that's gotta be around the corner
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:55.280]   all right i'll get to that in a little bit uh is that all the o_s is yeah that's everything
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:00.080]   we'll talk maybe in the next couple maybe next week we got the we got rich seagull for the 20th
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:03.920]   maybe when we come back new years you guys will have drawn some pretty stuff in free form we can
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:08.160]   talk more about that i'm i'm interested to play with it i draw things i don't know if i draw pretty
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:14.480]   things well set up a board we'll have a bawling we'll have an m&b board oh that's a good idea
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:20.720]   can you can you change the paper so i can have grid paper i can sort of know
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:26.480]   grid paper's the best i think you just talk a little dots on and off hide grid or show grid yeah
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:32.560]   well that's sort of a grid that's good enough that app is super 1.0 it's fun but i can think of like
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:38.480]   a thousand things i'd like it to do that it doesn't do but you know it's it's a start right it's you
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:43.440]   know if it works and it's reliable i think that's pretty good it's what it's what apple does better
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.200]   than almost anybody else is that we will start with something where you obviously know that
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:51.280]   there'll be more things to add and we'll slowly add them when we know that they work right like
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:54.880]   you know like it and it's like we'll just add this one thing and then and you're always hungry for
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:58.800]   those things by the time they add them almost always you know like you're always like it's but
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:03.520]   the problem you get with a lot of other platforms is they go now we're going to add 40 other things
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:08.960]   that will confuse you and will only work some of the time and apple's much better at at the let's
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:13.760]   just start slow and get it right and you know this is historically kind of tricky to do these
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:19.440]   are all objects you can move them around you can rotate them you can insert images this is this
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:26.720]   is pretty good you've got boy i mean this is like view look at this huge clip our library it's enormous
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:31.600]   look at that same library if you draw a circle and then hold your hold your will build a circle
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:39.200]   for you oh yeah let's see draw circle let's go maybe draw a circle and hold and hold okay no but
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:43.120]   it has a circle no it doesn't do that you know that doesn't do that i did i'm embarrassed to say
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:49.200]   that i just was note notes i suddenly realized that i could draw arrows and circles and squares by
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:55.760]   just simply drawing them i started drawing wiring diagrams in notes with just the little yeah it is
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:00.080]   surprising features in free form too you can do some like quick masking where if you drag a photo
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:06.320]   onto a shape it'll like lock to the shape and use it as a mask um a lot of the 3d shapes are
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:11.600]   actually you can take them apart and like pull pieces off of them they're multi multi object
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:16.800]   objects like there's a lot going on in there are they're using usdz inside of the no
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:20.240]   actually they're doing 3d objects are you do you have 3d objects and you can move around
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:25.280]   are there 3 objects well no they're they're like uh perspective shapes but the individual so
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:29.040]   they're all 2d but they're drawn in a perspective but anything like that this got multiple
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:35.760]   pull pains you can often drag the pieces of the shapes out part and and color them differently
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:41.200]   and stuff like that there's lots of weird stuff going on i mean and again it's 1.0 right like yeah
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:45.280]   the 3d object that you could rotate would be another thing that you could toss in there
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:52.160]   yeah down the road so this is great it's got little sticky notes yeah like i love the apples like
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:57.600]   this is not this is not like apple super complicated we've reinvented the way the working works right
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:02.240]   like that's not it it's like we've created a bunch of features a lot of which we had before
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:06.480]   some of which are new tossed them in an infinite canvas you can make as many as you want you can
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:11.200]   share them with other people they update in real time and if you want to talk or video chat or
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:16.000]   text while you're working on it it's all integrated using i mean i think that's where this came from
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.560]   is that literally they bought they brought um they were building all of those uh collaboration
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:24.640]   features and they they hit a brick wall where they're like oh what are we going to use
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:28.560]   uh it's like well we can use pages or we can use numbers and they're like hmm
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:34.240]   and then and they're like i know let's do uh let's take all of that stuff out of notes the drawing
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:39.840]   tools and dump a bunch of other stuff in and make a little sandbox and all the fonts
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:45.120]   yeah it's it's great to play with and like i'm glad that they did it and i hope they keep
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:50.480]   keep at it because it's fun yeah again not gonna change the world but uh i suspect
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:54.960]   it is going to provide that blank canvas that you know hopefully users will figure out like
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:00.800]   great uses for it and then that'll help drive and again people will put it probably has somewhere
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:05.840]   that you can add suggestions and so on so forth and you know apple it's funny i have like used
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:12.080]   that fit send feedback to apple for different apps and 99 and i sent a lot of them by the way
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:16.560]   like a couple like five or ten a week into the apps like i really wish it did this i really
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:22.160]   wish it and then once out of every 20 or 30 some team comes back to me and goes can you send us a
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:27.520]   file like you know i hit something soft like they're thinking about that and they go so the thing is
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:30.880]   is that with this thing they'll be you know you'll send feet you'll find somebody send feedback
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:36.320]   and feedback and feedback and occasionally you'll you know i think that they again they allow it to
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:42.080]   be organic they allow it to just kind of grow and we'll play with it and add features slowly so it's
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:47.120]   it's going to be fun yeah yeah so a lot of people who haven't filed a radar who should file a radar
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:51.840]   instead of going to twitter to complain which is which is very very healing for the soul but
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:55.600]   sometimes just file a radar say here's what here's what's happening here's what here's where i
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:59.760]   expected to happen here's what happened instead here's documentation it's fun i'm playing with it i
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:05.360]   can't stop all right uh i've made a new new album art for us how about that there do you think
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:14.240]   virus you have a virus it's got a lot of fonts and look it's you have send it back and bring
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:21.760]   to front i guess i mean i can add more notes all right i'm done i'm done moving on
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:30.800]   um apple says now i message can alert you if state-sponsored spies are eavesdropping
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:37.520]   the new ios and iCloud security initiative includes a new way for iMessage users is from
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:43.600]   uh the verge Mitchell Clark to verify that they're talking to the person they think they're talking
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:52.160]   to message contact key verification that's cool this is all part of the new security update you know
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:59.200]   in some ways well while apple sued the ns nso group i think that in many ways nso gave apple cover to
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:04.000]   tighten to suddenly start closing all these things down because it became clear that a lot of people
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.280]   are being looked at and especially people in the press was so they'll tend to say nice things because
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:13.600]   they're like hey i don't want to be spied on either and so here's a really good one i don't know if
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:19.040]   you could see this at the very bottom it says an unrecognized device may have been added to Jenny's
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:26.800]   account which is often the case with uh with spying right they're not cracking into your uh
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:32.320]   device they're cracking into your apple ID right and then sitting there and and either posing as you
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:39.280]   or listening to the conversation yeah so uh is uh Mitchell says well it's not exactly clear whether
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:43.760]   iMessage contact key verification will be able to help you if your phone has been completely taken
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:49.360]   over by advanced spyware although apples recently introduced extreme lockdown mode will help people
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:54.560]   who are targeted by those sorts of things it's definitely step up for people looking to use iMessage
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:59.200]   is iMessage for sensitive conversations is iMessage end to end encrypted not yet
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:05.040]   yes it is yes it's only the it's only the back it's always been ended and it's only the backups
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:09.440]   that are not encrypted unless you turn this on or don't do your iCloud back so if i've turned on
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:14.960]   advanced data protection oh look Jason just sent us a board yeah i did special mac break weekly
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:19.520]   board you weren't supposed to look at it during the okay it's fine yeah we'll we'll report back on
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:24.240]   our on our back break weekly and then i won't say anything but that's cool that's i won't open it
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:29.280]   dude what's that's cool and uh and maybe it'll say hey somebody else is in this board now
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:40.800]   uh apple is going to remove the gagging clauses from their contracts with employees from now on
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:50.080]   letting them for instance go to HR uh all uh any all gagging clauses related to workplace harassment
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:55.520]   are have been removed now this is the right thing to do obviously this is after
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:44:00.320]   an independent council found instances in which apple may have restricted employees from speaking
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:07.600]   out on sensitive issues related to discrimination and abuse so they have they've they've walked the
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:12.720]   walk as well as talk the talk and they're gonna pull those clauses out which is great and and it
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:18.000]   also helped the shareholders were there was a shareholder uh movement to basically make this
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.720]   sort of thing happen yeah i mean the way the way that the company treats labor is how you know
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:26.800]   what the character of the company is and so it's good to see at least a little bit of progress
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:32.240]   probably a little too late for scarlet but uh true uh better than you know what in a way she
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:40.080]   could say share scarlet uh who broke her non-disclosure uh to tell us what apple had done uh and and
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:45.600]   has lost her job i believe but she's appealing it um good for her because she she she made a
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:52.000]   difference by doing that she can she can claim victory uh tim cook is praised it's he's in
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:58.240]   he's in japan right now right visiting uh visiting sony praises sony for quote creating the world's
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:03.520]   leading camera sensor for the iphone i don't remember apple being too forth right about that in the
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:10.880]   past so it's a good on you apple good for you tim you might as well admit it we all know it all
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:16.320]   yeah i mean so that's that's what sony's business is all about right now like that definitely that
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:22.640]   definitely makes them happy uh to it it's it's there might have been something something along the lines of
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:28.560]   let's see we could give this great new hot sensor technology to you apple or we could give it to
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:34.320]   samsung gosh i don't know who i just we just don't know who we want to give it to right now if if
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:39.840]   only if only a company would be showing us the amount of love that they owe us where the most critical
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:46.240]   hard their hardware system here's the picture that he sent to a sony i mean to uh to sam sung
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:51.120]   saying see see how much they love us uh he tweeted i'm surprised he's still tweeting i didn't realize
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:55.440]   it we've been partnering with sony for over a decade to create the world's leading camera sensors for
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:59.920]   iphone thanks to kin and everyone on the team for showing me around the cutting edge facility
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:07.120]   in komomo today so that's nice tweeted that yesterday last night that's a good good picture
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:12.960]   probably taken with a sony camera i'm thinking i would hope so it'd be funny if we're
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:20.160]   sampling yeah uh apple's iphone 14 emergency sos feature now live in france germany ireland in the
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:27.360]   uk i've already heard from people who have used it uh with great effect i've talked to a number of
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:32.240]   people it's really exciting it's really good i'm very happy to hear that all right let's take one
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:37.920]   more break and then your picks of the week as we begin to wrap up this episode of mac break weekly
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:42.880]   our show today brought to you by an app you really got to have on your phone love this app
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:47.920]   called rocket money now you may know the app true bill and that's how i got first got to know
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:52.800]   this i have been using true bill for years uh it's now rocket money rocket board it they've
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:47:00.080]   improved it they've enhanced it it's still a great way to uh to see you know where your finances are
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:05.200]   to budget know how your net worth is going if you really want know how your stocks are doing
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:10.640]   you probably don't want uh but here's the best thing about rocket money and i love this thing and
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:15.600]   it's worked for me for years and i just love it subscriptions almost all of us are wasting money
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:21.600]   on subscriptions 80 percent of people have subscriptions they've forgotten about and worse we kind of
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:26.240]   assume rocket money to a survey we kind of assume oh yeah it's cost me about oh i don't know
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:30.480]   80 dollars a month i got about 80 dollars a month in subscriptions and then when people dig it's
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:36.320]   more like 200 or more a month on subscriptions here's the real problem a lot of those subscriptions
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:40.960]   are long forgotten you're not taking advantage of them uh you know if you're doing it on the
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:44.560]   iPhone it's easy to find the subscriptions through the apple store but we have many many other
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:50.000]   subscriptions rocket money formerly known as true bill makes it easy to cancel them easy to find
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:54.800]   them and then cancel them the rocket money app shows you all your subscriptions in one place is
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:48:00.720]   a recurring payment tab and if for one thing you'll find out if you have duplicates like i'm paying
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:06.560]   this twice i was doing that for one app uh you know and uh day one journal i love day one journal but
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:10.800]   i don't need to pay for it twice then cancels the subscriptions you don't want anymore let me say
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:17.760]   that again without leaving the app you cancel the subscriptions you don't want anymore that's awesome
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:23.840]   all you have to do is press cancel and rocket money takes care of the rest this is the personal
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:29.840]   finance app everyone should have on their device rocket money i you know it's great because i was
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:35.440]   using true bill for years and it's always been valuable uh it's how i cancel so many things that
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:40.400]   you know i just forgotten about or so every month i'll look at true bill or now rocket money and i'll
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:46.720]   see what's there and i it's it's really a great discipline uh and i was so pleased the the icon
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:51.200]   changed the name changed oh it's rocket money now because i've always loved rocket folks get rid of
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:56.640]   useless subscriptions and do a lot more with rocket money right now go to rocket money.com/
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:04.160]   Mac break it could save you hundreds a year it literally saves me thousands it last year i found
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:10.640]   something was costing me a lot of money got rid of it rocket money.com/macbreak cancel your
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:15.280]   unnecessary subscriptions actually i wish i'd had it but a couple of years ago i quit a gym
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:20.560]   stop paying the monthly to the gym but uh they said well the training fee separate you got a
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:24.560]   rate is renewed to cancel that and i didn't know it at the time and for six months i was paying
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:29.920]   for a trainer and a gym i don't have a membership to uh i wish i had rocket money back then it would
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:37.520]   have made it much easier uh i never did get that money back rocket money.com/macbreak you got money
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:43.280]   you're losing right now it's kind of seeping out of your bank account stop the leaks all right time
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:48.800]   for the picks of the week i will mention mine real quick just because we were talking about lensa
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:58.160]   and uh there is and Chris markwart showed me this uh on the radio show on sunday there's another one
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:04.320]   that is actually a full stable stable diffusion you can install on your iphone the iphone is fast
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:10.560]   enough to do stable diffusion it's called draw things it's open source so it's free draw.nnc.ai
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:17.200]   or you could just search for draw things on your uh on your uh in the abster here's the cool thing
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:21.840]   about it and if you can show my screen i'll show you real quickly um that there's a picture i did
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:28.240]   of us as maria but uh you can add your own model so this is the settings and if you've used stable
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:32.960]   diffusion you'll recognize all of these settings straight out of stable diffusion it comes with
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:41.440]   some generic models but you can download a whole bunch more anime cyberpunk 3d model dungeons and
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:48.560]   diffusion tron legacy open journey classic animation modern disney van goe style
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:54.640]   elden ring now i should point out i'm going to download paper cut in order to do the paper cut
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:51:03.440]   i'm going to download a 1.6 gig file they are giant they're ginormous uh these are checkpoint
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:07.920]   files if you've used stable diffusion diffusion you know exactly what's going on but that adds
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:14.000]   that capability and it's not mentally exclusive you can have more than one uh checkpoint on there so
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:21.040]   i have several right now and you can even use them uh it does the new stable diffusion 768 by 768
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:28.320]   which is great the only drawback to this compared to lensa lensa i did 200 images of me without any
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:33.680]   control at all i didn't do any prompting or anything in about 20 minutes this it takes a few minutes
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:39.440]   just to do one image because it's doing it all on the iphone and it's gonna kill your battery life
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:44.160]   so don't do it unless you're plugged in but it works and it's free so if you've wanted to play
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:48.720]   with stable diffusion uh certainly there are ways to do it on the mac now apple's even supported
[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:55.280]   it specifically by uh rewriting some of the pie torch routines for uh uh metal um
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:03.120]   you can do it on a mac you can do it on a iphone and it's fun draw things
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:10.160]   Andy and echo your pick of the week my pick is a really major update to one of my favorite
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:16.080]   writing apps called ulysses that a lot people are familiar with um when you look at my my heavy
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:20.160]   duty writing app has always been an app we've talked top up before called scrivener because
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:24.480]   for me it's very very good at managing projects where i'm not just sitting down to bang out 800
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:30.800]   words on x it's uh like all the all my scripts and research for uh what i talked about and done
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:37.760]   wgbh or all the final writing notes drafts and research i'm doing for a book all in one package
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:43.520]   and making it nice and nice and organized um the only problem with scrivener is that it doesn't
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:49.840]   have syncing really it has a workaround through dropbox so that maybe you can sync between the ipad
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:55.760]   version and your mac version and even so the ipad version is ambitious but it's not quite the same
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:01.600]   thing ulysses has always been sort of like a flat file sort of text editor but with impeccable
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:07.120]   user interface on the on the mac uh on the iphone and on the ipad and also because it was just
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:12.320]   using folders of text files impeccable syncing between the three wasn't as sophisticated as
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:17.440]   scrivener but it was again impeccable and in uh i don't know what device i'm going to be picking
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:22.080]   up to you to edit this with but i want to edit with this right now now with ulysses 29 which is
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:27.200]   being released this week they've added support for projects now where you don't it's not just
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:31.760]   folders full of stuff you can actually define something as here is a project it's called
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:38.880]   wgbh show notes and now it's a much makes it much much much much easier to to use these complex
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:44.320]   research and writing and creative projects and organize them within ulysses and you still get
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:49.520]   that wonderful uh syncing process you still get those wonderful same experience across all apps
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:55.360]   including including the iphone it has additional features uh like that i like about scrivener where
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:54:00.720]   i can be writing thousands of words in a very simplified distraction free editor but then when
[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:05.760]   it's time to publish i can say take these eight sections and compile them into a fancy looking
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:10.320]   word document and we'll compile into a fancy looking word document you can set project deadlines
[01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:16.560]   you can set uh goalposts word counts grammar checking all this sort of stuff it really has now gone
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:22.800]   to the point where it really is a challenger for what scrivener used to be kind of alone front and
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:28.640]   center at and now i think i kind of have to start to see if ulysses can do the same job as scrivener did
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:34.400]   because again it's such a pain in the butt too for all intents and purposes i can only use scrivener
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:40.800]   on my macbook i can't it's sinking is just so cumbersome and so unreliable in my head that i just don't
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:45.760]   trust it where i see lissey's i've been sinking for years and years and years uh so and it's a it's
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:51.920]   one of those venerable old apps a really good mac uh an apple oriented uh coathouse and that's not
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:56.800]   expensive it's a subscription based uh forty dollars a year or six dollars a month uh you can download
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:01.440]   it and try it out for free uh and it's one of those apps i'm very very happy to keep supporting because
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:05.520]   i want to look this is this is the payback for a subscription model they could actually afford
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:10.320]   to keep developing it and keep expanding what it can do uh like we were talking about earlier with
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:14.640]   apple products instead of putting everything into the first version and some of these features
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:18.800]   don't really work very well it started out as a very very simple distraction free text editor
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:22.800]   they added really good sinking they added this the add that and now they're at a point where
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:27.520]   it can be competing with an app that i've been relying on for over 10 years now so
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:35.200]   uh ulysses 29 go to ulysses.app you can go through the app store or you can download it and sideload it
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:40.240]   so to speak so pick your allegiance that way i actually net now that you mentioned that i also
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:45.520]   want to mention uh that i got an email from daniel jalkaute who is the great uh developer
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:49.920]   redsetter software we used to be at apple uh does a number of apps we like a lot he's just
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:55.760]   updated marset at five so write your next blog post in ulysses and now you can publish it in
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:56:02.080]   marset markdown markdown styling in marset at five yeah yeah day i love daniel you i think it was
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:07.760]   jason who told me about black ink his crossword puzzle uh app which is absolutely the crossword
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:12.800]   puzzle app and i've used his fast scripts for a long time which put scripts in your menu bar and
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:17.600]   and so forth so he's doing good stuff thank you janiel daniel for sending me that out so we knew
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:23.600]   that marset at five big update is now out and i have just finished the generation of a paper cut
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:31.280]   portrait of lisa with stable diffusion and i'm not sure i want to send her that but uh
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:33.760]   paper cut lisa is done
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:39.200]   you're uh you're pick of the week uh alex lindsey
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:42.560]   so to to continue with the ai
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:44.400]   bore ai
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:48.240]   this hasn't this has only been out for a little while so we'll talk about it uh
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:52.240]   a lot of people are talking about it but chat gpt is pretty amazing oh my god it's both amazing
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:57.440]   and frightening all at the same time um i'd like to show you one of the um one of the things that i
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:04.080]   experimented with is it was raining the other day and i just said i want you i said make uh what was
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:10.080]   it um give me a recipe for a rainy day soup oh that's what i asked for wow there it is there it is i
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:15.280]   made it oh yum you made it i made it a nice job buddy and here's the thing what is the
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:20.240]   squash soup it's like a chicken it's like a chicken it's some version of a it like chapped
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:25.280]   chat gpt does it's it's just some reasonably good version of something you know and i actually looked
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:30.880]   up uh tomato soup and it actually is my exact recipe so it's it's it's getting these from somewhere
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:35.120]   it's not making them up at a ball here the thing is is that it it is but it's it's changing the words
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:42.240]   at least because i uh i actually um searched for all the terms like the the different steps and i
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:47.760]   couldn't find them anywhere oh i couldn't find a one-to-one job it didn't find it made something i don't
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:53.200]   know how it makes it up but but it and i admit i add i i tune the spices up a little bit because i was
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:58.320]   like uh you can buy the way you can buy the way um mica told me this after you give it the soup recipe
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:03.120]   you could say how could i make that spicier or more festive you can actually add to the rest of
[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:09.200]   have gpt do that add to the rest of me and what what's interesting about it is and everybody
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:13.040]   should look at it right now because it's free it won't be free forever no um so it's in a test so
[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:17.440]   you should you should play with it it breaks all the time because too many people are using it um
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:24.160]   it is you need to understand what's coming like you just have to as a user like play with it
[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:28.720]   understand like you know if you're talking about it or even thinking about it you have to open this
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:34.400]   app and you have to look at the kind of responses that it's giving because uh you know i had we
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:39.280]   and on another list that i'm on someone said well i work in mia mia's this really high-end 3d software
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:47.120]   that that is used in film and he said i asked it to write an exporter a python exporter to export
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:53.520]   3d fahals out of mia and he goes wrote it and wrote the code to do that thing you know and and he had
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:58.400]   said i had to tweak it so as an advanced programmer i could see oh i got to change this one little thing
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:03.200]   um i've been talking to other programmers and that's what's really interesting is they're finding
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:08.000]   that they're brainstorming with it like write me the code to do this thing in this language and it
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:11.760]   writes it and they go oh i didn't think of it that way now they don't necessarily use the right
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:17.520]   and same way i use mid-journey is i'll brainstorm mid-journey like oh just do a logo like this or do
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:22.480]   an image like this i won't use the images it just gets me gets my juices flowing and thinking about
[01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:26.720]   something and but their programmers are using this but eventually it's going to be doing lots of low
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:32.720]   level programming um and but i find it fascinating like you could say write a i asked it i just asked
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:38.720]   it recently to write a haiku here's this is what it what it actually um what it actually looks like
[01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:44.000]   right so this is i'm doing a recipe generated by alton brown go ahead you do the haiku right
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:49.520]   a haiku about mac break it's not very good let's read it let's hear it
[01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:56.480]   a break falls gently on the keyboard below it silenced and crisp but it's it's it's a haiku yeah
[01:59:56.480 --> 02:00:02.480]   yeah haiku no it but i i do i do ones like um uh right uh i like for some reason it does
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:08.000]   like it is really usually really well about um security let's see what it says here so it'll
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:12.480]   take a little time and we'll go do do do do and sometimes it'll break and stay a long way too busy
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:19.040]   to do this um uh but it's what's it's very slow right now yeah in the still of the night security
[02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:24.240]   guards watching weight protection from harm anyway it's just a funny i find it to be um
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:31.200]   uh fascinating you know and and again there's all kinds of problems you know like the one of the
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:35.120]   things that we started talking about around programming is oh if it does all the low level
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:40.000]   programming that and then you still need programmers to like look through the code and the thing that
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.320]   came up with is if it does all the low level programming how does anyone ever become an advanced
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:49.280]   programmer because you're cutting out all of the practice anymore because it'll just do it you know
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:55.200]   instead of having a junior programmer or an apprentice programmer write it so there's there are lots of
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:01:00.000]   you know structural issues that are going to arise but i think that while it's free
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:05.040]   well you can just kind of use it and try to find the time that it's actually working um you should
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:09.600]   look at it because you know this is going to be really interesting and on the plus side of it
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:19.040]   is we're barreling towards a place where many people can create things from their imagination
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:24.720]   without the skill to generate it you know like they don't i don't know how to draw like what i
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:29.520]   love about mid journeys i'm not a great i can create 3d objects and i can create great texture
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:34.400]   maps i'm not necessarily a hand a guy that can hand draw a lot of things but i can
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:39.040]   create things that i really enjoy looking at and and as it gets better and when i can say well give
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:43.360]   me a little bit more of this and give me a little bit more of that um i think it's you know we're
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:49.360]   going to get to a point where we can you know put things into the world uh that are coming directly
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:55.040]   from our mind to the you know to the ground you know and um i think that that's a fascinating
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:01.040]   it's a little scary but also really empowering for a lot of people to be able to just show what
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:04.480]   they want to show you know in those areas and i think that that's going to be really interesting
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:08.720]   and um and i'm thinking of starting a youtube channel that's just recipes that we just cook
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:13.280]   and talk about what they're worth now see this now this i i have to i have to i have to
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:18.240]   interject here you have an artificial intelligence and we're worried about ai taking over the world
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:23.680]   and getting rid of us it's basically saying here the ai saying cook this and eat it and you're just
[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:28.960]   gonna do that that might not be a good idea i haven't asked it to like i'm even more concerned
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:32.720]   if i said you know give me something that will blow up or something like that that would be more
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:37.760]   frightening and it does have some some pretty good uh rails you know unlike what you can ask it to
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:43.680]   do is is oh i can't i can't do that or i asked it what would a jame bon villain be like in 1865 and
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:49.520]   it was like well james bon wasn't alive in 1865 but i'm sure new or i'm i'm sure that yes james bon was
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:55.760]   wasn't you know the first book was in 1952 he wouldn't have been around in 1865 he uh he but but
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:01.360]   i'm sure he the villain would have been ruthless very intelligent and and really push jay's bond
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:05.360]   to the like it was it was really interesting like you can also get around it there people have done
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:10.160]   jail breaks if you you know there's certain way techniques you can use to get around it's uh it's
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:16.320]   yeah guardrails very it's been very interesting it really is slow now and i and they got the head of
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:23.120]   open ai uh said that the uh the cost of running these servers was i water i wateringly high so
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:28.000]   before they said yeah it's gonna get it's gonna cost money just like all these other ones have
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:32.160]   cost it you know begin to cost money but but take advantage of when you can like at the moment this
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:38.960]   is gonna be and and i guess one of the i prompt is about 10 times the energy cost of a google search
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:43.520]   they said there you go well and and the the interesting thing is though is that one of the
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:46.960]   things i use it for now is when i'm trying to explain things and on office hours of course we're
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:52.560]   doing q&a all the time i oftentimes find myself thrown it in like how would because what it's
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:58.640]   really good at is concise and generally right on and i look at it and i'll go well that's not how
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:03.600]   i would say it but it go oh that's an interesting way to kind of make it short and explain what that
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:08.880]   is so it's it's something that i um again as a as kind of an assistant it's working really well i
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:14.400]   wouldn't i wouldn't take any of it and like put it into my term paper but but i but but if you
[02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:19.360]   want to research something it's really interesting because it's way better than it's way worse and
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:22.800]   way better than google like google you're gonna see lots of references to lots of things if you
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:26.800]   just want to explain something for you to think about um especially if you want to define something
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:31.280]   you're watching a tv show or listening to something they tell me what eotf is and it'll explain that
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:36.080]   it's electronic optical transfer function and how does that relate to gammon it's as well gammon's
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:42.160]   kind of connected to that somebody posted on uh reddit the chat gpt was the first to be able to
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:47.840]   explain in a way he could understand what if camera aperture and how it worked uh and it
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:52.240]   boasted it was a quite it was a very good at technical explanation there is a problem though
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:58.560]   that uh it sounds very authoritative and occasionally wrong stuff will be in there like
[02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:03.120]   a lot of aluminum foil in your soup and so you really should be in the wall
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:09.200]   it's a fun experiment i felt like food was pretty safe but i know before you do it yeah i definitely
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:13.920]   wouldn't take medical advice from you know and you know and but i but i do find and there's lots of
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:19.600]   errors like i find lots of but you know the funny thing was is i was someone said well it's it's
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:23.760]   gonna be it's the worst kind of thing because it's gonna be authoritative but anybody who knows
[02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:27.680]   anything about the subject will know that it's that it's off and i was like yeah like everything
[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:31.120]   i read in the newspaper like anything i read in the newspaper though someone who talks about something
[02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:35.520]   i know i'm like that is not at all what it's like you know like you know or that's not at all what
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:40.480]   happened and so i don't think it's any different than than someone who doesn't know what they're
[02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:45.440]   writing about writing about it so that's what that's it is what it ends up generating is basically
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:50.880]   it's like a uh an essay from somebody who is BSing their way through their college paper right
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:56.000]   right it's like it's it might be right but it might be completely wrong but it sounds right yeah sounds
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:03.520]   it's like it's it's like if i if i had to if i had to write an essay on uh how crabs and lobsters
[02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:09.520]   evolved and i needed to do it in an hour i would do amazingly frenetic web searches and then i would
[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:15.040]   just sort of sort of try to simulate what i found in these web searches and if i and if the original
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:19.840]   web search the the article was wrong i wouldn't get that but i might i might walk in i might throw
[02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:23.680]   in a line about actually and actually lina and actually lina and her da Vinci had have had a very
[02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:28.400]   very strong hand in the future direction of the lobster only because i dimly remember that one
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:33.200]   of the articles mentioned lina out of da Vinci's like artwork later on that something was inspired
[02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:40.640]   by the design of a crab that's the way to understand it it it mimics like so much of ai it it it's
[02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:47.920]   because it's designed it's it because it's designed to uh uh assimilate how humans speech speak and
[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:53.680]   re assimilated it allows us it hooks into our own mental software about what it's like when we're
[02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:58.560]   chatting with a real human being or when we are reading something that we knew a human being is
[02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:04.800]   created we're looking for logic we're looking for uh the point of we're trying to inherently
[02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:09.120]   trying to understand that was the point of view uh and the opinions of the person who's writing it
[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:12.880]   and that can really short circuit our brains when it turns off that no there is no point of view
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:18.160]   there is no opinion here there is no well it's it's just it's just basically making noises with
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:22.880]   the smells yeah it's it's like with mid-journey can't mid-journey can't do hands like it almost
[02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:27.120]   never do hands because it doesn't it doesn't know what hands are and in the same sense it doesn't
[02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:31.600]   do text like it like i'll say give me a logo and it'll just go everything's not like that and it'll
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:35.040]   and it'll and and someone and my daughter asked like why did you do that it's like because it
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:39.600]   doesn't know what the text is and it put a thing in there to do the thing you know it looks like text
[02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:45.280]   but it's not it's like but it's also like when you get it looks like a fact but it's not but it's
[02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:50.240]   like when you get chinese you go you go to japan and you'll see a bunch of letter american letters
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:55.440]   that just are fit together in a way that looks nice right you know on on a on a on a shirt right
[02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:59.360]   and they picked just because that that's a nice looking thing you know as opposed to that actually
[02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:04.320]   kind of is readable you know and so it's that's what it does it's it's anyway i i find it i went
[02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:09.600]   from not knowing what it was uh you know ten days ago to there's a window open on i have five windows
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:14.160]   here but there's a window open that has chat gpt and every time someone says something i'm like oh i
[02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:18.080]   wonder what chat i wonder what it would do with that the other thing that that where you get full
[02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:23.360]   circle is i put that i took that recipe and i posted it on this discord that i was on and someone grabbed
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:30.080]   the whole recipe and threw it into mid-journey just grabbed all the text copied it in and it made a
[02:08:30.080 --> 02:08:37.440]   picture that is very close to the picture i took of the finish soup i was like whoa okay now so now
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:42.320]   i'm now i've been asking chat gpt to describe something like describe this and then i copy and
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:47.040]   paste that into into mid-journey and mid-journey makes me picture it's really fun this is what
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:55.040]   this is scary this is what uh verso did uh with text uh of a picture of me and it looks like it's a
[02:08:55.040 --> 02:09:01.280]   movie poster but but but in what language i don't know and that's pretty that's pretty typical
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:07.120]   jason snell your pick of the week uh really quick because i feel like i would have picked free four
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:11.680]   more marz edit but we already covered those so it's uh i get the hat trick oh sorry we took all
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:16.160]   you good step away and i'm gonna throw in sports alerts which is actually an app i heard about from
[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:22.960]   my friend john grooper uh if you are using live activities in ios 16 or you have the dynamic island
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:28.000]   it's a free app it's got an app purchase but you can use a lot of it for free it's got a lot of
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:33.680]   sporting events you kick off a sporting event it displays as a live activity and keeps you up to
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:38.560]   date with the score so if you've wondered uh when is my favorite app gonna support scores you don't
[02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:42.640]   have to wait in the meantime maybe sports alerts will become your favorite app i don't know but
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:48.000]   that's the that's the killer feature is that it will uh use that live activities api is actually
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:54.960]   a mac or ipad or ipad mac i've had i phone and apple watch yeah yeah so it's for your i phone
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:58.480]   is it on the mac is that the best way to use it you think on the mac or you think the
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:02.800]   iphone because of the life of activities yeah you gotta use on the iphone that's that i mean i've
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:08.480]   got lots of ways to find sports scores on my mac but the the what you want is it yeah on the uh on the
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:14.480]   iphone nice sports alerts yeah if you're if you're just like hey this is the whole premise of live
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:18.960]   activities is i can put a sports score on my long screen yeah now you can get that nba score up
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:23.600]   every world cup score and this is nicely done it looks like it shows uh it shows things like um
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:27.760]   it'll still brackets and stuff i mean it's pretty good that looks pretty good there's a lot going
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:31.760]   on in there i could find out like what are the niners chances of clenching on thursday that kind
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:37.440]   of thing very exciting very exciting i'm gonna i'm getting it right now i can i wonder if it'll
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:42.800]   tell me what the stealers chances of clincher you know right now i think it's really easy Alex
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:49.360]   really easy for that one one percent still one percent like we've the eagles have already
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:54.720]   pledged why don't you just shift a little bit eastward and you could you know you could be a fan of
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:59.920]   the cardinals in one last night it would have been two percent oh those kernels that was a tough
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:05.440]   game last night believe Alex believes believe we're not used to it we haven't had a losing season
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:11.680]   like no i know like that time i don't know how to operate it's about time yeah sports alerts would
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:18.000]   like to send me notifications you bet you bet yeah yes in tini oh this is cool i could see all the
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:23.760]   week 15 games that's really great i like it thank you all three of you great picks
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:30.400]   we are uh we are on a roll here jesus snell he's uh he's doing all the good stuff at six colors
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:36.320]   dot com along with the dan moron and of course he and dan and others do many many podcasts
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:42.320]   so many podcasts so many uh the incomparable and so forth uh we always like to plug one what's
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:48.400]   your podcast of the week this week uh let's have a laugh check out robot or not on the incomparable
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:53.120]   the incomparable dot com slash robot where john sera kusa and i we it's not just about the robots
[02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:56.800]   anymore we talk about all sorts of stuff and what it means and what the definitions are and john
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:01.760]   has opinions and i sit there and listen to go mmm that's very interesting original concept like
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:06.400]   hot dog or not like we did we did a hundred episodes about whether something was a robot or not and
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:10.880]   then we've we've branched out since then to things like it's a hot dog a sandwich and stuff like that
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:15.360]   they're all very short it's like every episode's like four minutes long uh every other week we drop
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:21.040]   one that's funny and it's fun i wanted to do a podcast with my podcast called uh hills to die on
