[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.680]   It's time for Mac break weekly.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.280]   The show we get together with my favorite people and talk about Apple.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.960]   Our Apple gurus are in the house. No, John Prosser today.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.920]   Lori Gill is here, however.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.360]   She's she's she was smart enough not to not to believe him.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.280]   She was managing editor for iMore at Apple Hall.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.480]   Good to see you.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.920]   Good to be here.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.280]   Welcome also with us, Mr.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.480]   Annie and I co from WGBH Boston.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.760]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.880]   Hello, boy, am I steamed because I booked my airline tickets to be in my home.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.120]   I was certainly and now I had to eat that expense.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.400]   We thought that be a big announcement.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.800]   I'll get to that in a second.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.360]   We thought there'd be a big announcement today.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.120]   Also with us Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.960]   Hello, I'm sorry from YouTube.com/Renee Richie.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.720]   And occasionally I'm more.com.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.560]   You really know it's always going to be in my heart.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.560]   Yeah, you still do stuff.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.920]   So Prosser doubled down.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.280]   Double down, which was a mistake.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.360]   He had tweeted last week.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.760]   Remember in your and your tracker, what was the name of that?
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.320]   The tracker site you were talking about.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.240]   Apple track.org.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.440]   Apple track.org.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.600]   He's a 77% tipster, which is.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.120]   He's seven.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.480]   I think he's well, he's down now.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.280]   He's down a little bit now.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.200]   77.8% accurate.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.760]   And he tweeted last week for sure.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.960]   There would be an Apple event today sometime.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.520]   And this should have been a red flag between six and nine AM.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.320]   Well, he said a press release announcing the Apple Watch and the iPad would be today
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.200]   around nine AM Eastern.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.680]   Well, he's slowly narrowed in on that.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.200]   And he even said my sources of.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.960]   Here it is.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.600]   OK, guys, last tweet of the night.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.520]   This was yesterday.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.360]   658 PM.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.080]   My sources are not budging or changing your mind.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.680]   They're still telling me that Apple Watch and iPad are coming tomorrow via press
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.480]   release.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.120]   See you all in the morning to find out.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.320]   Is this so weird to me because like who would know that Apple was going to announce an
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.400]   iPad Air and Apple Watch event today, but not that it was just the event and not the
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.560]   products, but the event was going to be about those products.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.160]   Like that's a very narrow, we set theoretical union of knowledge and no knowledge.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.720]   Well, those people, whoever in that intersection are not going to be around much
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.200]   longer.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   That's the case.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.000]   It's that easy to narrow down.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.200]   We told half of you that it was going to be these products and half that was going to be an event,
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.360]   but nobody knew both.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.680]   So this is the this is the invitation.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.920]   Did you guys get one?
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.280]   I guess you must have, right?
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.720]   Yeah, I didn't, of course, but I don't exist in the world of Apple.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.320]   This says Apple event.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.240]   It's actually kind of cool because it's so it says Apple event.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.440]   Join us from Apple Park, September 15, 2020 next Tuesday, 10 AM Pacific.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.680]   So we will be streaming that coverage live.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.400]   Micah and I will do iOS today first, and then we'll we'll stream that coverage live
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.080]   right after and then we'll do Mac break weekly with your analysis right after that.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.520]   But what happens when you tap this, I'm loading the universal scene description package.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.360]   What happened?
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.760]   It was working earlier.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.640]   Let me do it again.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.680]   Tap.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.280]   Oh, it's broken using web objects.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.080]   What the hell?
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.600]   So it's so funny because I literally use this on this device.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Earlier today, but it's no longer working, but you get a an augmented reality
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.480]   version.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.080]   Oh, screw it.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.600]   You can go to the state brand new Twitter account and take a look at it.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.000]   Yes.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.360]   You want to see the is that a brand new account for him?
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.720]   Well, the account is all, but it's the first time he's used it.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.720]   Is that true?
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.720]   It's yeah, it's quite a flex.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.800]   His first tweet Greg J.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.200]   O.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.400]   Z or J.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.640]   Oh, yeah, it's Greg J.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.400]   O. Z.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.840]   He is, of course, going to be at this event because he is the replacement for
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.120]   the new SVP for marketing.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.360]   And here is his tweet demonstrating.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.480]   The beautiful graphics that I couldn't.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.120]   So that's the augmented reality.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.400]   It knows the shadows to even doing the little.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.320]   So it turns the illustration into the date 915.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.680]   And he's also kind of looks like an apple for a half a second to you.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.680]   Yeah, there's a level.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.320]   There's the apple.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.400]   I think it's supposed to be an apple.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.880]   Now, what is this tell?
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.600]   How do we do?
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.120]   How do we decipher this?
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.160]   The reviews he leaves?
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:24.000]   I love speculating on on invitation things, but I think this one is not as
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.240]   telling as we we'd like to pretend it to be.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.560]   I think it's just Apple is showing off augmented reality and that there's not
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.480]   going to be a product per se that is reflective of that other than, you know,
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.120]   the light our camera in a new iPad or something like that.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.680]   Rumor is, of course, the next generation Apple watch and an
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.680]   next generation iPad Air that looks a lot like an iPad Pro down to the type
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.880]   C connector on it.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.600]   That's that all seems credible.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.320]   That's rumor though.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.520]   There's two big questions here, though, Leo, because like we know that Apple
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.600]   marketing communications gives a gist, like they give the spec to the
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.680]   graphics design team.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.040]   The graphics design team does not know what's at the event.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.560]   Oh, the communications team, of course, does, but they just give them what
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.200]   they want to see.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.600]   And then the graphics design team makes it.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.720]   So there's no like direct Easter eggs.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.280]   It's just whatever the Markov's team tells them to make.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.840]   But time flies, you know, some people immediately think, Oh, that's a
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.560]   light our sensor.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.400]   But other thing, no, that's an Apple watch.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.960]   And something blue.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.720]   Oh, that means the new iPhone is blue, but it's too late to be that blue.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.400]   I mean, it's it's just all the way.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.120]   They must give them the verbiage though, right?
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.800]   So the time flies has to be coming from the people who know.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.880]   That's Markov's.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.640]   I don't know because also they will also also we're being played to a certain
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.040]   extent, because I'm sure that when they first start sending out these invites and
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.920]   they notice that my God, these idiots are actually like devoting all kinds of
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.080]   time and airtime to try to let's start to like sort of hype that up by putting
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.800]   little details so that people will definitely talk about this a lot more.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.480]   Like because I'm not I'm not setting myself aside from this.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.440]   I'm when I saw that especially when I saw the animation, I thought, Oh,
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.160]   listen, maybe it could be like a like air moving around and that could either
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.240]   indicate the iPad air or could indicate the new oxygen sensor, but
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.080]   a blacked sensor on the Apple watch.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.600]   But we just we just got through talking about like how the it's like if the moment
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.480]   that you start trying to like bank your reputation on predicting things that
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.280]   might or might not happen, it's like there's a rake right in the middle of an
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.040]   open field.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:27.880]   You found the rake.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.560]   You stepped on it.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.360]   You had the option of not swimming on it.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.200]   You decide, you know what?
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.920]   I'm just going to stomp right on that thing.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.560]   Then you backed up and you stepped right back in the same place.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.240]   So this vent we will cover.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.040]   John Prosser's score is going to go down a little bit.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.200]   I guess not really because he was a press release right in a way, right?
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.240]   It was it's yeah.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.080]   The whole thing is the way the culture is.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.680]   There was no there was no press release.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.600]   There was no press release and it didn't say and nothing about this
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.800]   invitation says necessarily watch her iPad.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.080]   So no, no, I think we're going to take a few points off his accuracy.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.480]   Although the big two is two clubs got told it was no iPhones.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.200]   Same way they usually get.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.320]   Well, that's what's interesting.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.240]   I'm looking at the nine to five Mac story, which originally said
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.440]   Apple officially announces iPhone 12 event.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.080]   In fact, you still see that in the slug because it's hard.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:23.280]   It's easy to change the title in the page, but the but the the slug in the URL
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.040]   still says Apple phone 12 event.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.440]   So do we agree it will not be an iPhone event that that's going to be in October?
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:30.880]   But I'm just kidding.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.200]   He's usually good at that stuff.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.560]   Like he he's usually one of the people who will say like no hardware at this event
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.560]   or Apple's not expecting this this year, you know, and he's got a pretty good track record.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.280]   He's not on Apple track, of course.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.160]   He's pretty good.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.880]   He's not funny.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.960]   He's not an Apple track.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.040]   No, I think they're more the the young hipster trendy leakers.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.040]   OK, he's he's at Buzzfeed news.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.800]   Does that mean that Buzzfeed is no longer?
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.560]   Yep.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.000]   Well, he was recode though.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.040]   So and that's where it started.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.240]   Like I think he was from the Walt Mossberg sort of generation or like the
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.360]   and the Andy and not co sort of generation of big papers that covered Apple and that Apple
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.560]   wanted those specific readers to understand key things about the event.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.960]   So the Wall Street Journal or recode or somebody would say those things or Bloomberg
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.120]   Bloomberg got that too because they want Bloomberg readers to know.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:22.240]   So Pachowski tweets September 15th, don't hold your breath for the new iPhone.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.920]   He also tweeted that's what your intestines look like after six months of lockdown.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.880]   Accurate.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.920]   I mean too much information.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.720]   I would I would I would oppose that if not for the fact that just 20 minutes ago,
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.880]   my lunch was a peanut butter sandwich and a pop tart.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.400]   Oh, dear.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.320]   I think it's a little bit of a pop tart in the sandwich.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.720]   Walt's fruit technically.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.080]   Oh, dear, dear, dear.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.600]   So instead of jelly, he used pop tart.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.920]   That's exciting.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.720]   I would do that.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.480]   If you don't have any pop tart, I mean, you don't have any jelly.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.960]   Put the pop tart on the peanut butter.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.160]   You think you leave the bread out too, for that matter, save yourself some time.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.200]   That's all right.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.680]   Great.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.520]   Like that.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.200]   It actually sounds very delicious.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.840]   Yeah, I'm usually a child would approve.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.800]   There you go.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.680]   Well, again, it was plated like like on the food network.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.440]   That's all it matters.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.520]   License into sections and sort of fan them out on the plate and sort of glue.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.360]   When you get back into the Nutella, just do the spot and then a little swish down.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.600]   Plating is everything.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.160]   It's all.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.560]   But yeah, I myself would be surprised if there was an iPhone announcement next week,
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.880]   chiefly because I've been there.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.440]   There's been really loud talk about how there were delays on the iPhone this year.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.880]   And so I would I would I would expect an event in October rather than November
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.880]   rather than September.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.960]   My accuracy rate, which by the way, according to Apple track.org is zero percent.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.360]   We've never been wrong.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.600]   I've never been right.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.600]   There you go.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.640]   My my here's an interesting one.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.120]   And I again, this is a tweet and I haven't verified it.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.440]   Somebody said, if you look at the metadata for the YouTube feed, which is
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.520]   already set up at Apple's YouTube account, the metadata says does say air.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.040]   I've had air Apple Watch, but it also says MacBook and iMac.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.440]   It says everything.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.480]   I went in and pulled all the keywords and it says everything.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.520]   It's a product that Apple makes.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.080]   Oh, OK.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.400]   Nevermind.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.520]   But the one thing that was interesting and the one reason that this was written
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.640]   about is that it says series six.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.600]   So all of the other things that are referenced are existing products.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.040]   The series six is not an existing product.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.680]   That's why it's kind of a big deal, but that's.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.640]   Well, that's well, that's what I have sources that I've sort of I may be breaking
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.480]   a confidence here, but they tell me that six comes after five.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.160]   I'm not I'm not hanging my reputation.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.160]   Let's say here's the here's the metadata.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.240]   It does say series five and then series six, but it also says iPad, iPad,
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.640]   Macbook, iMac, Macbook, pro fitness, wellness, illustration, Apple TV, digital art,
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.520]   AirPods, Apple event, Apple keynote, WWDC, which is clearly not September.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.080]   Apple special event.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.680]   Uh, yeah, you're right.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.920]   It just pretty much says everything.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.360]   I don't know if you can read anything into that.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.960]   Or again, I think I'm being totally serious here.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:17.520]   It's this is this is like code breaking in 1944 at this point where they they
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.120]   also know that people are going to take a look at the metadata.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:25.000]   They're going to take a look at the image size and the image exit information.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.360]   And I mean, we were we're websites are routinely breaking down the code of like
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:35.040]   pre release software to look for any mentions of hover phone.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.880]   Oh my God, I saw a string that says hover phone in the in the upcoming beta software.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:45.840]   It's this is what I hope that Apple is big enough that they can sort of they can sort
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.560]   of allow some of their engineers to say, you know what, it would be really, really
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:54.720]   funny if you basically got everybody chasing their own tails by sneaking a tiny, tiny
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.560]   little graphic of something with an Apple logo, but it's the size of, let's say, a
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.840]   one inch square piece of aluminum and with with a port on the side of it that no one
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.280]   has ever seen before, just put that somewhere in the binary and let's just see them chasing
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:08.840]   our own tails.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.680]   They screwed with with a german for a while when he was looking for the strings for
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.320]   new Apple devices, like iPad, one comma seven and things and they started putting out
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:16.880]   landish.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.560]   I don't think they went as far as like 12 comma hamburger or anything like that.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.640]   They started putting out landish numbers in there as sort of like a wink and a
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.360]   nudge that they knew that people were in there.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.800]   Um, tags?
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.560]   That feels like I don't need any.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.320]   I don't know why.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.160]   Yeah, especially like that that would be a feature that they could, you know, like a
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.480]   pro of hardware product that they could announce as part of a feature that took
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.600]   home with a new iPhone 12.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.520]   That seems like that they go hand in hand.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:50.680]   Uh, is he a seems like a two hour event because the calendar invitation says two
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.400]   hours and two hours seems long for Apple Watch, even Apple Watch six Apple Watch
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.480]   SE and iPad.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.720]   So either it's not two hours and that's just the standard calendar invitation
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:07.040]   length they put out or there may be there's some peripherals, but those all feel like
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.640]   if it's AirPods over the ear AirPods, all that stuff feels like iPhone event stuff.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.640]   Absolutely.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.480]   Max.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.360]   Sorry.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.200]   Double pinder asks and I think it's a fair question.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.000]   Why wouldn't they announce the iPhone next week?
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.320]   That's the normal time.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:22.880]   Not ready.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.920]   This is not ready.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.280]   It's a COVID thing.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.680]   You don't want four weeks.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.120]   Well, yeah, I mean, lock down all those things.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.720]   Yeah, it's it's apparently, I think Apple announced it's it's a few weeks behind,
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.240]   which is like two to four weeks in Apple Financial Parlance and that would move
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.240]   it from end of September to beginning of October.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.840]   And if the event was at the end of September, I think that'd be fine.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.840]   Like they could say they had they did have a three week gap one year between.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.840]   They usually have two weeks.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.520]   They could have a three week gap one year, but I think a four week, five week gap.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.320]   That's too much for them.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.080]   They'd much rather do.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.640]   Although we just think there will be a long gap between the iPhone 12 pro.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.920]   That'll be even longer.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:03.280]   Changing.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.600]   It was not the pro this week.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.320]   Digitime said it was the six point one inch iPhones would come first and then the
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.800]   five point four and six point seven inch and I I broke first.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.240]   And I think I'm so less expensive.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.760]   50 times, but it's just right.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.520]   Bonker.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.360]   What do you think Laurie?
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.440]   So give us Laurie, give us your timeline.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.680]   Well, yeah.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:28.040]   So it would make sense for Apple to announce and launch their their iPhone, the new iPhone lineup.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:33.720]   There there would be one model or one, you know, size that would be available soon.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.520]   And that's why they're postponing until October for an event at all.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:46.680]   So I was thinking and again, the digit times if they're right on this, I'm wrong, but I was thinking that the iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:51.760]   Max trying to remember the names of these would be announced first.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:17:06.640]   So that would be the four point five inch iPhone and then the six point one inch iPhone, not the pros and that later in the year as possibly as late as November, we would see the pro models or the pro max models, maybe even in three stages.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.320]   So they have three events.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.320]   It wouldn't be events.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:28.120]   So in this case, it would be they would they would have an event in October, knowing that the earliest they could get any phone out would be maybe a week or two after that event, but also knowing that there would be some phones that would come as late as October or late as November, which there's a precedent for that because that's what happened with the 10.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:28.840]   They have phone 10.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:38.440]   They were announced in September and didn't come out until late October. So there, but there were other iPhones available shortly after the event took place.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:51.160]   So I think one postpone the event long enough that they can get one model of iPhone out fairly quickly, but also make it so that when the next iPhone that's available comes out, it's not two months later.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.720]   It's more like a month later or three weeks later.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:04.360]   So to a week from today, iPad Air watch, maybe tags? No, maybe not because that might be for a later event.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:09.880]   And then when in October, early, early October, probably, right?
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.320]   There'd be an iPhone event, maybe one month, exactly.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.000]   So October.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:20.720]   First, first or second week in October, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say as late as like actual mid October.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.480]   I feel like, you know, 15th of October might be a little bit late.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.720]   It might be sooner than that.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:30.440]   That's my guess on October or the 6th, 13th, 20th and 27th.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.920]   So maybe the six or the 13th.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.800]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.720]   The 60 even seems a little early.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.280]   That's the 13th.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.560]   Maybe the 13th.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:46.560]   And that would be iPhones with some available in a week or two and some available, maybe in a few weeks like they did with the iPhone 10 and.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:53.480]   When now, we know that they're going to also announce Apple Silicon sometime this year.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.240]   Would that be at one of these events?
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:02.120]   So that would have been if you think of a traditional year, a Mac event would normally take place in October.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:12.320]   So this not being a typical year and knowing that we're getting Apple Silicon, that does change things because Apple Silicon could come as late as.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.240]   December 31st, 31st, and that we still count as this year.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.160]   The trash can Mac Pro.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.280]   They announced it in the fall, but it wasn't available to come out.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.080]   You couldn't get it until early January.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:34.240]   Yeah. So my guess is that we are not going to see an Apple Silicon Mac in at the iPhone 12 event.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:39.560]   I think that's still going to be postponed a little bit longer and it may get its own special event in November.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.040]   That would be a third. Yeah.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.640]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   I agree 100% not because this is it's not well because you think about what they have to achieve with each one of these.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.280]   Quote, now we're using air quotes events.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:20:03.560]   In the case of Apple Silicon, they not only with the with the iPhone 12, what they're trying to do is get people excited about replacing their phones with the new shiny shiny with the Apple Watch.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:09.800]   They're trying to they're going to have to talk about here are some new some new health health features that we have.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.760]   Here's how they work.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.840]   Here's how they've been certified.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.840]   Here's how well they work.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:23.560]   Apple Silicon is going to be a totally different sort of thing where they have to walk people through exactly why you should not even not be not be wary of it, but you should be excited about it.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:34.520]   They have to talk all about how they how they didn't just take iOS and excuse me, they didn't just port Mac OS over to iPhone hardware and iPad hardware.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:39.640]   They built a custom chip and here are the things that we did to make it the best Mac OS CPU ever.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.000]   So this is why I really think that that's going to be a standalone event.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.680]   If there's anything else tacked onto it, it'll be something very, very simple.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:57.560]   Like they might decide that if again, Apple tags, if they if they haven't announced it, then it's a way to say, Oh, but it's a way to announce the most time when everyone's going to be taking a look at it.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.280]   But this is going to be a big major event because this really is like trying.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.320]   This is almost like a campaign that they have to launch here.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:12.440]   They have to convince people that this is there's not not only is there nothing to worry about, there's everything to be excited about with this new CPU.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.400]   It's absolutely the case that Apple tags are just a feature, really.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.920]   And so they could be announced at any time, probably around the iPhone.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:32.640]   So and actually the least important thing of all the things they'll be announcing this fall, it would be a new air iPad air or even a new series six Apple watch those the iPhone and the max Apple Silicon.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.440]   Those are I agree with you, Andy.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.640]   Those are tent posts.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.440]   You're going to have as much of an event as you can for those two things.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:45.920]   The watch though has like a very iPod like position position now where, or maybe not even because it's not near saturation.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:56.000]   The iPhone is in a hugely competitive near saturated market where you know, you really got to put on a show to get people to buy them where the Apple watch the market is nowhere nearly saturated.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.440]   They're not really targeting up.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:03.560]   They're not really targeting people who never bought one and they have huge holiday sales spikes.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:24.360]   So the more like just giving camera time to the Apple watch really helps with the wearables segment and if they have the new health features, like if they have the blood oxygen sensor, that's something where you want like the vice president of health, some will decide up there to talk about blood oxygen levels and sleep tracking and exercise tracking maybe for COVID and that all is.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.840]   So watch is important too.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.880]   Yeah, it behooves having that sort of airtime.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.880]   I don't know what to call it.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.160]   It's not stage time anymore.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.200]   I can't take 2020.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.120]   Apple's got it.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:40.040]   Apple's really, I mean, of all the tech companies out there, they have a lot to show this fall.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.600]   A lot of new stuff.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.800]   And there is a reason to have an event for a lot of it.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.800]   Yeah, Android 11 just dropped today.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:55.560]   So there's I think that all these companies, they try not to get too bunched up because there's only so much attention that could be devoted to anything.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   One thing, right.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.200]   And Samsung had two events, right?
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:03.520]   Like they had the Galaxy Note event, then they had part two for the full one after the other one, one month apart.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.360]   So and that was just for two different phones.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.880]   I mean, Apple's got four or maybe even five models and there's no logistics.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.800]   Like no one's traveling.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.600]   It's much easier like to just whip it.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:21.840]   I'm not saying it's not easier, but I mean, it's more logistically feasible to do micro events than it would be to do real world events.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.120]   Right.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.680]   Well, it's going to be a busy couple of months for us.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.880]   Yeah, I guess, right.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.440]   But I'll see what else do we have to do?
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.920]   Exactly.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.800]   Exactly.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.880]   If we're not get the Rona.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.040]   OK, anything else to say about these events?
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.360]   The only thing we know for sure.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:48.440]   I always want to because there's so much rumor smog that the one thing we can see clearly is that in a week from today, they'll be an event.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.360]   Yes, that's all we really know.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.760]   And we'll see what they have.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.760]   And it's from Apple Park.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.120]   Is there no disincentive to spread these out?
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.280]   Isn't there some incentive?
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:01.880]   You get diminishing returns right with getting people's attention or do you?
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:07.720]   I mean, I think we have one big event than three small women.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.640]   No wonder woman.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.880]   There's no black widow.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.280]   I give you as many people.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.040]   You can people are desperate for entertainment.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.080]   Now of all times would be the time to have three minutes.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.920]   Maybe speaking of entertainment here, there's a post on I saw it first out on Reddit.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:28.520]   Then I saw it on Mac rumors that someone claims to have seen an Apple Watch prototype in a security case that looks like an iPod nano.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.760]   And that would fool anybody.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.880]   Well, but let's use it like sort of in the palm of your hand.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:41.560]   But the thing is, but the thing is, it reminds me that if someone wants to make that kind of that kind of a case, I'd be so into it.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.680]   So something with a lanyard on it so that I couldn't necessarily like drop or lose it.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.120]   How do you solve the other?
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.120]   How do you solve the other case?
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.760]   How do you solve the authentication issue?
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:55.600]   Because the theory when you unlock it and it's on your wrist, it's unlocked until it goes off your wrist.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.040]   I presume that's some sort of.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.240]   You just have to disable that.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.120]   That's some sort of capacitive thing, right?
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.040]   Well, disable it.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:01.760]   You disable it.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.520]   But also you can turn off.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.320]   You can turn off passcode.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.200]   You can.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.920]   No, but you can't use Apple Pay or anything like that.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.720]   If it's not right, that's correct.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.880]   It's got to it's it's not passcode.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.840]   It's I unlocked it because I looked at my phone in the face, unlocked it.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.720]   But if I take it off my wrist, it's going to be locked with or without a passcode.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.480]   I could use a passcode to unlock it, but it's somehow saying that is now
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.200]   securely attached to my identity.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.400]   Like flavor.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.400]   If you wear it on your chest, it'll take a hard touch skin.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:32.840]   But I'm not.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.480]   Does that.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:38.800]   So I'm like, I'm so shocked that you went with a flavor, flavor, reference and not a Tony Stark reference.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.800]   Like you have it like right on your chest.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.240]   I get it.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.200]   Look at the EKG.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.120]   You'll get the things like that.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.200]   But in this kind of use case, though, in this kind of use case, though, I'm talking about, obviously,
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.920]   and you're also not using the heart rate monitor.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.200]   But if this were not if this were a standalone device, I would say, no, what's the point?
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:26:00.920]   But if it were like a $40, $30 really well made case, I could see so many so many incidents in which I would be.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:06.480]   I actually want to wear like a fancier address, your style watch, but I still want to
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:11.320]   essentially I still want to get like notified about things without having to pick up my phone.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.000]   I still maybe want to still have a gigabyte of music to play.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.280]   I'm saying for as a $30 thing that even if it were something that I would use the hell out of for two weeks and then forget about,
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.120]   I would be so excited to get a case like that.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.360]   There's a guy named Apple demo on Twitter who created a kind of a 3D printed prototype.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.280]   Was something like that?
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.640]   Yeah, not really.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.600]   So what do you do?
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.720]   You put a little sponge in the back and get it wet with your sweat.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.200]   I mean, how do you how do you make it work?
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:48.360]   Well, so I have a friend who purposefully she she disables the passcode to unlock the Apple watch.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.680]   She just wears it around a wrist.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:56.520]   She just doesn't like the feeling of having a wrist so tight, a watch so tightly wrapped on her wrist.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.840]   That's just her fashion sense.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.440]   How does she unlock it?
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.320]   And she just doesn't use Apple Pay.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:05.280]   She doesn't use the things that you that have that require it to be stuck to your wrist for.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.040]   She still loves her Apple watch.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.600]   She just those are that's how she chooses to do it.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.520]   So I feel like it's some for some people.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.520]   It'll work.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:16.360]   They just don't use the other features that you would need for that kind of thing.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.280]   So mine's locked because I took it off my wrist.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:24.560]   Now I have a passcode, but if I don't enter the passcode, it just shows nothing.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:29.360]   It just shows I mean shows the time and it doesn't show my calendar because I can't see that.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.960]   You couldn't see notifications.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.160]   It's a watch.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.000]   You just want to, you know.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.760]   OK, OK, that seems like a lot to pay for something that's non functioning.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.360]   Is there any way to disable that?
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.400]   I don't think there is.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.160]   I think Apple's intentionally built that in.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:53.360]   Yeah, it's probably some sort of deal with the credit card companies, whether if they're going to allow you to use that sort of authentication, they're going to want it locked down.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.320]   Well, it's not just that.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.600]   I mean, literally most of my apps don't work.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.720]   Notifications don't work.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:05.360]   It has to be you have to log in with your phone or passcode before Andy's Tony Stark solution Leo.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.960]   I mean, they would be on my heart.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.440]   Fine. All of you just go ahead and like be a screen door on my submarine.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.120]   But hide my light under a bushel.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:14.720]   That's fine.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.680]   Doesn't have to be that tight, by the way.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.720]   I mean, it's pretty loose on my wrist and still works.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.200]   It's just it.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.800]   Yeah, just a can't be.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.960]   You have a second Apple watch for this that you don't need all your primary Apple watch.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.520]   All that on.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.440]   And then when you will, I will.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:33.480]   And truthfully, Apple could announce something that could be have, you know, they could say the passcode only Apple watch that has to be unlocked with the passcode.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:38.400]   And then you could keep it in a because the thing is, if you unlock it with the passcode, but it's not on your wrist.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.000]   Doesn't it relock?
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.160]   Yeah, it does.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.160]   So that's what they do.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.160]   They turn that off.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.680]   They say this special one for your iPad, an iPod, nano case.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.200]   I guess we are.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:49.600]   I guess that's right.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.840]   People are so salty.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.400]   But it actually not.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:08.240]   I think that it is an interesting demonstration of how the convergence of the iPod and the Apple watch where the reason why they feel is there's no need to really do anything interesting with the iPod anymore is that.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.000]   Anybody who they would push into an iPod meeting, I want something that's not really a phone.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.280]   I just need to have like digital things on it.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.520]   I need something to wear while I'm working out.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:21.320]   That's not as big and bulky as having a phone strapped to my arm is in fact the Apple watch.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.240]   This is the iPad nano.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.200]   This is the four gigabyte iPod nano.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.160]   That's what it is.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:27.880]   It's the watches.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.640]   Now your nano.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.240]   I was just sort of Marie Condoing a whole bunch of like my hardware.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.320]   And I have a I have a drawer.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.120]   I have a drawer in my library.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.400]   My vintage Boston Public Library Oak Library card.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.920]   Faith that is like just nothing but like old music players.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:50.960]   And so it gave me a chance to actually look at pretty much every iPod that's ever been taken out, including the iPod nano.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:58.400]   And it really reminded me of what an interesting and cool form factor that was that little postage stamp thing with a color screen that you can clip onto anything.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:03.280]   And I just got me sort of wondering of is there a place for a device like that?
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:16.280]   Even if you have to sort of reconsider what its portfolio of features, what its role is going to be because it's there's something to the idea of you start off with a form factor that is just appealing to begin with.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:22.480]   And I know that I think good design is always you start off with a function or you develop form and function together.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:30.440]   But there's something about gosh, I really wish there was something more I could do with this other than admire it every two months or so when I'm sorting through that drawer.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:34.520]   I thought I knew how Twitter worked. What is a hash flag?
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:39.720]   It's a special.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:46.080]   It's a word I hadn't heard before today to here's the hash flag for the apple event.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.440]   It's a little light blue apple.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:56.760]   But apparently this is a hash flag browser from Wong MJ.com that shows there's a bunch of hash flags for a variety of things.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.720]   I don't even know this.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.160]   This is something Twitter does, obviously.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:10.600]   Yeah, when you use a special hashtag like when I made a joke about the Hamilton movie, it automatically put up a like Hamilton movie, the Hamilton logo in the middle of it.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   Oh, that's so cool.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.560]   Did you have to use the right hashtag and it sees that, right?
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.000]   Right.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.600]   That's so cool.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:22.440]   I mean, I've known that they do that because that's actually pretty.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.320]   I've seen it happen quite a few times, but I didn't know it had a word.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.120]   I didn't know flash tag with the word.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.120]   Well, yeah, or hash flag.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.360]   I've entered a couple times now.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:36.480]   You know, I guess I make money somehow.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:43.440]   If you are a sociologist browsing the latest hash flags would tell you something about what's going on in the world, right?
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.000]   Outside the Netherlands, even.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.320]   Star Trek day 2020.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.520]   What is that today?
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.320]   What happy Star Trek day?
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.400]   So if I put hashtag Star Trek day, I'll get a little one of those little
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.720]   the highest logos.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:05.800]   Yes, you'll be hashtag or you could do Star Trek deep space nine and you'd get that guy
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.440]   for Star Trek day and it's seven of nine days.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.760]   And that what it how it works.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:14.000]   Well, no, it's eight.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.840]   The eighth, isn't it?
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.720]   Yeah, James T.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.480]   First birthday yesterday was seven of nine today and today is Star Trek day.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.600]   I still can use hashtag Star Trek.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:27.320]   The original series gives you a little Spock or Star Trek TOS gives a little Spock.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.360]   Now, see now I'm going to have to start tweeting stuff like this.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.040]   This is the day.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.760]   OK, that's the day the original series first aired premiered on September 8th.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.120]   Oh,
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.360]   hash.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:40.520]   But you can't like may the fourth be with you this and just have like live long
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.000]   and exactly 8th of September or something.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.200]   I just I just thought that the moment the moment the moment that made the fourth
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:53.160]   became a thing, you've got to know the Babylon five Star Trek.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.120]   Every single fan was like, oh, I so wish there was something so
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.240]   perfect and natural like that for us to and it's and it's at the start of summer,
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:01.520]   too.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.560]   It's the perfect day for everybody to get together.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.720]   It's the day where a premier.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.880]   Cost.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.960]   I think it's just, you know, Trek is just more data driven, you know, they're
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.040]   all about the facts.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.040]   They're not whimsical.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.240]   They've got, you know, they got the important stuff down.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.240]   They don't need a special.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:16.680]   Unreal,
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.360]   crazy, nothing unreal.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.280]   Oh, I know why I've never seen these.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.920]   It doesn't work on the official Twitter app for the Mac or on Tweet deck.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.760]   No, you got to be using the web.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.360]   In other words, two ones that you use.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.240]   Like most of Twitter, it's sporadically implemented.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.800]   OK.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.400]   That's cool.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.320]   I think that I like this.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:39.400]   I think the Star Trek fans would say, well, we keep Star Trek in our hearts
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.920]   every single day of the year on like, like, Star Wars.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.880]   They don't need a special check.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.320]   He's don't need a special day for that.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.120]   No, every day.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.320]   Star Trek day.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.240]   It's a star date.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:49.920]   It's not a star.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.480]   It's not a day.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.160]   It's a star date.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.480]   Exactly.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.080]   All right.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.280]   Let's take a break.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.560]   We've dealt with the rumors.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.040]   There are any other rumors that we haven't dealt with.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.560]   I think that's what we mentioned.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.240]   The I watch or the Apple Watch SE.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.600]   Oh, no.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.240]   Oh, no.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.280]   Oh, no, really?
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.560]   A low, at least less expensive Apple Watch.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.160]   Basically a replacement for that.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.920]   That's what the series for is, isn't it?
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.200]   Well, the series four was was dropped.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.160]   There is a series three series three.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.440]   They dropped the four.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.480]   It is what the series three is.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.440]   Yeah, the current one is a series five.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.600]   So the series three is like 200 some bucks.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.480]   One 99.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.440]   Great.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.360]   So if they give it a faster processor chip and then we're just like.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:32.840]   Update it.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.000]   Here's a better version.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:34.920]   Instead of calling it.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.400]   The series is very health stuff.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.280]   Call it the SE.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.200]   Special edition.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.440]   I'm just.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.680]   So, you know, I think they should do this because unfortunately,
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.080]   you know, when the original Apple Watch came out, it kind of was the feeling
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.840]   well, they're not going to update it every year.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:53.560]   So you could spend a little money on your $27,000 gold watch.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.800]   But now that it really seems like they are going to update it every year,
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:01.160]   I'm much less likely to buy an edition version, the titanium or the ceramic.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:01.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.160]   Same because I got to have to upgrade it a year.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:03.840]   So get the 200.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.160]   But we're not the normal people, Laura.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.160]   Like, sorry, Lee, like the most people still don't have like their whole things.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.920]   Most people still don't have an Apple Watch.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.920]   And like the best way I can explain it, because there are already people being
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.640]   angry about having bought an iPad that someone else might get a new iPad or that
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:20.320]   they're going to update Max more frequently if they're on Apple Silicon because it'll
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.320]   make theirs obsolete.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:25.840]   And the best way I can explain it to everybody is just, it's like a bakery.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.120]   They need to make fresh bread every day.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.880]   Even if you don't buy fresh bread every day, if you go there and your bread is stale,
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.960]   you'll be upset.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.840]   So they need to keep making these products every year because you can buy an Apple
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:41.080]   Watch every three years or a Mac every five years or an iPhone every every two
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.080]   years or three years.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.680]   But when you buy it, it should be as up to date as possible because then you get
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.000]   the most lifespan out of it.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.880]   So don't think about like other people getting newer stuff than you.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.840]   Think about you getting the newest thing whenever you're ready to buy.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.080]   That's my rant for today.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:36:00.960]   I just read a long article on the difference between
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.440]   bread gone bad and stale bread.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.560]   They're two different things.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.640]   Yes.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.600]   And lucky for Italian cuisine.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.480]   Yes.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.880]   You don't want mold on your bread.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   So take it out of the, if you open a loaf of bread, take it out of the bag, but
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:21.280]   it's okay to put it in the fridge, it'll get hard, which is not bad because you
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.120]   can soften it again if you heat it to 140 degrees.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.680]   Anyway, I kept it was a long piece on this.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:31.560]   You see, that's, see, that's where you kind of, you're kind of screwing yourself
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.000]   over by buying those fresh breads at a real bakery.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.200]   When you buy the process stuff from a commercial factory, you just leave it out.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.560]   It's pretty good for a month or two.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.440]   Let's take a break.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.840]   Great to have you all.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.680]   Good to see you.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.600]   I guess we'll be back next week a little bit later.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.480]   But we will be talking about something.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.560]   Yes.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.720]   Something new.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.720]   Our show today brought to you by last pass.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:59.400]   Last pass recently surveyed 700 IT and security professionals across a wide
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.080]   range of industries, financial services, IT retail.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:08.320]   Most of them, 82% said their business has been exposed to risk due to poor
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.960]   identity and access management.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.320]   I am.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.440]   That's what Last Pass does.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:18.280]   Last Pass helps you manage identities and promote good security behaviors.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:22.160]   And it's especially important right now while your employees are remote, no longer
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.200]   soaking in the warm, secure baths at work.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.840]   They're at home in the cold, cruel world.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.640]   Who knows what's going on?
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:33.680]   But so the first thing to make sure is you provide your employees with secure
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.680]   password storage.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:40.480]   Last pass gives every employee his or her own vault for storing every app and
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.960]   web blog in they use.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.360]   They make it very easy to share those logins to you.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.560]   You don't want employees emailing texting.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.920]   Logins when they have to share them.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:54.400]   You want them using the secure sharing built in the last pass.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.000]   Last pass is also all about convenience.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.080]   In fact, you know, we know employees aren't going to use this unless it's easy to use.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.960]   And Last Pass actually makes their job easier.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.040]   That auto fill fantastic.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:10.000]   They have single sign on more than 1,300 single sign on apps, which means it's easy.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.720]   They just on their phone, they say, yep, that's me.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.160]   And that's it.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.120]   No password at all.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.840]   That helps you manage employee access and a centralized view.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:20.960]   So, and this is important to for you, not your employees, but for you, it always
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:26.200]   has insight into who is accessing what and from where enterprise password
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.320]   management ensures oversight of shadow it.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.200]   But there's also enforceable policies.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.160]   We use many of them because of course we use Last Pass enterprise.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:38.480]   We require two factor, for instance, uh, that you minimum password requirements.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.920]   You can there's more than a hundred policies.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.080]   You can enforce across all your password protected accounts.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.120]   They have multi factor authentication, which is great.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:53.440]   It takes biometric or, or authenticator based two factor to the next level.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:57.960]   So you've got, you've got face ID, you've got touch ID, but you also have things
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:03.360]   like geo location and IP address so that you're always sure the right person is
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.840]   using what, you know, they have permission to use and no one else.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:09.000]   Employees always have their passwords with them to us.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.280]   One of the things I love about Last Pass iOS, Mac OS, Android, Linux, Windows,
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:19.240]   every browser out last passes there to help you fill in your passwords to help
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:19.960]   you keep track of them.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.480]   Really importantly, to help you generate long, strong, unique passwords every
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.000]   time you need to create new ones.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.720]   And, and even if your employees are working remotely, even if their internet
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:35.160]   is sketchy, Last Pass works, even an offline mode, working remotely should add
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.760]   convenience, not frustration, AES 256 bit encryption.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.040]   They use all the, all the state of the art security tools.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:46.080]   PBK DF2, Steve Gibson, by the way, verified all of this.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.640]   That's why he uses Last Pass.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:53.360]   SSA, SSJ 256 hashes, salted hashes on all the passwords.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:58.600]   Your data is encrypted and decrypted only on the vice, never anywhere else.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:02.480]   And your passwords never transmitted anywhere, not even Last Pass.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.560]   So, so it really is truly trust no one encryption.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.680]   Your data is always safe.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:13.240]   Last Pass, the number one password manager, the only one I use, I've used it for years.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.120]   We've used it a twit for years.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:19.200]   Let Last Pass securely manage your users identity by letting your employees work
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:24.080]   efficiently without making vulnerable, your business vulnerable to cyber threats.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.760]   Go to lastpass.com/twit, lastpass.com/twit.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.840]   Thank you, Last Pass for sponsoring the Twit Studios.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.960]   Actually, I really owe them because I'm the only one in the Twit Studios these days.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:40.480]   So thank you, Last Pass for keeping me safe here.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.560]   I guess everywhere we broadcast is a, is a Last Pass studio.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:49.000]   I have a sign in my office at home in case I have to stream from home.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.080]   Always ready, always ready.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.000]   Oh, I wish I could go to Singapore next week.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.800]   Well, for a lot of reasons, great food, but Thursday, actually, is this week,
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:05.360]   the Marina Bay Sands Store opens.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:11.160]   Look at that in the water, a floating globe, just a little causeway attached to it.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.200]   So you walk across the bridge and there you are out in the harbor.
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:21.320]   It's apparently has an incredible view, three hundred sixty degree view of the city.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.720]   Here's some pictures from Apple.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.600]   Man, does that look pretty?
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:29.600]   Apple.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.680]   It's funny. I mean, they don't mind spending a lot of money on stuff like this.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.000]   I mean, this, this isn't going to pay back the investment.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.360]   It's just a great ad for Apple and the brand, right?
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.000]   But it pushes the architecture forward.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.200]   It sure does.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.800]   Yeah, that's the contribution.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.640]   It's like, again, like you can care, you can not like Apple or not, like retail or not,
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.440]   like any of these things, but just their, their contributions to architecture,
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:55.120]   like retail architecture, the last decade have been stupefying.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.280]   Why do that?
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.000]   Is that for reputation?
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:02.760]   Well, because I think that they've discovered particularly with the New York City store,
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:06.080]   that it really does pay off when you become when you create something,
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.000]   it becomes a landmark by definition.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.080]   Exactly.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.720]   People, the number of people that are at the New York City Apple store,
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.400]   just to be at the New York City Apple store.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.000]   And if at the time they remember that, Oh, that's right.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.880]   I keep me picking up an iPad cover or if it they say it or if better yet,
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:25.080]   if it means that your company has an identity that is tied to a city's community,
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.200]   that pays off really, really well.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:31.920]   I think they could certainly do it a lot less with less creativity and less expense.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:35.840]   So kudos to them for not simply having, Hey, we've got our now,
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.880]   Singapore, you get your own cube and Boston, you get your own cube.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.360]   Right.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.920]   They are gorgeous.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.840]   It's nice and unique.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:46.240]   Even within New York, you've got the fifth Avenue store, but you also have the
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.520]   Grand Central Terminal store.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.200]   You have the so is.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:48.360]   Right.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.960]   So the shiny one is breathtaking too.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.480]   I'm not complaining.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.360]   I'm thrilled.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.640]   They got enough money.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.480]   But at the same time, you have to wonder what's the business model for this?
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.920]   Because it's got to be expensive.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.880]   Well, let's certainly let's also say just just to quickly say that they also do a
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:09.960]   good job of simply saying here is a beautiful, but really neglected and unloved
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.040]   piece of gorgeous architecture in the city.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:15.600]   We can renovate it right by necessarily stripping it out, but trying to keep
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.080]   as much character as possible.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.600]   I mean, the the Covent Garden up is not Covent Garden.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.800]   The the first Apple store in London, for instance, had that sort of thing about it
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.960]   where in the opera.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.120]   And Grand Central.
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.080]   Go ahead, Laurie.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:38.240]   What better way to to give your your brand that kind of status to than than to make
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.680]   these kinds of design buildings and, you know, really show off.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.840]   We are a design tech company.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:50.160]   And here's this globe in the middle of the ocean for you to prove just how like our
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:55.000]   status as as designers, you know, I think that's to me when I look at that.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.880]   I think this is Apple, you know, spreading their peacock feathers to let
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:05.360]   everybody know that, you know, we're all about design and, you know, especially at
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.360]   a time when phones are looking more and more alike, they really want to make sure
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.960]   everybody remembers you love us because of our design aesthetic, you know, don't
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:18.160]   forget that, you know, it's also what happens when you reach a certain level.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:25.880]   As a as a company, the only way to, you know, to go forward is to like become iconic, right?
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.800]   And Johnny wanted to like he had an itch to design bigger places like Apple Park
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.760]   and work with retail and that.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.360]   I mean, you just let people run it.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.080]   And I don't I mean, sure it's not true now because of COVID, but, you know, at one
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.160]   time, Apple made more money per square foot than anybody but Tiffany.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:44.400]   I mean, it was a very Tiffany, I think that they beat so it's very
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.000]   silly.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.040]   Like they don't make money on these.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.320]   But I just wonder, I mean, these it must.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:49.360]   Look at this.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.680]   So you see up above you a whole, these are adjustable louvers.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:58.000]   They're like blinds because it can be very hot and sunny in Singapore, as you might
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:58.360]   imagine.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:03.320]   And then look, see these escalators because there's also in the water underneath.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.720]   There's then a bigger showroom as well.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:10.360]   Part that's interesting to me is that like because Tim Cook often gets just like
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:15.560]   written off as a logistics person or like, but I've heard him talk about the Apple
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:19.880]   retail stores and he goes on and on about the builds of the staircases and where
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:20.640]   they source them.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:25.440]   And I guess that is logistics, but he had a deep passion, like that was often a
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.600]   Steve Jobs thing or Johnny I have something, but he had a deep passion for the
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.440]   materials and the build and the architecture and the design and everything as well.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.840]   And it's really cool when you see that go just company wide.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.000]   Really beautiful.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.520]   Oh, man, it makes me want to go to Singapore.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.960]   I was supposed to be there in January.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:44.600]   I would have been supposed to be in Hong Kong and Singapore in January.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.800]   Well, I'll put it off for a couple of years, but I'll do it.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.680]   Apple is not, I have to say, a $2 trillion company anymore.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.360]   Yeah, what happened?
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.440]   Well, the stock market.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.200]   Fickle markets.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.600]   I know, but it was it was pretty big for one day, wasn't it?
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:07.000]   Apple had the worst day, I think ever of any technology stock, they lost 8%.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.160]   But it was also just bad for all stocks.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.840]   Because they could afford to Leo.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:13.120]   That's so big.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.800]   They could afford to have a hundred eighty bill.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:16.440]   Well, lost.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.040]   That's not right.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:20.040]   They're their market value.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.680]   Their market cap lost $180 billion in one day.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.200]   It's the large.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.280]   There's vanity metric.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:31.000]   It's a vanity metric, but it is the largest one day loss in value for any company ever,
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   according to Beren's.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.680]   The previous lost Volkswagen in 2008.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:42.320]   So this came shortly after this Doc split.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:47.520]   Is there, I mean, like, I still I still question like the whole market.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.080]   So a bunch of companies lost, you know, their 8% to.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.840]   Yeah, it was the worst day of tech stocks for tech stocks in March.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:47:00.200]   You know, and I can almost well, I'm not I'm not a market prognosticator and I'm not
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.160]   an investor, by the way.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:05.200]   But I mean, I have funds.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:11.280]   I don't I don't invest in individual stocks for good reason because my track record would be awful.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:16.280]   But I generally think that this is if any sector is going to come back.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.800]   It during COVID, it's going to be technology sector.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.840]   The long arc of history.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:25.960]   Yeah, as a matter of fact, I can't remember I read this, but there is a there is at least one
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:31.400]   country that is putting forward that tech companies should be taxed more heavily during this period,
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.920]   because they're actually doing they're the one industry that's doing exceptionally well.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.840]   And that an increase in taxes taxation on those companies could help to keep other
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:44.040]   industries afloat. Again, I'm sorry. I don't have that handfuls that reference handy, but this is
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.320]   this is not the sort of thing that's going to improve the perception that
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:52.360]   tech companies have way too much power and they'll they'll only become more and more powerful
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.960]   no matter what happens in the world. So it's been interesting to see in 2021,
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:01.160]   whether this shakes out as something specific that people would like to address or whether just
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:07.960]   simply continues to downgrade people's opinion of a huge people of two trillion dollar companies
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:12.920]   that have access to all the information that we transact with willingly and unwillfully as we go
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:17.080]   through it every day of our lives. The internet is a pain monetization engine. So I mean, the worst
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:22.360]   that we suffer, the better like Twitter always places are going to do. But if you look at the
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.120]   wit was covering this, wasn't he? And he was explaining there was a bunch of shorts and puts
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:30.280]   and profit taking going on. It's just like, I think that's the Wall Street machine.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:34.600]   I think the word profit, the words profiting are actually probably the most accurate because
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:39.560]   tech stocks had been ramping up hugely as had the market as a whole, really heating up over the
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:43.880]   last few weeks. When that happens, people at some point go, yeah, I'm going to take some of that
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.960]   money out. And so this stock goes down again. And also the shorts get mad. So they start doing
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:51.800]   things to get the stock back down again so they can buy it lower and sell it higher when it goes
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:57.000]   back up. I'm going to presume it doesn't have anything to do with the epic lawsuit or
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:03.800]   Apple is now countersuing. Today they filed counter claims in their battle with Epic
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:08.200]   seeking damages from Epic for its breach of contract.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:13.480]   Well, because Epic sued them like Epic filed another motion for damages earlier in the
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:18.280]   weekly. Oh, you can't just have Tim Apple and Tim Epic are going at it and they get a fair fight.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.600]   Yeah, it's the battle of the Tims.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:25.320]   It's so this becomes this is going to become a super sell, you know, where
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:29.560]   just like the Samsung, the suits and counter suits and counter countersuits and counter counter
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:34.280]   countersuits become so huge that at some point there is going to have to be a meeting of the five
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.880]   families to decide how do we end this because we're spending way too much time on this.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:46.120]   Oh, and by the way, I did find a citation on that. There is a top a the EU's European commissioner
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:51.800]   for economics and taxation at the European House, Ambrose Eddie Forum said that it's a major problem
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.400]   and big tech has to pay a fair amount of taxes in Europe, especially as they are the real winners
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:59.960]   of the corona crisis. You couldn't win earth. Carolina Milanese had a great point, though,
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:04.120]   which he also said that Apple writes these things for people. They don't write them for the courts.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:07.800]   And when you go through and look at the language, it's like in the middle of the night in the
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:13.240]   darkness of the night, Epic. Oh, I know. Oh my God. And it's really written for for humans,
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:18.200]   not for the courts. It's it's so many wars on so many levels. It's like a 40-chest video. Yeah.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:23.240]   And of course, as you pointed out last week, PUBG is suddenly, you know, you go to Apple Store,
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.680]   it's the number one low. Everybody wants the new PUBG. But then banned in India.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:32.520]   Yeah. Yeah. Immediately afterwards, because Tencent owns the mobile version,
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:37.400]   but also Tencent owns 40% of Epic. So are they next? It's so confusing for to be a customer these
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:41.640]   days. Well, it's it's complicated because now India is having its own little war with China.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:45.240]   Right. And so they are making they're punishing the country as much as they're as much as they can.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:49.800]   And they're using people's dependence on phones as leverage in that war. And it's going to get worse
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:56.920]   before it gets better. 118 apps last week were killed in India, all Chinese.
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:05.320]   Speaking of which, Apple says it stores Hong Kong users iCloud data in the US.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:12.680]   And that if Hong Kong or the Chinese government wants to see that data,
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:21.640]   they refer them to the US Department of Justice. This is in response to the July 1 security law
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:30.280]   that was imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing. No more requests for user data from Hong Kong authorities
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:36.520]   were just referred to the US government. I'll see how long that sticks. Yeah.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.360]   As soon as China.
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:43.880]   A war will have to be issued by a US judge before Apple would hand it over. That's one way to handle
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:52.280]   that. Just say, well, we store it here. And good luck. Yeah. That is that is one instance in which
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:57.080]   Apple, the smart thing to do and the only thing they can do is simply hide behind procedure and
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:02.520]   simply say this is on this is how we run things for everybody else. This is where the jurisdiction
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:08.040]   lies and therefore unless the situation radically changes, this is all that we can do. But as soon
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:12.680]   as you know that they're going to have to fold just as soon as China says that we
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:17.960]   given the amount of control that they're putting over Hong Kong residents right now,
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:24.200]   the idea of them putting harder restrictions over tech companies that do business with Hong
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:29.320]   Kong residents is going to be upgraded or downgraded, however you put it to match it up.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:36.600]   Well, and actually Apple's a little slow to this. Right after July 1 Microsoft Twitter and Google
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:41.080]   all said that they would stop processing requests for user data from Hong Kong.
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:47.240]   Apple took its time. They were assessing now they have said that that's going to be the case.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:51.240]   They also said, I think we should point this out. You may see some of these requests in the
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:57.240]   transparency report that's coming out soon that Apple says it really received a limited number of
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:03.720]   non-content requests from Hong Kong related to fraud or stolen devices. And presumably they
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:11.800]   cooperate in that case. I don't know. 604 requests for device information, 310 requests for financial
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:19.000]   data, 10 requests for user account data that was last year in 2019. So it's not a lot, but still,
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:26.440]   this is a geopolitical environment is shifting. All this stuff I think we talked about last week,
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:30.840]   but all the different countries trying to put different rules in place for like how much you
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:35.880]   can charge for an app store and how you have to have localized data or data repatriation.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:40.760]   And all these companies have become so international over the last decade. And now there's so many
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:47.720]   nationalist movements and antitrust movements. It's going to be really interesting in a non-
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:51.320]   non-terrible way to be a multinational company, I think over the next decade.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:55.880]   Yeah, in fact, Japan is now probing the app store rules.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:06.040]   Japanese game creators also coming, stepping up and saying, yeah, we got some here.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:13.640]   Hero Now Koonamitsu, who's the founder and chairman of Gumi, a mobile game maker,
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:19.560]   wrote on his Facebook page, I want from the bottom of my heart, Epic to win.
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:31.080]   Okay, 702,000 registered developers in Japan. So it's a big developer community.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:37.720]   The app store ecosystem, according to Apple generated 37 billion in buildings and sales in 2019.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:45.960]   So it's a big, it's a big money maker, a Japan concerned about same as everybody is about how
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.800]   Apple runs a store that Japanese and trust.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:52.120]   When time gets tough, like you want more of the pie, like when the pie is growing,
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:55.960]   like when the app store started, it was growing so fast, we had story of app store,
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:59.320]   millionaire after app store, millionaire, and everyone's like 30% wine, whatever,
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:03.560]   I'm making so much money, it doesn't matter. And when times are tough though, everybody's like,
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:08.120]   wait a minute, you know, how much of the pie do you have? And then all these sort of squabbles
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:08.840]   come to the surface.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:17.560]   Japanese antitrust regulator says it's going to step up attention to the iPhone makers practices
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:24.360]   in the wake of the epic Apple battle. I'm not sure exactly what that means.
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:26.040]   We're going to be looking at this, I guess.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.840]   Let's see.
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:38.920]   A Facebook was upset over Apple. And we talked about this when it first was announced, I think
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:48.040]   back at WWDC, Apple was going to put a pop up on iOS 14 when a company requested your Apple
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:56.520]   identity for advertisers. And Facebook said this is going to be a massive problem. It's because,
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:00.600]   you know, you've always been able to turn it off, but putting it in people's faces like that
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:04.280]   means that most people say, no, no, I don't want to share that information.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:10.840]   And Facebook said this is going to kill the online advertising market. So Apple apparently.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:16.600]   So they didn't say that they put up a notice telling developers that it was going to make it
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:22.760]   complicated. And then a bunch of headlines came up saying Facebook flipped. It was vastly sensationalized
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:26.600]   in the media compared to the Facebook blog post, which was very matter of fact,
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:30.360]   because Facebook has Facebook and then they have the partner network. And this was all partner
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.080]   network related.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:37.960]   So according to Alex Heath, writing for the information, Apple plans to delay the enforcement of this
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:44.920]   change until next year, giving people a chance to kind of respond and talk about it.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:51.560]   Until 2021, developers will still be able to ask users for permission to share their IDFA
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:56.840]   when iOS 14 is released this fall, although you won't have to. So you could pop it up,
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:01.480]   but you don't have to pop it up. Apple said, we want to give developers the time they need to
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:06.280]   make the necessary changes. And as a result, the requirement to use this tracking permission will
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:12.760]   go into effect early next year. I think that has to be a response to Facebook though, right?
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.560]   Here's the poll. It's every year they do that every year. They did that with
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:20.200]   log in every year. They announced security feature. Everyone gets super like the developers get
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:24.200]   super stressed. They try to implement it. They find a bunch of edge cases and we was signing with
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:28.040]   Apple was the same thing last year where they're like, Oh, maybe Gmail doesn't have to include
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:32.120]   an odd sign in with Apple login because it's only logging in Gmail. We should have thought of that.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:36.760]   And then it gets pushed out and I think it ended up going live in January of this year.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:40.520]   This is just normal. Here's the pop up. And I think it's great.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:48.280]   Palabot would like permission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:52.680]   Your data will be used to deliver personalized ads to you. And then the user gets to say,
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:58.840]   allow tracking or ask app not to track. And of course, if I saw that, I would say ask
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:03.240]   app not to track, right? Wouldn't you? Everybody? Yeah, I do. I do think that these companies have,
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:11.000]   I think it's correct for them to say we're not to say at least consult us on the wording of this
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:20.680]   alert because it's it's if the wording is too alarmist saying that they should they should be able to say
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:27.080]   that look within context that any website that you visit is going you're being tracked anytime you
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:31.960]   walk through a park carrying a phone, carrying a phone in your pocket with that's not an airplane
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:35.800]   mode, you're being tracked. That's that's an awful lot to put in one dialogue box. But it should
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:42.680]   reflect the fact that as part of the reality of living in in in the 2020s, yes, we will be tracking
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:47.720]   we need we want your location so that we can help monetize the app and also deliver features.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:53.640]   The idea of warning it's sort of like the it shouldn't be like the warning that you get from Google when
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:57.880]   under certain circumstances when you say we think we think that there's a site certificate in validation
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:01.800]   here you might be your so it might be trying to steal your personal information. That's the sort of
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:06.680]   thing where everyone's going to absolutely nope right out of there. So if if the big purpose of the
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:10.680]   delay is to simply say we're definitely going forward with this feature but let's talk about the
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:15.640]   language to make sure it doesn't necessarily informs people without necessarily scaring people off.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:21.640]   I have to point out though if you go into your settings now on iOS and you go to the privacy
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:28.120]   settings on iOS, I think well now I'm going to ask you guys you're the experts but if I go to
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:36.200]   settings privacy and then I scroll all the way down to apple advertising, I can turn off personalized
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:41.160]   ads. Does that the same thing as turning off apples ID for advertisers?
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:50.280]   I don't think so. This is just like for general the one that you were just looking at. I think
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:57.880]   that's just for Safari. I don't think it has anything to do with your apple ID. I think it's just for apps.
[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:05.080]   Oh for apps okay um let's see here. Then you can see if you add targeting information
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:09.960]   you have turned personalized ads off which prevents apple from using account information
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:15.880]   or your interactions with Apple services. I think that applies to parties.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:24.200]   So this is in the App Store but I was told I thought I was told that you could turn off ID.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:31.320]   Here's tracking. Allow apps to request to track. Allow apps to ask permission to track you across
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:36.360]   apps and websites. So look in your phones and see if this is turned on.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:40.840]   Yeah that just turns it off by block. Like if you turn off location apps can't ask you for
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:45.160]   location. If you leave it on they can ask you on an app by app basis. I think that's the same thing.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:52.920]   Oh so this doesn't turn off IDFA. Leo are you on iOS 14? Because I believe that's only in iOS 14.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:01:01.000]   Oh I am. So that is the feature that's at issue. Allow apps to request to track, turn it on
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:06.520]   and then they will ask permission but not yet. Not till next year. They'll be like we don't have to.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:13.400]   So there in the iOS 13 I thought there was a way to do that in iOS 13. Is there not?
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:19.080]   I believe what you it was what you were just saying which is under just under your privacy
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:25.560]   and advertising. You can limit ad tracking which allows you to opt out of receiving ads targeted
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:32.360]   to your interests. But that's not turning off IDFA probably. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. This is why we
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:37.160]   need a lot of the work that needs to be done on this is on simple clarity. That okay you're turning
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:41.160]   off location but are you turning off other information that these companies are going to be able to
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:47.960]   use to identify you. It's I think that when Google got caught doing this a couple years ago even
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:52.360]   their internal documents said that their own engineers and they're looking at it saying this
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:57.160]   this I didn't understand this myself and I'm working on this product. Other people were saying it
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:02.440]   almost looks like it was intentionally trying to confuse people and even today you have to have
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:07.000]   a long talk with somebody about saying how can you how can you make sure that my phone cannot be
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.400]   tracked and my activity can't be tracked and the answer is to keep it off and keep it turned off
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:19.560]   really. Apple did just release a an ad about privacy saying something should not be shared.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.920]   Yeah. It's a good ad. I can't can I not play it because I bet I can't play it because
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:30.840]   I'm playing an apple ad and apple will take down our show for paying their ad without taking any
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:35.080]   time from that. So what I've heard about that recently is that if it if it goes for over 20
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:40.760]   seconds there's an automated content ID system that kicks in and that just flags any any registered
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:45.800]   apple content that's longer than 20 seconds. You okay they should really be a way for apple to say
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:51.400]   if it's an ad let them play it. It's free. They don't have to put it into content ID but I don't
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.760]   know if they're that granular or they just outsourced it to some company. Yeah. It would be content
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:59.960]   ID needs to be a little bit more granular. Well yeah I can't play it but here's the good news.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:06.280]   You can if you go to the apple youtube site but that's the point is that it says apple says
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:11.560]   something shouldn't be shared. That's why iPhone is designed to help give you control over your
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:16.760]   information and protect your privacy unless Facebook complains. Oh wait a minute doesn't say that part.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:25.400]   So you know apples you can't have it both ways apple if you're going to advertise that you give
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:32.440]   people control you got to give people control and if advertisers complain and you and you say oh
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:38.680]   never mind well then you shouldn't be running that ad. Am I wrong? I think it's less of the
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:42.680]   complaining and more like the implementation like there was a problem in implementing it
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:46.840]   because they what they test internally and what a million developers suddenly discover
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:51.320]   are different things and it's just edge cases and bugs that they have to fix but it's not a
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:55.880]   oh sorry we're not going to do it it's like no I think there's zero sympathy for Facebook inside
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.120]   apple. I think there's just we didn't consider this this or this and we're fixing it so we'll give
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:04.600]   you until January to implement it. Well one of the things they I mean I'm considered is that it's worth
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:12.280]   $70 billion a year and a lot of that revenue goes to apple so I don't know if it does does it?
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:18.120]   Well I don't think that's anything on Apple. I mean they don't get a cut of it.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.160]   I don't know that's an interesting question yes since they don't have apple ads they wanted to
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:27.560]   but they their apple ads was a flop. Yeah I asked didn't work. Yeah.
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:37.080]   It's interesting I you know the timing of releasing that ad September 3rd and then announcing
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:43.160]   same dollar by the way we're not going to give you that that do not track option just yet.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:48.280]   It doesn't look great. Yeah bad optics. Yeah regardless. Okay
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:59.400]   Apple has to pay its retail workers people in the apple store for the time they spent being
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:07.640]   searched. Yep that's fair about time. It's about time. It's a it's a it really is a common scam for
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:12.440]   employers that you can't we're not going to allow you to leave until you're all your your stuff has
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:16.360]   been searched for stolen property but we're going to tell you you have to clock up before that and
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:20.760]   in some times they're they're having to stick around for half hour 45 minutes waiting for a
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:25.480]   security person to be ready for them to do the search and this is something that it's kind of
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.640]   embarrassing that apple was even caught up in this to begin for seven years they've been fighting
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:40.120]   this since 2013. Yeah this is Walmart stuff. I mean you know what to expect there from the apple store.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:46.200]   Come on guys. Nothing with that kind of architecture should be doing this. Yeah exactly. Yeah well
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:51.240]   it's not I don't know this is in a Supreme Court ruling this is just an appeals court so I suppose
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:55.400]   apple could appeal this all the way to the Supreme Court. I don't know. Yeah maybe things
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:01.000]   might be tough. Please don't let it go. Yeah again this is this is this is why whenever I see
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:06.680]   propaganda about oh they're just hippies in a garage and they're the friendly company that
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:11.400]   cares about people and cares about the world it's like okay go ahead and say that but it really is
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:15.160]   embarrassing when we find out that you've been stealing from your employees for seven years and
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.200]   you're what you want to fight for the right to continue to steal from your employees. Yeah
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:24.440]   somebody said apple stopped doing the bag searches years ago so are they not doing them
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:30.840]   anymore anyway so maybe that's why it doesn't matter. Well they just want the I think they still
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:35.480]   want the back pay. They want the back pay of course yeah yeah. Hey if you're having trouble
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.440]   getting people to sign up for apple TV plus I know what you should do.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:49.240]   Hire somebody away from Quibi. They've got it. Apple has hired Tim Conley. He is an experienced
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:57.400]   Hollywood executive from Disney Hulu most recently from Quibi where he was one of the senior executives
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:04.120]   running partnerships and advertising he left before the service launched he also helped to
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:10.760]   launch Hulu. Smart man. Good timing. Good timing. Yeah I think I'll leave now if you don't mind.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:17.800]   You guys got this. Before my resume becomes poisoned perhaps I should yeah see if RB is hiring.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:23.480]   Help watch Hulu's live TV service which required a lot of deal making. This guy's a deal maker
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:29.080]   oversaw a deal between Spotify and Hulu to bundle their services not no way he'll be doing but given
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:36.440]   his history probably be working on acquisitions right or deals for apple TV's channels feature
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:43.080]   which tell me what the channels feature is that's that lets you watch other channels.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:52.360]   That lets you sign up for something like HBO or Showtime or CBS all access right through the TV app
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:58.840]   so it's not a separate account so if you signed up through the TV app you'd just be able to watch
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:05.800]   all those channels through the TV app but if you were using so like I have an HBO Max subscription
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:12.600]   that I subscribe to from the website right I can't it's not it's not yeah it's I mean I can still
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:20.760]   access the the HBO Max stuff via the TV app it just takes me to the TV or takes me to HBO Max it
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:27.480]   doesn't open it up within it so this allows you to actually have like the channel let's say Showtime
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:33.160]   it shows you like an interface of all of the shows that Showtime has within the subscription
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:38.440]   you can click on it and watch it right inside the TV app so this they just started their TV bundle
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.200]   they did that show time thing right show time and see this right for 10 bucks you get all three
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:50.120]   so maybe I'll tell you this guy might be I'm on board with this if they start doing this kind of
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:55.640]   thing where you get a really good discount by getting multiple channels I think this is a
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:01.800]   really great idea for them to make a name for themselves in in TV plus because you know we've
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:06.920]   talked a lot about how the content itself hasn't really been the thing that's going to keep people
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:13.800]   subscribing but if you have a bundle that includes multiple channels for a really low price that's
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:19.000]   going to start making people think well I already have this I already do that why don't I just you
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.080]   know spend an extra five dollars and I have this bundle all inside the TV app this could
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:30.920]   potentially be a good a good move for them how do you like my suit gorgeous gorgeous right
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:36.440]   I it's a nice thing you like the flamingo shirt I love the flamingo shirt it's all from Taylor's
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:42.360]   store our sponsor Taylor's story and what's cool about this this is a custom shirt and a custom
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:48.920]   suit but they didn't send a tailor over to measure me I actually use their app their size me app
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:54.680]   took a couple of pictures it's so and actually what's really cool is they sent me before they made
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:00.440]   the suit a scizer which made out of kind of like canvas which I'm keeping because it's kind of fun
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:05.720]   and and then and then I said we'll take it in here do this and they sent me a second scizer so they
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:10.360]   really care about getting it just right and only when I said yeah that one fits perfectly
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:16.200]   did they make the suit and I'm loving it the neat thing about Taylor's store is not only does it
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:24.920]   are you getting custom tailored shirts pants suits for men and women and not only do you not have to
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:32.040]   go into a store or have a tailor come over but they have so many customization options now if
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.560]   you're pressed for time you don't want to do the app they have a quick size option you enter you
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:41.240]   know your height and weight they get they actually get pretty darn close but if you want to use the
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:47.080]   app you even get even closer to it and then you can say oh I'll just take the you know this shirt or
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:52.600]   that shirt just like you would at any store or and I did this actually with a suit you go through a
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:59.080]   wide variety of fabrics you can choose the lining I got a beautiful paisley lining it's fully lined
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:04.520]   which I really like that's a good sign in any suit look at that that lining it's beautiful it's just
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:08.040]   you can't really see it on camera because it's black I didn't want something flashy but if I'd
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:13.720]   want it I could have really flashy lining you can have the thread color the buttons you contrast
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:20.840]   fabrics and here's a shirt that I just got look I got my my name or your initials on the cuff my
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:27.160]   name's short so it works instead of initials with and you choose everything everything to to match
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:35.080]   your design dress shirts chinos beautiful suits polo shirts shorts all can be purchased without any
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:40.040]   need for measurements and man I love I'm only buying my stuff from Taylor store because it fits

[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.520]   course a lot of wool suits but Lisa's she won't touch me if I'm wearing wool she says it makes me
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:23.240]   itch so I was able to get a really nice non-wool fabric that just looks good fits good feels great
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:28.920]   and this will be a good travel suit so I'm very excited yeah I can't I can't believe how old I was
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:34.440]   before I realized that clothes are supposed to fit you and that like yeah it's like I mean I
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:40.760]   started wearing ties like voluntarily when I realized it oh the reason why like I feels like
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:46.520]   I'm being choked by my shirt collar is that I'm not buying the right sized shirts oh you can actually
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:53.320]   buy a shirt with a larger color that is actually has come oh so yeah that's I can actually put my
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:57.880]   top button I you know I've never had shirts that I could button the top button and wear a tie with
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.360]   until Taylor store I really love that Taylor store is great thank you Taylor store for
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:07.000]   your your my your my dresser my official dresser now and by the way they've all kinds of crazy
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.200]   fabrics like this one this this flamingo this is this is actually a shirt I wore on my last trip
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:17.560]   because it's such a yeah it's such a fun shirt so you may remember when apple amazon and google
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:24.440]   you may remember when hell froze over when apple amazon and google said announced they were
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:31.480]   gonna do an open source smart home standard called project chip connected home over ip
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:37.560]   I I don't know I was wrong I thought oh that'll never fly you'll never you'll get those three in
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:44.280]   the room and they'll just tear each other's eyes out but no apparently it's on track for a 2020 one
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:54.120]   launch who to thunk it they just to put a announcement up this is actually it's interesting because this
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:16:01.880]   is on the zigbee alliance page so that just shows you it's uh they're even working with the zigbee
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:07.880]   people here's the pyramid for you know all the technologies so this is at the highest
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:15.000]   layer this is really an api I think right I you know who I should really ask about this
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:21.400]   is uh Matthew kessanelian mica because they do the smart tech today show they probably all over
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:30.760]   this thing but I love the I mean I have to say I love the idea that I could I don't have to have
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:37.480]   a different app on my phone for every device or have different phones or you know I want it to
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:45.080]   work everywhere on everything that I use so do will this allow us to have more integration with
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:53.160]   different virtual assistants like the one from google and the one from apple you know what it
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:57.640]   could we have a smart speaker that it just integrates them both without all of the
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:02.600]   complicated jumping through the rules that companies have to do we can but hold it's not like the
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.920]   opposite though it's not like you could it was almost like assistant agnostic like regardless of
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:10.760]   which assistant you chose the gear would work well that's it right choose your assistant which
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:15.320]   means you could use all the assistance so it didn't you any assistant you use you could use that one
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:19.640]   that's what I think that's what lory's saying right you don't have to you don't have to you
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:23.880]   don't have to say oh I have to use amazon because that's kind of the way it is right now oh I have
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:28.120]   to use an echo in fact that's why and they all started buying their own stuff so it made it harder
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:35.480]   yeah even worse so now the alliance has 145 active member companies all the biggies
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:43.320]   uh I think this is going to be the holy grail it's the one thing that's been holding back home
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:49.320]   automation was this kind of this tower of babble where nothing would talk to anything else
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:57.960]   yeah i've got two smart home hubs in my house right now that deal with two different brands of
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:02.360]   products and and there's more to come you know there's more smart things out there that I want to
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:07.800]   add which just means that I'm going to have to add yet another hub to my router that's already
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:13.320]   getting filled up with with the hubs anyway so if there's a standard that makes it so that I only
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:19.960]   need one hub and it works with all of the brands that would be so much easier to do I don't even
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:25.560]   mind having multiple hubs I just want to have you know my routine if I have a apple home routine or
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:31.000]   a google home routine should be able to address everything in the house instead of having to say
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:37.800]   good night good night okay amazon is big the window like this like just staring in at this
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:44.760]   nobody wants to say good night to me the the other thing that we also they also will make it
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:49.720]   great is that it will it not only will it make it easier to attach new things to a network it also
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:54.600]   means that you won't have a individual company sort of holding you hostage like if they suddenly
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:58.840]   decide that we decided that we're going to have to charge you five dollars every time if every
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:03.160]   month every time you want to turn a light bulb on an honor off if it's basically on a standard
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:08.520]   that is not necessarily dependent on this one phone app or this one one hub it could really give
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:13.320]   people a lot more allow them to be a lot more brave about investing in smart home technology if
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:17.560]   they feel as though if it's going to work exactly like a like an old-fashioned light bulb does the
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:21.960]   fact that it's screwed into an outlet means that it's going to work no matter what terms of service
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:28.680]   that I pretend that I read before I click the the accept button if you're going to Amsterdam or
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:34.680]   Portugal I know you're not if you live there now and maybe you're going to go sometime in the future
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:42.360]   you'll be glad no Apple Maps now has 3D images in Amsterdam and transit information in Portugal
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:50.440]   I've been to this beautiful museum in Amsterdam and is it is the most amazing Rembrandt collection
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:20:01.320]   I've ever seen now you can kind of zoom in and see it in 3D you'll get the I let's see I culture
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:08.680]   has the current list of known areas which includes Amsterdam and this is I culture unfortunately it's
[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:19.160]   in Dutch Amsterdam Amsterdam Ease which is not the easiest language for me I can figure out that
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:26.440]   Apple Carton is Apple Maps and 3D is still 3D but apparently you'll get even stuff Google's won't
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:33.480]   translate that for you probably would I just kind of like I like looking at Dutch it looks it's
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:39.800]   the Amorra who hunted me do you speak no but it's african to so close and it is it's not
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:47.240]   big african either but it's right so Amsterdam Harlem Zandvoort Blomendahl heems theta
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:54.600]   Hoover-Dorpers on Tom and Alsmere I don't I'm sure I'm saying those wrong I really am but
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:21:02.360]   that's cool you gotta have a lot of us in there yeah yeah so and Portugal what is Portugal get
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:10.200]   Portugal gets transit information in fact not just Portugal but they've expanded transit
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:16.040]   information quite a bit this year to many locations in the EU including France Spain which
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:20.680]   ball which ball must intelligence there's still playing catch up though you know it's funny to
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:26.440]   read these stories and go well yeah but Google Maps has that's had that forever but you know it's
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:32.680]   good to have to uh well it just goes to show you that at Google Maps is no longer has the strangle
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:38.520]   hold on maps that they once did I mean I don't know if I talked about it last week but I was
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:42.600]   talking about how I don't I don't have the new Microsoft flight simulator but knowing that it was
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:49.000]   pulling its terrain data off of Bing Maps got me to like actually go visit Bing Maps for the first
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:54.280]   time and god knows how long but and being really really impressed with the level of 3d detail and
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:22:01.320]   say Boston so before it's an Apple Maps is doing great too but you got to wonder how hard Google
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:05.960]   is working to make sure that it keeps some sort of an edge beyond simply having been
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:11.560]   the the the the defaults the people's default conceptual standard of maps
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:17.480]   if you go to store.apple.com apparently according to 9 and 5 Mac and you try to buy
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:23.960]   a series 5 Apple watch they'll say oh why would you though yeah but why would you
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:29.000]   oh I'm sorry they're out of stock right now just so you can be really upset that you
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.920]   bought it right before they announced anyone yeah don't buy it now wait there might be something

[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:07.320]   only I know apple tv plus trailer for a new animated film called wolf walkers
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:15.240]   in fact this is part of a whole bunch of new family stuff wolf walkers a feature it's a
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:20.040]   venture film about a young apprentice apprentice names robin who travels with their father to
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:29.720]   ireland to wipe out a pack of wolves but it turns out she can turn into a wolf at night oh no
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:33.640]   she meets somebody who can and she wonders maybe we shouldn't kill these guys because maybe they're
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:43.000]   people coming sometime in 2020 I can't wait yeah what is it have to decide November 1st
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.520]   wait just wait for the apple events Leo you don't have to decide anything yet we don't have
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:54.840]   enough information I got time yeah I'm gonna climb is on your straw mankind gotta finish that
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:24:01.080]   I've watched greyhound I'll watch it again that was pretty good I start watching Ted lasso thanks to
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:04.440]   thanks to you you're right it's goofy but it is it's sweet
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:11.160]   yeah I mean it's as good as one is good as a show can be based on a character developed for ESPN
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:22.120]   but no I like it it's cute yeah it's sweet yeah yeah yeah and he keeps making a sports ball to watch
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:29.720]   it no fact it really if you if you're in into sports you probably shouldn't okay yeah it might
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:36.120]   make you upset yeah it's not really it's not about sports it's about humans it's about people yeah okay
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:38.120]   and it's about hawker suligens
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:52.120]   the premise is it's a third tier American football coach brought to England to coach a premier league
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.840]   team that hasn't been doing so well
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:25:02.600]   and everybody's saying what do you eat he doesn't even know the rules of soccer in fact the best the
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:08.440]   best part of it is when he's saying what is that is it is it a pitch what do you put it
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:14.680]   is it a field is it a pitch what do you call that it's like that's the funniest part it's pretty good
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:19.720]   um boys i'm going to introduce you to a new concept called the forward pass i'm telling you
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:25.240]   it will be unstoppable once we master what you can't pick them all up why not where's the running back
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:29.800]   where's the running yeah can what if you just use your forearms it actually is using your forearms
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:35.240]   it's terrible if you just think about the premise is not good but i think it's actually he's good
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:40.360]   it's cute it's sweet his assistant is sweet it's the characters the characters yeah they're
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:46.600]   they're so good and they're they're so much just sort of um positivity that's being thrown around
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.520]   there even in the face of people trying to be as negative as they possibly can be so yeah it's one
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:56.280]   of those yeah it's one of those where you could be meanie and it doesn't matter yeah yeah yeah
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:02.840]   yeah because he's just on relentlessly upbeat yeah kind of guy you just want to smack in the face
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:11.880]   then when you do he kisses you and he has half a cookie and you feel really bad that's that kind
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:20.360]   of show um what else is there uh is there anything else i think that's we feel like i've used up all
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:25.880]   of apple tv plus i don't think there's any there's much left i wasn't maybe i'll watch that brooklyn
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:33.000]   show a little longer but viseo uh was it viseo that's uh or was it lg that lg said they were gonna have
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.880]   apple tv built in and then they said they're no we're not now they say they are so
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:44.840]   anything else to say about that i don't think so i think that's going back to older phone our
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:51.800]   older tv's too right back to the 2018 lg right yeah as it should that's great i am unfortunately
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:58.440]   mine's 2016 so i'm not going to be any benefit no i don't like smart tv's honestly in fact i have
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:04.840]   to say the apple tv plus app on roku is awful compared to the apple tv plus app on apple
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:12.600]   if you want apple tv get an apple tv oh yeah i should ask is there gonna be an apple tv this fall
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:19.240]   i don't if there is a new one i don't know if it's this fall or not there should be it's good
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:25.880]   timing for it yeah now i would buy one even if i don't get another year disney or apple tv plus
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:30.840]   well do you have the fork yeah i'm the ultra well what what would you need to make
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:35.160]   why would you buy a new one oh i know is what i'm getting at actually i did buy a new one because
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:41.160]   they wear out well they overheat okay yeah and then so i had a bad one so i bought a replacement but uh
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:46.760]   no you're not quite powerful enough like they can't cause it over hdr cleanly yeah and that's
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:51.320]   well yeah for games but i mean i'm not a gamer so for me it's just like uh you're struggling with
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:54.760]   the hdr compositing and i really wish you were a little bit more powerful so that could be more
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:57.560]   elegant little more juice what is in there an a8
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:05.800]   uh an a10 isn't it an a10x a10x okay wait this one here yeah okay and i think it's going to
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:11.800]   eight fall of x i have run out of stories so you know what that means good news our picks of the
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:19.000]   week are next let's kick off picks of the week this week i think it's your turn rene to start the
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:25.800]   ball rolling okay so i did something that was holaciously ill-advised over the weekend i decided to
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:33.560]   um react to reddit's uh slash r slash apple sub and just go through some of their top stories
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:40.840]   and uh give some opinions you know some thoughts on them and the reddit website has always been
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:47.640]   abominable just horrible on ios devices and you'd think it'd be hard to mess up a website but you
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:53.080]   would be wrong like previously just it wouldn't fit right it wouldn't move right the latest version
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:57.240]   sometimes it doesn't even scroll like it'll load up the page and you can't scroll it and you try to
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:02.600]   go to desktop view and it makes the font like three letters can fit on the on an entire iphone
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:08.440]   screen and it's just i don't know what you have to do to make a mobile website this bad or just a
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:13.400]   website in general this bad especially if you're a monster web company but everybody agrees with
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:19.080]   you by the way rene i don't i don't know anybody who uses the browser no and it's a website that's
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:26.040]   all so i went to i went to one of my perennial favorites uh which is apollo um which is a not
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:31.880]   the official reddit app because i was fed up enough with the official reddit stuff i wanted
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:36.840]   something that only an indy apple developer could do and that is to give a damn about the product
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:43.240]   that they were designing developing and shipping and wow is apollo just it is so nice it is i agree
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:50.600]   on an ios ios app uh yeah nadian developer christian which is always one of my favorite things uh but
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:57.000]   he just does such a good caring considerate job and you can you can log in and has all your stuff the
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:02.840]   sub edits you go to all the interactions that you'd expect it just it makes it does the impossible
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:07.640]   it makes reddit usable on mobile and i think for that it deserves some kind of nobel prize i
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:12.680]   could i couldn't agree with you more it's i've used a lot of them i use narwhal for a while but
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:18.280]   everybody seems to agree apollo is the only way to read reddit and you know i like reddit if you
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:24.840]   choose the right subreddits like the r/r/apple um there's a few too many pictures of my new mac
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:30.920]   in there but uh but there's also a lot of useful information i agree with you ichon is great
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:35.640]   slash apple is super salty but that's kind of what makes it fun salty's fun salty's fun salty's good
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:40.120]   yeah and if you're a coder there's a lot of good coding uh sub-readits yeah a shortcut
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:45.080]   sub-readit is a sub-readit is amazing shortcuts oh that's right that's right a lot of good ones i
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:49.880]   forgot yeah yeah yeah that's really good so i agree with you and i think if you're gonna do it on ios
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:54.120]   you got to use apollo and the self-road for pokemon leo they're not gonna go down that rabbit hole
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:58.440]   right now but that's another really good sub-readit oh the silk road it's a bunch of math and statistic
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:04.920]   and analyzing everything about the video game now apollo is free but they want you to pay for like
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:11.000]   premier plan right yeah yeah and the free version is good the subscription is well worth i mean throwing
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:17.560]   money at them no in fact i keep paying them extra yeah keep giving them more of my money
[01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:22.680]   i think i had to pay for dark mode that was that was really the reason to put me over the top i
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:31.000]   really like that apollo app.io thank you rene andi and not co your pick of the week uh my pick is
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.240]   so not free but more valuable than anything else you're gonna be spending your money on
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:38.200]   uh just a reminder to get your flu shot this year is it time?
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:42.920]   September and october are the months that you're supposed to get your flu shot it's when they've
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:46.600]   they've developed the flu shot for this year and you're getting it early enough that it's going to
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:52.840]   be very very useful uh you can go to vaccinefinder.org which is a site that's run by boston children's
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:57.800]   hospital that will just tell you do have the only problem is that it's not just for flu shots you
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:02.440]   do have to choose flu shot amongst the table of like a hundred different shots but then just tell
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:06.200]   you tell them where you are and it'll find any place that is actually offering them although here
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:12.280]   in the united states pretty much any uh any drugstore uh ever or any walmart is offering flu shots
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:18.440]   and i i have to admit that i've never i do have an appointment for next week or the week after
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:22.920]   i've never really gotten i've never gotten a flu shot before because my thinking had always been
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:27.640]   well i've just i just never get sick i've never gotten the flu and oh you want to get this year
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:33.880]   yes well also also because it's sort of heightened the thing of yes well maybe maybe you're carrying
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.640]   maybe you you're carrying the virus and you you were a little tired a couple of days and that's
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:42.920]   how much it hit you but in the meantime you were infecting other people uh so i think it's part of
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:47.880]   our civic duty to make sure we get our annual flu shot once again anytime september in october best
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:53.000]   time to do it it's it's that we took it's it's kind of fun that just remember that every time they
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.960]   release a new iphone they also release a new seasonal view flu vaccine so you want to you want to get
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:02.200]   in on that right away just like you'd be camping out uh in front of the apple store back in the
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:07.240]   good old days they don't have them yet and are uh it's funny because it's it's safe it's all drug
[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:12.840]   drugstores and uh and uh uh food stores but a lot of them are doing that uh but they but i don't think
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:18.440]   they've received their shots yet because they all say not currently provided but but i'm trying to
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:23.080]   decide i'm running in the cusp should i get the 65 plus version or should i get the one for the
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:28.760]   youts i don't know you know get the you're gonna want the one with the extra storage because when
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:35.160]   you copy a bit oh sorry talk about flu shots i think i think that's the right answer though so you're
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:42.600]   gonna save up get the flu shot plus vaccine finder.org yeah i want the flu shot plus the max yeah uh
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:50.760]   rene i'm sorry uh laura your turn okay so my pick this week comes from alison
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:57.000]   sharden oh yes whom i know from chit chat across the pond but she also does a bunch of other podcasts
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:04.280]   she has a podcast with bart bus shots which i apologize if i butchred your last name
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:11.720]   it the podcast is called taming the terminal oh but what's very exciting about this is that
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:20.280]   um alison and some and a friend of hers oh actually turned so what happens was that they would do
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:27.240]   the podcast taming the terminal and bart would actually have his his notes on how to actually do
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:36.520]   these things so alison and um dr helmer vander linden turned that into an actual pdf book or or
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:42.680]   there's actually a bunch of different versions that you can um download and listen to and um if you go
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:51.160]   to let me make sure that i've got pod feet dot com that's right um uh download ttt book this is
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:57.800]   where you can find it in apple books you can get an e-pub that includes audio you can get the pdf
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:03.880]   form you can get it as a um kindle book so there she's they've they've developed like multiple
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:10.200]   formats so that you can actually what read it in any format that you want and it's it's totally
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:18.040]   free and it's like a learning tool for you to um learn about using terminal which um alison actually
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:22.840]   said she thought you'd be really you'd really appreciate that leo i do because she knows i'm
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:27.480]   i'm all about the terminal yeah we've done a little bit of that in our hands on mac but i
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:30.680]   you know i was reluctant to spend too much time in the terminal i didn't want to leave people
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:37.000]   weren't interested uh out but boy this looks like it goes really deep into really powerful stuff so
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:46.600]   it's fantastic yeah taming the terminal and it's free yes thank you alison yes thank you alison for
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:54.120]   introducing us actually i have a terminal command for you how about that this comes from uh a
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:36:00.360]   listener as as you know i've been doing hands-on macintosh for a while and i've shown how to use
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:06.040]   brew which is my favorite for installing uh terminal applications and so forth there's a number
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:11.160]   of package managers but brew is the most common one and uh i mentioned when i was showing that how
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:17.640]   brew file would let you save all your installed apps and make it easy to quickly reinstall uh
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:24.440]   everything with with a new mac but uh then one of our uh community members at the community saguaro
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:30.520]   said well you said something about saving your preferences from your applications and i said
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:35.560]   well whoa hold on now wait a minute that's going too far i don't know anything about that i could
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:41.240]   tell you how to save preferences from command lines you know your dot files well he's come up
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:48.840]   with uh something and actually this is a a really cool program called mac up as in backup
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:54.120]   in fact once you install mac up you do it with brew and it's available also on linux i should
[01:36:54.120 --> 01:37:01.320]   say uh and then you type the word mac up backup it does something kind of clever it's a really it's
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:06.680]   a simple python script but what it does is it copies copies a lot of the p-lists and configure
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:14.200]   information uh from a big number of applications it actually copies them to your drop box or your
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:19.560]   google driver i cloud look at all the applications it supports and then makes a link back to their
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:26.760]   normal location so as you change your update settings for a huge variety of apple apps there's
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:35.240]   a lot gooeys as well as command line you're actually just changing uh the drop box file
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:39.560]   and so it's automatically backed up for you you don't even have to run the program more than once
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:45.080]   just to set this it's basically a script that just sets this up and now you're automatically
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:50.600]   getting everything backed up which means it's very quick to restore it using well you did mac up
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:58.040]   backup mac up restore to then restore all of your files from drop box it supports a variety of
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:03.560]   locations it's a little complicated uh you have if you want to have it be anything but drop box
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:09.160]   you have to modify i can fig file that doesn't exist but uh it is actually pretty powerful it's
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:15.560]   really cool the one thing i would bring up is it doesn't encrypt those files so if you're putting
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:21.160]   things like p g p keys or ssh keys into your backups you should make sure you back them up
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:27.480]   somewhere fairly safe um so i'm we're gonna address this probably on a hands-on mac uh episode
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:31.720]   coming up in the near future but i thought i'd mention this today because it's free it's on
