[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.720]   It's time for Macbreak Weekly to show the covers the latest news
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.400]   from Cupertino sitting to my left, the good looking,
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.160]   and the talented Andy.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.440]   No, that's not Andy.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.640]   The less good looking and talented-- no.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.840]   Just teasing Mr. Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   Andy's enjoying it, though.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.640]   Andy's laughing.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.480]   He's shortening from the Pixel Core, Pixel Core.com
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.280]   for that great group of multimedia artists working together.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.280]   A guy, a friend of mine, walked up to me on the streets
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.320]   and my wife just passed her classes in 3D animation.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.400]   She's looking for work.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.240]   She doesn't know what to do.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.800]   Next, I said, I know a guy you should meet.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.480]   Yeah, we're having a lot of fun.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.200]   P-I-X-E-L-C-O-R.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.200]   We finished our first year from--
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.640]   since our new launch.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.200]   And we met an important milestone.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.920]   What was that?
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.160]   We actually distributed more work to our members
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160]   than we took in membership.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.880]   So it really is-- I'm not kidding when I say it's a way
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.000]   to get work by a factor of two and a half.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.960]   Wow, that's great.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.040]   So one of the things that we've been doing--
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.240]   we've been very careful not to talk about that in the past
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.880]   because we didn't want to promise anything
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.640]   and everything else, and we still can't promise it.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.600]   But what we do is not only do we train people and organize them
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600]   and get them working together.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.920]   But we find ways to get work out to them.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.720]   And it's been--
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.360]   That's so awesome.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.160]   Last year has been a--
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.960]   That's fantastic.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.720]   Our first year where we're actually distributing more
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.240]   then comes in from membership.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.760]   Very good.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.360]   Also here.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.120]   He is also lovely and talented.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.280]   And the enough co of the Chicago Challenge.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.120]   And if it's any consolation, Alex,
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.280]   it's because I'm more emotionally needy than you.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.680]   So I just am doing it to make him happy.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.080]   I'm like one of those characters on 30 Rock
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.680]   where Tina Fey has to just keep pumping him up,
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.880]   pipping up just to make sure they show up on time
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.600]   and on schedule and reasonably sober.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.320]   So really, you should take that as a compliment
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.560]   that they gave me the compliments about you.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.400]   Right.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.120]   I think he just wants you to play the ukulele a little bit more.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.800]   I know I do.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.240]   See, that's my-- that's my stardee, the passive aggressive
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.720]   stuff.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.160]   Like if I don't want you to leave to use,
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.840]   I need this stuff.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.080]   I'll start playing really, really expensive Rolling
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.600]   Stones music to license.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.160]   We'd also--
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.360]   It's me.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.400]   I'll play the public domain stuff.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.720]   I'd also like to welcome into our chatroom Howard Stern.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.160]   So it's great to have Howard.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.840]   You know, why would somebody go in the chat room
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.640]   and go Baba Bui?
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.480]   Like somehow he's doing it.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.200]   It's so funny.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.160]   It's like, I don't care.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.680]   Go ahead, please.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.280]   Be my guess.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.600]   Oh my gosh.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.800]   Oh my gosh.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.640]   We've been Baba Bui'd.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.560]   Let's get to the stories.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.280]   Boy, there are some big stories this week.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.000]   I hardly know where to begin.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.440]   $39 billion.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.760]   That's a good story.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.040]   And a good story for--
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.160]   I guess for T-Mobile, which AT&T is announced on Sunday.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.280]   Probably good for AT&T.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.360]   Terrible for the rest of us, don't you think?
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.400]   If I get better service, I think that the real question is,
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.800]   is when does AT&T get big enough where
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.080]   we have to split them all up again?
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.920]   I mean, it seems like they went back out
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.560]   and then they came back together.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.560]   So I think that there is--
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.640]   I think the T-Mobile wasn't going to survive.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.120]   I think it had to do something.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.440]   I mean, I think that it--
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.000]   I think both T-Mobile-- I think this puts a lot of pressure
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.960]   on Sprint.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.160]   Verizon says we're not buying Sprint.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.920]   Sprint was trying to buy T-Mobile.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.200]   But now, of course, even if regulatory approval,
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.800]   they don't get it.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.880]   The price is a little steep for Sprint to buy.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.280]   I think one of the interesting things
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.720]   is that they-- some of the news has really said
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.520]   that they were growing.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.480]   T-Mobile was doing well until the iPhone came out.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.840]   And it really--
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.880]   Yeah, everybody was doing well until the iPhone came out.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.040]   iPhone-- you could clearly say this is the Apple effect
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.600]   for T-Mobile.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.560]   And frankly, for Sprint too, the two companies
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.680]   that don't have iPhones.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.760]   I have to tell you, though, and I agree with--
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.040]   Om Malek wrote a piece on Giga Om saying,
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.520]   this is not good for anyone.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.360]   Fewer cell phone companies is not good.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.560]   The companies with T-Mobile, of course, they had lower prices.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.480]   They were more aggressive.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.080]   They didn't have bandwidth caps.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.920]   And you could buy unlocked phones and use them with T-Mobile.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.480]   This just gives more power to Verizon and AT&T,
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.360]   makes Sprint a weakling.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.320]   And as Om Malek says, it kills innovation in the market.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.120]   Now, of course, it has to be approved by the FCC.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.400]   And I presume the FTC as well.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.720]   And I think it's going to be a hard one.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.640]   I mean, it's not going to be an obvious--
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.280]   we shouldn't assume that the merger is done,
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.880]   because this is going to be a very, very steep and arduous
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.680]   uphill battle to get--
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.080]   Well, I think what happens--
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.400]   and we talked about this a little bit on Twitter--
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.000]   I think what happens is the FCC is going to approve it,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.560]   because T-Mobile is shaky.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.880]   But they're going to extract some net neutrality requirements
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.600]   out of AT&T, which I think is fine.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.960]   They're going to get something out of it.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.480]   AT&T already in the press release spins it.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.760]   This is good for America.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.360]   49 million people who wouldn't have a 4G network
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.920]   will now have it.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.240]   95% of all America will have access to our new 4G network.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.000]   They're saying, in fact, they even use the words,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.640]   this is good for rural America.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.280]   This is part of the FCC's--
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.360]   this is part of the FCC's broadband plan
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.200]   they should approve it.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.080]   So they're really spinning like crazy.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.360]   Well, and I think that one of the things that hopefully we're
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.760]   going to see is forcing them to open up some of the lines.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.200]   I think one of the reasons we have such bad bandwidth
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.440]   in San Francisco, ironically, is because the AT&T--
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.960]   Right.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.600]   And it blocking a lot of other services going in.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.760]   And I think being required to open those up
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.240]   as part of this process would be very good for consumers.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.720]   You've got to understand, though, now, with AT&T and Verizon,
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.760]   they'll have locked up 70% of the market.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.200]   Sprint has 11.9%.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.360]   That's the next biggest company.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.400]   No, no, Verizon.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.560]   Verizon and AT&T together are 70%.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.240]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, right.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.760]   iPhone carriers, in other words.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.280]   And also means-- It's hard to see how you end up with--
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.880]   how do you-- how to sprint survive?
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.600]   I just don't know how that--
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.480]   It also means there's only one GSM carrier in the US.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.880]   I think that's a big deal, too.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.440]   Andy, what do you think?
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.760]   As an AT&T subscriber, it doesn't affect me directly,
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.280]   but I'm concerned that now you don't have--
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.720]   T-Mobile used to be the best alternative carrier out there.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.840]   Because, as you said, the only way that they could remain
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.400]   competitive is to give the best features to consumers.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.800]   I think there are also-- not only were they one
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.280]   of the few major carriers who would let you simply bring
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.440]   in a phone from God knows where and just buy a data plan for it,
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.560]   there are also the company that seemed to mess people
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.000]   around the least on fees and just totally weird fees
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.200]   that come out of nowhere.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:03.680]   So I would feel more strongly against this,
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.600]   if not for the fact that I would--
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.000]   I was not someone who would normally recommend T-Mobile
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.040]   to anybody only because of coverage issues.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.800]   But I just think, in principle--
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.280]   no, this isn't going to be a good thing for consumers.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.920]   Here in the Hinterlands, T-Mobile is as good as any other carrier.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.480]   I use T-Mobile on my Nexus 1 and Nexus S.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.880]   And I like T-Mobile.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.920]   When I was traveling, T-Mobile was the only company
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.560]   that gave me unlimited texting, international texting,
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.960]   for not a very expensive fee.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.480]   So they're also trying to differentiate themselves
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.680]   with 4G coverage for the iPad announcement a few weeks ago.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.560]   I had a T-Mobile 4G phone with me as a wireless hotspot.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.800]   How was it?
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.840]   Very, very good.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.000]   All 4G has problems giving you the speeds
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.440]   that any carrier promises.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.520]   But I had two different 4G phones with me,
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.120]   and the T-Mobile was definitely stronger, at least,
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.240]   in San Francisco.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.560]   So that's the sort of freedom that is going to be deleted now.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.320]   If T-Mobile was completely absorbed into AT&T,
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.320]   the idea that if you have a situation or an area in which
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.840]   you just need that extra feature, you need that extra speed,
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.560]   or there's a coverage gap that no one else is really covering for you,
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.120]   now you've got option minus one.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.400]   Well, I think that's the issue for me.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   I like choice.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.000]   I keep on wondering whether, as this stuff continues to progress,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.440]   whether I'm using FaceTime more or FaceTime or Skype
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.280]   or other things like that, I probably
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.560]   use that 80% of the time compared to myself.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.640]   I know I'm not typical.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.400]   I know I'm not typical.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.520]   I have to admit, at this point, no, I have to admit, at this point,
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.400]   I clearly was wrong about FaceTime.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.120]   Because when we were at Momos, we asked,
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.920]   because I have been very blunt about saying,
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.880]   nobody's ever going to use this.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.440]   This is stupid.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.880]   Nobody wants to make video calls via a cell phone.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.440]   You have to be in Wi-Fi.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.360]   Wouldn't you use Skype?
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.600]   We asked the Momos crowd.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.760]   Half of them were using FaceTime.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.760]   So I was wrong, obviously.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.200]   But what I keep on thinking is that Apple's ability
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.600]   or other organizations ability to, if you really
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.240]   were able to get either a Wi-Fi network or the next generation
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.280]   of whatever that's going to be, you could almost
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.520]   start building that infrastructure
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:17.640]   to let people use that in a much more wide way.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.600]   And that could end up being a whole nother option for people
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.880]   who are using who right now are stuck with what we would
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.840]   consider cell.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.000]   And I have to admit, most of this is the stuff
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.120]   that I've been talking to people about in a couple
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.400]   different countries in Africa, where they're no longer
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.640]   putting down wired lines.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.600]   And it's cell, but they're also looking at Wi-Max.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.040]   They're looking at which of Wi-Max and 4G are kind of similar,
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.280]   depending on how you--
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.840]   Well, 4G is such a weird term.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.800]   There is a technical term, but nothing's 4G.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.560]   Even LTE isn't technically 4G.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.280]   And certainly HSPA+, which T-Mobile uses isn't 4G.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.080]   But from the point of view of a user,
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.560]   and you said the right thing, which is it's faster.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.440]   So it's 4G.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.440]   It's faster than 3G.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.480]   It makes it 4G.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.240]   But when I look at being able to build this in a bunch
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.960]   of large markets, and to really test it,
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.120]   and to kind of push it down, I mean,
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.000]   it would take a company that made hardware,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.640]   like made the hardware that could make it work.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.760]   And they would have to have tens of billions of dollars
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.840]   in the bank to flip that on.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.320]   Right.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.200]   Oh, who would be able to do that?
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.960]   When you look at what Apple could
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.960]   do with a mobile me service, they could do a lot more than just--
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.800]   I mean, they have the cash on hand,
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   and they're making the cash on hand
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.760]   to theoretically start lighting up
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.960]   an awful lot of services if they chose to.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.520]   Well, they've said now that they're
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.160]   going to use that North Carolina Network Operations Center
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.080]   for an improved mobile me and iTunes, right?
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   Well, that's the rumor.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.760]   I don't know if they've said it officially.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.360]   I think they said it officially.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:47.680]   I don't think--
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.200]   Well, I don't know.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.000]   Apple doesn't say anything.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.600]   They don't say anything.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.520]   They had a time.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.080]   But I just feel like that it seems
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.920]   to me the natural progression of mobile me is--
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.520]   yeah, first of all, that you do this stuff
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.720]   if you have a connected door Wi-Fi.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.960]   But Apple has the cash and the ability,
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.240]   and they bristle at having to deal
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.200]   with these cell phone manufacturers.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.000]   So our cell phone providers, it just seems like you could
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   definitely see them starting to go down the path.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.440]   I thought Google might do that, too.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.760]   Remember when Google was bidding in the Spectre Moxion?
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.680]   I thought, oh, this is great.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.880]   Google become a carrier.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.320]   I personally think that Apple, Google, Amazon, and Netflix.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.240]   So just all get together and just build something.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:22.840]   And you wouldn't have--
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.440]   Eliminate all world governments and just take--
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.840]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.880]   If you just-- if you took the top 20 markets
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.400]   and you canvassed them with one gig pipes, you would--
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.760]   and then made it widely available for not much money,
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.320]   you would put so much pressure on these other folks
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.160]   that it would give you a lot of leverage.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.480]   It would be worth throwing--
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.000]   those companies have the money.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.280]   It'd be worth throwing $30, $40 billion
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.400]   into it just to press AT&T and Verizon's nose to the ground.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.640]   Well, I'd love to see that.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.080]   Who wouldn't love to see that?
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.320]   Say uncle, AT&T, say uncle.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.240]   But you wouldn't have to do it to the whole nation.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.080]   You just have to take the top markets
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.440]   and you just focus all of your efforts there.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.560]   But everybody wants to be in the business of running luxury
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.560]   salon spas.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.600]   No one wants to be in the business of laying all the sewer
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.560]   pipes to make it happen.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.720]   I mean, that's the problem.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.320]   But you did touch on something interesting.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.320]   But with all these companies, they're
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.880]   going to be able to project power in the next five years.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.920]   So the ones that control huge data centers,
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.520]   the ability to simply push data from point A to point B.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.280]   And over the past few weeks, it really has occurred to me
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.480]   that if there's one company that can compete with Apple
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.760]   so much so that they could, with the right kind of moves,
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.880]   even become a threat to Apple, it would be Amazon.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.920]   All they're missing is one Google-based--
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.800]   Google Android-based tablet where
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.440]   they put their own software team on it
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.040]   to build everything from the ground up, take away everything
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.840]   that's Google-ific about Android, produce a really nice,
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.160]   pleasant user experience.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.560]   And now they've got a tablet that's
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.000]   hooked up to the biggest bookstore in the world,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.520]   a really good streaming video service
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.560]   that you get free with a $60 subscription fee per year,
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.320]   now a built-in app store, built-in software store,
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.000]   and and and and.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.360]   And then make moves in that direction.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.360]   Would that be the kindro?
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.920]   We're going to talk about that in a second,
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.560]   and why Microsoft's not happy, and why Apple's not happy.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.760]   The lawsuits are coming fast and furious, kids.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.120]   We'll do that in just a second.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.160]   You're watching Mac Break Weekly with Andy Inako,
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.320]   Alex Lindsay, I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.600]   More to come in just a second before we go much farther,
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.160]   though I would like to mention our friends from Canada
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.120]   who brought us maple butter.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.560]   They've been holding out on us, you know.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.200]   Andre Nontel is in the studio, and he brought me maple butter.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.560]   Do you know what maple butter is?
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.360]   Apparently, the Kenny Aids are holding on to it for dear life.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.160]   Oh, maple butter.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.680]   That's so good.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.240]   You know what else comes from Canada?
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.120]   How much are you eating, or what else are you doing with this stuff?
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.640]   Have you ever--
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.760]   Andy, have you had--
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.000]   Bring me some maple butter.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Quick.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.440]   We need some bread.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.680]   No, you don't eat bread.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.080]   Well, you must--
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.000]   I live just within a quick couple of gallons of gas away
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.120]   from Vermont.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.360]   America's sugaring capital.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.720]   Next time that you're here for either leaf peeping
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.080]   or for just for your cheese, dairy, blueberries,
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.720]   or your maple sugar beans, why not pick up to New England?
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.120]   We have people who made it from scratch.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.080]   That's where the country started.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:15.920]   You know what?
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.720]   The cradle of liberty.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.600]   Yeah, but really, don't Canadians make the best maple butter?
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.360]   I'm sure they do.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.160]   They have more maple trees.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.360]   Look at this.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.880]   The spoon stands up in it.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:33.800]   This is Le Nommar du Ponton, the murmur of spring.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.320]   Is that right?
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.200]   Andre, am I translating that correctly?
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:41.160]   Bur d'erabo, pure maple butter.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.640]   Springs murmur.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.640]   Whatever.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.800]   Whisper of spring.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.320]   Look at this.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.520]   See, in New England, we make a good working man's butter.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.360]   OK.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.040]   They say working man's butter without any of those pretensions.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.120]   You know, how many carbohydrates?
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.480]   Oh, my God.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.960]   Here, you better you better eat this.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.920]   This is for you.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.680]   It comes in a baby bought a baby food job.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.920]   So not to hurt yourself with it.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.720]   Oh, my God.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.960]   Tested out on your kid first.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.320]   I'll let you adjust the dose of the adults.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.320]   Oh, my I'm going to I'm going to die a bit of a comma right now,
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.040]   just from that.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:11.960]   The syrups could do now.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.880]   You brought me clear syrup.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.640]   Apparently they're holding out us.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.640]   Have you ever tasted anything like that?
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.080]   Have you had that before?
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:18.920]   All right.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.240]   You have had that before.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:20.880]   Yep.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.640]   It's not like makeable sugar candy.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.160]   It's basically--
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.120]   But it's like maple sugar candy, except butter.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.880]   Except you can spread it on bread.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.880]   Go ahead, Bob.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.560]   Dig in.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.280]   Bob Hylas in the studio.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.360]   It's just like maple sugar.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.800]   This is your reward for all these great microphones.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.000]   Sarah, where's the living?
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.360]   It's taking it with him.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.280]   You can't have it.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.280]   So I go ahead.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.880]   Sarah, I have some maple butter.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.080]   It's incredible.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.600]   We're going to--
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   I don't know.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.480]   It's hover ad turned into a maple butter ad.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.800]   But I'm just saying there's good things
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.760]   that come from Canada, including hover.com.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.560]   Isn't that good?
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.280]   Holy moly.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.600]   And William Shatner.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.480]   Come out of Canada.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.680]   And Murray, William Shatner, Gordon Lightfoot.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:09.000]   Maple butter and hover.com.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.080]   Hover.com.
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:11.880]   How did we get here?
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.200]   Hover.com-- by the way, some people-- if I say that,
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.840]   I would like to say it from Canada,
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.760]   because people think, oh, well, then I can only
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.480]   get the .ca registrations.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.640]   But no, in fact, that you can .com,
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.880]   dot everything.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.200]   Go to Macbreak.hovr.com.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.040]   It's the old domain direct.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.920]   The folks at Two Cows do this.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.720]   And they do such a great job of it.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.640]   Macbreak.hover.com.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.600]   I keep getting tweets.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.120]   I should actually roll through some of these tweets.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.680]   Because I keep getting tweets from people who say,
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.440]   thank you, Leo, for telling us about hover.com.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.000]   And it is easy.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.560]   It is simple.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.560]   It's fast.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.360]   It's affordable.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.080]   And no upsell, not all those clicks.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.040]   Those other guys spend millions of dollars on Super Bowl ads.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.320]   Hover.com advertises on Twitch.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.480]   Who do you like better?
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.120]   Exactly.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.000]   Exactly.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:58.800]   They're Canadians.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.880]   You got a lot of them.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.960]   Transfere your domain to hover for only $10,
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.560]   which includes a year registration.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.960]   So if you've got domains that you want to transfer over
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.360]   from those other guys, it's very simple to do.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.520]   They'll charge you $10, but then you get an additional year.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.400]   The high up here are 40 sounds like maple butter tastes.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:17.960]   That's right.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:18.840]   That's actually right.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.720]   That's correct.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.240]   That is correct.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.360]   Our chat room knows.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.400]   It's the maple butter of microphones.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.920]   Register your domain and save 10% right now when you use
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.400]   Macbreak.hover.com.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.080]   And by the way, they don't upsell you on things like,
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.960]   who is privacy, which I always get.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.040]   Because I don't want people calling me by my house.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.520]   Because they know my domain name, right?
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.640]   It's automatic.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.040]   There's no upsell to it.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.000]   They give it to you.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.960]   It's part of the deal.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.320]   They know you want that.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.520]   And Hover doesn't sell hosting or a lot of other things.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.240]   It's very simple.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.440]   It's for email addresses, forwarding email,
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.360]   redirecting domains to other other countries.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.480]   It's like, you don't want someone doing everything for you.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.600]   You want isolated--
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.760]   A little might.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.840]   I don't.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.280]   It's like a gauntlet right now.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.920]   When you try to register for something--
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.280]   And would you like this?
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.440]   And would you like this service?
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.640]   And would you like some blue cheese?
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.440]   No.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:05.920]   I don't.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.840]   Another thing, by the way, when you call Hover during business
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.200]   hours, they promise you--
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.440]   You will not be put on hold.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.280]   Let me tell you, the other guys, they promise you
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.240]   you will be put on hold.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.840]   So there's a difference there.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.600]   I have never spent more time listening to crappy music
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.720]   on hold than with those other guys.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.080]   If you have a lot of domains to transfer,
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.800]   go to Macbreak.hover.com.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.280]   Click the Transfer Your Domain button.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:32.000]   And they'll do it for you for one flat rate, just $25,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.680]   no matter how many domains you have.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.840]   I wish I had done that, to be honest.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:43.040]   866-7316-556, mention Macbreak, or just go to Macbreak.h-o-v-e-r.com.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.320]   Hover.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.200]   It's Canadian.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.440]   It's got to be good.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.960]   With a name like Hover, it should float.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.040]   OK, so we talked about AT&T and T-Mobile.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.400]   That was the big story, certainly, of the week.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.520]   But there's a lot of other ones.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.240]   For instance, on Friday, iPads go on sale worldwide.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.280]   Will there be any?
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.840]   It's a big question, Mark.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.600]   Everybody will get 10.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.000]   Yeah, 10 for France, 10 for Germany, 10 for Canada.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.920]   And the first 20 people in line at every one of those countries
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.040]   has got to start just shipping them to other countries.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.840]   Can you get an iPad to today if you--
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.920]   people walk into stores.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.200]   Somebody in our chat room says he was just
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.080]   seven in line behind the last one that they had.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.200]   So they're getting new shipments.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.880]   So yeah, they got a lot of stores got huge shipments
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.320]   last night for sale today.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.120]   But I tweeted about that last night.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.960]   And so it was happy to find out that it was actually true.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.760]   But even then, there were just dozens and dozens of people
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.640]   in line at the start of the store.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.600]   And a lot of people who Charlie Brown themselves out
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.560]   of being just second to late, a second person too late
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.040]   to get the iPad.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.200]   Well, and right now, the way that they have it managed,
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.960]   it's a little complex.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.520]   And I think that they were changing this.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.680]   But at the beginning of last week,
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.720]   the way that you would buy another iPad was in San Francisco.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.680]   In San Francisco is one of the largest stores, one of the most
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.400]   traffic stores.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.240]   You would start lining up-- people would start
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.880]   lining up at 8 o'clock at night.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.600]   And they'd wait all night.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.720]   And then they'd start handing out tickets in the morning,
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.680]   like 6.30 or 7 o'clock in the morning.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.720]   And then if they ran out of tickets, that was it.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.160]   There's no more left.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.080]   But you wouldn't find out until the morning.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.680]   And if you came in the morning, your chances of getting into a line
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.880]   and getting it were extremely low.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.560]   And is it really worth--
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.480]   is it standing, bending all night in line?
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.040]   Is it that much?
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.040]   I know.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.040]   I know.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.800]   It's important to remember that this is not a donor kidney.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.280]   That if you go to--
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.360]   I'm serious.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.800]   If you go to apple.com/store, place an online order.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.560]   At some point, you will get an iPad, too,
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.440]   and you never have to camp out at all.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.600]   Yeah, no camping calls.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.440]   It's a great device.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.320]   But even when I bought my 3G iPad last year,
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.640]   I didn't even consider trying to play that game.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.400]   It was if I have to wait two or three weeks to get it,
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.080]   I'd much rather play two or three weeks.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.920]   It's OK.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.680]   Many generations born, were born, lived, and died
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.760]   without ever even knowing of the iPad, too.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.280]   I know.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.560]   I don't know how they survived.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:18.960]   I will say, though, that when the 3G S came out,
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.640]   I was not available or something.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.600]   I didn't want to stand in lines.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.840]   I figured, oh, I'll just go get it in two days or whatever.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.960]   And then it was sold out forever.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.040]   And it turned out that it was like--
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.520]   I waited six weeks before I could just comfortably walk in
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.840]   and without standing in some kind of crazy long line
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.280]   or whatever.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.960]   And I learned my lesson.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.080]   Now I'm in line.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.960]   Let's get the first day, call it a day.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.960]   Well, if you're lucky enough to have an iPad, too,
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:45.120]   later in our picks of the week, I will show you a magic trick.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:45.640]   Magic trick.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:50.800]   A $5 magic trick that will turn on amazing new secret features.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.560]   I know what that is.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.080]   You know what it is.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.440]   I think you told me about it.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.400]   I might have forwarded it.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.040]   I don't remember.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.200]   Amazing.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.000]   I think I've got it.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.560]   Let me see.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.480]   No.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.880]   Oh, yeah, did it.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.880]   Anyway, you'll find out.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.720]   So we did talk for the last couple of weeks about what
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.240]   the earthquake in tsunami in Japan
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.400]   might mean for the iPad 2.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.400]   There are, in fact, according to all things,
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:22.240]   the three key iPad parts, which can only be made in Japan.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.720]   Actually, five parts that come from Japanese suppliers,
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.320]   but three of them just can't come from anywhere else.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.960]   This is from iSupply.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.960]   I love talking about iSupply on the Twit this week.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:39.400]   And the panel marveled that you could just create a company
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.400]   and just kind of guess at what stuff must cost,
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.800]   put out a press release, and get so much attention.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.400]   That's a good business model.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.240]   We think that must have cost $100 to make.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.360]   You get all this coverage.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.160]   That's a good business model.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.800]   Oh, it's a profit deal, eh?
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.800]   I like that business model.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.360]   I think that remains as we speak.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.280]   Don't cut to me while I start making some money.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:09.200]   I'm going to start guessing that this laptop cost $1,243.63
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.360]   to make.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:14.560]   This just in Apple laptops cost $1,243 to make.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.200]   And $63.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.880]   According to Alex Supply.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.560]   So according to iSupply-- and I don't know if you want to believe
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:26.080]   this or not-- they think that the screen is uniquely made
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.640]   in Japan.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.840]   They found it to be more flexible and durable than the glass
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.280]   used in iPad 1.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:39.360]   It's made, they think, of Dragon Trail glass.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.080]   Don't laugh.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:40.640]   Don't laugh.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.400]   We're not done yet.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.360]   There's more.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.920]   I thought you were going to say Dragon Scale.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.440]   It's me.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.320]   That is why it is so powerful.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.240]   They grind up the Dragon Scales,
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.480]   and then they put it in the glass,
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.840]   and that is why it's scratchable.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.080]   Well, it is fired in the furnaces of Mordor.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.760]   Yes.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.760]   Apparently, Dragon Trail glass is manufactured only by one
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.360]   place, a sahi glass of Japan.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.160]   Two of the company's facilities were damaged in the quake last year.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.880]   Also, the iPad 2's battery-- and this
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.080]   is a little bit more substantial because most lithium-ion
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.480]   batteries apparently are made in Japan--
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.040]   and the electronic compass.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:18.760]   The iPad 2 battery apparently made by Apple Japan,
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.040]   and the compass by AKM-semi-conductor.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.440]   Both companies-- both plants escape the quake unscathed.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.920]   But of course, you've got power supply slipping, shipping
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.160]   and logistical issues, and so forth.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.000]   So add to the fact that the iPad is an impossibly short
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   to supply due to demand, to the fact
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.760]   that you may not be able to even make some of these.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.160]   This could be a real shortage.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.560]   Well, I think that what's interesting about it
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.240]   is, is this process-- and this gives an argument about why
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.600]   Apple is not giving up that cash, not sending out dividends,
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.520]   not-- you know, they're hanging on to all the cash
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.440]   that they have in the company--
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.400]   that they're able to buy futures on a lot of these pieces.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.760]   And futures for the listeners is that you're buying
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.960]   at a certain cost, regardless of what the market cost is.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.960]   And so they were able to buy these futures long in advance.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.240]   So even if the cost doubles, they're
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.320]   still paying the same amount.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.120]   But Motorola and everybody else is paying whatever--
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.240]   Of course, if it's the market rate of--
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.840]   If your part's not to be had, doesn't matter what price you get.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.760]   Right.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.520]   But I think a lot of times the parts are going to be had.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.960]   And they have agreements, and they're
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.080]   the biggest game in town when it comes to buying a lot of these
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:25.880]   parts.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.120]   They may even buy--
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.520]   I think they stocked up on NAMM, right?
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.840]   So they bought the world supply of--
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.640]   I think they did.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.640]   Man forever.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.240]   How much you have?
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.280]   You will take it all.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.840]   You need to check or just pull a PO or--
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.640]   We'll just ship it to--
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.720]   Is that one infinite loop?
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.080]   Is that $3 billion or $4 billion?
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.880]   I just need to put-- no--
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.200]   Actually, what number to put in front of this?
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.040]   I know you're joking.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.600]   But according to Piper Jaffrey, again, it's Gene Munster, who
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.280]   is--
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.280]   Crazy.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:56.200]   But he says they spent $3.9 billion earlier this year
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.880]   due to secure component supplies and capacity.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.200]   Now, if you don't--
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.040]   Come change for Apple.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.000]   Come change.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.520]   I got that in my backpack.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.360]   It's like a tenth of their cash position.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.120]   Less.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.680]   It's like a 20th.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.520]   God, it must be nice.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.200]   I mean, I think a couple months ago, they were at $60 billion,
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.400]   and they're building at a rate of--
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.360]   I think their savings is building at a rate of $10 or $15
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.120]   billion a year.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.120]   Doesn't that make you think we might be paying too much
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.480]   for Apple gear?
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.080]   Isn't that the first thing that comes to mind?
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.280]   They've got how much in the bank?
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.920]   We think that, but we keep--
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.920]   We still do it.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.760]   And we get in lines.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.960]   There is not a single person that
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.960]   was in the Apple line for the iPad 2 that didn't already
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.320]   own an iPad.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.040]   And most--
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.280]   Actually, this isn't Piper Jaffrey.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.080]   This is Tim Cook.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.120]   So it's true.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.120]   Tim Cook and an analyst call last week
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:49.000]   said Apple spent $3.9 billion to secure these components
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.400]   and capacity.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.240]   $3.9 billion.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.000]   But again, that's why Apple doesn't
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.880]   want to give up that cash because it gives them
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.880]   a lot of leverage.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.440]   And it's money in the bank because they can--
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.800]   I think it's pretty clear to sell as many iPad 2s
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.240]   as they can make, even if there's actually nothing inside
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.600]   the case they apparently can sell it.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.560]   They just sell it.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.200]   Here, this is a hollow, empty demo iPad 2,
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.040]   but someday you could redeem this for an actual iPad 2.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.560]   Wouldn't that be smart?
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.720]   Instead of tickets, just give me a plastic iPad 2.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.480]   So at least I could show my friends I've got one.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.800]   You can't play with it.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.320]   But I have it right here.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.000]   That would be smart.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.280]   There's a market there.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.720]   It's a business model.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.080]   My son goes to cell phone stores
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.640]   and gets-- they all have plastic dummy cell phones.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.120]   So I think he's selling those to his friends.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.960]   I don't know what's going on, but he goes to those stores
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.400]   and he like, oh, yeah, I haven't made it from my rounds yet.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.040]   And he goes around and says, you got any extra old phones?
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.000]   And he buys the ones that they don't show anymore.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.640]   What did they do with those?
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.120]   I think he sells them to his friends.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:52.620]   I don't know.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.160]   I don't want to do Naomi Camels.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.560]   I'm just like, throw them at pizza.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.680]   But actually, I think that's what they do.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.920]   I am so mad at you.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.040]   Take that.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.920]   Where's my laundry?
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.520]   That's a good idea.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.360]   I should do that with the staff, everyone's doing well.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.120]   Put the fear of God into the matter.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.160]   Apple stores, I think they are to be complimented for this,
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.200]   are accepting your old iPad.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.400]   Should you choose not to sell it?
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.040]   Although I think it has some real value.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.000]   Even gazelle.com is giving hundreds of dollars
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.960]   for first generation iPads.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.440]   But Apple will accept your old iPads as a donation
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.880]   to Teach for America.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:26.760]   That's really cool.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.560]   Which gives it to a teacher in a low income community.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.960]   I think that's fantastic.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.840]   Of course, in an underscores what we've said,
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.160]   which is the iPad 1 is perfectly good.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.200]   I just-- that whole thing about--
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.960]   you can get a whole bunch of people
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.760]   to line up for all night to buy something
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.920]   to replace the thing that was working great already.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.960]   So iPad owners, you take your unwanted device
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.640]   to an Apple retail store for donation.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.280]   Retail employees will give the iPads
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.000]   to Teach for America, which subsequently
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   will distribute them to teachers for use in the classroom.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.960]   You know what Apple should do is they should say,
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.400]   if you come in, you get to go to the front of the line
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.520]   if you're going to donate your iPad.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.640]   Yeah, what is the incentive?
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.920]   You get the tax break.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.280]   But this should give them something.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.000]   That's what they should do.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.280]   They should put them in the front of the line.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.360]   You want to get an Apple II?
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.920]   You want to get an Apple II?
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.920]   You want to get an iPad II?
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.920]   I'd like an Apple II.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.320]   I would like an Apple II.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:13.960]   I gave mine away.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.480]   I'm so sad.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.280]   Where mine is.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.280]   It's probably in the basement.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.280]   I think it'll give people incentive to steal iPads
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.040]   from people in the middle of the line who were asleep
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.160]   because they could sort up so early.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.800]   You get to get it first and make a clean getaway
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.280]   before the guy wakes up.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.160]   You got to think these things are really ill.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.200]   You're right.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.600]   Bad idea.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.000]   But I think you're right.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.520]   There might be a limit to people's patience
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.960]   and being so keen on getting an iPad II.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.920]   So many people have been talking about,
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.040]   geez, why can't Apple just count up the number of iPads?
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.000]   They know them.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.760]   I'm sorry, not Apple, but the actual stores.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.480]   Why can't they just simply say, we know
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.600]   we've got 20 of these, 30 of these, and 40 of these.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.240]   We will just simply send out each headband,
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.000]   armbands for each one of these things.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.520]   If you have a wristband, you know you will be getting
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.720]   a white 16 gigabyte AT&T iPad.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.320]   If you don't have a wristband, just go to the orange julias,
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.520]   have the rest of the day off,
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.600]   'cause you're not getting an iPad.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.800]   A lot of people just so disappointed that they camp out.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.960]   They wait all this time and they're still like this.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:12.640]   - So frustrating.
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.080]   - Seven people too late in order to get one.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.520]   And when they get there, they're disappointed
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.880]   that the only thing they can get is the 16 gigabyte
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:20.800]   black Wi-Fi.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.440]   - Oh, they should be happy with that.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.440]   They should be happy.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.800]   - Oh, see that?
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.480]   Why would you just take whatever you can get?
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.240]   Unless you want to be sapped like me
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.640]   who has to review these things.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.480]   - I'll take it.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.600]   - Why wouldn't you say, I don't care.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.360]   So just put, go to the hallmarks store and it's like,
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.400]   give me that picture frame,
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.640]   you've got to have the local one.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.600]   - Because it's the hottest consumer electronics device
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.120]   in the history of mankind.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.760]   That's why I figured it out.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   Give them some maple butter,
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.760]   and the Apple stores will give you anything.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.160]   - Bring this to the line.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.120]   - They've never had that.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.240]   - There's the name for the show.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.120]   Give them some maple butter and I'll follow you anywhere.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.800]   (laughing)
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.920]   - Well, or you could go online
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.940]   and order a blackberry playbook right now.
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.560]   - Hey, evidently it's similar price.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.880]   - $4.99 for the 16 gig Wi-Fi,
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.720]   available for pre-order now and pick it up April 19th.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   Why not?
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.480]   - It's really good.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.920]   It's practically an iPad.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.760]   - Well, the app store is huge for the blackberry.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.760]   - Oh, wait.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.000]   - No, no, but that's not good.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.360]   - I actually have played with the playbook.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.880]   I have one for Regis of Kelly and I was very impressed.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.840]   First of all, it's multitasking is fantastic.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.000]   It really does a great job.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.720]   You can, the way it works is you launch apps,
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.600]   all five of them.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.280]   And all of the same time.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.960]   - No, there's some, you can have all of the apps
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.440]   that we can have a movie playing.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.000]   You can be playing Unruk, I think it had Quake on it.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.320]   You could have this stuff.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.880]   It's all going, then you slide it up and then you see
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.560]   the thumbnails of all of them live running.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.640]   You can scroll amongst them.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.120]   I mean, the multitasking works for,
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.800]   'cause it's this dual processor, a Tegra inside.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:55.640]   - Right.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.200]   - I'm actually impressed that they're able to get the price
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.840]   down at $4.99 to the same.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.040]   I mean, they must be taking a little bit of a hit on that.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.040]   - It's gotta be painful.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.800]   But I think that the problem is, is that with the app store,
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.560]   with the other pieces, that the real number,
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.960]   that they have to be hitting to really compete heavily
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.400]   is $350 to $400 something that you have to be able to achieve.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.240]   - It has to be a lot cheaper,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.960]   seven inches for the same price.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.520]   So you get, you know, it's a smaller.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.360]   - Some people might like that.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.720]   I mean, it's easier to fit into your pocket.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.560]   It's easier to--
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.440]   - I had the Samsung and I was, I thought it was
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.280]   a nice form factor.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.120]   - Yeah, I think it's--
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:23.960]   - I did not agree with this.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.720]   Steve Jobs who said, "Oh, no one will ever want
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.560]   "a seven inch screen."
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.080]   I just, I thought, what do you think, Andy?
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.240]   You've had both.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.800]   - Yeah, I mean, that was just a dumb comment.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.560]   If there's so many people who don't have,
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.320]   don't can't fit something like this
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.320]   into the rig, into the regular lifestyle.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.120]   You know, just carrying this around wherever they go.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.520]   There is definitely room for a jacket pocket sized device.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.880]   And HTC is making a couple of interesting things
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.160]   that are becoming it out very soon.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.320]   Some of them are gonna be very competitively prized.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.160]   And so I think I said this a couple weeks ago,
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.480]   as a matter of fact, that that's the biggest opportunity
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.760]   that most tablet makers have.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:02.080]   That if Steve Jobs is so adamant against seven inch tablets,
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.800]   well, that's the first thing you should try to make.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.280]   Make something smaller than an iPad,
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.440]   'cause you know that there's,
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.640]   it will immediately have something that's different
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.560]   that can do things that the iPad can't do.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.280]   One thing that is better,
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.520]   the front facing camera is three megapixels,
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.600]   the rear facing camera, five megapixels.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.280]   They're both 1080p.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:22.160]   I really do think that's a big dropout for the Apple,
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.400]   for the iPad too, is that the,
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.040]   I just feel like they just made a big deal
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.160]   about FaceTime HD and then they gave us bad cameras.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.000]   Every time I turn it on,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:31.840]   I have to admit, every time I turn it on,
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.280]   I have to turn it on the FaceTime.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.720]   I look at it, I'm like, "Wow, what a good camera."
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.040]   I haven't tried it on my new MacBook.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.240]   I have to see 'cause that's that they have
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.000]   the new HD eyesights in there.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.640]   GPS orientation center sensor,
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.280]   XLRometer, gyroscope.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.360]   This is all on the playbook, digital compass,
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:51.040]   stereo speakers, stereo microphones.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.600]   - How big a deal is that?
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.120]   - Well, I don't know, I was a little disappointed
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.280]   'cause it seemed like the speaker,
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.080]   the new speaker on the iPad is not as good
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.040]   as the old iPad, for instance.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.360]   It's mono, right, it's a single speaker.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.840]   - But how much, and I agree with that,
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.960]   but how much stereo separation are you gonna get?
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:08.800]   - No, no, no, you're not.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.640]   - Different these things.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.520]   - I think, I used to listen on the iPad one,
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.800]   I used to listen to books and stuff,
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.480]   and it was a nice, good, clear, loud sound.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:21.160]   Sarah's nodding, she listens to the radio on her iPad one.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.880]   I think she would be as happy on iPad two.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.680]   - I don't even travel with speakers on my iPad one
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.880]   because it's loud enough.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.640]   It's good enough, I don't care.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.040]   - Have you guys tested it on, Andy,
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.400]   have you tested any of the reports
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.920]   that the microphones on the new iPad,
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.040]   the on the new iPad two are not as good
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.320]   as in the iPad one?
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.920]   Or, and there's a distinction between,
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.040]   there's some rumblings,
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.880]   there's a distinction between the WiFi and the 3G.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.720]   - Really?
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.640]   - So the WiFi,
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.880]   - 'Cause they didn't have enough room with the 3G.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.720]   - Just don't know, I mean,
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.080]   there's just some stuff rumblings
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.720]   that are kind of bouncing around
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.320]   that are saying that the WiFi mics are better
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.320]   than the 3G mics, which sound a little bit muffled.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.840]   And I haven't really, I don't have a WiFi one.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.920]   Both the ones that we have at the house are both 3G,
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.960]   and I mean, they're fine,
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.760]   I mean, they're not particularly great,
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.880]   but I don't have a very high expectation
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.600]   of what they should sound like.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.880]   - Yeah, unfortunately, the only device I have to test was
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.080]   is the 3G model.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.360]   I did do just quick and kind of accidental tests
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.480]   of the speaker quality between the two,
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.360]   excuse me, I'm sorry, the microphone quality between the two.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.040]   And I couldn't really test any sort of a difference,
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.880]   but by accident, I meant that I was recording something
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.680]   in GarageBand, and I forgot that I had the USB microphone
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.320]   not turned on, not powered up properly.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.480]   So that's how I got my accidental recording samples
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.880]   of the built-in microphone.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.240]   And they both seem pretty okay.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:48.440]   I don't think that either of them is going to really live up
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.200]   to any expectations someone might have
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.240]   of really decent audio recording,
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.440]   but I can't categorically say that the 3G model
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.880]   has a weaker microphone than at least the first one.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.920]   - Right.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.960]   I guess I'll buy a playbook,
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.840]   and we'll just have one in studio and you can play with it.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.720]   - I think that sounds like a great idea.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.400]   - I do think it's a good example
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.160]   of how to make a nice compact tablet.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.840]   I really like, I only spent about a half hour,
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.160]   45 minutes with it, but during that amount of time,
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.000]   I thought that this is quick, this is slick,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.840]   it has easy controls, it went up on the iPad,
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.320]   and that it figured out a way to get a home button
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.320]   that does everything that the home button does
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.360]   without either having a mechanical home button
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.600]   the way that the iPad does,
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.200]   or have a persistent virtual button
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.400]   the way that Android does.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.960]   I thought there was a very nice, very well thought out device,
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.280]   and as usual, it just comes down to price.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.120]   - And I really do want some other tablets to be successful
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.640]   because I think that Apple needs to be pushed.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.680]   I think that the iPad too is far from being perfect,
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.760]   and I think that if Apple gets too much of a lead,
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.720]   I think we just won't see any innovation.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.040]   I mean, even though Apple loves to innovate
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.240]   and loves to do cool things,
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.560]   we all know that they do slow down
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.240]   when they're not getting pressed.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.520]   - Okay, I'm going to BestBuy.com.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:04.520]   It says order early brag often.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.720]   - Hey guys, guess what I ordered.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.520]   - Aren't I great?
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.860]   4.99 for 16 gigs.
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:16.600]   Let's pre-order that.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.840]   Yeah, well, it's, it could be interesting.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:23.600]   They're using a QNX, which is a real-time operating system
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.720]   that's actually quite impressive.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.240]   It's not Android.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.040]   I think the jury has now concluded
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.200]   that the Zoom is a disappointment, yes?
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.160]   - Not quite yet.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.520]   - Not yet, not yet.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.360]   - Too soon.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:41.120]   - There's still a lot of people who just don't react well
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.000]   to the iPad.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   It's not because they're preachers,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.560]   it's because they use it, they don't really get it.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.920]   And when you give them an alternative that is more open,
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:53.000]   that really is everything that the Zoom represents.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.120]   A lot of people are going to be attracted to that.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.600]   And it's also not that much more expensive.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.800]   It's not stupid, more expensive than the iPad,
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.320]   which is what we've had to deal with before.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.240]   - Right.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.960]   This is actually the same exact prices.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.360]   The iPad, the Blackberry.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.200]   - Interesting.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.840]   You know, I'd love it if the problem is,
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.600]   you don't have iMovie, you don't have GarageBand.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.560]   You don't have, you know, I'm gonna have a better camera,
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.640]   but I won't have all of those great apps.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.400]   - And iMovie and GarageBand, I think are just,
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.000]   I mean, that's what got my wife, she,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.920]   what's funny is if somebody,
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.120]   I showed my wife GarageBand and she was like,
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.080]   I have to have one of these.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.560]   I mean, like as soon as she saw the GarageBand,
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.640]   and she, and that's, that sells the thing.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.560]   - So then I got her and I talked to someone at Apple,
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.760]   at the Apple store and they said,
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.840]   oh yeah, that's the number one thing
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.240]   that's selling the iPads is people open up GarageBand.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.440]   - Although you can run GarageBand on an iPad one.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.720]   - Yep, no, and it's a little,
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.560]   here's what happened.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.560]   As soon as you start adding a couple layers,
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.120]   it starts to do a lot of optimizing.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.920]   And, you know, just a lot of cycling.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.400]   But the, but what's funny is,
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.920]   is that my, I just tweeted about this this morning,
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.760]   my wife uses her iPad now probably four or five times more
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.880]   than I use mine.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.280]   You know, she, that thing is like attached to her hip.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.200]   Like she wanders around and she listens to stuff
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.840]   and she, and she actually likes the daily.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.680]   We were talking about it.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.520]   - Really?
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.360]   - My wife, and my wife is--
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.520]   - The Rupert Murdoch iPad only magazine.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.920]   - She's not like, with Rupert Murdoch,
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.120]   I was expecting she wouldn't like the daily
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.280]   'cause my wife is not conservative by any stretch of it.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.520]   - No, it's not conservative though.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.080]   In fact, it's funny that you should say that
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.160]   'cause we talked about this on Twitch.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.880]   We had Nick built in from the Times on.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.720]   We had a Neelike Patel of formerly of Engadgeton.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.680]   They both loved the daily.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.600]   They thought the daily was great.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.520]   - And I, and I, you know, I subscribed and I'm, you know,
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.880]   and I, and I, and I go up to it occasionally.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.160]   But I'm not reading it every day.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.080]   She reads, she just like, that's what she's doing
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.800]   while she's like, that's her in-between thing.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.440]   And she really loves the, she's like,
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.800]   do I have to subscribe to this eventually?
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.120]   'Cause I will, this is great, you know?
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:36.960]   - Yeah, like nine cents, yeah.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.080]   - And, and so it's, I just thought,
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.120]   I thought that her usage is interesting
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.440]   because that's the closest thing to an average user
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.680]   that I know.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.880]   Like my wife is much more just typical, you know,
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.720]   typical person.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.560]   - You hear that, Carlita?
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.720]   - Your average.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.200]   - Average computer user.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.200]   - Average just average, Carlita.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.200]   - But you're special to me, honey.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.680]   It pretty listening.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.160]   - We love Carlita.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.000]   - So anyway, but I mean, she just,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.720]   - No, she's a normal user,
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.040]   as you can say, is better than average.
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:02.880]   - I wouldn't say average.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:03.720]   - Normal user.
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:04.560]   - She's a normal human.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.400]   - 'Cause the leo.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.520]   - She's not the geek that you,
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.640]   - Leo, Leo has said that I'm not.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.480]   - You're not normal.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.320]   - I'm not normal.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.480]   - Well, there's no question about that.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:15.000]   I, I submit, I submit it to the, for your inspection.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.120]   Is Alex Lindsey, anything like you and me?
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.880]   - No.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.720]   - Me, me, me.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.280]   - Andre goes, me, me.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.480]   Here, have some, have some maple butter.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.320]   - We're gonna take it first.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.160]   - I can't have any more of that.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.520]   - I know, I'm shaky from like one half,
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.040]   quarter teaspoon, I'm shaky.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:31.880]   - It's so good.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.480]   - I haven't had so many carbs in the last six weeks.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:38.000]   - It's yummy, but I have to be careful.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:38.920]   I'm pacing myself.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.320]   - It is super yummy.
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.160]   - Yes.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.880]   - Imagine if you will,
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.280]   the best cake icing you ever had,
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.200]   then make it 40 times denser and better.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.640]   And you'll have some idea
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.440]   of what Andy Inako is missing today.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.480]   - And I can imagine myself,
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.640]   if I let myself have any more,
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.040]   I can imagine eating the whole thing.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.680]   And then just lane on a,
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.800]   - You would be, you would be dying.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.040]   And then I would just,
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.920]   I would, all the blood would exit my head
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.560]   and I would just be laying on one of the,
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.120]   I probably would sit on the ground out outside the studio.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:06.960]   - Oh, oh.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.800]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   - Oh, oh, oh.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.440]   - He was doing okay and then,
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.440]   oh, oh, oh.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.440]   You had a sugar spike.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.920]   - I don't know what happened.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.640]   I ate all of it.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.000]   - It's like eating like a dozen Krispy Kreme dimes.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.680]   (laughing)
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.680]   - It's so good going down.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.520]   And it really,
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.760]   - It's three seconds later, you go, why did I do that?
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.600]   - You know, they need,
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.760]   have you seen that website that does kill me?
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.880]   You know, where it tells you how many cups of coffee
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.480]   it would take you, like how much you could say?
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.320]   - It's killing you.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.160]   - I want a Starbucks latte.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.000]   - Yeah.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.360]   - And I'll tell you, if you drank 46 of these,
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.360]   it would kill you.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.000]   You know, and you could set Red Bull or,
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:39.840]   you know, whichever one,
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.160]   it would tell you how, which one they should do that
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.320]   with sugar, they should say like,
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.160]   it would take you.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:48.160]   - You ate 43 Krispy Kreme Boston cream pies.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.200]   You would die.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:53.480]   - Gentlemen, this is a Girl Scout cookie.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:58.480]   I accepted my order from my niece about four days ago.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.240]   And that was four days ago.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.480]   I had more than one box a day available,
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.040]   but I've been eating a lot of these.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.640]   (laughing)
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.680]   And my goal is to not eat all four boxes in a week.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.640]   And I think that if I take this one cookie
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.400]   and just like leave it in my office,
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.760]   or just put in a novel up and mail it to myself,
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.160]   then that will be the goal.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.600]   That'll get me towards that goal
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.520]   of not having eaten all of them in one week.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.360]   So.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.200]   - Pestky thing that complex sugar,
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.600]   it's almost as if God wants us to just be jittery
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.440]   and unfocused.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.400]   - I like it that the name of that Girl Scout cookie
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.960]   is Asante, which means to your health.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.920]   I don't really think so.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.400]   - I don't remember the name of it,
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.720]   but these are like, thank you cookies.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.840]   And each one, like they're like short,
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.560]   brush, short bed of digestives on one side,
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.600]   chocolate on the other.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.280]   And each one is stamped with a different version of thank you.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.360]   - Yeah, that's a sweetie for thank you.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.200]   - Yeah, oh, there it goes.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.040]   - Asante, Santa.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:53.960]   - Asante, Santa.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:54.800]   Thank you.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:55.640]   I say that a lot.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.440]   - Thank you for the sugar.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.760]   You know, Andy, if you would spread
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.360]   the little bit of maple butter on that cookie.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.200]   - Yeah.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.240]   (laughing)
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.360]   - You see, well, actually that would be a good idea
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.480]   'cause if I want to have a heart attack or a stroke,
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.680]   I would much rather have it like,
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.240]   while I'm like live on video,
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.960]   'cause I live alone, I have guests like often,
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.960]   but it's a good idea to have, you know?
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.200]   It's a good idea to have these medical things happen.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.040]   Like when you're,
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.600]   you get EMS out there in a heartbeat.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.440]   We'll Skype them.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:28.440]   - So last chance ordering the Blackberry Playbook,
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.440]   16 gigs of memory, Wi-Fi.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.200]   - Go Leo, it's stupid.
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.640]   - You think I should just do it?
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.800]   - I think we, I think from a journalistic perspective
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.160]   that we need to have no choice.
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.000]   - I have no choice.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.760]   - All right, so that we can test it head to head.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.560]   - I also think that you should be the first in line.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.800]   I think you should do a whole show from there.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.640]   (laughing)
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.480]   - No, no, it's there.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.280]   You know the beauty of this?
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.400]   It's gonna arrive at the office on the 19th.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.760]   - On the 19th of April?
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.120]   - April 19th.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.360]   Well that's the, yeah, that's the best.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.640]   But so it's pre-order, but that's done.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.520]   - There you go.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.640]   - Now I almost got a zoom in now.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.040]   Then I saw Samsung's gonna be doing a new 10.1,
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.520]   and I liked the Samsung Galaxy,
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.440]   so I'm gonna wait on that one.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.960]   I think Honeycoil is a little immature still.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:13.800]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.160]   - The child is not that we are.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.960]   (laughing)
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.480]   HTC also finally announced some pricing
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.120]   on their Android 3.0 tablets.
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.000]   And I believe that there's seven inch
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:24.920]   or they're nine inch tablets,
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:28.480]   gonna be 529 for a 4G tablet.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:29.880]   So that's a damn good price.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.240]   - Well see, and there's an example of,
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.400]   I don't feel any pressure to order an Android tablet
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.920]   because I know there'll be a variety of choices there.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.240]   I know this is the only BlackBerry tablet
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.400]   for the foreseeable future.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.000]   So it's a much easier purchase.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.240]   You see, that's an advantage.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.120]   - Well that gets into that whole fractioning the market.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.640]   - Well there's a really direct concrete example
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.640]   of why that's not, you know,
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.440]   I mean, Google doesn't have any choice.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.800]   It's an open source operating system.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.400]   That's how they made it, and that's how they do it.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.320]   But it just shows you that that is a disadvantage,
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.520]   at least in that one respect,
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.840]   because yeah, they'll have in the long run
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:06.120]   a better choice of products, prices, capabilities.
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.120]   But in the short run, it's an easier thing to say,
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:10.000]   "Well, there's only one iPad too.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.640]   "There's only one BlackBerry playbook."
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.320]   So there you go.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:14.160]   - Let's take a break.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:14.920]   We're gonna come back with more.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.720]   Randy Inako, Alex Lindsey, Leo, report.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:21.120]   And let's not forget our friends at Smile.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.600]   Smile software.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.080]   Remember, they used to be called Smile on My Mac.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.040]   - Thanks, Smile works better.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.200]   - I like Smile. - Smile on My Mac
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.400]   was a little too long.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.720]   - Smile software.com/Macbreak.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.520]   You can get a good deal on a program
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.920]   that you absolutely want.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.640]   It's called PDFN.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.760]   Have you downloaded it yet, Alex?
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:40.960]   You gotta try it. - Oh yeah, I have it.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.640]   What do you think? - That's great.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.080]   - So the deal is we all deal with PDFs, unfortunately.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.080]   People don't fax.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.160]   So what they do is they make PDFs
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.440]   and they send you the PDF and they say, "Please,
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.280]   "this is what I love."
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.840]   - Print sign and fax back.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.320]   - Yes. (laughs)
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.000]   - And I'm like, "Huh?"
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:58.840]   - Huh? - Yeah.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.680]   And generally, I'm just in so many places
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.360]   and with now that I have a tool that makes it easy,
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.240]   it's one of those things that you can now
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.320]   knock out a signature and then use it all the time.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.160]   - I use it all the time.
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:13.880]   I mean, then what used to happen is,
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.160]   especially for loners,
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.520]   we would get these big agreements
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.440]   to get the hardware and everything else.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.040]   And they say, "Okay, we're gonna send you this."
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.720]   And I wouldn't get the loner not because
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.360]   it was a free piece of hardware
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.840]   that I can play with for 60 days or whatever,
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:30.960]   but I don't get it because I just can't fax back the...
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.680]   - You know these guys, they do text expander,
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.240]   which is like a must have.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.240]   PDF pen, version five just came out,
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.520]   lets you both... - Hey.
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.360]   What?
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.880]   - Well yeah, hell yeah.
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.520]   That's 'cause I went to a special,
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.240]   and by the way, please go to this special URL
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.600]   so they know that there's actually somebody
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.520]   listening to this show,
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.440]   smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.280]   - Oh right now.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.040]   - Please, let's see if we can bring the site down.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:53.880]   - Yeah, let's...
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:54.720]   - Smilesoftware.com.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.640]   - We are doing a website.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.160]   - A Macbreak. - Yeah.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.040]   - Smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.080]   Please, everyone go right now.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.840]   - An involuntary web test.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.400]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:05.440]   - We forgot to tell them.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.280]   - Yes, surprise PDF pen.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.480]   - Well it wouldn't be a test if we told them
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.480]   how to talk about it. - This has to be,
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.000]   this is a surprise inspection of their website.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.920]   - So what this does, in fact,
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.120]   a Macworld magazine says it's abilities compare well
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:21.320]   with Acrobat Pro yet PDF pen comes in at a tenth of the cost.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.280]   They have PDF pen and PDF pen Pro.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   It lets you edit PDFs, add text, images, signatures,
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.640]   that's what I use most.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.400]   You can even make corrections, fill out forms
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.920]   and OCR scanned documents as well.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.520]   Now, what I like about this basic OCR built in,
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.640]   that's right, what I like about this is,
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.640]   I'm filling in a lot of forms for summer camp for my son.
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.240]   You get, and of course the health forms and all that,
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.080]   this makes it so easy.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.280]   You can even, if you have the Pro version,
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:49.520]   convert a website into a multi-page PDF,
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.320]   you can redact text in PDF pen,
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.520]   remove a social security number or banking details
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.080]   and send it on.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.240]   - I love to redact just 'cause it makes me feel like
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.840]   - Like a government agency.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:00.840]   - I agree.
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.200]   And it is redacted.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:05.040]   - You do not have security clearance for that information.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:05.880]   - I would redact it.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.080]   - This information is not there anymore.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.080]   (laughs)
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.840]   - You can also merge pages from several files,
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:17.280]   repurpose, apply a custom watermark.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.360]   It's just all these nice features.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.440]   Now you can try it for free, which is great.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:23.360]   Of course, Smile Software always gives you free trials.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:28.360]   SmileSoftware.com/MacBreak,
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:33.360]   PDF pen, 59.95, PDF pen Pro, 99.95.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.840]   But do try before you buy,
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.880]   and that's the best part of this.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.680]   PDF pen from Smile Software.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.600]   Great people.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.640]   They've been really wonderful contributors
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.000]   to the Mac community always.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.640]   Throw great parties at MacworldExpo.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:50.520]   And these are the kind of Mac developers we like.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.560]   We like having them on our show.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:56.760]   SmileSoftware.com/MacBreak, please use that URL.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:00.560]   So did you get 10.6.7?
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.880]   - I just saw it this morning.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.640]   I was scared.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:05.480]   - What?
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.560]   - No, I have to--
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.400]   - Don't be scared.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.720]   I just, I don't do it before shows,
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.040]   because then my computer's not working directly.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.040]   - Yeah, I'm sitting here in your shows.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.240]   - 10.6.7 update is recommended for all users
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.600]   running SNU-lippered.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:18.160]   General operating system fixes
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.520]   that enhance the stability of the baddies.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.520]   They always say the same thing,
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.040]   security of your Mac improves reliability.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.880]   I'm back to my Mac, resolves an issue
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.000]   when transferring files to certain SMB servers.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.680]   It's funny somebody called me on the radio show
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.480]   this weekend saying, "Whenever I can copy files
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.840]   "to my Mac from my Windows machine,
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:36.240]   "whenever I try to do the opposite,
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:38.440]   "I get a permission error."
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.480]   Let's hope that fixes that.
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.480]   That happens to me too.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:41.320]   - It happens to me too.
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:44.360]   And I've been having trouble with back to my Mac specifically,
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.840]   so I'm hoping that this is going through this.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.640]   - And some minor Mac App Store bugs.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.560]   There is a very special version,
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.360]   for those of you with the new MacBook Airs
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.680]   or the new MacBook Pros.
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.760]   They update firmware and other stuff.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.800]   Big update, 313 megabytes on this old MacBook Pro,
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.520]   the 17 inch, a couple years old.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.840]   So it could be different depending on which system you have.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.120]   There's a lot of security I think in here.
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:12.360]   Remember Safari was whooped in five seconds
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.200]   during the Pwned to Own contest at Cansec West.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:20.160]   They should if they really want this up in Vancouver,
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.320]   if they really want these hackers
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.400]   to break into these systems,
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:26.960]   instead of offering them $10,000 at a MacBook Pro,
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:28.760]   they should give them maple butter.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:29.600]   - I'm just saying.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.600]   - That would be huge.
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:33.120]   - And but, you know.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.920]   - I would crack anything for maple butter.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:36.720]   - A small crate of maple butter.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.200]   (laughing)
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.480]   Mobile Me is affected.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.680]   - You know, it's like pulling teeth to get Apple
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.880]   to tell you about the security details,
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:45.720]   and I understand why.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.120]   They don't want to, you know, they don't want to,
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.360]   you know, telegraph the bad guys what they're up to.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.280]   But information is here on their website,
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.600]   and they do tell you some stuff,
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.560]   including 5.04 for Safari, which tells us
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:01.200]   that is probably to fix the Pwned to Own vulnerability.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.000]   Raw image compatibility for more cameras,
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.720]   so digital raw has been updated.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.000]   Resolves a Windows Resize.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.640]   There's also little, look at all these little issues.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.520]   Rare issue, and then 10.6.5
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.000]   that could cause user accounts to disappear
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.480]   after putting the system to sleep.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.920]   That would be a bad thing.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.320]   Let's see the security fixes.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.760]   See what they say.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.080]   For the protection of our customers,
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.920]   Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.800]   until a full investigation has occurred,
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.840]   and any necessary patches or releases are available.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.880]   So they will tell you, but only after it's been patched.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:43.440]   Fixes for, well, let's see,
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.480]   let's see what they say here.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.680]   Security updates.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.160]   Hmm.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:51.520]   Airport, Apache, AppleScript, ATS,
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:55.440]   ATS, ATS, ATS, and that's just the A's.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:58.520]   B-ZIP, CarbonCore, ClamAV, so a lot of this
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:00.360]   is open source stuff.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:05.360]   Cortex, File Quarantine, HFS, ImageIO, ImageIO, ImageIO, ImageIO,
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:11.640]   ImageIO, ImageRaw, Installer, Carabaros, Kernel.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:13.760]   Lots of fixes in here.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.880]   So get it.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.240]   Don't be afraid, E-Cat.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.040]   Do it.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:21.800]   Let's see what else.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:25.560]   So here's some information from I Lounge about the mobile,
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.920]   we're talking about the mobile media changes.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.400]   The reasoning for the very large server farm.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.760]   In North Carolina, according to...
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:36.120]   People in the know.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.160]   People in the know.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.160]   Who are those guys?
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.000]   I Lounge.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.240]   Apple is set to announce a new free version of Mobile Me.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:48.960]   Free.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:51.440]   I'm going to do a people like me
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.280]   that's been too much mobile.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.120]   Free.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.360]   I know I've been paying for Mobile Me since day one.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.120]   According to a trusted source,
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:00.640]   the source who works for a major educational institution
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:03.080]   claims the school supplier has said the current version
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:06.080]   of Mobile Me no longer available in Apple is
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:09.680]   suggesting new students sign up for the 60 day trial
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.600]   to cover the gap between the final Mobile Me shipment
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.720]   and the launch of the new version.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:18.120]   So the clock is ticking.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.400]   In addition, according to the source Apple
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.400]   will be supporting the existing version of Mobile Me
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.320]   for the next year,
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:26.840]   suggesting the new version will be different
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.200]   from the existing version.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:32.600]   And of course, let's not forget the suckers
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:35.640]   who just paid for a full year of Mobile Me.
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:36.480]   Prior.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.320]   I just did recently.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:39.360]   Prior to Apple removing any method
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:40.880]   through which a user could pay.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:41.880]   Have you seen that?
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.160]   You can't buy a new subscription to Mobile.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.160]   Wait a minute, let me check.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.880]   Have noticed that people haven't been asking me
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:48.720]   when I buy computers,
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:51.600]   whether I want to do Mobile Me anymore.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:52.440]   Oh, it's just that.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:53.280]   I know it was just that.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.520]   It would always be like, do you want Apple Care?
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:55.720]   Yes, do you want Mobile Me?
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:56.840]   Would you like to spend more money?
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.200]   Yeah, no, I don't need that.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.120]   They did upgrade the calendar.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:00.960]   All right, let me see.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.360]   Okay, okay, Mobile Me.
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.200]   Mobile Me, let me see.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.360]   I'm on my Mobile Me account.
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:06.840]   I have one thing on Mobile Me, a picture of my dog.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.320]   Just so I know it's me.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.840]   Let's see, account.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.600]   I mean, it should hide this in case it gives
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:13.600]   personal information out,
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.840]   like the name of my dog.
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:16.840]   Loading account.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:19.120]   Let's see where I can renew my Mobile Me
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:20.880]   'cause it just renewed in February.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.960]   Your subscription will renew account type.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.200]   Doesn't it doesn't really.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.480]   Thank you, I see if auto renew is gonna work
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.640]   over the next couple of months.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.600]   Mine doesn't renew for another few, I double checked.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:37.040]   Yeah, see mine, I just, of course, January 19th,
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:39.520]   they just paid for another year.
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:40.440]   Thank you.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.640]   Let's see, maybe I can, can I upgrade it?
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.400]   Let's push the upgrade button.
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.280]   Oh yeah, I can still buy.
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:48.560]   No, oh, look at that.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:49.520]   Zero dollars.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:50.420]   Oh.
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:51.920]   Zero dollars, I can.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.520]   Hey, try to upgrade to 60 gigs.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.120]   Just see what happens.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:55.960]   Oh, it does.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.200]   No, no, there you go.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.400]   20 is what you started with.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.240]   I guess it's zero.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:01.600]   Oh shoot, see, I got myself all excited.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:02.440]   That wasn't hard to do.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:05.440]   No, you can still be a sucker if you'd like to be.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.480]   You can still, well, I guess our advice would be
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.560]   probably not a good idea to buy anything more.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:11.400]   Not right now.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.240]   In Mobile Me.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:16.240]   Until we find out what the heck is going on.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.600]   But you can, you could, you are, I guess we've confirmed,
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.880]   you are allowed to still spend money
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.000]   on one for me.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.880]   You are, welcome to Apple.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:27.120]   You are allowed to spend more money on things you don't need.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:27.960]   Oh, that's me.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.440]   I think you can still contribute to Giuliani's
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:30.240]   presidential campaign.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.680]   (laughing)
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.560]   Well, he's got bills.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.400]   I think Mobile Me has bills.
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.240]   You think he doesn't cost any money to like,
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.400]   call that, cut all that grass and coop or do you know
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.720]   that just add another campus?
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.480]   (laughing)
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.320]   Well, we'll look for it.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.480]   This next month, if it happens,
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:45.840]   it's supposedly next month.
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:50.160]   18T shames.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:53.360]   More like warns.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.600]   I don't think there's as much too much shaming as, as,
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:58.920]   yeah, we are going, if you do not stop this,
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.040]   we are going to throw you over the cliff.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:03.400]   You may have received an email from 18T recently
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:07.880]   that reads, "Many 18T customers use their smartphones
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:11.720]   "as a broadband connection for other devices like laptops,
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:14.480]   "a practice commonly known as stealing."
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.040]   I mean, tethering.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:18.240]   Tethering can be an efficient way for our customers
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:21.600]   to enjoy the benefits of 18T's mobile broadband network,
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:24.780]   but our records show that you use this capability
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:28.200]   but are not subscribed to our tethering plan.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:30.480]   If we don't hear from you,
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.000]   how would they know that we were tethering?
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.120]   If we don't hear from you, we plan to automatically enroll you
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.960]   into Datapro 4GB after March 27th.
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:44.760]   Notice this is a positive, like, this is like not saying,
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.000]   they're not shaming anyone.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:46.920]   No, they're just telling you,
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.280]   they're sending out the warning that they're going to move you
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:51.720]   off of your unlimited subscription forever.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.480]   That's what, I mean, that's what's,
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.320]   that's what they're telling you.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.400]   They're giving you the, there's no shame in that.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:01.360]   There's a whole lot of, the new plan will replace your current
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:05.040]   data plan, including if you are on an unlimited data plan.
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.560]   So the next step you're going to see is people getting really
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.240]   upset because they got taken off in the first month
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:12.040]   that they had it, they're going to get a bill for $600.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:14.880]   Asked for how AT&T is identifying these users,
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.960]   it's possible the carrier is simply looking at data usage trends
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:20.440]   and making an educated guess.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:23.280]   TUAW says a browser ID strings might tell you,
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:25.640]   "Sure, if you use a desktop browser and it came through
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.920]   your phone, well, that would be kind of a giveaway."
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:31.800]   Or AT&T may be noticing different than expected time
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.960]   to live units on packets sent from a computer,
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:35.880]   throwing a tethered smartphone, this answer coming
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:36.960]   from a Reddit user.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:41.200]   I believe the issue is TTL packets,
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:46.200]   saving apparently the TTL times are non-standard.
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.760]   AT&T is not saying.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:51.040]   Did, I didn't get the message, I think.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:51.880]   I should check.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:54.240]   Have you been, have you been sneaking?
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:56.960]   No, but you know, how do, I mean, let's see,
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.480]   who would have come from AT&T?
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.080]   Well, I mean, do you have a, do you have a jailbroken phone
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:01.920]   that you're tethering?
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:02.760]   Well, you won't get it.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.680]   But I don't think that everybody should check to make sure
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:06.760]   because maybe they just made a mistake.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.920]   I got one from AT&T the other day, it was just my bill.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:12.400]   It was really high.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:15.120]   Perhaps you didn't notice that you always thousands of dollars.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.560]   Yeah, it was a whole lot of,
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.720]   you went out of the country less.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:20.440]   Yeah, I got an $800 bill, but that wasn't too bad.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.440]   I expected something.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:22.640]   No, no, yeah, 800's not.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:24.120]   I thought maybe 10,000.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:25.840]   So that's what they do.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:27.600]   You know, the thing is, is that what's really important
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:30.960]   that I've gotten well trained in after my first $800 bill
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:35.960]   is to, as soon as you land in the UK or St. Martin
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:39.800]   or France or whatever, you immediately go into your preferences
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.160]   and reset your usage.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:44.160]   You have to reset your, like I have an international plan.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.600]   And so now you have 50 megs.
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:47.800]   That way you can tell.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:48.640]   That way you can tell.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:49.480]   That way you're telling.
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:50.480]   'Cause I got, I was in St. Martin.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.320]   I was in St. Martin.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.200]   I got to 49 and I was like, okay, I'm gonna stop.
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:54.320]   I have to warn you.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:58.160]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm sorry.
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.920]   I have maple butter.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.240]   You got to remember the roof of my mouth.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.720]   That doesn't always work.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.920]   When I was in China, I used that technique.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:09.320]   And it was much more than the usage meter on the phone set
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.640]   than the ATT representative said,
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.080]   well, you should really have used our app.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:13.920]   - Oh, no.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:17.120]   There are also ways to get around it.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.960]   When I was in Europe last month,
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.880]   I decided I didn't want to have to spend
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.200]   a hundred bucks international data,
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.480]   especially since Leo since you had your problem
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.080]   because you didn't sign up for two months
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.040]   waiting for all the hidden haterlands to report him.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.960]   And so I just checked it out and realized
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.760]   that if I just made the right settings on my phone
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.280]   to make it impossible for any data to get pushed,
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.920]   it's still able, I'm still able to send and receive texts
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.480]   or just 50 cents a shot.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:42.240]   So I found that just for the basic needs
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.560]   of making sure that I could give somebody a phone number
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.720]   that they could get in touch with me wherever I was,
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.880]   it certainly did that job for me.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.160]   - You can also, when you have a Wi-Fi connection
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.240]   or before you go, you can download really, really bad maps
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.280]   of Paris and London.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.480]   And they're really, really big.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.640]   They're like 250 megs and they look really, really bad,
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.200]   but you at least know where you are.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.600]   So you don't have to use the map function.
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.120]   That's what I use a lot when I'm lost in something bad.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.800]   - They recommend that there's a motion X,
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.480]   and you recommended that their GPS drive,
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.760]   but there's also motion X GPS,
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.440]   you can read download maps.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.760]   - Well, yeah, it's really great.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.960]   You just simply draw a circle around the region
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.360]   of the town or the globe that you want maps for.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.320]   It'll simply download all the map.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.440]   - Anywhere in the world?
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.440]   - Yeah, anywhere in the world.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.360]   - It uses open map, open street map.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.680]   - 'Cause I got excited about my,
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:32.640]   the Tom-Tom just started releasing ones for all over Europe.
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.560]   And so I'm, I'm sorry.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.520]   - I know that.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.800]   - No, you don't.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.880]   - No, you, have you ever seen this one?
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:40.920]   - Which one is that?
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:41.760]   - Wait, where is it?
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.960]   - Angry Birds Rio.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:46.960]   - Rio, I haven't.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.520]   - I haven't got in Rio yet.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.240]   - Yeah, you can get it on the App Store course,
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.480]   but if you'd like to get it for free,
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:56.280]   if you had an Android phone and you joined the Amazon App Store,
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:59.280]   you'd get this today that's absolutely absolutely--
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.560]   - But Leo, you're talking a crazy man.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.800]   Holy apple can call something the App Store.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.920]   - Oh yeah, so Android, for Android users,
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:12.040]   Amazon has announced and is now doing an App Store.
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.240]   An App Store, really?
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:20.040]   Yes, the Amazon App Store for Android,
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.080]   only 3,500 apps in here.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.880]   If you have an Amazon account though,
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.080]   it goes right through your Amazon account.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.480]   And every day they plan to give away a free program.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.320]   Today's free program, the new Android Birds Rio.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.520]   - And not just like a free flash on App,
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.240]   a different commercial app that normally costs a month
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.600]   because it will be a free download.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.120]   - So, I have to say, many of these apps,
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.320]   in fact, all of these apps are available
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.400]   through the regular marketplace,
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.320]   at least for now, I don't see any exclusives.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.080]   And if you bought it through the regular marketplace,
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.640]   you probably wouldn't want to pay for it again through Amazon.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.680]   On the other hand, if you haven't bought it,
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.280]   there are free apps on here.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.800]   I guess the whole idea of this is curated,
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.400]   only 3,600 apps on here.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.560]   - But they're the best apps.
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.680]   - Yeah, and it solves a big problem
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.120]   that I've always had with Android,
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.760]   in that I've always thought that the marketplace
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:07.680]   is kind of screwed up.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.360]   It needs a bunch of grownups.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.040]   We know how to run a store to create a great store front
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.840]   that makes it easy to find the good apps
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.880]   and keeps kind of the crumbs off the table.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.040]   And that's why Amazon getting to this market,
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.080]   that's a really interesting development to me.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.080]   - Books and comics, city info, communication,
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.320]   cooking, education, entertainment,
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.920]   so all those standard categories.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:32.360]   But even more interesting, a recommended category.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.480]   So this is the curated stuff.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:37.280]   Actually, this reminds me a little bit of,
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.160]   there's a program called App Brain for Android
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.680]   that will look at what you've got,
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.440]   and apparently that's what they're doing.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:45.120]   And then recommend apps for you right now.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.480]   These are just the top apps.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:51.480]   So Apple, not too happy about that word, App Store.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.160]   They immediately sued.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.400]   - Well, they have to, actually.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.280]   - It doesn't matter whether it's happy or not.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.240]   - Yeah, it's their trademark.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:01.840]   So they have to sue, or it'll become a generic term.
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.240]   Something they don't, it's not whether they're upset or not.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.840]   They have to call them, warn them, talk to them,
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.960]   and then they have to take them to court.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:11.000]   - They've actually asked for an injunction,
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.960]   actually to tell Amazon, "Stop, you can't."
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.520]   - I never understand this whole process of why you,
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.160]   if someone already has a trademark,
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.960]   why you wouldn't just find another name.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.200]   - Apple applied for the App Store trademark in 2008,
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.680]   didn't get approval till last year.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.000]   - But they, Microsoft, - Microsoft,
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.400]   has opposed it, claiming it's a generic, Microsoft,
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.360]   not Amazon, claiming it's a generic term.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.720]   Apple's been arguing against Microsoft.
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.760]   Apple says they contacted Amazon three times
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.080]   demanding the name change,
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:45.080]   but Amazon has yet to provide a substantive response,
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.240]   and of course, the substantive response today is,
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.440]   - Nope, go on and use it.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.640]   - That's our substantive response.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:52.760]   Take that, Apple!
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.800]   Interesting.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.080]   You're right, they have to defend it
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.720]   if they want to preserve it,
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.400]   but isn't it kind of?
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.800]   First of all, App, App has become generic.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.800]   Does Apple have a trademark on App?
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.600]   There's an app for that.
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.760]   They have, there's an app for that, I know that.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.040]   - Did anyone really use it a lot before that?
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.680]   - Well, yes, oh yeah, oh yeah, Killer App,
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:15.760]   remember the phrase Killer App?
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.400]   App's been used by computer users for years.
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.040]   Of course, there's a nice little play for Apple.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.200]   App is the first three letters of Apple.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:24.560]   - And it's an App Store.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.840]   - I think what they registered was App Store.
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.960]   - An App Store is unique.
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.200]   - No, we're said this is the Killer App Store.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.080]   - Right.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.920]   - Anyway, it's interesting, it just shows though
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:39.920]   how valuable that, that ecosystem, an App Store ecosystem is.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.840]   - I just don't know if Amazon couldn't have done it
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.360]   with some other name.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.680]   - Call it the Ama Store.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.520]   - Or something.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:50.760]   - Somebody said App should stand for Amazon's portable programs.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.200]   - Just call it Piranha.
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.040]   - Piranha.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.800]   - Yeah, it's in the Amazon.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.000]   I get it, I'm not so stupid.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:57.840]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.560]   - I get it, it's a fish in the Amazon.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.320]   - It can spell lines of market.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.480]   - We'll cut me to cheese.
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:08.360]   - Microsoft, by the way, busy suing Barnes and Noble
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.680]   over the Nook e-book reader, Microsoft says,
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:14.360]   the problem is Android infringes Microsoft's patents.
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.560]   So if that's the case, I would expect more lawsuits to come.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.880]   They're picking the low hanging fruit.
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.360]   - That's gonna be ugly.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.000]   - Did any of you have trouble, you have a Verizon iPhone?
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.160]   Did you have a problem with it
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.800]   setting a springing back instead of a spring forward?
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:29.800]   - I don't have a Verizon phone.
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:30.640]   - Oh, you don't?
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.480]   - No.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:36.480]   - According to Engadget, Apple's iPhone, iPod Touch,
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:39.280]   both spring back.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.440]   - This is just for the Verizon phones?
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.440]   - Well, it says now, regardless, it's erratic.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.000]   - Mind sprung forward and stayed there.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:45.840]   - Minded too.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.400]   This is, they've been problems before
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.940]   with daylight savings time.
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:54.080]   According to users on Twitter and the Apple forums,
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.880]   the clock app has been demonstrating
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.240]   all kinds of erratic behavior.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.560]   Some alarms going off early,
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.360]   others late, plenty of others working perfectly.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:04.200]   Ours worked perfectly, yours worked perfectly, Andrew.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.600]   - Yep.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.480]   I got caught the last time, but not this time.
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.640]   - I could see how if you're in Phoenix,
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.160]   I mean, that's, you know, you're assuming the phone knows
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.160]   you're in Phoenix, so it shouldn't change
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:18.560]   to daylight savings time, but I don't know.
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.520]   This sounds like, it's not universal,
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.640]   so it doesn't sound like it's a bug.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.960]   Sounds like user error.
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:27.080]   Oh boy, I'm gonna get the mail on that.
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:27.920]   - Yeah, yep.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.800]   - Not from Switzerland though, you know Switzerland
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.280]   is the number one Mac loving country in the world.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.720]   - Chocolate and Macs.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.920]   - But no, but no, but no, Babylbutter.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.040]   - No, Babylbutter.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.760]   - This is a Pingdom blog.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.120]   I don't know who they are.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.800]   This is the eye supply of usage or something.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:51.800]   Pingdom blog did a exercise in statistical research
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:56.520]   in which they came up with the top Mac countries,
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.620]   basically it's OS 10 market share.
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:02.520]   So the OS 10 market share in Switzerland is 17%
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:06.000]   compared to 15% in the US.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.760]   Even that sounds higher than I've ever heard before.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:15.000]   Luxembourg, right after Switzerland, then the US Iceland.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.320]   - Now the graph I'd really like to see here
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.440]   is not the percentage but the Qum.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:19.920]   So like what does that actually mean?
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.120]   Like how many machines?
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:21.960]   - Yes.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.600]   - Isn't the suicide rate also really, really high
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.440]   in that part of Europe?
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.880]   (laughing)
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:30.840]   I'm not suggesting correlation or causation of the saying.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.200]   - We are depressed, but we have Macs.
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:36.520]   - The winners are very, very long.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.640]   - New York Times is gonna use the iTunes
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.120]   in app subscription feature.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.200]   So we now have somebody, a major publisher,
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.280]   they're putting up a paywall.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.400]   - Look at the prices.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.240]   - Yeah.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:48.440]   - Not cheap.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.360]   - That's just in and of itself,
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:51.960]   that's been a real source complaint.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:55.120]   - $15 a month on this phone,
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:58.520]   on the tablet, $20 a month.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:02.000]   - And if you want both, $35 a month.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.720]   - Yeah, oh, they don't even give you a break,
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.520]   just add them together and you can figure it out.
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.520]   - I think that's gonna demonstrate that the daily
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:11.360]   has the pretty much a workable model for everybody.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.720]   The idea that you have a simple flat rate
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.320]   that lets you download stuff automatically onto the device
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:18.200]   that you can then carry around with.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.760]   This notion where it costs you a certain amount of money
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.960]   to access via the web, certain amount of money to access via.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.720]   This mobile device, that mobile device,
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.800]   you can't cash stuff, you can't keep stuff, that's just nuts.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.720]   I'm a big fan of the New York Times,
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.760]   if there was any one newspaper that I would buy
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.440]   an annual subscription to, it would probably be the Times,
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.840]   but I just can't deal with the pricing structure.
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.400]   - You know what's gonna happen.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.400]   They're gonna drop the price.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.240]   - Yeah.
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:42.080]   (laughing)
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:42.920]   - They can't get away with it.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.240]   They're gonna completely change it,
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.880]   especially since there's so many different ways
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.120]   you can get that content free.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.640]   - It's so complex.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:52.800]   - Yeah, there's so much stuff that's kind of necessary.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.880]   You get 20 free views per month
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.040]   so that you don't necessarily have to always get,
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.600]   have a subscription in order to send you a link
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.080]   to a good article.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.040]   Links are also a different structure
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.680]   where you can get in through a link
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.320]   in a different manner than through the subscription model.
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:11.720]   It just seems as though the person who's gonna have to pay
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.880]   the most and go through the most amount of trouble
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.240]   are the people who are the most passionate users
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.800]   and the most passionate fans of the stuff
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.560]   that the New York Times does.
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.760]   - Has this happened already?
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:24.480]   If I go to my New York Times app on my iPhone, will I...
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.320]   - I don't believe so.
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.840]   I think it doesn't turn on for another couple of weeks
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.760]   until mid-April.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.920]   - I love New York Times.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:33.160]   I pay for the Sunday Times,
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.360]   but if they suddenly start saying,
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.720]   "Give us $15 a week," that ain't gonna happen.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.680]   - A big problem seems to be that it seems to be,
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.560]   they're trying to use the digital content
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.160]   to push paper subscriptions,
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.360]   which demonstrates how much money they think
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.960]   that they have to make by actually pulling out
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.280]   a physical product.
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.480]   They're not really ready to make that leap yet.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:54.200]   I don't know if I mean, when I buy not ready,
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.400]   I don't know if I mean psychologically ready,
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.440]   institutionally, or just simply, there is no,
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.960]   we don't have the infrastructure in order to
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:04.320]   try to make money off of putting paper
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.720]   out of trucks and dot-per-alpha people's houses.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.880]   - I think the danger really is,
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.760]   is that you're gonna not put your arms out
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:12.920]   for the handspring and you're not gonna get enough air
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.120]   for the back flip.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.880]   - So it's a gymnastics metaphor.
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.040]   - Yes, and I did that one time,
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.680]   and I spent 10 years in recovery.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:26.520]   - So anyway, yeah, but the key is that
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:27.760]   when you don't know what, I don't think
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.760]   that the problem that they really run into
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:34.760]   is that if people stop going because it's too expensive,
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.840]   and then they know people are no longer putting
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:43.640]   buying wood to put their, to read it on,
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:47.000]   they end up losing both the print and the online
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.520]   and real risk. - And trying to regain
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.280]   loss of subscribers is painful.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.880]   - Yeah, well, do I get a break?
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.360]   Okay, so I subscribed to Sunday Times,
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:58.040]   I presume that means I will get some break on this, yes.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:58.880]   - Do you?
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:11:59.720]   - I don't know. - I don't know.
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.320]   - I don't think they're connected.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:02.680]   - No, they're disconnected.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:03.880]   - Well, that's screwed up.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:08.880]   - That's, I mean, I think that's the case in a lot of situations.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.280]   And I, you know, and there's ads now on this,
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.960]   are they gonna get rid of the ads?
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.160]   - Nope, oh no, definitely not.
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.280]   It's gonna happen in the house ads.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.560]   - Okay, well, you know, it's easy to fix this.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.720]   Just press that little button there.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:25.360]   (laughing)
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.400]   And then it works.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.880]   - Delete New York Times, yeah.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.720]   - Now it works perfectly.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.200]   - It's free now.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:33.040]   - It's not, it was so easy.
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.360]   - Well, we've got a little fix for you here on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.000]   And now that you know,
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.120]   send the message.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.560]   (laughing)
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.280]   All right, let's take a break when we come back.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.000]   No, I, look.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.120]   - And that's one to grow on, by the way.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.000]   - That's what, yeah.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.960]   I have no spanking, is that what you're saying there?
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.800]   I make money.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.560]   I make a living doing this, but we offer it for free
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.080]   and we do advertising.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.080]   - Well, and the other thing is,
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.080]   is I think that there,
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.040]   - It's not that you can't have a paywall at all.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.200]   I mean, I think that there is a,
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.520]   you know, I think the daily has the right approach
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.720]   as far as we're not gonna charge you an arm and a leg,
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.800]   you know, it's a reasonable price for--
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.640]   - This does say it's the,
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.840]   now saying in our chair, it's free if you get the paper.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:14.680]   - Is it?
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:15.520]   - Yeah.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:16.360]   - So that would be good.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.600]   - Yeah, I just, it's complicated.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:19.440]   - It's complicated.
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.000]   - And then, you know, the thing is,
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   is there future marketer people who don't get paid.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.920]   - I just don't get paid. - Who's going to pay.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:24.760]   - But now, I don't-- - I don't think
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:26.120]   Times subscription gets you full access
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.360]   to web mobile and iPad.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.800]   See, I get that with a Wall Street Journal.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.200]   And that to me works.
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:34.520]   I pay 100, whatever it is, a year for the paper Wall Street Journal
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.240]   and then I get full access on the iPad.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.120]   - But is there a Jack Nicholson option
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.840]   to the subscription where you say,
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:43.000]   okay, I want you to give me a paper subscription.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.280]   I want the Sunday paper, which includes access to the iPad
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.720]   and then hold the Sunday paper.
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:49.560]   (laughing)
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.560]   - You know, ironically, there isn't for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.080]   I called them up and they said it costs more
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.200]   just to get it digitally.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.040]   What?
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.720]   It's cheaper to buy the paper and throw it out.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.960]   - Then it is, does that make any sense at all?
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.720]   - Yeah, that's the problem.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:08.360]   - Well, and until there's a pure digital delivery option
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.880]   and also just, I think that the best perceptive way
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:14.080]   to sell this content is to say,
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:15.880]   there's a difference between the web edition
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.040]   and the iPad edition.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.040]   The iPad edition, we deliver an electronic book
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:23.040]   to your device that is much better than the web
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.160]   and will work on your Wi-Fi device all day long
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.000]   through your commute.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.520]   And that's a different product.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.160]   People can perceive value in that
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.520]   the way they cannot receive a link to a webpage.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.880]   - I'm just waiting for the,
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:35.560]   this is all gonna be fine and dandy until Al Gore points out
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.560]   the carbon footprint that requires you to,
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:40.080]   you know, it's cheaper to get paper,
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.440]   70,000 trees every Sunday times.
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:43.280]   - Right, yeah.
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:44.640]   - And that's how many trees are used up there.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:45.480]   - Somebody in the chat room says,
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.320]   no, it's no problem.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.560]   You subscribe to the Paper Wall Street Journal.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.640]   You'll get the electronic edition,
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.720]   then you put the paper on hold,
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:53.160]   say I'm gonna be out of the country for the next 15 years.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.920]   And then I think everybody should just say,
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.120]   return to sender.
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:58.440]   - Yeah, return to sender.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:02.640]   - What if you're actually just to simply mount a shredder
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.720]   underneath, but beyond like you're in,
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.240]   you're inbound slot like that.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.080]   So you just have to sit in air, say New York Times
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:11.000]   was right here, but the third week in a row of the paper
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.240]   before I realized that there's a,
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.880]   jee jee jee jee jee jee jee jee jee jee jee jee jee jee
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:15.160]   sound every time you put that in.
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.120]   And says, you know what,
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.400]   maybe that's why paper I don't have to drop off anymore.
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:22.200]   - Damn paper boy, Mr. Shredder again, honey.
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:25.000]   - Oh God, come on, they're in my mouth.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.600]   - Bob, look at the mess in this foyer.
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.480]   We should tell that lad not to wear such tight gloves.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.360]   He wouldn't keep losing fingers this way.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.440]   It's damn inconvenient for us.
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.800]   - I hate that.
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.520]   - Now this mother to come here with a mop
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:41.520]   and so Mr. Clean, you do that really well, Andy.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.240]   - Well, I was born to go inside.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.480]   - You were born with a silver spoon filled
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:46.800]   with maple sugar in your mouth.
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.560]   - I've cut the lines and cleaned the pools
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.120]   of many people above my station here.
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.600]   (laughing)
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.520]   - When I was in the Hamptons cleaning pools,
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.360]   I learned how to speak like this.
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.960]   Oh boy, for some reason the printer
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.720]   doesn't wanna do anything.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.160]   Put down those shares.
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.560]   I'm paying your five dollars for one hour paper.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.480]   It doesn't matter what you're doing.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.320]   - Chop chop.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:08.320]   Chop it each other.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.960]   - Hey, our new mostly photo show is coming up right after
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.680]   this show in about 20 minutes.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.520]   Lisa Bettany and I will talk about photography.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:17.720]   Oh, I forgot to bring my camera.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.800]   I have to go home and bring my can't do photography show
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:21.640]   without your camera.
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.880]   I have to go home and get my camera.
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.240]   We're gonna do what's in my camera bag today.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:29.880]   So stay tuned, that's at live.twit.tv, 1pm Pacific,
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.600]   4pm Eastern time every Tuesday, our brand new show.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.840]   Net at night is rebranded, renamed and moved
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.000]   to 11am Mondays, 2pm Eastern,
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.800]   Amber Mac and Sarah Lane and the new title,
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.120]   The Social Hour.
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:46.760]   We're gonna cover social media.
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.600]   - Awesome.
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:48.880]   - Yeah, it's gonna be great show.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.920]   Lisa and I are also doing a photo walker.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:53.280]   First of three photo walks is coming up Saturday,
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:56.000]   March 26th, two o'clock in San Francisco
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.280]   at the Ferry Building.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.360]   You can find out more by visiting
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.440]   mostlyphotoadventures.com.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.280]   We do want you to RSVP there.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.680]   And while you're there, learn more about the 100%
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.680]   reinvented 2011 Ford Explorer,
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:10.360]   thanks to Ford for supporting mostly photo
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.680]   and our mostly photo photo walks,
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:15.280]   mostly photo adventures.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.360]   Dot com, our picks of the week coming up
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:20.160]   in just a moment in a momentito.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.240]   But first, yes, it's another Canadian company.
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:26.440]   You know, this maple butter is getting better all the time.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.120]   - All right, now see, people are gonna ask you
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.240]   to open your books and find out exactly
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:32.000]   where your money is coming from.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.120]   Is there some tourist board that's
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.840]   say South of Michigan?
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:36.680]   - A North of Michigan.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:37.520]   - North of Michigan. - North of Michigan.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:38.360]   - North of Michigan. - North of Michigan.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.160]   - I think we should,
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.640]   we should get more American companies out of here.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:43.960]   - If there's anybody from like the Vermont Tourism Board,
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:46.320]   send me a box of hats, posters,
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.000]   'cause we gotta have fight fire with fire.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.160]   I'll have like the Canadian,
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.360]   I'll have the the the rotten flag behind me.
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:54.920]   I'll have green trees and pine trees around here.
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.240]   - I'm not gonna say that. - I'm not gonna say
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.760]   American Vermont Jaws.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.160]   - I'm not gonna say that. - And we'll be serving that.
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.120]   - And it's scrapple for everyone.
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.400]   - I got my man pack the other day.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.440]   You know that?
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.960]   Manpacks is another Canadian company
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:08.000]   that send you underwear in the mail.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.520]   (laughing)
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.200]   I have a subscription every three months.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.120]   I get three pairs of shorts.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.200]   - It's just like the Davy Jones in 1968.
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.520]   It's wonderful.
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:16.360]   - Three pairs?
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.320]   (laughing)
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.520]   It's not used!
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:21.000]   Three pairs of shorts.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.160]   Three T-shirts, three pairs of socks.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.520]   They come in the mail every three months.
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:27.000]   That way I never have to wear underwear
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.560]   more than one month without washing.
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:30.400]   - It's great.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.800]   - But let me get back to FreshBooks.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.720]   - 'Cause that's-- - You say one month?
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:36.120]   - Every month I get three pairs.
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:37.120]   - Oh, okay. - Every three months.
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.600]   No, no, every three months I get three pairs.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:39.440]   - That's not it.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.280]   - So one month. - One month.
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.360]   - Do they get crunchy yet?
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.360]   (laughing)
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:43.200]   - Oh. - Okay.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.040]   - Moving on.
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.040]   - Add advertisement.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.040]   Money coming in.
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.760]   - Give the first few weeks,
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.880]   they just get soft as butter.
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:51.920]   - Really, really great photo show coming up
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:52.880]   in less than 20 minutes.
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.360]   We don't want to crowd them on that,
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.360]   so let's--
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:59.000]   - FreshBooks.com, everybody should go there very soon.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.400]   Right now, in fact, it'd be a good time.
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.680]   freshbooks.com makes invoicing fun.
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.640]   Oh, I know, that sounds impossible, doesn't it?
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.360]   Well, I love to invoice with freshbooks.com.
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.240]   Actually, it was Amber MacArthur told me about this in 2004,
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:14.120]   since then, 2 million people have used FreshBooks
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.600]   to send invoices.
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:17.480]   Now, there's two things that FreshBooks does for you.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.320]   First of all, makes it easy.
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.840]   Easy as can be to make it invoice.
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.640]   You put your logo, you upload it.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.200]   You don't have to print it out.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.040]   They mail it.
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.120]   They'll print it out for you if you want,
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:29.240]   for an additional fee, even put a stamp on it.
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:30.720]   They have some nice features,
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:33.320]   including an iPhone based time tracking app,
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.080]   so, or on the web.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.480]   And so you can track hours if you bill hours,
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.800]   and it'll automatically go right into the invoice.
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:42.840]   But the most important thing about FreshBooks
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.480]   isn't how easy it is to invoice.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:48.360]   It's how easy it is to get paid.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.720]   FreshBooks users, according to their survey,
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:54.920]   in 2007, get paid an average of two weeks faster,
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.360]   because that email invoice comes with a button
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.200]   that says, "Pay this bill now."
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.200]   Of course, they can send you a check.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.040]   I'm not saying they can't,
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.000]   but they can also use PayPal,
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   or 11 other online paying services,
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.200]   or a credit card to pay you right away.
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.920]   And when it's easy for your clients to pay,
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:11.560]   you get paid more quickly and more easily.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:14.160]   In case your clients are not quite on time,
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.920]   there are automated late payment reminders
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.560]   that could be sent out.
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.840]   So you see I have three reminders here,
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:22.920]   every 30 days I sent out another reminders that says,
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:23.840]   "You know, here's the invoice.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.200]   Maybe you lost that invoice.
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:27.080]   You need to copy it in."
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.680]   I just love FreshBooks.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:30.080]   It does everything right.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.880]   Data's, of course, secure, backed up in real time
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.920]   to three sources in two different locations.
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:41.680]   256-bit SSL encryption, so you are absolutely secure.
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:43.160]   I just love this.
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.360]   I want you to try it free.
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.760]   It's actually free for the first three clients.
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:48.080]   So if you're a small business person,
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.560]   I could sell five years of my--
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.400]   Exactly.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.880]   I was invoicing Rogers, the radio show,
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:54.960]   and that was it.
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:56.560]   It was easy.
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.640]   Free.
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:59.720]   And they are sending out birthday cakes every day.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:00.960]   They have a drawing for a birthday cake
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.880]   to people who sign up for FreshBooks using.
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:06.160]   FreshBooks.com, actually, there is no offer code.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.000]   I'm gonna take that off there.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.560]   Just FreshBooks.com, make it easy for you.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:09.920]   Just tell them that we came.
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:10.920]   Well, too, you know, they will,
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.200]   if you, they may ask you at some point,
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.040]   where did you hear about it?
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:17.800]   It would be a great boon to us, if you would just say,
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:20.080]   "Yeah, I don't know that Mac Brick Weekly thing."
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.040]   They were eating the maple butter.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.600]   That's all I know, it was a maple butter show.
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.800]   Something about maple butter, they'll know.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:25.800]   And they'll want some.
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:29.240]   FreshBooks.com, easy online invoicing.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:33.120]   It's the best, I can say, 'cause I used it for years.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.000]   I now have people.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.760]   Consistently more expensive.
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:38.080]   Yes.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.440]   I kind of am thinking, "I may have been able to."
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.440]   I'm in a mistake there.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.600]   Should have, should have kept with the FreshBooks.
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.480]   So, I just got a reminder to take a picture of myself.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.320]   I hope you don't mind.
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:51.120]   This is my pick of the week.
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.000]   You know Lonely Sandwich?
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.440]   The guy who works with Merlin Mann,
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:57.680]   and they do that, "You Look Nice Today," podcast?
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:58.560]   They got a new app.
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.480]   Just came out yesterday that I just think is so cool.
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:03.360]   It's simple, this isn't fancy, a Buck 99.
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.080]   It's called Every Day.
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.640]   And you see, I just started, 'cause it just came out.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.160]   Every day, I take a picture of myself.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.000]   See?
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.720]   And it shows you, either shows you the previous picture.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:14.640]   Oh, look at that.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.800]   So, I can line it up, or it shows me the grid.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:21.560]   So, that way, the idea is, you take this picture every day,
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.320]   you're all lining it up.
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:24.760]   I'll do another picture here.
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.040]   I have to do it like this,
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.760]   so I get all lined up exactly right.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.720]   And then, it'll make a movie out of it,
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:31.240]   you know, after it's not gonna happen right away,
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:35.040]   but after a year or so, you got 365 images.
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:36.320]   You've seen those where it's, you know--
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.560]   Oh, there's the one.
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:38.560]   There's that famous one.
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.240]   Let's see.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.080]   Let's see.
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:45.960]   I gotta get this, match this right up there.
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.320]   18 million views.
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:49.360]   For that one video?
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.920]   For Noah takes a photo of himself every day.
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.480]   That's it, Noah, yeah.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:53.840]   Noah, every day, you gotta see it,
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:56.680]   'cause this'll be inspiring for the.
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:00.160]   So, yeah, Noah's the guy who kind of did this.
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:02.680]   And I think it's gonna be kind of fun to have this
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:06.880]   in my, you know, so it does this, you know, automatically.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:11.360]   So, you see, and by lining up your face,
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.200]   you get an interesting--
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.320]   And I'm sure it was a lot harder for him
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.160]   than it is with this app.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.280]   Oh yeah, he probably had to put tape on the ground
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.360]   or something.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.360]   The background can change.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.200]   See, that's fun.
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.640]   The hair changes.
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:22.920]   He did this for six years.
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.160]   You get fatter, you get thinner.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.480]   Yeah, that's kind of a little OCD.
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:27.960]   Yeah, but he got 18 million views.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:30.120]   But he started this before he even--
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:30.960]   That's OCD that paid off.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:31.800]   You two had existed.
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.600]   I mean, he's an artist.
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:35.440]   He's an artist.
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:36.280]   It's an artist.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:37.720]   Pretty cool, huh?
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.640]   Five minutes, six years.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.560]   And his eyes--
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.560]   No, his eyes never changed.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:44.920]   That's what is a little creepy.
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.120]   Maybe I should never--
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:47.960]   But you really see him there.
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.120]   Oh my God.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.680]   Sometimes he's got bedhead.
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.360]   Oh, that's a fern.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.360]   Oh my God, the hair.
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:58.120]   Some major hairage.
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.160]   His hair's alive.
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.000]   Isn't that wild?
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.200]   So anyway, this is an app, but it's my pick every day.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:05.520]   You can do this too.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.400]   If you have this app in six years.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:11.000]   Yeah, I don't know if I have the patience
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.160]   to do that for six years.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.320]   Oh, so I'm trying to do it with my kids.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.120]   I have a two-frame movie so far.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.800]   Would be fun to do this with your kids, wouldn't I?
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:19.920]   If I could get them to look at it
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.920]   long enough to take the picture, that's the--
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:24.440]   Do it with my dog.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:25.280]   You don't try to--
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.920]   No, you used to weigh your hair on March 21st.
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:27.920]   Oh, man.
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:29.800]   I don't even want to look at that.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.120]   I went out like that, you believe.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:34.120]   Waymyhair.com.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.280]   Yeah, that's a great site.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:39.120]   And I promised I would show you this Gizmodo trick.
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.680]   Gizmodo discovered this.
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:44.600]   First of all, I didn't even know this part.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:47.000]   You got to go to the App Store and get Xcode.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.680]   Used to be free.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:50.680]   You just have to be a developer to do it.
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:51.520]   Not anymore.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.640]   Xcode is now on the App Store and it's not free anymore,
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:55.720]   but it's only five bucks.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:56.560]   And Xcode is--
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.080]   Xcode's the Macintosh development.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.280]   This is Xcode 4.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.120]   Yeah, the brand new one.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:03.400]   Yeah, you won't get updated to Xcode 4 if you don't do this.
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:05.960]   So I did it, five bucks, 4.2 gigabytes.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.400]   And then it expands.
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:11.280]   So you need about 10 gigs free to do this.
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.320]   That's cool.
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.360]   So five bucks.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:13.920]   Well worth it.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:17.360]   This is the development system for Macintosh.
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:20.280]   You probably have it on your Mac operating system disc,
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:21.960]   but you don't have the current version.
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.160]   You only have version 3.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.440]   This is version 4.
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:30.200]   Now, once you do that, you then plug in your iPad 2.
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:32.680]   Did I mention this is the iPad 2?
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:33.800]   Not the iPad.
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.840]   I don't think it works with the iPad 1.
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:36.840]   It does.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:37.920]   It does.
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:40.720]   There's a development mode for the iPad 1.
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:43.120]   How come we never knew that?
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.320]   You knew that.
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:47.280]   Because I read about it on a overblog.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:49.160]   It's publicly available.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:50.720]   Oh, that's my mistake.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:51.320]   I never read that.
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.280]   There's that.
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:55.680]   So anyway, you attach it to-- there's a whole article
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:56.880]   on how to do this in Gizmodo.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:00.040]   And then, maybe it was you who told me about this, Andy.
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:03.680]   Then, your iPad has new gestures.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:05.520]   So what you'll have to do--
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.000]   let me show the iPad-- is go into the settings.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.360]   Once you turn this on, you go into the settings,
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:16.080]   and you'll see where the setting is for how the rotation goes.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:19.480]   There's a new one-- multitasking gestures.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:22.520]   Use four or five fingers to pinch to the home screen.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.960]   Watch this.
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.680]   Wow!
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.000]   That was cool, wasn't it?
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:30.260]   Why?
[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:31.480]   I don't know why they don't just build that.
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:33.400]   It's not even Leo making that noise either.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:34.240]   No.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:35.840]   It makes that noise.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:40.160]   You can swipe up to get the multitasking bar.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.400]   There it is, see?
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.200]   Look at that.
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.240]   Swipe left or right to go between apps.
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:44.960]   That's the coolest.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:45.520]   Watch this.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:47.960]   [BEEPING]
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.880]   [BEEPING]
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:52.680]   I love the sound.
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:54.880]   They really need to add-- yeah, the sound effects are great.
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.880]   I wonder-- yeah.
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:57.080]   By the way, that is--
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.080]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.080]   For those of you who noticed--
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:00.920]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:03.000]   That when I went by Safari, that the page it was on
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.720]   was a search for pedaloma psychiatrists, that's not for me.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:08.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.120]   This is when I was going to recommend.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.320]   I'm going to save it for iPad today.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.200]   This is such a great game.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.440]   But anyway, so that's cool, isn't it?
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.720]   Wouldn't you like to do that?
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:16.240]   Watch this.
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:16.880]   It's easy.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:17.240]   It's easy.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:18.240]   Go.
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.040]   All you have to do is pay $5 for that capability.
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:23.640]   It's well worth it.
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.080]   And you get Xcode for free.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:29.360]   Or if you've paid $5 for Xcode, you could do this for free.
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.400]   Your choice.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:32.560]   Your pick-- well, that's good.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:33.200]   I like that, Andy.
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.520]   Can you do that at will?
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:36.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000]   Wow.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000]   Wow.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.160]   That's something you learned in school to drive the teachers
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.160]   crazy, isn't it?
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.160]   That's mostly something I learned when I was administrating
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.080]   a Mac lab to drive people using their Macs crazy.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:48.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.000]   They've got another error.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.480]   I don't know why I keep it.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:54.080]   It took a while before they realized, oh, it's when
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:56.280]   that weird-looking admin is actually walking around
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:58.280]   that this Mac needs to be screwing up.
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.280]   OK.
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.280]   OK.
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.920]   Well, I got you on camera, Andy.
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.480]   Why don't you give us your--
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.480]   OK.
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:09.480]   This is a Mac app that I encountered a few days ago
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:14.280]   when I had a specific need for a specific type of photo app.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:15.880]   And I knew that, well, there's probably
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.080]   someone who's thought of this before.
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:18.480]   And darn, if they didn't--
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:22.080]   this is a app called Collage by a company called CFX.
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.280]   If you go to--
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.680]   ooh, I'm going to have the wrong window open.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:29.520]   But it's on the app store.
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.000]   And all it does is what you see behind me.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.720]   It takes source photos and puts them into any collage format
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:36.880]   you really, really want.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.280]   So if you're doing any kind of publishing,
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.920]   you can do this sort of stuff easily enough
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:44.240]   if you just do a whole bunch of cutting and pasting
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.280]   and aligning.
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:48.840]   But it's even easier if you pay these guys $30.
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:53.160]   And just simply start dragging photos in there.
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:56.680]   You start off with a pretty simple prefabbed format.
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:58.920]   But as you keep building and building, when you decide that,
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:02.280]   well, actually, I want this image right here
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.480]   to be sort of a portrait.
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:04.840]   But now it's not aligned properly.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.880]   So I'll just start scaling and cropping it so that it fills the way.
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:10.840]   Oh, no, I need this one to be facing the other way.
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:12.520]   This image here, I need to be facing.
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.200]   I don't know how wet it can do this.
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:16.880]   It's more perspective.
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:19.480]   But I want this image to be facing the other way
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:22.560]   so that she's facing into the rest of the shot.
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.800]   It's the sort of thing where if you do these things more
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:28.280]   than once, you find yourself asking yourself,
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:31.240]   how much would I be willing to pay some guy $30 to make this
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:33.840]   really, really easy every time I need to do it?
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:36.080]   So it's not a cheap app at $30.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:39.680]   But considering how well it works to do any sort of collage
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:43.400]   app, right now, you see up here is just a simple three-frame
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:48.360]   collage, but it's a lot--
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:48.880]   Oh, here we go.
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:51.720]   And on our westerly front.
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:52.720]   I'm sorry enough.
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.280]   I'm doing that terrible thing where you're
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:55.400]   watching yourself on TV.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:57.200]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:59.040]   Cool.
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:01.960]   But yeah, this is just one simple layout,
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.360]   but you make things a lot more complicated.
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.680]   And of course, the more complicated
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:10.400]   a collage you want to create, the cheaper that $30 seems to you.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:13.520]   So if you are in a position where you're just laying out
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:16.000]   high-resolution collages for certain pages,
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.560]   or if I bought because I'm setting up a couple of e-books
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:22.800]   that seem to deserve the easiest way
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.840]   to do this sort of thing and control the layout
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:28.280]   is just sort of hard wire in where these pictures go.
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:30.800]   I did the first two by hand.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:33.160]   Then I got the demo and said, no, what?
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.600]   $30 does not seem too cheap, given that I have
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:38.200]   11 more of these to go.
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.640]   So good, good stuff.
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:42.000]   By CFX, they do have a free demo.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.480]   So if you just want to give it a try, it'll-- of course,
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:50.320]   it'll-- I tried to check it out on this machine here,
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.160]   which isn't authorized for it yet.
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.520]   And it's all this export.
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:54.760]   Then use that as the background image.
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:57.000]   And of course, the demo version, it's all stamped.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.960]   Demo, demo, demo, demo, demo, in huge letters.
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:02.680]   So but it'll give you a chance to see exactly what they have
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:03.200]   does.
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:03.960]   I like the one.
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:08.960]   On the OS 10 app store, it's called collage $30.
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:11.560]   Boy, this would be a nice thing to have on the iPad as well.
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:14.120]   I could really see somebody doing this kind of thing
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:15.120]   on the iPad.
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:16.600]   Yeah.
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:17.600]   Thank you, Andy and Naco.
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:19.360]   Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:20.840]   So I have a--
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:22.320]   I decided to move one pick to the next week,
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.440]   because I'm going to have a switch on.
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:27.360]   But I have a problem.
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:28.440]   I have many problems.
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:29.440]   I thought so.
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:30.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:34.360]   I forget a lot of my appointments.
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:36.680]   Like, my way of managing everybody
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:37.920]   is that as I tell everyone--
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.520]   I give everyone my phone number.
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:40.480]   And then I--
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:41.080]   let's meet it too.
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.200]   And then they call and go, hey, how's it going?
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.440]   Just like as if I remembered that there was going to be a meeting
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:46.800]   right now.
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.920]   But if I have to call them, I miss about one of them.
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:49.440]   I'm that way.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.000]   Totally, yeah.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.840]   Yeah, so I just manage everyone around me
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.800]   to manage my insanity.
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:56.160]   But part of it is just that it's not in front of me all the time.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:57.720]   And now my computer's in front of me all the time,
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:59.240]   but my schedule isn't.
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:01.160]   And I would be better if it was in front of me.
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:03.040]   And I've been looking for the right app to do this.
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:03.720]   And I download it.
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:05.000]   I bought a bunch of them.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.320]   And the one that I'm happy with, that I'm happiest with
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.640]   is one called Blotter.
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:11.960]   Now, this is on the App Store.
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:12.480]   And--
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:13.160]   Oh, I don't know this one.
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:16.040]   And what Blotter does is it puts it on your desktop.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:16.800]   It puts your schedule.
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:18.280]   So you could take a Geek tool to do this.
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:19.600]   So Blotter is probably a little easier.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:22.040]   Geek tool was what I had been playing around before.
[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:23.720]   Yeah, that's the one where you can kind of really program it all in.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:24.560]   You could do anything with that.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:25.120]   You could do anything with it.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.680]   And console, I have my to-do list on there.
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:28.960]   And I just decided that was a little more than I wanted.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.280]   And I found some stability issues
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.920]   that I started blaming Geek tool for.
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:33.480]   And I don't know if this will be any better.
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.720]   But what it does is it just embeds this on your--
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:36.400]   Oh, it's pretty.
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:36.960]   It's pretty.
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.360]   And it embeds it on your-- and you can't click on it
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:40.520]   while it's in your desktop.
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:41.880]   That's one of the kind of important things.
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:42.880]   So it's sitting underneath it.
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.160]   It kind of looks like you want to click on it.
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:44.560]   It does.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.320]   But no, but it's good, though, that it's not.
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:49.680]   And so essentially what you can do is you can have it there.
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:51.120]   You can have it fill the whole screen.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:53.680]   There's a small one that'll go over to one side.
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:56.000]   And this just keeps my schedule in front of me.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.520]   So that every time I go to my desktop,
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.560]   I can see what my schedule is.
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.920]   It also tends to have me not want to make it messy.
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:02.320]   I like this.
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:05.920]   Because it's just a nice, subtle, it goes over whatever
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:07.880]   images you're already putting together.
[01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:09.320]   I thought it was well designed.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:11.280]   And I don't know how much it is, because once you buy it--
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:11.880]   It's $10.
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:13.080]   $10, OK.
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:14.400]   Once you buy it, it just says it's still--
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:15.160]   I know I hate that.
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:15.640]   It's really bad.
[01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:16.600]   I can't tell you.
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:17.800]   Someone asked me how much was it?
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.080]   I was talking to somebody else about it.
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:20.080]   And I was like, I have no idea.
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:21.720]   I went to the website and it doesn't say it.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:22.920]   It just points you toward the actual--
[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:23.680]   It's installed.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:24.280]   That's all we know.
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:25.520]   So anyway, so it's called Bladder.
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:28.000]   And it's nifty.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.840]   Now, I think busy-- I use BusyCal.
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.440]   Does this work with BusyCal or only with ICal?
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:33.800]   I only use ICal.
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:34.640]   I bet it's ICal.
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:36.240]   But I think there is a way to do this with BusyCal.
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:37.440]   I have to do some research.
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:40.960]   Geek Tool will put your stuff up there, but not in a pretty way.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:41.720]   It's just text-based.
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:44.080]   It can be pretty, but you really have to do a lot of work with it.
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.800]   You have to do a shell programming.
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.360]   Yeah, there's a lot of heavy lifting to make it pretty.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:51.920]   And of course, others can't see your Bladder, only you.
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:56.160]   People are saying, Alex, a $10 app, are you feeling OK?
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.560]   That's awfully inexpensive.
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:59.640]   You know, I have-- you know what?
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:02.560]   I had a pick for this week that I'll pick next week
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:03.600]   that will make up for it.
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.000]   No.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.280]   He's got a new car.
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:11.280]   Alex, Alex is not like, "Dipping Taunted."
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:12.280]   Oh.
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:13.280]   Oh.
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:14.280]   Oh.
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:15.280]   Oh.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:15.780]   Oh.
[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:16.760]   I didn't realize you could--
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:18.280]   believe it or not, I didn't realize you could do this.
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:19.280]   Like, in the photo view.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.880]   Oh, it's changing.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:23.080]   All I did was use the trick to OK, to always expand that
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:26.680]   and realize that for no absolutely no functional purpose,
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:28.560]   that will also let you rotate as your--
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:29.560]   No, no.
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:30.560]   --this bigger.
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:31.800]   It's just to drive you crazy, basically.
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:35.480]   No, no, just to sort of make every other tablet developer
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:37.920]   squirm say, yeah, that's how much power we got.
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.720]   It's not only in this hardware and the operating system,
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:40.720]   but also in the development.
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:43.800]   You know, we just thought, hey, my phone call that I'm expecting
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:44.800]   is 10 minutes late.
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:47.000]   I'll just add something really, really powerful
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.440]   that would be impossible for any other operating system to do
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:50.560]   because I got 10 minutes to fill.
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:51.560]   That's really time.
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:52.400]   That's what we're doing now.
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:53.960]   Sister Quartz command.
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:56.440]   Annie and I got rights for the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:57.760]   You must read it.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:02.040]   Is there an app for that?
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.120]   I don't believe there is an app for the Sun Times yet.
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:07.320]   We're-- see, because here at the Chicago Sun Times,
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:10.960]   we don't believe that journalism and quality criticism
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:12.680]   should be trapped behind firewalls.
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:16.080]   We believe that America deserves more.
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.920]   Chicago Sun Times, we're the bright one.
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:20.360]   Come check us out at suntimes.com.
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.560]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:26.080]   Chicago Sun Times, his website, www.cdub.ob.com.
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:27.440]   Alex Lindsey is in the Pixelcore.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.600]   He's the head pixel.
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.280]   You just check it out, pixelcore.com
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:33.760]   for the guild of multimedia artists working and training
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.720]   together in, of course, Pixelcore.tv.
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:37.600]   For the many shows they do, Alex,
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:40.320]   will be going with us to the National Association of Broadcasters
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:40.480]   Show.
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:41.360]   We're prepping hard.
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:42.680]   A couple of weeks we'll be doing that
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:45.280]   quickly from there, as well as some of our other shows.
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.840]   But we'll also be having a great time there,
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:49.280]   seeing all the new gear.
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:52.000]   I think it's going to be one of the most interesting NABs
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000]   in five years.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.040]   I mean, there are so many things that I know are coming.
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:58.800]   And that I think are coming.
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.520]   That I'm just-- I just can't--
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:02.440]   Usually at NAB, I kind of feel like, oh, I have to go.
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:04.200]   I don't really want to go to Vegas again.
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:08.080]   I don't really want to deal with the LVCC.
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:10.120]   And this year, I'm actually kind of giddy.
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:10.720]   Kind of excited.
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:14.640]   Well, just to confirm my belief that the National Association
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:16.760]   of Broadcasters was intelligent and picking
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:20.520]   TWIT as its official net cast partner for this year.
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:21.080]   This is the year.
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:22.120]   Oh, Bob Hiles here.
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:23.040]   You're going to be there, too.
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:24.960]   Do you know what happens on Wednesday night?
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:26.400]   What happens Wednesday night, Bob Hiles?
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:32.200]   Wednesday night at 6 o'clock, Sarah and I host a reception
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:33.320]   just across the alley in the--
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:34.120]   Well, we better be there.
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.200]   It's two hours.
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:37.200]   Are we invited?
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:38.320]   Everyone's invited.
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:43.840]   It's-- last year, we gave away $14,000 in prizes.
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:46.520]   All kinds of-- almost everybody wins a prize
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:48.880]   and gets some free-finger food and some drinks and stuff.
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:50.120]   It's really a fun thing.
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:52.640]   It really is for the amateur radio operators
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.240]   that are engineers.
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:56.560]   But hey, a lot of chief engineers are--
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:57.080]   They are.
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:57.280]   --are hands.
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.000]   And it's really fun.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.640]   When we started that, they didn't know that in great
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:01.160]   percentage.
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:04.240]   But Wednesday night, 6 o'clock, come and join us.
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:08.120]   We use Bob's-- for those who wonder, who is this Bob Hiles?
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:10.360]   We use Bob's microphones exclusively.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:12.640]   They're the official microphone provider
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.480]   to the TWIT net cast network.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:16.320]   And if you like our sound, you're
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.120]   liking the Hiles PR40, which is the best
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:19.760]   mic in the world as far as I'm concerned.
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.600]   And amazingly cheap.
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:24.240]   I mean, I don't mean cheaply made inexpensive to buy.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:25.520]   And if you're not--
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.600]   I mean, man, this is the mic.
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:28.440]   Bob, it's nice to see you.
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:29.440]   Thank you for popping in.
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:29.960]   We're here.
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:30.440]   Had a lot of fun.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:32.920]   And we'll see you at NAB.
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:33.400]   Wednesday night.
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:34.800]   April 14th through 16th.
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:36.080]   We'll be there broadcasting live.
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:37.560]   Should be a lot of fun.
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:39.160]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:40.320]   Mostly photo coming up next.
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.360]   Our brand new photo show with Lisa Betney.
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.440]   We're going to go out in the field and record this one.
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:45.600]   Crazy.
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.280]   It's insane.
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:49.360]   Have a great day, a great week.
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:50.360]   We'll see you next time.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:51.400]   Now you get back to work.
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:52.440]   Break times over.
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:58.380]   (upbeat music)
[01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:01.040]   (intense music)
