[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:44.160]   I'm here in New York, John Foster and Scott are on the west coast and we are going to,
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.120]   what's the big news for this week?
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.280]   John Scott, have you been following the news this week?
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.320]   Well the big news this week seems to be that Photoshop CS3 is going to be available on December
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.320]   the 15th.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.720]   So that's a lot earlier.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.720]   Well this isn't going to be available, it will be a beta version.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.720]   And it's basically making a public beta?
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.720]   It's basically a public beta much like Lightroom or other software.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.720]   And the big thing about this is that this gets around a couple of huge problems that Photoshop
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.720]   has running in Rosetta.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.720]   And that first problem is that under Rosetta it can only use one gig of RAM.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.000]   Well that's not normally a big problem for guys that are doing web kind of things but
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.600]   it is a problem for people doing print.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.480]   So someone who is doing print is much better using a G5 dual dual with as much RAM as
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.600]   possible because it will go and use all of that RAM.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.040]   But with an Intel version it doesn't.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.240]   The other problem is that if you are running other apps like Illustrator and Word and Entourage
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.840]   and all the other things that haven't been universally binary yet or Intellified as I
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:07.040]   call it, then the RAM footprint becomes even smaller.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.040]   Because it's still only using a small chunk of the RAM.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.640]   Well Photoshop tries to use all the RAM.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.960]   Photoshop is trying to use all the drive space, all the RAM, everything available on the
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.960]   computer.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.960]   Sometimes I find it is trying to use my mouse.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.560]   Well if you are using Photoshop you should really just use Photoshop on that machine
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.960]   and try not to use other stuff.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.560]   Especially if you have left it in an untuned situation.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.560]   Well especially also if you are doing print level stuff and higher resolution stuff,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.560]   that's where this becomes super important.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560]   Right.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.560]   Like Greg out of Cap of a kind of guy.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.560]   He is going to be unhappy with CS2 Photoshop.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.960]   But this is exciting because what this does is that this frees, this shows us what this
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.560]   machine, the Intel version of the Macs are really all about.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.560]   We will see some better benchmarking.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:15.560]   We will see the push to get developers to recode their plug-ins.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.560]   Which is everyone has been standing by waiting for this to happen.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.560]   And now there is the incentive to get it done.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.560]   And there has been a lot of, and one of the questions that is coming up right now on our
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.560]   forums just to confirm it, I think John kind of covered it, is that this is a universal
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.560]   code.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.560]   And this actually gives by putting out in beta, it really does give the developers enough
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.560]   time to have a near public beta of there.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.560]   You know, having everybody have the availability of the new application.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.560]   Right.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.760]   Well, traditionally when you get a new version of something from Adobe, and this is not
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.560]   a slam against Adobe, but it is just a very difficult thing that they have to do, which
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.560]   is they are trying to ship five different applications in a box at the exactly the same
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.560]   time.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.560]   And so shipping schedules doesn't allow for perfect software.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.560]   What do you mean by five, five versions of applications?
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.560]   Well, you have got Illustrator, you have got InDesign, you have got the software.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.560]   InDesign, you have got GoLive, but now replaced by Dreamweaver and Adobe Bridge and Photoshop.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.560]   So you have five different applications that are going to go in the CS suite.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.560]   And so they all have to converge at the same exact time from a development point of view.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.560]   And that is a difficult thing.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   I mean, it is mind-bogglingly difficult.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.560]   And I am surprised that they even made the effort to do it because what that means is
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.560]   that the whole company is in lockstep trying to move forward.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   In the past, before they had CS, it was Photoshop would ship when it could ship and Illustrator
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.560]   would ship when it would ship.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.560]   And it made for better versions of the applications.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.560]   Right.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.560]   So now it is just a big – and it is something that as they try to sync all these applications
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.560]   together to make it a better experience for the designers, that it is kind of a necessary
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.560]   evil related to this problem.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.560]   I am excited about the beta because what this does is that we can essentially call this
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.560]   1.0 of CS3.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.560]   And so the people that want to be the early adopters can go and use it and report the bugs
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.560]   that they get.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.560]   And when it actually does ship in April or May, whenever second quarter is, I mean, that
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   is all the way up until the end of June, then it will be a much better application.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.560]   And I think that it also lets – it definitely will be much more solid.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.560]   I know that we have been doing tests where we released some of our applications.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.560]   Some of the DVROG's applications are released into the PIXACOR and actually it is not just
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.560]   DVROG's handful of other applications into the PIXACOR ahead of time and that helped knock
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.560]   out a lot of bugs before it went to general release.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.560]   Right.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.560]   Well, you can see every – you can never anticipate every single way that the user is going to
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.560]   use stuff.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.560]   And sometimes it is just a weird stuff.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.560]   Sometimes someone will have a bizarre version of a JPEG that was compressed with something
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.560]   years ago and it just causes grief.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.560]   Well, you know, I hate to interrupt this.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.560]   I hate to interrupt this Adobe love test here.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   But I would like to point out something that there is like how many thousands of universal
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.560]   applications already shipped and Adobe is like in the caboose on the train.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.560]   I don't think that this necessarily should be grounds for applause that they are finally
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.560]   getting this thing together.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.560]   Well, we are not – we are not applauding them.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:39.560]   I mean, for one, this was caused by engineering decisions that got made a decade ago.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.560]   And this has nothing to do with them going, "Oh, we are asleep at the wheel."
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.560]   No, no, no, no.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:52.560]   This was everything from the compiler that they used that didn't get ported to Intel
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.560]   to Apple making decisions about which processor to use on and on.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.560]   And also, I think it has also been Adobe's further moved towards the PC as far as making
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.560]   sure they are really supporting the PC.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.560]   I definitely feel like I think that Adobe has seen Apple as encroaching on their territory.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.560]   And I think there is a lot of their focus.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.560]   I mean, a big part of their market, half of the Photoshop market at least, is on the Mac.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.560]   But they still want to make sure that they keep on pushing the PC side because I think
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.560]   they are afraid of getting too far into – they need to be separate from Apple.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.560]   So I think that that has been part of the thing.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.560]   That is a mistake in my opinion on their part.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.560]   But I do think that most of this stuff is very old code.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.560]   And this is not just a problem that is facing Adobe.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.560]   This is a problem facing a lot of other application developers, not just with universal
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.560]   porting, but also with general issues related to moving forward.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   A lot of these apps, you start making these decisions.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.560]   It is kind of like I am in New York right now and I always noticed the difference between New York.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.560]   Most of the cities on the West is that one was built around – the streets are much smaller.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.560]   They weren't built around modern cars.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.560]   You go to somewhere in Arizona or something and all the roads are really wide because
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.560]   they already knew what was coming.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.560]   In the same way, applications that were written in started being written in 1989-1990.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.560]   And there is probably code that hasn't changed very much since the mid-90s in Photoshop.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.560]   Getting that all revved up is quite a process.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.560]   The other thing is that Adobe is the apps that are being used.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.560]   It is a difficult app and it is also as far as technologically as well as it has to be
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.560]   rock solid. It can't have any bugs. It can't be crashing randomly.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.560]   A lot of people on the higher end or consumers are actually willing to let their applications
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.560]   be a little less stable.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.560]   I don't know. I mean the people who have lost all their work because iMovie or iDVD took a hit.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.560]   That is just like, "Wow, I just spent nine hours doing this."
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.560]   What is with the perpetual beta thing?
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.560]   I heard that Chevrolet's new Corvette is coming out in beta.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:05.560]   At what point in time do we start holding these folks accountable for something that works?
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.560]   That will be $2,000 and oh yes, it is in beta.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560]   Let us know how it works.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.560]   Here is the thing. I would rather have a beta version of something that I know that I can
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.560]   write bugs on and that I can have a positive change toward the app becoming better than to have something
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:30.560]   that is sitting here that I have spent $930,000 on that I can't affect because oh, we are in the new build cycle.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:36.560]   This is a big problem. Typically what happens is if we wait until March for CS3,
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.560]   Adobe will already be six months into development on CS4.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.560]   When we are saying, "Oh, it would be really nice to get this stuff."
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.560]   Now, they may take everything we said into account, but they are not going to do anything about it
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.560]   for another year, year and a half. Whereas right now we have a window between December 15th and probably
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:58.560]   March 1st or March 15th or whatever where if a lot of people are saying this isn't working,
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.560]   we are going to see a change inside of three or four months.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.560]   I would much prefer, and I will be honest with you, I would much prefer Adobe to do this.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.560]   I would really prefer Apple to do this where we get,
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.560]   there are all kinds of niggling issues that you end up with that are just goofy things
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.560]   that show up in a lot of applications and some of the Apple applications that it would be really,
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.560]   really great if a lot of people gave them feedback at just the right time,
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.560]   we were able to affect change quickly. I just don't even with not one release,
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.560]   a lot of times I don't see that stuff getting fixed.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:35.560]   Let me jump in here with Aperture. Aperture is a perfect example where Apple did just that.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:41.560]   They didn't say they were doing it, Alex. It's pretty obvious that they treated Aperture 1.0 as a beta
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:46.560]   because we have had two updates to Aperture in the last 38 days alone.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:52.560]   Apple is being responsive and there is that argument, but I just want to remind folks,
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.560]   those of you who are younger may not remember these days, but in the old days the companies took it
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.560]   upon themselves to be responsible to hire beta testers. People got paid to do this.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.560]   Now somehow we live in a world where it's okay that we pay to be the beta testers.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.560]   I'm not quite sure that's as good as it is. Is this a pre-beta, John?
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.560]   No, it's a beta beta. I mean, it's a quote public beta.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.560]   Anybody can download it, right?
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.560]   Yeah, well you do have to have a working CS2 serial number.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:28.560]   Okay, great. I think what's interesting about this is that also when you call out a beta
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.560]   and you start to do this, you also end up with a situation where you're able to hook people on
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:37.560]   the new version. You know, if they start using it and test it and playing with it and liking it,
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.560]   then you say, "Okay, now it's going to expire if you don't pay whatever."
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.560]   I have one question for you that I'm going to challenge your entire thesis on.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.560]   Okay. You're going to fly home from New York, yes?
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:55.560]   I am. So would you like to fly home on the new beta version of the Boeing aircraft?
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:00.560]   Yeah, but I can't say my position every five minutes either.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.560]   You know, if I could say, we were flying in with a 100 -- I swear 100 is a visibility
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.560]   flying into Philadelphia yesterday. And then I really did want to be able to save my position
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.560]   just in case it crashed. I could go back and revert to 200 feet off the air again.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.560]   How about this? We'll give you the new beta version of the artificial heart.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.560]   Let us know how that works out for you.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.560]   Well, I just have things -- I have things thump out all the time.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.560]   I guess the thing is that I'm -- and I have to admit that part of my understanding of this,
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.560]   and I think for -- and you've been in the situation as well, and John, I know, has been in the situation
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.560]   as a developer. We develop software, you know, at BB Garage.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.560]   And the thing is that, you know, you just know that it's not all going to work all the time.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.560]   Right.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:48.560]   And no matter how hard you test it, I can either lengthen the development period by another six months or a year,
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.560]   or -- and even if I hired 15 people to do beta and to test every button,
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.560]   until someone does something really goofy with it, I'm not going to know that that hole was there.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   You know, until -- for instance, if Adobe really just did beta on the meat of their users,
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.560]   they would only find -- they would only get print users. And video guys and everything else,
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.560]   we kind of left out in the cold because we represent about 5 or 10 percent of their market.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.560]   You know, so the thing is that it is a -- you know, tell someone that something goofy with it,
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:21.560]   you just don't know, and a lot of these bugs can be very obscure. It can be the collection of this, this, this,
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.560]   and this, and it's really hard to come up with all of that. And to me, I just see this as an extension
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:33.560]   of crowd sourcing and a need to release things to a wider market faster because one of the other things is
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:39.560]   you can't wait anymore for -- no one wants to wait an extra year for it to be tested by a handful of people.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.560]   They'd rather have three months of being tested by 100,000 people. You know, that's the --
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:49.560]   I'd rather have something that is moving forward than to have something that I know will ever be fixed.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.560]   Right.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.560]   Yeah, so --
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.560]   Okay.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.560]   I think, I think, you know, it makes real good sense from Adobe's point of view, don't get me wrong.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.560]   I think, you know, if a business person, I sure get that. I completely understand that.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.560]   But, well, let's see. Is there anything else going on other than the potential beta release of CS3?
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.560]   Well, the other thing -- just one thing that's on the forum right now, people listening,
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.560]   is that we're becoming a content creation monopoly with Photoshop, and I can't see the rest of this.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.560]   Let me roll over here. I can't quite see the rest of that chat message.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:27.560]   You know, I think that this has always been one of the issues with Photoshop is that it has almost no competition.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.560]   So Adobe kind of, you know, plods along with it. You know, there's a lot of things --
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.560]   a lot of us that would love to see extra features and things added.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.560]   And they -- I think they move slowly, A, because they have a lot of people.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.560]   This is the same problem that I think Microsoft has with VISTA.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.560]   You have a lot of people who are embedded in it being a certain way,
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.560]   and if you start changing it too dramatically, they'll be upset.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:52.560]   But it also is just that there's no one really clipping at the heels of Photoshop or anywhere really close.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.560]   And people can talk about it in this great marketing to say that there's a Photoshop killer,
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.560]   but no one's even in the ballpark at the moment.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:04.560]   And so there's a monopoly in that sort of way. I think that the most exciting thing,
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:10.560]   if we had real competition, would be to see price changes and drops and everything else.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.560]   I find that Photoshop Elements is a little too crippled, you know, for me to want to use.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.560]   And I know it's not designed for me, but I think that there's lots of simple things the average user could do.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.560]   Or even just releasing that in John's process before releasing Photoshop 6.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.560]   You know, it's something that's a -- or something older.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.560]   - Right.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.560]   - Now, you know, years ago, I was at a meeting where some Adobe people,
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:38.560]   these are all Adobe people who, by the way, don't exist anymore because they get fired when the macro media thing happened.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.560]   But they were all talking about this rollout of what they were calling component Photoshop.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.560]   And we started to see a little bit of that in Lightroom because Photoshop's gotten so big.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.560]   I mean, Alex, you live in a Photoshop world that most photographers don't even need to know exist.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.560]   And likewise, designers live in a Photoshop world that most video people don't know exist.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:03.560]   So it's just what they were talking about was releasing components of it, almost like breaking up the monopoly, if you will.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.560]   And if you look at that point, then there is some competition.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.560]   Obviously, Aputure has something to say about how the photography side of this thing all shakes out.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.560]   And I don't think that, you know, Aputure was ever designed to be a Photoshop killer,
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.560]   even though we've all used that phrase at one point in time looking at the press releases early on a year ago.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:31.560]   But I do think Aputure provides an interesting alternative to the photographers who use Photoshop if they don't need to do masking in layers.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.560]   Everything else you can do in Aputure.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.560]   - Yeah, and that's the -- for me, I don't even need -- I don't need anything added to Photoshop.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:51.560]   I mean, there are a handful of things that I'm really glad that CS2 has, but I have to admit that I'm 99 percent -- no, 95 percent of the stuff I used is still stuff that was in Photoshop, you know, five or so.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:58.560]   I mean, it hasn't -- my patterns haven't changed dramatically since then.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:04.560]   And I always think that if we just give people those basic stuff and let them get good at it, then they might be more interested in some of those.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.560]   - It's all good compared to version 09, remember the prompt?
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.560]   - Right.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.560]   [Laughs]
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.560]   - There's that.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:25.560]   So now moving on, now, according to Forester, there's been this article that came out by Forester Research that says that the iTunes sales are in a free fall.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.560]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:34.560]   - Well, how would they know that without having specific statistics from the iTunes store?
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.560]   - Well, that's what Apple's saying.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.560]   It caused enough of a firestorm for Apple to actually say something in public, which is --
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.560]   - And they almost never, ever times a billion ever do that.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.560]   - Right.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:55.560]   And it just seemed to be -- now, what do you guys think of the claim that Forester made in the Apple's reaction?
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.560]   John, you go first.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:02.560]   - Well, there's a whole bunch of iPods that are in gift wrap right now that aren't being booked up to anything.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.560]   So there's no iTunes to put on them.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.560]   So we'll see you a surge after December the 25th.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.560]   - No, because everyone's waiting for their new --
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.560]   - Well, no, they're not waiting.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.560]   It's just that they're in gift wrap.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.560]   They're in free.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.560]   And so with everyone waiting, there's gift cards that are being bought.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.560]   There's iPods that are being bought.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.560]   And money is being -- money right now is traditionally being diverted toward other things.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:35.560]   And I think that if we were to go and look at the numbers, we would see that, you know, people are out shopping.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:43.560]   People are out buying and spending their money not on tunes, but on iPods themselves.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.560]   - Well, we know Forester just, you know, they're so well known for getting it right.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.560]   Let's roll back to 1993 when they said, "Oh, the Internet, it'll never go anywhere."
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.560]   But it's a complete fact.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.560]   It's going to last a week.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.560]   We're gone.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.560]   And then a couple of years ago, podcasting's peaked already.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:02.560]   And, you know, I think their motto is, "We're not happy till you're not happy here at Forester."
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.560]   - Well, I --
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.560]   - How would -- like John, how would they know?
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.560]   Bottom line is this.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   I think a lot of this comes from the news stories, Alex.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.560]   I have been going nuts the last two weeks.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.560]   The echo chamber out in the Internet sometimes drives me nuts.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.560]   You see a press release.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.560]   You look at the press release and it reports to, you know, say some kind of statistic from
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.560]   a report.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.560]   I'm the kind of guy that actually reads the report.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   When I look at the report and I see 20 news stories, 10 of which will have a headline that
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.560]   says, "I tune sales booming," 10 of which will say, "I tune in the toilet," all looking at the
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.560]   same report.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.560]   And it really just boils down to the numbers.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.560]   Here's the number that no one's talking about because I read the report.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.560]   They're saying that there's an average sale of 22 songs per iPod.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.560]   I don't know how they get that number, but let's say it's true.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:55.560]   Well, in a situation where you have a $22 add-on sale to an electronic component that represents
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:01.560]   roughly 10% of its price, I can tell you right now, the entire marketplace would jump off
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.560]   and not agri-fall to get that number.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.560]   - Yeah.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.560]   (laughter)
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.560]   - Yeah, and I think that with any of this -- with whether we're looking at research -- and we've
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.560]   said this before, I think we've talked about this on Twim a little bit -- but with any kind of
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.560]   research, you know, any of these researchers -- these researchers aren't interested in
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.560]   -- I mean, they're their job is to analyze the business and everything else, but they
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.560]   oftentimes know just the hair of what they're actually doing here.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.560]   I mean, they're mostly talking to spin doctors, and that's their job.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:32.560]   And the thing is, is that when you talk to -- when you see press, for instance, when you
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.560]   see an article about things that you don't know anything about, you know it's the truth.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.560]   When you see an article about things you know nothing about.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:43.560]   If I see an article about, you know, "Cause" then, you know, "It might as well be true because
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.560]   I don't know anything about "Cause" experience."
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.560]   You know, but, you know, I mean, you know, I -- I'm more at -- more at the version maybe just as
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.560]   true as any other one.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.560]   It doesn't -- I don't know what -- what that looks like, and so I think, "Oh, that's a great
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.560]   article on whatever that is."
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.560]   Whereas, as soon as they talk about anything that I know about -- and it doesn't matter whether
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:03.560]   I'm a lawyer or a farmer or a computer graphics artist, I get very clear that they have no
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.560]   idea what they're talking about.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.560]   They have no idea what, you know, what really is going on there, but that's the whole mystery
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.560]   of news that keeps people excited, is they think that they're talking about a lot of things
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.560]   that the average person doesn't know about, and so we think it's the truth, you know,
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.560]   it's all -- you know, it's all spin.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.560]   And so the --
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.560]   You know, here's -- here's -- I got to look at their research methodology.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.560]   Here's what they do.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.560]   They found a guy named Dave.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:31.560]   His sister, new guy whose cousin, had walked by a store where they sell iPods, and that's
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.560]   where they got their number.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.560]   But he walked by and didn't buy one.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.560]   No.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.560]   [ Laughter ]
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.560]   So the -- you know, one of the things that I do think is interesting about the whole iTunes
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.560]   thing, and whether the Zoom will make any difference, you know, because I know we're talking -- I know
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.560]   how much Scott -- I know how much he loves the Zoom, but we're going to step back a second,
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.560]   and we're going to try to look at it objectively.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.560]   But the --
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.560]   I'm objectively stuck.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.560]   [ Laughter ]
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.560]   I'm actually -- I was actually thinking of testing the Zoom.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.560]   I'm thinking of actually going out and getting the Zoom and testing it.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.560]   You know, Leo's had one, but I haven't -- and I'll tell you the thing that I'm most interested
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.560]   in is the subscription service.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.560]   I may not be a Zoom, maybe something else, but I'm actually really realizing that
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:16.560]   a subscription service may be something that may, in the long-term, possibly catch on.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.560]   I'd really like to see a hybrid between them, you know, between what Apple does, where I can buy the songs
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560]   and a subscription.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.560]   There's a lot of times where I just want to download a whole bunch of stuff that I just want to
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.560]   listen to for a trip, but I don't want to pay $800 for whatever I was going to download.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.560]   I'd rather just take a few bucks a month and just be able to do that for trips and not have to buy
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:38.560]   every song that I have a whim to listen to, you know, and that's the -- that's the thing I'm most
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.560]   interested in with any of the other players that's going on here.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.560]   So anyway, we'll see.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.560]   Have you seen -- have you guys seen the new Parallels release?
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.560]   It's really cool.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.560]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.560]   Scott, I'm --
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.560]   Scott, we'll never see the new Parallels release, Scott.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.560]   This one's from here, Scott.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.560]   It's for you, Scott.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.560]   I don't -- listen, listen.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:03.560]   There are a list of 1.29 million things that will happen before I ever put Windows in my Mac.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.560]   [ Laughter ]
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.560]   It's a John -- it's going to happen, guys.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.560]   Forget about it.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.560]   John, what's new when the new Parallels release?
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:15.560]   Well, the big thing in the new Parallels release is a thing called Coher -- Coher -- Coher --
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.560]   Coher -- Coher --
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.560]   I don't know.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.560]   Start with the --
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.560]   Coher --
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.560]   Coher --
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.560]   Coher --
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.560]   Coher --
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.560]   Like I said, it starts with the C and an O.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:34.560]   But what it does is it lets you call out a window so that the window that would normally be stuck
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:41.560]   in a box in a window can now live side by side with whatever other Mac apps that you have.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.560]   So --
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.560]   Yeah, and so now you either use Bootcamp for on this to make this work, right?
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:50.560]   No, you don't have to use Bootcamp, but it will use the Bootcamp partition, which is really cool,
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:58.560]   because that means that if I want specific speed with a video drive, for example, if I wanted games
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:04.560]   or if I wanted my environment to be all windows all the time, I would boot into Bootcamp.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:10.560]   But if I just need that one app that I'm using once in a while, this is a great way to have that work.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.560]   Well, I think that's been the big thing.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.560]   I mean, what I couldn't believe is that when I saw the videos of the coherants of what --
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.560]   just being able to -- you're opening applications, and it's almost as if the application is just running
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.560]   as a Mac application with slightly different interface.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.560]   It's really amazing.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:31.560]   Yeah, and I have to admit, the parallel thing -- I have bootcamp because I've been using mostly
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:36.560]   soft-ammonages, X-Sci, and a handful of other high-end 3D apps like Endorphin,
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.560]   and they need their own environment.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.560]   But I don't know if I should talk about where I was, but I had a broadcast facility yesterday,
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:51.560]   and the art director had just bought a new Mac Pro and had OS X had two monitors,
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.560]   and had OS X on one monitor, and had parallels running fullscreen on the second monitor,
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.560]   and it was amazing.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.560]   I mean, you were sitting there being able -- and you get -- almost.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:05.560]   I mean, the next piece would be able to drag between the two, and you'd have both of this kind of solved.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:11.560]   And I think that this is important for Apple only because I think that what this really provides this
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:18.560]   is the -- I think that what this provides is with is for all of us that have that one or two apps
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.560]   other than Scott, that have the one or two apps that we need to use on a PC.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:29.560]   My -- for instance, our CFO needs to use QuickBooks on the PC because QuickBooks on the Mac sucks.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:34.560]   So QuickBooks on the PC, she needs -- she has to run a separate PC right now,
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:39.560]   and we're about to get her a MacBook Pro or a MacBook or whatever that Mac thing is.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.560]   That's a little thing to do around.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:47.560]   And just so that she can run those financial apps that she's embedded in,
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.560]   and then just have the rest of her life on Mac.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:54.560]   And I think that's -- I think that's far between this huge upsurge in percentages of Apple sales.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.560]   You know, we're now seeing them jump to 5.9.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:04.560]   It could be as high as 6.5 or 7 by the end of next year by -- you know, Apple could be 10% by 2010 at least.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.560]   Well, here's a good example of how you would use that.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:14.560]   One thing you can do is you can share a folder so that it has a common folder between your parallels
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.560]   and your Mac. And so you store your data in that folder.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:25.560]   Then if your computer gets virode, then all you have to do is blow away the partition that did that,
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.560]   the virtual space, and then load the one from your backup and you're good to go.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.560]   I think you got some on your shirt there, John.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.560]   He's a gun.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:38.560]   Look, this is the -- as far as I'm concerned, this is the new classic.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:45.560]   This is really -- this is bigger than probably the classic or any of this stuff.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:51.560]   I mean, really what this does is it levels the playing field so that there's no reason that you can give an excuse
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.560]   to say, "Well, I can't run a Mac because."
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.560]   Well, I think it's actually further than that.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:02.560]   I think it's -- you really have to come up with a strong reason to buy a PC at this point, like a pure PC.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.560]   Simply because, you know, when you're buying a Mac now, you're buying two computers.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:10.560]   If you're able to run all your PC stuff and you're able to run all your Macs of all at the same time.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.560]   And that's the thing that I'm -- you know, I'm pretty excited about.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.560]   Now, there's a question on the forums as to whether there's a free update.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.560]   John, do you know the answer to that?
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:25.560]   I think it's going to be a free update, but I -- you know, that's the crystal ball in me that's saying that.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.560]   Right.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.560]   Right.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.560]   But it's -- here's the thing.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.560]   Even if it was $30, it would be totally worth it.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.560]   If for no other reason than the installation.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.560]   Right.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.560]   When you -- the way that they'd make the installation work now, it's pretty cool.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:50.560]   You -- instead of having to go through the entire Windows decompression where it takes, I don't know, between 30 and 40 minutes,
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:57.560]   and as long as an hour to do, it's -- the parallel thing knows what needs to go where,
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:02.560]   and it copies it right to it, and you don't see any of the normal Windows installation.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:03.560]   Right.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.560]   Very fast.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.560]   No, it's -- I think it's pretty revolutionary.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:12.560]   I'm proud of the surprise that Apple -- and then here's -- we have one comment.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.560]   Hopefully, one day, OSX will work on PCs through parallels.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.560]   No.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.560]   That won't happen.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.560]   [ Laughter ]
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:25.560]   I don't think Apple -- you know, it just comes down to a whole issue, but I don't think Apple's ever going to make it really --
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:30.560]   Well, there's a bunch of economic reasons that that won't happen, but, you know, look at it this way.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:44.560]   If the adoption rate of Windows Vista doesn't happen quickly, then there's a reason to have Mac OS on those machines instead.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.560]   Right.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.560]   So now, what else happened this week?
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.560]   I have seen that I was traveling all this week, so I've been catching up here.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:29:00.560]   Was there any other big news this week that we -- people weren't as active on the Mac break idea as tag this week and delicious?
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.560]   Well, I'm trying to avoid the obvious thing to talk about, so I'll move on to the next question.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.560]   The Apple aperture update was news.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.560]   That was kind of a big deal.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:18.560]   It was just a bug fix, but it did fix a lot of, you know, nuisance bugs that were uncovered.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:25.560]   One point five was the really big, you know, recent update, and then, of course, that led to 1.51 and 1.52.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:31.560]   And there's some bug fixes, and they rethought a couple of things after they got some complaints from the user base.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:37.560]   One of the big deals for a lot of people was the way the watermarks were applied to JPEGs and stuff.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:43.560]   Originally, you would create a watermark, and then it would be whatever size you made it and put it on your picture.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:49.560]   It would be 1.5 updates, so that that watermark scaled so you couldn't control the size of the watermark.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.560]   They went back on that and fixed it.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.560]   Just some, you know, little buggy, UI things that needed to be.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:02.560]   It wasn't anything major, but every time they do this, it shows that they are extraordinarily committed to making this thing work,
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:08.560]   which is really quite interesting to note, given the fact that according to the rumor site, aperture is dead.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.560]   Right.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:15.560]   The team has been fired, Joe Short doesn't have a job, people are killing their cats and dogs, I mean, whatever.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:21.560]   Anyway, I think that's news because I'll tell you what, the aperture community is really picking up on the web.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.560]   There's a lot more traffic about it.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:31.560]   I created the first aperture blog a year ago this Saturday, and when I did that, I was lonely.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.560]   Right, right.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.560]   We're a lot of aperture users, but now, I mean, it's a big deal.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.560]   I use it every day.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.560]   I don't actually have a single photo and I photo at this point.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.560]   I don't really go back to that anymore.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:50.560]   I'm just so used to what I get in an aperture that it's not really a consideration for me anymore.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.560]   Now, for an average user to taking photos, I don't know if that makes sense.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:31:00.560]   And I would consider myself using aperture almost like, I'm not a professional photographer.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:06.560]   And I think that I probably am using it like iPhoto Plus.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:10.560]   I use it every day too, Alex.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:16.560]   I mean, people, I've gotten a couple emails since I started talking about aperture on the various podcasts.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.560]   I'm like, "Oh, you're just an aperture fanboy.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.560]   Are you working for Apple?"
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.560]   "Yeah, the Audi Auto."
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.560]   Well, the answer is no, I'm not working for Apple.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.560]   I just want to remind people, I have a best-selling Photoshop book out there.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.560]   So, I'm making a statement against my own interests when I mention the fact that I like aperture.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:36.560]   Well, and just like you said earlier, I don't think that aperture, and I think they both kind of live in their own world.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:37.560]   I don't ever consider.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.560]   I'm going to do something in aperture that I wouldn't do in Photoshop.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.560]   I mean, that I would do in Photoshop.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.560]   I kind of go back and forth pretty seamlessly.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.560]   Most of what I'm doing in Photoshop is editing anyway.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:52.560]   I know for people who are only doing color correction, aperture may be more what they need in those areas,
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.560]   or as much of what they need.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:01.560]   I just find that I don't need Photoshop anymore because unless I have to do masking, which I rarely do,
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.560]   because I try to get the picture right in the camera in the first place,
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.560]   then most of what I was using Photoshop for was pretty basic stuff.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.560]   Cropping, rotating, minor color correction, perhaps changing something to black and white,
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.560]   doing a little sharpening, resizing, et cetera.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.560]   I do all that in aperture now, and I do it in about a tenth of time.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.560]   It used to take me in Photoshop.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:26.560]   For me, I'm always excited about Photoshop every year that it comes out.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.560]   This year I realized not so much.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:38.560]   When you look at the professional photographers, these are guys that have spent a lifetime learning their craft.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.560]   So to throw Photoshop into their lap and say, "Here, learn this."
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.560]   It's a daunting tool.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:50.560]   To find the 12 things that a photographer is going to need to do and wrap that up into a professional package,
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.560]   that just shows a lot of foresight to make that one.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:58.560]   John, that was brilliantly said because that's exactly what apertures intended to do.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.560]   Apertures, I know a lot of digital photographers, and there's two camps.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:08.560]   There's the Photoshop people, and these are the people for whom photography is more about Photoshop than the camera.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:13.560]   Then there's the aperture people, and those tend to be people who come from,
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.560]   "Hey, I get it right in the camera, and I just need something to manage all this stuff."
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.560]   Aperture does that.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:26.560]   I think it's also interesting to note that I view multimedia, which used to dominate the space in terms of being the choice for people
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:33.560]   who wanted to collect their media and organize it, is going to become part of the new Microsoft photo design suite,
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.560]   which is kind of like weird.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:40.560]   A couple questions from the forums.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.560]   One is, does anyone think that parallels would get picked up by Apple?
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.560]   I don't know how popular it's getting.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.560]   I would hand it, I would say no, right off the top.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:56.560]   There's so many different competing virtual donations.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.560]   There's the open source wine project.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:07.560]   There's the stuff that's happening with the other one.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:13.560]   There's four different projects that are out that are either in beta or they're selling.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.560]   I don't see it happening.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:24.560]   I don't think Apple is ever going to give a non to Windows.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:30.560]   They're going to make it available, and there's no reason for them to do that.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.560]   Here's the exact biggest reason.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:40.560]   That is, if they have a virtualization machine, then they're responsible for all the little nitpick bugs that happen.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:45.560]   If somebody's Windows thing doesn't work, then it's to the Apple support guy to support them.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.560]   By saying it's the third party, even if Apple threw them a million bucks to say,
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.560]   "Here, we want to keep you guys going."
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.560]   They're better off doing that because then they don't have the support nightmare.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:00.560]   Then the "genius" can be off the hook for fixing that computer.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:05.560]   One of the questions from the talk to forums was, "Wasn't bootcamp a nod to Windows."
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:10.560]   I don't think it will. One of the examples I carefully said is they're not supporting it.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.560]   They do the campus of beta again.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.560]   It also runs more than just Windows.
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:20.560]   It actually only runs in one of the incantations that only runs Windows,
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:23.560]   but there's other stuff that it can run in bootcamp.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:31.560]   There's a lot of pressure building up on the talk to forums for Scott to give us an update on the iPhone.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.560]   I would be happy to do that.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:41.560]   We were looking at it and we decided that we weren't going to talk about it,
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.560]   but there's been so much pressure here.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:46.560]   We have a "Go Scott Go" right now on the forum.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.560]   I just wanted to do this week.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:54.560]   I just want to make it perfectly clear that this was not in any way, shape, or form my idea.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.560]   It wasn't.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.560]   I was just happy to cruise along and not mention the elephant in the room,
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.560]   but it's not.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.560]   Everybody clearly knows what's really important in the Mac universe.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.560]   I'll discuss it.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.560]   Here's what we know.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.560]   Now we have not little stingy, weird rumor sites talking about it,
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.560]   but we've got Morgan Stanley.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.560]   We've got business week.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.560]   We've got big players talking about what's going on.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.560]   It appears that this is the fourth or fifth time we heard rumors this week
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.560]   that Apple has brought capacity from singular,
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.560]   and now we're hearing that they may be even selling airtime packages in Apple stores.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.560]   Clearly, we're going to have an iPhone.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.560]   Nobody disputes that anymore.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.560]   Anybody that does well, they're just wasting their time.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.560]   It's a question to win.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:40.560]   Now, one of the unpleasant rumors that was out on the rumor sites that I hope is wrong
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:47.560]   is that Steve Jobs threw a, well, Steve Jobs in a meeting with the iPhone developers saying
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:52.560]   that it was the most, I think they said, you know, screwed up development project
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.560]   they've ever had, fired a bunch of people who know that this is true,
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.560]   but it could delay the actual release of the phone,
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:02.560]   but we're seeing some big time Wall Street analysts talk about second quarter,
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.560]   and, you know, I never really thought we'd see it at Macworld.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.560]   I'm still holding out for hope, though, that we see a picture of it,
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.560]   like they did with ITV.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.560]   -You used to playing to buy those for all of us, Scott.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.560]   -Who is this?
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.560]   -This is your friend Merlin.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.560]   -Hey, buddy!
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.560]   -My plan is this.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.560]   If they have them available at Macworld, I will put one in your pocket.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.560]   -Really?
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.560]   -I will put one in your pocket.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.560]   -When you're not looking at their backpack.
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.560]   -Which is why the price went up?
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.560]   -Yeah, I did notice it.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:40.560]   I got some hate mail from people saying, "Oh, yeah, you had to talk about being willing to pay
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.560]   800 bucks now.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.560]   We're looking at 699 for the top end.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.560]   What's going on?"
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.560]   -You probably heard that you've been throwing around this,
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.560]   this thing about buying everybody an iPhone.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.560]   That's probably just, that's saying it's something price-free.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:54.560]   -Yeah, actually nothing would make me happier than as we sit in the Apple Store,
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.560]   Merlin, on the 9th at 6 p.m. to do Mac Break Live for Macworld.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:04.560]   Nothing would make me happier than to have a slew of veritable cornucopia of cell phones
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:09.560]   in front of me to just start handing out to all of us on the panel and say, "Guys, call me."
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.560]   -What a great day that will be.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:15.560]   -We won't have to talk about it anymore and we'll have an iPhone and it'll be the best of all worlds.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.560]   -I'm just hoping on my phone, Merlin, I didn't bring this up.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.560]   -So, I'm in Toronto doing call for help with Leo and I thought,
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.560]   "Just stick my head in."
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:29.560]   I very innocently just asked if it had been mentioned and then it turns out that that's all it took.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:33.560]   I blame myself.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:39.560]   -Don't you agree though that the level of quality in the iPhone rumors had gone up?
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.560]   -Oh, Steve, is that the quality of rumors at this point is extraordinary.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.560]   We have nothing quality in a room for like this in, gosh, weeks.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:53.560]   -Yeah, not since the asteroid leak.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.560]   -My predictions are this.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:01.560]   We will absolutely, positively 1 billion percent sure, see an iPhone in 2007.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.560]   We just don't know when.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:06.560]   But if it's at Macworld, I stand by my prediction and my promise.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:12.560]   Everybody on the Mac break weekly panel will own one courtesy of me.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.560]   -We should have a sweepstakes where you can get one to the kids too.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:21.560]   In case Apple is listening, if you all can't get this ready for Macworld,
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.560]   I wouldn't mind if you brought me the prototype to display to everybody.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.560]   -Actually, you can win one.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:33.560]   You can win the caption contest on fakesteve.blogspot.com.
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:39.560]   -And you'll get a prototype iPhone.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.560]   -Yeah, wow.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.560]   -I need a working one.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.560]   -Yeah, I need a re-inform.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.560]   -It is the funniest thing I've ever read.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:54.560]   It's called fakesteve, F-A-C-A-K-E-Steve.blogspot.com.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.560]   And it's basically as if Steve Jobs was writing his day to day.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:04.560]   -No, no, I think the big question on the forum here is, will it come in brown?
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.560]   [laughter]
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.560]   -It's going to come in clear.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.560]   -Will it have to work?
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.560]   -It's made out of really fake sun in--
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.560]   -It's going to be a cubic zirconia.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.560]   -I just want to mention--
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.560]   -I just want to mention--
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.560]   -I just want to mention--
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.560]   -I just want to mention--
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.560]   -I just want to mention that they got the color wrong.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:20.560]   It's not brown.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   It's turkey vomit brown.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.560]   Let's get it correct.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.560]   -Crickets vomit brown.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.560]   -Oh, Scott, always making friends everywhere you go.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.560]   -I've never--
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.560]   -You know, by the way, my other phone's ringing,
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.560]   and I guess that means we just lost the Microsoft sponsorship.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.560]   [laughter]
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.560]   -So, any other big news for this week?
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.560]   Does anyone in the room have any news that we didn't cover?
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.560]   -Merman, did you have any news that you saw go by?
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.560]   -Oh, my gosh.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.560]   I'm trying to think what has been big this week.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.560]   I've been kind of all over the map this week.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.560]   I don't have any big news.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:56.560]   You know, I basically read during fireball and the mac-lope,
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.560]   and that's where I learn everything I know that I talk about
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.560]   on here pretty much.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.560]   -What would you expect from the loot in with CIVI's photo of you
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.560]   looking at Amber's leg?
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.560]   -Oh, that was a staged photo that Leo insisted on.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:16.560]   - Amber just got Amber just got her photo on the wall at City TV,
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.560]   and so Leo wanted to immortalize that.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.560]   -Now, have you ever heard of this?
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.560]   -There are weeks of Marilyn, or are you just there for today?
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.560]   -Vinures is Tuesday, and then this is the end of it today.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.560]   But we shot some good segments.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.560]   We did actually, I would like you to talk about some of your smart
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:34.560]   playlist stuff, and I don't know if we've got any closer to your
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.560]   mecca of smart playlist.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.560]   -And I want to say, once again, I need to sit down,
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.560]   and actually, here's the problem.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.560]   Here's the problem is I need to build a smart playlist,
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.560]   but I don't have enough songs on my laptop to actually do it.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.560]   I need to go sit down and buy a bunch of songs.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.560]   I don't actually carry songs on my laptop because I don't have enough.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.560]   -You should have somebody squirt you a few.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.560]   -No.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.560]   -Oh.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.560]   -I also like to squirt you some songs.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.560]   -Yeah, can you squirt me some scones?
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.560]   -That sounds sick.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   -Hey, I just bought Suzy cream cheese on iTunes.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.560]   -Really?
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.560]   -Yep, Frank Zappa.
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.560]   -Okay, did you guys already cover the iTunes sales stuff?
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.560]   -Yeah.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:12.560]   -Yeah, we did.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.560]   -What was your verdict in that?
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.560]   -We all think it's crap.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.560]   -Yeah.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.560]   -It sounds like a little bit like the guy.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.560]   -It sounds like a person who made a very low sample and made a very
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.560]   large decision from a very low sample and was probably very
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.560]   incorrect.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.560]   -We decided the same person, Merlin, that predicted the
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.560]   internet was not going to take off.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:30.560]   -I don't think that's the one, anyone.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.560]   -I don't think it's hard to use.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.560]   -You know, it's hard to use.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:34.560]   It's hard to use.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.560]   You've got to be at your modem.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.560]   I really don't think it's going to go anywhere.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:45.560]   -So do we have any, okay, who had some picks for this week?
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   Favorite applications, hardware or software for the Mac, Scott?
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.560]   Do you have one for us?
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.560]   -Well, you know, I don't necessarily have one that's a
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.560]   favorite for the Mac, but I have to say that, you know, back in
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:03.560]   the day when we used to use Skype to do this show, and when I
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.560]   completely reconfigured my studio so that we could use Skype to
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.560]   do this show, I invested in a road podcaster microphone, which
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.560]   of course is now that much.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.560]   I'm going to mention that, but I just want to point out the
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.560]   fact that I'm not the least bit bitter that we're doing this
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.560]   show over talk shoe, which does not involve Skype, which means I
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.560]   invested all this money for nothing, but that's a nice
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.560]   -Mike, you talked me into one of those too.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.560]   It's a swell mic.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.560]   -It is a very nice microphone.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.560]   It emulates Alex, you'll appreciate this.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:34.560]   The old EVRE20 that sits in almost every radio station in America.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.560]   And it's heavy.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.560]   It weighs like, I don't know, weighs like three, four pounds.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.560]   It's heavy.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:40.560]   It's got a really good sound.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.560]   It's like all USB mics.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.560]   You know, it could use a little more gain.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.560]   You do need to work it close, but it definitely sounds better than
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.560]   the Snowball, has much better off-access noise rejection than the
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   Snowball, but it also costs more than the Snowball, and it's not
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.560]   so much better than the Snowball that, you know, you couldn't get
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.560]   by it yet, Snowball, but the bigger news is there's really
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:02.560]   fancy, like even Neumann is going to be making a USB mic pretty
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.560]   soon, but for right now, my pick would be if you're a serious
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.560]   podcaster, you don't want to learn how to deal with mixers.
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.560]   You don't want to buy a digital interface, but you do want to
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.560]   get a really good quality voice thing happening with GarageBand
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.560]   or something, spend 200 bucks on a road podcaster.
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.560]   So that's my pick.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.560]   -Great, and John?
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:24.560]   -SketchFighter 4000 from Amber House software.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:28.560]   I mentioned this last week as kind of a, "Hey, we just got
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.560]   released, and then I got addicted to it."
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.560]   -Oh, really?
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.560]   -Yeah, it's really fun.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.560]   -So, and what, now, can you give us a little bit of a, a little
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.560]   bit of overview again on what it actually is?
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:44.560]   -Okay, so what happens is that, basically, you are in
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.560]   study hall, you're bored, you've got line paper, and you're
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:53.560]   sitting there doodling, and it says, "If the person who made
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.560]   the doodles, their doodles come to life."
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.560]   -Right.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:02.560]   -And so, so it's basically a cross between asteroids and
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:08.560]   start these and a bunch of other games where you basically,
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.560]   you've got to go collect stuff, and you've got to fight your
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:15.560]   way through to get a mission solved.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.560]   It's pretty fun.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:21.560]   And the thing that I like about it is that it's a lot like,
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:25.560]   the controls are something that I already know from the
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.560]   old games.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.560]   So, instead of having to do combo, combo, combo, combo,
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.560]   and learning all these chords and mashing my fingers up on a
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:39.560]   console game, which, no, it can be worth it, this is a, this is
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:44.560]   a game that has a low time commitment, and it's really
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.560]   easy to, really easy and fun to get into.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:50.560]   -Now, we have a question for you, Merlin, on the forum.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.560]   Are you still using pizzas?
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.560]   Or is that just something you use as a selection?
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.560]   -I think this is destined to become my iPhone.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.560]   I still use pizzas.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.560]   I use it on the flight here.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:07.560]   The part that people don't get is the haters is that it's easy
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.560]   to very quickly get into a nap.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.560]   Everybody knows how to fall asleep.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.560]   I'm getting defensive about this.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.560]   But the beautiful part about this is that you can do it very
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.560]   quickly.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.560]   -Yeah.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.560]   -I feel like, have you been to this thing, Alex?
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.560]   -I haven't, I haven't, and, you know,
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.560]   the thing is, I was thinking about it yesterday afternoon,
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.560]   and I just couldn't remember the website for it because I was,
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:31.560]   I got in from, I had flown in the morning from Pittsburgh
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.560]   to Philadelphia and then had meetings there and then took a
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.560]   train from Philadelphia to New York to have meetings here
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.560]   yesterday.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.560]   And I got here and I had about a half an hour before the meeting,
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.560]   and I really was like, man, I really, what I really needed to
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.560]   possess.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:45.560]   -Yeah.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:46.560]   -And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.560]   -I got a free demo.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.560]   You can just grab it and give it a shot.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.560]   -I should have downloaded it.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.560]   -Yeah.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.560]   -I should have downloaded it.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:54.560]   -Meroen, you said anybody can fall asleep,
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.560]   so you don't use, to fall asleep, is that correct?
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.560]   -You know what, I'm not going to, I'm not going to fall into
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.560]   this trap.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.560]   I'm not, I can, I can see that there, there, it looks like
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:06.560]   it's just branches in my path, but I know as soon as I step on it,
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.560]   I'm going to go into a big hole.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.560]   -I'm wondering if the, if the easy part is falling asleep,
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.560]   that would mean that the hard part is waking up and I can
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.560]   certainly see where like a friggin' alarm wouldn't do the trip
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.560]   for it, right?
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.560]   Sorry, bad Canadian connection.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.560]   I'm having trouble getting you.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.560]   Alex, do you have my pick of the week?
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.560]   What's your pick of the week?
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:26.560]   I have a pick of the week.
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.560]   I think I've mentioned this before, actually.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:32.560]   This is getting so fractal and so preferential, but, um,
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.560]   I'm actually going to talk about this in a little bit on, on, on
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.560]   the latest show, but I love this application called Tubesock.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.560]   And if you're, if you're like me and you're squandering away
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:43.560]   huge amounts of your time playing with YouTube,
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:47.560]   Tubesock is an application that you basically point at any
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:51.560]   URL on YouTube and it sucks that movie down, takes it from an
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:55.560]   FLVD, turns it into an iPod video and squirts it onto your iTunes
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:58.560]   for it so that it's readily available for your iPod.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.560]   Now this is like the best thing in the world and we talked about it
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.560]   before, but I think it's the same, pretty much the same thing.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.560]   -I think, yeah.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:08.560]   I've had better luck with Tubesock, but, yeah, but it gets the same
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:11.560]   idea, but here's where this gets better, is that the only failing
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.560]   of the, of the app is that you could only put in one URL at a time,
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.560]   and it would kind of be a pain in the butt.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.560]   And now there's a program out there that is called Tubesock
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:23.560]   Loader, that says nothing except let you drop in a
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:26.560]   bajillion URL, so you find all those Steely Dan videos you've
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:30.560]   been looking for for years and, and drop them into Tubesock
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:35.560]   Loader and it will squirt all of those into Tubesock for you and
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:39.560]   then squirt all of it into iTunes for you, consequently, it's
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.560]   great and it's very fun.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.560]   I just use it for a whole bunch of videos and it works great.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:45.560]   It's a crazy URL.
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.560]   It's shurntsign.at, but you could probably just go to
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.560]   MacUpdate and search for Tubesock Loader.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.560]   -Now, my, our schedule for this show, just in case we run out of time,
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.560]   here the schedule for the show is supposed to end in 20 seconds.
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:01.560]   So, then, I want to thank everyone Merlin and, and John and Scott
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:02.560]   for signing in.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:05.560]   If it doesn't end, I'll go ahead with started, but if I get cut off,
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.560]   that's, I just wanted to, you know, we, this is our first test of
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:09.560]   talk.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.560]   We're hoping to do this once a month, let us know online,
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.560]   whether this is something you'd like to see regularly.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.560]   I'm thinking of doing this once a month where we can have people
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.560]   call in and then we have a lot to go.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:22.560]   It's been really great to see people popping stuff up here on
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.560]   forum while we're talking and hopefully we can get some people,
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.560]   get more people online.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:31.560]   I think this is a great little test for MacBray.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:34.560]   The, my, I think mine, and I don't think I've talked about this
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.560]   too much before, and this is not a MacRPC, but it's the Mac version.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:40.560]   It's just fantastic, which is Google Earth.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.560]   Have you guys played with Google Earth?
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.560]   Oh, like, yeah.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.560]   So fun.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.560]   This is a distinction from map.google.com.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.560]   This is that on steroids.
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:54.560]   I mean, it is, you can literally lose an hour, two hours, three hours,
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.560]   just playing, jumping around, looking at maps, zooming in.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:02.560]   On top of what you see with maps.google.com, you can see there,
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.560]   you can actually load 3D buildings.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:06.560]   You can actually put your own buildings in that work and your
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.560]   own Google Earth and then submit them so that people can download them.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.560]   But they want you to add to Google Earth.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.560]   There's just an enormous amount of development going on right now,
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.560]   and I think that it's just a killer app in the making.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:22.560]   It used to be called Keyhole a long time ago, and that's when I got into it.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:26.560]   And if you can see people used it on the news when you see, you'll see Google Earth,
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:29.560]   you know, because you can get, there's like the little base version that you can get for free,
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:33.560]   and then you can buy a pro version, which only like $250 or something that lets you animate movies
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.560]   going over the terrain and everything else.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:40.560]   And I think that you can also see where all the closest restaurants are.
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:45.560]   I personally often am finding the nearest Starbucks on Google Earth.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.560]   [laughter]
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:50.560]   I used it to plan my first trip to Toronto, because you can go in,
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:54.560]   and what's awesome is you go in and create a folder called Trip to Toronto
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:57.560]   and add place marks and all of those for all the places you need to go,
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:01.560]   and then say like showing me the ATMs that are nearby, and it just zooming into that area,
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.560]   and you can just print that out and take it with you.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:07.560]   Yeah, it's a really great, great app in my opinion.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:10.560]   So, it's a good time for you to cross-promote the latest Mac break,
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.560]   which is actually one of my favorites.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:16.560]   Oh, the funny thing is I said, okay, I just want to say it for the record,
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:22.560]   I forgot that we were actually talking about Google Earth on Mac break,
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.560]   the show that's coming earlier.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.560]   We shoot this clip earlier.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.560]   That's all the kids about that. That's a great segment.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:36.560]   Yeah, there is a show right now with Leo and Alex Oliver from Mac,
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:40.560]   Alex Oliver from it's called School, and they're doing training for Google Earth
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:45.560]   and SketchUp, and this is how to build models and SketchUp and interact between that
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.560]   and Google Earth.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:51.560]   And their SketchUp allows you to actually build models
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:55.560]   and insert them directly into Google Earth, and that's also free.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:59.560]   Google SketchUp is a free application, and so this is kind of an introduction to that,
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:02.560]   and Alex Oliver kind of propping through it, and Alex is amazing,
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.560]   and the application is amazing.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:08.560]   And it's a really good episode after we took a little hiatus to show people how we were doing it.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:13.560]   This is our first one back in. I think it was a really good example of how that's up.
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:16.560]   So, you showed us how you can make your own house, the shape of your house,
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:20.560]   and then skin it with a photograph to actually make it look like your house,
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.560]   and then share that with people on Google Earth.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:28.560]   So, that's out this week on Mac Break, the video.
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:32.560]   And one thing people may notice about Mac Break, the video, by the way,
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:36.560]   is that the rate of shows coming out is much faster than it has been in the past.
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:40.560]   So, we were hovering along at about one show per week,
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.560]   and I think we're going to start moving to two to three shows a week
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.560]   towards our end goal of it every day.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:51.560]   I think we may be in sometime in the spring, so that's kind of the direction we're going.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:55.560]   But definitely check that out if you haven't seen some of the Mac Break for a while.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:58.560]   This one is a great one to jump back into.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:02.560]   And I think we have some new ones coming from Merlin Mann soon.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:08.560]   And people have been, we've got some posts about the new Twit Open,
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:11.560]   they know the Twit Sounder at the beginning of the show.
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:15.560]   And that's all from Carl Hoffmanfrost, who is here in New York.
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.560]   I was actually meeting with him while I was up here,
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:22.560]   the art director at WABC, and he's the one to put that together.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.560]   He did a great job on that, Alex.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.560]   That's really nice.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:27.560]   I just make the show feel bigger.
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:30.560]   I don't know what it was, but I just thought it was a show just feel like,
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.560]   "Wow, we're watching really fielding a network now."
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.560]   So we really enjoyed it.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:38.560]   Now we just need that guy saying the agony of defeat.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.560]   (laughter)
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:47.560]   So I think I want to thank everyone who called in and logged in to talk to you.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:50.560]   I think this is a really good experiment.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.560]   I really, I enjoy it.
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:53.560]   It's fun.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.560]   I think that hopefully we'll be able to do a lot more of these.
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:00.560]   And once we get a little bit better at it, Leo's already an old master of it.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:04.560]   He's kind of paving the way for us because he has so many more people logging in.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:10.560]   We didn't really promote this one that much, but we will post the next one more publicly.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.560]   We'll do another one of these in January.
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:17.560]   People know we kind of very quietly let people know about it this time so that I didn't get,
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:22.560]   didn't have a Leo problem of being slammed with hundreds of people.
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:24.560]   So thanks everyone for logging in.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.560]   Thank you, Merlin, in Toronto.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:27.560]   Thanks for stopping by.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.560]   Thank you, boys.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.560]   It's nice to hear your voices.
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.560]   And thanks, thank you, Scott.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:33.560]   Thanks for dropping.
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:36.560]   Where could people find out more?
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:39.560]   Where do you spend most of your time on Scott?
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:46.560]   Pretty much podcastingtricks.com and then over at the O'Reilly website on Inside Aperture
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.560]   where I have a column every week.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.560]   And Merlin, you're all 43 folders.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:54.560]   One of your folders, the latest thing, actually, I shot some stuff with Amber yesterday on that phone guy.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:57.560]   So if you go to thatphoneguy.com, you can follow it through to YouTube.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.560]   I got three new phone guys that went up this morning.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:00.560]   Three new phone guys.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.560]   It doesn't get better than that.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:04.560]   Well, let's hope it gets better.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.560]   Does the phone guy talk about iPhone?
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.560]   You know, the phone guy has not talked about.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.560]   The phone guy has had a lot of health problems lately.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.560]   So he's been talking about that in front of people.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:16.560]   Scott, after working, people find more of you.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:29.560]   Go to twit.tv/forum or to the specific show notes, which would be, in this case, twit.tv/mbw19.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:31.560]   John, is that something you're going to try and do for every show?
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:32.560]   I'm going to try to do it for every show.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.560]   You are out of control.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:34.560]   I am on.
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.560]   I am on.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.560]   That is awesome.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:38.560]   John, I am the MCP.
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:43.560]   John, if you actually work with some of our guys, we can get it into the official notes too.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.560]   Oh, cool.
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:46.560]   So email, then about that.
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:50.560]   So that should have been in the after show, but it was in the regular show.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:52.560]   I'm not going to have another show here.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:55.560]   So anyway, this is Alex Lindsay.
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:57.560]   And another Mac break has been broken.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.560]   I like that.
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:00.560]   I like that.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:01.560]   I like that.
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:02.560]   I like that.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.560]   Mac break has been broken.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.560]   That's really good.
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:06.560]   That's pretty good.
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:10.560]   Everyone's, while the old guy has an idea, we're keeping.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.560]   I'm killing this one.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:15.560]   I'm supposed to be out of my hotel room an hour ago.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.560]   So, okay guys, all you think is connected?
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:22.560]   The only thing I'm going to add is working on the after party for Mac world.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.560]   We have to do something.
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.560]   I know, but I'm working on it.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:27.560]   Oh, you are?
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:28.560]   Excellent.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.560]   Let's party up.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:30.560]   Alright, see you.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:32.560]   Everybody have safe travels.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.560]   Alright, see you guys.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:34.560]   Bye.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:37.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:40.260]   [music]
