[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   This is Detroit.

[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   This is MacBreak Weekly, episode 63, for October 23, 2007.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   So long, Tiger.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   [music]
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, episode 63, the last, as Andy and Notco pointed out,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   time will be speculating about the features of Leopard.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Oh, Andy and Notco is here from the Chicago Sun Times and his website,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   the colossal waste of bandwidth.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Hello Andy.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Hello Leo.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   This is our special Leo part.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Leo part, I know this is the operating system named for me.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I'm being very, taking it very personally.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Scott Born is also here from the Apple phone show and
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   girlsgongeek.com.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Hey app or .TV, I should say, hey Scott.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   I am very well.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Thank you for having me and of course I'm not going to even speculate about
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Leopard, I'm going to let you guys do that.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Oh good.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   We have trained speculators here, including the Horned one, Half Man, Half Beast,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   but all Mac, he bleeds.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Is it a 41?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   The Horned one.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   He bleeds Rainbow Colors late.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   How could you talk to?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   The Macalope.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Hello.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And his voice is this time not artificially modified but modified by a
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   hellacious cold.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   And a mixture of cold, various cold medicines.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Oh, you should be good today.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Yep.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Oh, he should be good.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Roll your tape recorders on this one.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   If you hear a clunk though, I might, you know.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Would that be your Horns bumping into something?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   That would be, yeah, exactly.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I never did ask, are you a six pointer, an eight pointer, a twelve pointer?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Uh, standard six points.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Alright.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Nothing fancy.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   You're not a show off.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   No, yeah.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Macalope is now at part of the CNET blog sphere.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   You said macalope.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   What was it?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Macalope.cNET.com/macalope.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   There you go.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Blogs.cNET.com/macalope to read his latest.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   So today, really, it all boils down to three big stories and we'll cover all three of
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   them.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Of course, the effect that Steve Jobs announced, how like the way he began the
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   announcement, uh, was very, it was like somebody was tape recording him talking and
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   then quickly transcribed it to applehotnews.com.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Cause he started, it didn't sound like it.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   What did he start with?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Like, hey, you guys.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Or something like that.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   So, uh, hey, you guys.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   We're going to have third party applications on the iPhone.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Uh, that's big, big news.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I think everybody's, oh, that's, this is how it begins.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Let me just say it.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Okay.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I guess we'll let you, Steve.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Is this, is this Mitt Romney?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Let's say your tax are too high and so are mine.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Let me just say it.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Let me just step on this hay bill and toss my coat over my shoulder so you know,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I'm just a regular guy.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Let me just say it.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   We want native third bill.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   At a minute.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Uh, we also have, uh, the leopard story.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And that's of course the biggest story because leopard comes out on Friday, just a few
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   days hence and we'll talk a little bit of, we'll speculate for the last time, as I mentioned,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   for a little more, more about what's going to happen when leopard comes out.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.720]   And then the really big news, which is yesterday or last night, late last night, after the
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.720]   markets closed, after everybody went to bed, uh, Apple announced its humongous quarterly
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.720]   earnings.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.000]   It's been a very good quarter for Apple and the Apple stores.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Why are you laughing?
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Why are you laughing, mister?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   This is where I read the disclaimer, isn't it?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Yeah, it's trying to read the disclaimer.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   None of us have Apple stock, I might add, except for a certain party, mister.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.080]   I also have a small.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.080]   Do you?
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.080]   Very small.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.080]   Aha.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.080]   It's significantly small.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.080]   Oh, interesting.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.080]   Oh, well, I'll have to read.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.000]   You know, well, now it, you know, that's what we're buying.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.560]   It's now worth a lot more though, McVillie.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.560]   A small, but growing.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.560]   A couple of iPods or something.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.960]   A small, small, but I should really have the disclaimer to hand when I begin this show.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.960]   I never read it anymore, but it's a.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.680]   Would it be simpler if we just said that Andy and Otco and Leo are the only people here
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.600]   with journalistic integrity who are beholden to who are not suckling at the Apple?
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.840]   Don't worry for me.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.840]   Stock profits.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.840]   I felt so guilty.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.720]   Oh, I thought I'd stop for leopard.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.440]   I had 10 shares of Google stock and 10 shares of Yahoo stock just that I had bought at the
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.200]   time because I thought it was historic.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.160]   And I felt so guilty about that that I dumped it.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.400]   I had dumped it at 650 bucks to.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.000]   But I dumped it.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.400]   But I can safely say I no longer have any tech stock.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.320]   I put everything in the in the aerospace and weapon development war bonds.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.720]   Yeah, I figure war bonds are probably the best way to go at this point.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.320]   Many parable posters on Leo's investment.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.400]   If you look at recent pictures of Leo, you'll see he has no pupils just like daddy warbuck.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.080]   So I'm just going to say any or all of the contributors to Twitnet cast their families,
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.800]   the agents, erasigns, may hold positions and securities registered to publicly traded
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.520]   companies mentioned on the Twit network.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.920]   But basically that's we now know it's Scott and Mackle up, but neither.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.560]   Now Scott has a little bit larger stake, but as somebody pointed out, I think not enough
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.880]   to make you, you know, like pump the stock or anything.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.880]   Well, come on.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.280]   I mean, yeah, I mean, I'm not I'm not a principal shareholder now.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.720]   What's ridiculous and nothing I say is going to impact the stock.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.160]   I'm just happy to own it.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.200]   We've had was on the show for crying out loud.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.280]   We don't apologize for having a.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:13.320]   Well, you know, it's careful listeners will note several times that I have taken apple
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.960]   the task for making mistakes.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.480]   I it's to my advantage as a stockholder to point out where they can improve.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.000]   So I don't have a problem when they're doing things wrong, saying they're doing them wrong,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.600]   but looking at the results yesterday, my goodness, googly doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.060]   It's like doing a few things right.
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.180]   With quarter profit, $904 million.
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.940]   That's up from 542 million in the waiting.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.380]   You got to say that right.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.540]   904 million, almost a billion dollars.
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.940]   That's your pinky up to your mouth.
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.860]   That's up 60.
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.220]   That's up like 40% from this quarter a year ago, 67%.
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.320]   Analysts predicted a profit of 85 cents a share.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.980]   They were a buck one.
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.820]   So they, that's when you really get the stock run up right when people get the.
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:58.820]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.820]   They're very conservative in their guidance for the next quarter.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.820]   I mean, I'm surprised that anybody really believes in anymore.
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.820]   That's it.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:04.820]   That's a good point.
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:24.460]   They do, they do, they do release a guidance for the analysts saying we expect to do this.
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.620]   And if they don't do that, then there's disappointment.
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.420]   And if they, if they overproduce as they do all the time, then.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.420]   And they've been overprodiced.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.220]   I mean, they've been significant.
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.820]   I mean, they've been beating their, their guidance for years now.
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.380]   It's like, it's funny when Steve Jobs said, oh, we're only going to sell 10 million iPhones.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.660]   I thought he was underselling it.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.420]   Now looking at the sales, it looks like actually he might have been overselling it.
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.060]   But we'll see time will tell.
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.060]   What did he say?
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.740]   He'd say they'd sell 10 million in the first year.
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.740]   Was that what the?
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.300]   He said by the end of 2008, right?
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.300]   Oh, the.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.300]   And they're there.
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.020]   That's a year and a half.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.140]   A cook just verified that number.
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.940]   They still say they're on track for that.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.940]   And if you look at the price drop data from that day forward in this reporting quarter,
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.020]   there were only 18 days and they sold 400,000 units.
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.260]   The first 18 days.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.260]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.260]   The critical 18 days.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.260]   Sales.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:21.740]   All that doesn't matter who you are, what business you're in 400,000 days is a bunch.
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.740]   Interesting though.
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:28.700]   According to Timothy Cook, as many as a quarter of a million of the iPhones were purchased,
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.020]   but not activated.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.580]   That means they think they are a lot.
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.580]   Brics are unlocked.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.580]   Yeah.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.660]   Or the people who just like to keep them minted in the box.
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.260]   Well, remember me.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.540]   We just bought my iPhone for the stickers.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.540]   That's all.
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.540]   That's what.
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.820]   What's interesting is that AT&T when remember when they gave out those figures, there was
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.380]   that huge discrepancy between apples and AT&T's.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.300]   And at the time, there was no unlock.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.860]   Do you think people actually bought these phones early on expecting an unlock?
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.620]   You know, that's a great question because I've heard so many estimates on how many people,
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.140]   you know, are actually unlocking versus holding out versus trying to resell.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.900]   I mean, I understand that there's there are a lot of phones still.
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.700]   Some idiot bought like, I don't know, 20,000 phones thinking he was going to resell them
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.700]   to block this.
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.700]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.700]   Well, imagine that happened.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.700]   Sure.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.700]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.700]   How many did you buy for your vest, Scott?
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:26.540]   Actually, that's the beautiful thing is when you have as many iPhones as I do, you don't
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.500]   have to buy anymore because they're like rabbits.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.100]   They probably feel like they do.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.260]   They attract other iPhones.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.700]   iPhone dev team has announced that they have a reverse and unbrick now that'll get you back
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.020]   to 102 and then you can up to gate to 111.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.020]   So they're working hard.
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.020]   I'm impressed.
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.860]   Erica Sedoon reports that on the unofficial Apple web blog today.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:52.940]   Getting back to the results, which I mean, we should really glory in this because it really
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.460]   is good news.
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:59.380]   For instance, they sold 2.16 million Mac and Tasha's in the quarter.
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.940]   That's an increase of 400,000.
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.780]   Doesn't break.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.580]   They don't break out domestic and foreign sales, but foreign sales typically are much
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.580]   lower than domestic.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.820]   So I would bet the bulk of those are sold in the US.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.060]   And it's market share that we need to look at.
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:20.700]   And the analysts or the IDC and the Gartner were saying that Apple's market share was
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.700]   way up.
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.700]   We talked about that last week.
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.740]   Sales rose to 6.22 billion.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.620]   Gross margins surged 30.
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.780]   This is an interesting statistic because this is independent of sales, but their margin
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:39.940]   went up from 29.2% to 33.6%, which is just huge in this business.
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.660]   One third margin on everything they sell is phenomenal.
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.660]   They'll kill for that.
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.660]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.900]   Take a look at Dell's numbers and compare those two little factoids.
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.260]   But that's why you can buy a PC for 600 bucks.
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.260]   Yeah.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.260]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.260]   But the market share.
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.020]   Remember, we used to talk about 2% market share and we were kind of like happy?
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.780]   And now it's four times that.
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.780]   Yeah.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.660]   Well, do we do we know what the market share is?
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.660]   I mean, do they?
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:05.740]   It's roughly 8%.
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.740]   That's amazing.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.740]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.500]   Is that worldwide or US must be US?
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.500]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.500]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.500]   I don't know that.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.420]   I just don't have much of a presence worldwide.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.420]   Yeah.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:20.420]   But I think we see some indicators that they're also going to try to change that vis-a-vis
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.460]   more Apple stores in foreign lands.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.300]   The Apple number is actually much bigger than the data question IDC numbers by a factor
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.460]   of two in the IDC case.
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.140]   Dell sold 5 million computers.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.300]   HP sold 4.3 million.
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.020]   Apple sold 2.16.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.500]   That's pretty solid.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.500]   They sold.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.500]   They sold half of what HP sold and HP is the number two manufacturer in the world.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:51.180]   Well, I, you know, I'd really like to hear Andy talk about his perspective on what he
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:57.500]   thinks this means in terms of like if you look at someone who's followed this max stuff
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:02.340]   for a long time to see how many max particularly were sold in this last quarter.
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.940]   Andy, do you think that there's is it the halo effect?
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:05.940]   What's going on?
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.020]   You've, you know, I just really want to hear what you think about that.
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.220]   I'm sorry to jump in Leo, but I've been dying to know what he thinks.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.220]   It's great.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.220]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.220]   He writes about this incessantly.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.220]   Yeah.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.700]   Chiefly because we're seeing one of the most brilliant things that Steve Jobs has done in
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.780]   terms of larger term strategy.
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.260]   I mean, there's there's tactics and their strategy.
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.780]   Introducing the iPod is a tactic.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:31.580]   The idea of it increased the influence of Apple's brand is a strategy.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:39.340]   Up until the first couple years of jobs return, the Macintosh has been its own little island
[00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.620]   where it can do just fine on its own.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.300]   It doesn't need new blood coming in from outside.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:49.060]   The message that it was sending also to the rest of the world was that we'll be perfectly
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:54.100]   lovely if you were to come in and buy a Macintosh, but we don't necessarily need you because
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:59.180]   once again we have our we have our our consistent two, three, four percent of the user base.
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:04.660]   And we're happy to, you know, hit them hit all these people for 30, 40% margins.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.460]   Now though, the brilliant thing about the iPod, the brilliant thing about the iPhone and Apple
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.700]   TV is that it has the ability to bring new people into the phone into the fold.
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.060]   People who previously would not think of themselves as Mac people are now thinking of
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.980]   themselves as Apple people.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.980]   I have an iPhone.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:21.980]   It works.
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:22.980]   I have an iPod.
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.980]   It works great.
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.860]   I use iTunes and it works so much better on my PC than Windows media player.
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:33.620]   And this basically I don't want to put too fine a point on it, but there is this effect
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.900]   of people thinking that, well, no, Macintosh is not this little island that we have to
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:42.300]   have a friend that knows how to get in in order to really pursue switching to Mac or
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.700]   getting a Mac for the house.
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:51.220]   It is now at the same level of awareness and the same level of availability as any other
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.220]   machine.
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:57.580]   And now that that major psychological barrier has been broken, you find more people just
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.260]   swinging by an Apple store.
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.980]   And of course, don't discount the fact that you can now swing by an Apple store.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:07.160]   It is no it is no longer a big deal to find the one store in town that sells Mac and
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.700]   Toches and know what they are talking about.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.380]   For a long time, Apple was the cute little computer.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.100]   And if you wanted a real computer, you would use an IBM.
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.580]   If you wanted a cute little personal.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.260]   Well, that was a prejudice.
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.700]   That was only for a few years that that actually is.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.700]   Thank you, baby.
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.700]   They die hard though.
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.700]   I have to say.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.700]   I mean, I think that there are a lot of people who still think that.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.020]   Yeah, I mean, there are also people who won't rent houses to Irishman.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.020]   I mean, that's it.
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.420]   I think you think it's they are out there.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.420]   Wait a minute.
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.660]   Isn't that a good idea?
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.660]   I thought that.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.660]   Excuse me.
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:45.160]   You know, again, I do think that the perception of what an Apple is has changed from being
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:52.960]   the cute little computer now to the BMW, the high priced, glossy kind of computer.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.120]   And I think some people think, Oh, I don't need that much.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.360]   I don't want to spend that much.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.120]   You think Apple is competing in head to head against Windows machines?
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.120]   Not yet.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.880]   Well, they actually they are because they have never they have still yet to really put anything
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.480]   on the price list that can compete with a back to school computer that appears in office,
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.640]   Macs or staples or best buy.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:20.160]   If you walk into a store with a thousand bucks, you can buy a hell of a nice Windows machine.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.840]   You can buy practically nothing in the Mac line.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:28.280]   However, if you start in the middle of the list, if you walk in with $1,300, $1,400, the
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.080]   Mac is right in there.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.840]   Also, there's of course the factor that, well, if you want to run Windows, go ahead
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.840]   and run Windows, we're not going to be offended.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.480]   We're not we're not checking IDs in the door.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.480]   Mackle up.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.920]   Do you think that people are now get that message that a Mac is a good Windows machine to?
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.560]   Well, yeah, actually that was what I was going to chime in with because Tom Kresn was talking
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.400]   about that today on the peanut about how Apple has lowered the barrier to entry because
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.080]   you walk into an Apple store and you know, in your a little bit curious, but you know,
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:01.320]   if you're not sure if you're ready to swing that way, but they, you know, they can tell
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.560]   you that sure you can still run Windows if you have to.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.720]   I mean, the idea is that you won't have to.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.120]   Yeah, most I think most people I think you're going to.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.120]   Yeah, never.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.120]   That helps.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.120]   That helps a lot of people.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.040]   I think get over the threshold that, okay, if this whole switch just falls flat on its
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.760]   face, I can always install Windows on this machine and keep running in the same environment
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.160]   that I'm used to.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.640]   My mom, I think, you know, my, I use my mom as a test case.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:30.680]   She mid 70s has a G4 or G5i Mac and she sent me an email saying, oh, I just ordered leopard
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.200]   because there is a Windows program I want to run.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   And I had a disabuser.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.440]   I'm sad to say that the notion that she would in fact be able to run boot camp on her system,
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.040]   but she got the message.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.560]   I wasn't I who told her.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.440]   So it is getting out there.
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:51.080]   And also I was in the, I was in the best buy a couple of weeks ago buying yet another
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:56.440]   set of dual layer DVD so I could burn yet another set of leopard seed disks.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.440]   And I was surprised.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.360]   I'm at the MIT flea market, which no, because I keep throwing them against the wall and
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.760]   enjoying watching them shattered to millions of millions of weeks.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.360]   Hey, you don't have to do that anymore.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:10.120]   Well, no, no, I can throw the water at the wall and it's always saying it's smashing
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.840]   to a million, but that's it.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:13.840]   But that's our next topic.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:19.000]   Anyway, I was surprised to see that now that there is a mini Apple store in a lot of best
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.640]   buys, we're not talking about a corner of the store that has a special Apple little stand.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.080]   I'm talking about you see the black back.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.720]   You see the black wall in the middle of the store with the glowing apple logo in the middle
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:37.200]   of it and the same, the same, the same, unstained poplar wood benches and the, and all the stuff
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.040]   locked down the way it is on people and Apple t-shirts actually manning the place.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.280]   I mean, it is like, I was, we got the explicit tag or do we not get the explicit tag?
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.840]   We are a clean, my friend.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.840]   So we are clean.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.960]   See if you find a euphemism for that word you're about to use.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.360]   Well, there was, there are certain clubs where if you are too timid to participate, you're
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.880]   allowed to come in and watch and these little kiosks as well as the Apple store allow the
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.960]   windows people that's okay.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.960]   It's a voyeur.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.560]   I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.560]   I know you there.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.560]   This is a place of safety.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.000]   Nothing's going to happen here that you don't want to happen.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.800]   And of course, two or three weeks later, there he is.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.800]   You know, dressed up.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.800]   The Mac and his lap.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   I know these things happen.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.800]   All sorts of things.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.800]   I'll have my.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.000]   I'll have been to college.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.040]   You know, the, the actually the Apple retail has been doing very, very well.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.480]   Another thing we learned is that the retail source have been phenomenally successful,
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.800]   which again, I have to admit this every time I, I poo pooed the idea.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.520]   You know, Gateway was just getting out of the business.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.160]   I thought Apple was crazy.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.800]   Revenue of $1.25 billion in the fourth quarter from the store.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.440]   That was overall retail revenues, $936 million.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:48.360]   Well, you know, that they're one of the few companies who's been able to do the manufacture
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.920]   and retail thing, right?
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.760]   And that's, I looked at the report carefully as I'm prone to do.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.240]   And I have to say, I spent a lot of time on the retail store stuff because that seems
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.400]   to be very promising.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.240]   And 43% of sales.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.280]   I mean, it's a staggering amount.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.360]   50% to first time Mac users.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.240]   That's, that to me is the one you want.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.880]   Most of all, that's the switchers.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.560]   And then I do agree with Andy that I wanted to hear his take on it.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.560]   But I wanted to see if it verified now.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.640]   And I think that the iPod and iPhone has created a Halo effect.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.400]   We're bringing people over and people are seeing how easy it is to use stuff.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.040]   And you know, on a daily basis, someone looks at my iPhone and says, you know, I'm going
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.040]   to try that out.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.800]   I see a lot of iPhones around and they're not, they're not Mac users.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.240]   They're their windows users.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.000]   Let me make sure I hear you.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.480]   I just want to make sure I'm clear about what I'm saying here that a lot of it is the
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.880]   Halo effect of these devices.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.400]   But again, a lot of it is just the question of, well, how do I get into Macintosh?
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.560]   Well, there's one store that's sort of near Nashua.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.560]   Right.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.760]   Now we're long drive, but you can get there.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.480]   And that was sort of like what it was like in Massachusetts where there were a bunch
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.480]   of stores that people who were into Macintosh knew about.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.440]   I mean, the best analog that I can make is that, you know, there's, there's, there's
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.200]   a great game called Settlers of Catan that I just love.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.320]   But it's one of those, it's not a monopoly board game.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.120]   It's one of those like, you can only buy it in the sort of store really that sells the
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.800]   Dungeons and Dragons stuff, the collectible card games, the hero click stuff, like the
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.680]   really, really intense gaming stuff.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.400]   Again, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.840]   He's such a nerd, isn't he, Mac, a lot?
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.600]   I could again, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.600]   Yeah, he does.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.600]   He's a gamer.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   I could tell.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.760]   He spent a few times with 18 sided dice in his game.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:32.080]   No, I played, I played actual Dungeons and Dragons once at camp and it went so badly
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.840]   that we basically chased the Dungeon Master someplace where I didn't want to go.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.840]   You killed Kenny.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.600]   No, we spent, we spent four hours having, doing all this like double entry bookkeeping
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.400]   and trying to figure out how to create these characters because he knew how to play the
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.400]   game we did.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.880]   And then he killed us all like it.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.840]   But first, like the first thing we did, they, well, what do you mean the hallway collapse
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.840]   around us?
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   One of us has the ability to sense a trap.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.240]   Well, it wasn't a trap.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.520]   It was just a weak structure, but you should have did.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.120]   That's when we started hitting.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.720]   This is what the numbers were made for.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.080]   So I want to correct my figures.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:15.600]   Apple's retail sales were $1.25 billion.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.600]   That's the revenue.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.600]   Let's see.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.600]   43% of the max sold were sold in the stores.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.600]   50% to first time users.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.600]   Apple opened 12 new stores.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.680]   And now they're saying the next store is in Beijing, which I love.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.880]   And if you're right, Matt, they'll open there.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.120]   These are the under estimates.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.600]   I can't imagine they're going to say they say a buck 42 is share for Christmas.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.600]   But margin.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.600]   Keep the really good news.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.920]   Wu says two 10.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.920]   Okay.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.920]   Two 10.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.920]   Two 10.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.920]   That's the stock price.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.120]   When I predicted 200 on this show, I was Pichard.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.420]   Ad Shaw.
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:54.420]   What is it now?
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.420]   What is it now?
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.320]   I can't stand a look.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.320]   Come on.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.320]   You must have a tattooed somewhere.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.440]   No, I haven't looked today because I'm hoping it goes up because I need to do some
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.440]   DCA.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.440]   What's that?
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.720]   The dollar cost averaging.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.560]   Does that mean buy or sell?
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.040]   That means we get a little bump.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.000]   We sell a little bit and we wait for it to settle back down and we buy back in.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Interesting.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   90.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Excuse me.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   No, wait.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   My Raman noodles are almost done over here.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   I just need a little bit of dirt.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Scott is a good.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Scott is a good.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.080]   I'm with Donald so I can give it a little taste.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.800]   Is it good if the price is $92?
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.080]   Is that good or bad for you?
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.080]   I'm just kidding.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.080]   Just teasing you.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.080]   I'm just kidding.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.080]   I'm just kidding.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.080]   I'm just kidding.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.080]   185 right now.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.080]   One, eight.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.080]   Wow.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.080]   Five.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.080]   Wow.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.080]   I think time to DCA.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.080]   Up to 11.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.080]   Up to 11 as a.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.080]   Unbelievable.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.080]   So the market obviously likes these numbers.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.080]   Well, it mess with bandwidth if I do another Skype call to my broker.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.080]   Well, from this Skype call.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.600]   No, we'd like to listen in, Scott.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   Just leave it up.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.600]   Yeah, that's very educational.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.840]   How proud to go get it.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.480]   That only the $1 million shares now.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.600]   That only exists the show where we talk about Mac stuff.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.560]   We teach you how to buy Mac stock.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.080]   So I just want to say the stocks going to go up even further.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.400]   And here's why.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.080]   As of today, you can pre-order the complete Led Zeppelin on iTunes.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.560]   And that is the big news.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.480]   99 bucks for every song ever recorded.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.680]   The big news is that every Macintosh system administrator is not going to be so stoned
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.640]   and useless for the next week.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.240]   That no installation will go correctly.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.240]   No support.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.480]   No through and the entire system will collapse.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.880]   Unbelievable.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.600]   You know, I probably do already own all those albums on vinyl, but I'm going to spend 99
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.600]   bucks.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.600]   You bet.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.600]   Hey, you know what?
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.600]   I'm so excited about it.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.600]   I'm buying it twice.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.600]   I don't own a van.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.600]   I'm not interested.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.600]   You could afford to though.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.600]   Did you say you don't own a Mac, Andy?
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.600]   I'd say I don't own a van.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.400]   So I'm not sure if I could really enjoy Led Zeppelin the way that other people can.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.400]   True.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.680]   That's what they should have done as a promotional package instead of the, you know, the Led Zeppelin
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.680]   iPod.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.680]   They should give you a van.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.920]   Are they doing a Led Zeppelin iPod?
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.280]   No, I don't think so.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.280]   That would be cool.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.280]   What would it look like?
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.280]   You can have the yellow side of the Merle Wing.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.640]   You would have more into the characters of Don't be ducked.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.240]   I asked Merlin to join us if he wanted to.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:14.960]   And I guess he's probably busy with the baby stuff right now, but I think he'd have
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.960]   something to say about this Led Zeppelin.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.960]   Now, come on.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.960]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.400]   It is exciting, but you could buy Led Zeppelin before.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.040]   This is not not their first time on the iTunes store, isn't it?
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.920]   For 99 bucks to get everything.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.440]   How many songs is that?
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.440]   165.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.120]   Well, that's a good deal, then.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.840]   It's like that should be 165 bucks.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.280]   Are they DRM-ed?
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.560]   That I do not know.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.560]   And I'm so excited.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.800]   I didn't even bother to check.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   I clicked buy twice.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.280]   Like I said, I was just excited.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.120]   Are all 169 tunes good?
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.120]   165.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.120]   165 good?
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.120]   I mean, aren't there Led Zeppelin?
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.120]   They're good.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.720]   They're in the 168 of them all.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.320]   What sort of like you drive by those strip clubs and it says hundreds of beautiful girls
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.520]   and three ugly ones?
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.520]   Right.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.520]   That's actually a trademark, I believe.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.840]   Oh, OK.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.280]   So good news.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.400]   Is there any bad news in anything Apple announced last night?
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.200]   I think it's all very positive, right?
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.720]   And whatsoever.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.960]   Anything on the horizon that you think could slow down this juggernaut?
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.560]   The economy in general.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.960]   They do say that the marches will go down because their component costs are going to
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:27.960]   go up.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.520]   They're using a lot of flash.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.520]   I can't.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.760]   They must be the number one purchaser of flash memory in the world.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.360]   We've got the left word on the street trying to buy flash memory from drug dealer.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.160]   And actually I'm looking at this.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:45.360]   And in fact, Wolf said 100 that they're going to sell 14 million iPhones, not 10 million.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.200]   They're on track to sell 14 million.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.040]   He said 10 million in 2008 specific.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.040]   Wow.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.520]   They're ahead of, they believe.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.720]   I think what that means is they expect 4 million in 2007.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.440]   They expect good seals in Europe, I think is what they're saying.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:07.560]   This is a, you know, before we get on to to leopard, I do want to mention that this is
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.520]   the sixth anniversary today of the iPod.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.520]   The iPod was announced.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.280]   I remember very well on this day in 2001.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:22.000]   In fact, nobody, you know, remember September 11th was six weeks before nobody expected
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   much.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.160]   I do remember, I didn't go to that event, but I remember Patrick Norton coming back with
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.160]   one.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.080]   He said, Apple wanted to give you this and I was blown away.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.640]   I still have that first generation iPod, five gigabyte iPod.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.640]   It's right here.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.640]   Pretty cool.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.400]   I hope the kids today understand what the world was like before the iPod when it really
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.840]   wasn't understood that an portable MP3 player had the ability to not suck.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.840]   Right.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.840]   I mean, it was true.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.320]   It was, I mean, it was like the right brothers.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.800]   They were like the right brothers playing where you're just so amazed that you can actually
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.640]   do this with this device that you didn't care that, you know, you're limited to about
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.560]   200 yards and that went out every eight times.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.640]   So it crashed and died, but the iPod was the first one where you didn't none of only 3%
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.920]   of your life was based around actually keeping this thing running.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.040]   We're asked on the other players.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:14.040]   It was like 50% of your time was trying to figure out how to arrange your songs and get
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.920]   them on the device and then use format.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:20.720]   It was not, it was not necessarily easier to use than a CD file with 10 CDs in it.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.960]   We spent a lot of time on the screensavers talking about making your own hard drive MP3
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.080]   player and the thing, you know, there'd be the size of a shoebox.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.360]   It's amazing how small we can get this.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.560]   And when the iPod came away, I mean, it just blew everything else away.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:39.040]   It was just highly recommend the Steven Levy book on the iPod.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.040]   What was it called?
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.040]   The perfect thing, something like that.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.560]   But what I love about that book is that it really puts the entire device in historical
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.560]   context.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.560]   Exactly.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.680]   It really describes not just the first, the first, the first.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:55.320]   The first discussion was, well, they're going to use ARM chips or proprietary Intel chip.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.240]   It was like, no, here's what the world was like in 1999, 2000.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.240]   Here's what the stakes were for Apple.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.680]   It was, it was, he's a really great storyteller.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.840]   Yeah, he really is.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.800]   This is also, I didn't know this, but kind of overshadowed by the iPod anniversary.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:12.280]   But on this day, eight years ago in 1999, OS nine was released.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.800]   What are you giggling about?
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.240]   Steve Jobs said, OS nine is not really that nerdy.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.520]   The best, the best internet OS card from anybody about the anniversary of Mac OS nine.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.000]   I mean, maybe I just don't have good friends, but automatic.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.080]   I'm reading from a Chris C. Bould's article in Apple Matters where they do this great
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:37.800]   this day in Apple history, things that were new in OS nine, automatic software updates.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:44.160]   The first Mac operating system to support multiple accounts and the key chain was introduced
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.160]   with OS nine.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.160]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.160]   The tail fins on the cars.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.160]   How about something to the bottom?
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.840]   It's funny, I mean, 99 isn't that long ago, but it seemed when you talk about OS nine,
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.640]   it seems like a long time ago.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:00.040]   And exciting young stud named Marlon Brando changed the way we felt.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:06.760]   Wasn't it about that long ago that the, I think this was recently had its anniversary
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:13.160]   of Michael Dell's comment that if you were running Apple, that he would close the whole
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.160]   thing down and give the money back to the shareholders.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.360]   Yeah, good thing he didn't do that, huh?
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.760]   It was like eight or 10 years.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.360]   Yeah, I think you're probably right.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.280]   He'll never boy, he'll never live that one down.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.760]   Everybody remembers that at least every Mac fan remembers.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.760]   Certainly.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:34.160]   Also, October 20th, 1997, the last Newton came out the message had 2100.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.160]   And now Apple's back in the Newton business, which is one of those here too.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.160]   Do you?
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.160]   So a little bit of history before we go back to the future and talk.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.400]   If you do those things in the future, you really need to use the KCC some voice.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.000]   And I'm just saying, I T-bide, a device called the Newton had his last abroad.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   That's true.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   I will from now on.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   From it.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.520]   Let's talk a little bit about, let's see, we did the OS 10.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.400]   Let's quickly do the iPhone SDK.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.400]   Any surprise?
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.560]   I was stunned.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.000]   I didn't expect them to announce it.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.240]   I'm a little disappointed.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.320]   It's not until February.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:15.040]   If they put out the SDK in February, it's going to take a couple of months after that
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.600]   right before we see apps.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.680]   They had to do it.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.680]   I mean, I'm not saying--
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.320]   Did they plan to do it or have to do it?
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.720]   I think they had to do it.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.600]   I'm not saying they did it in response to a column that I wrote a few weeks ago, but
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:31.560]   I was saying, look, I'm saying, because what I was saying is that it's okay that you're
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:36.360]   not going to have this ready anytime soon, but you have to make a statement that says,
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.760]   yes, there will be real third party apps.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:44.200]   As I've said many times before, people have to plan months in advance what hardware they're
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.200]   going to invest into.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:50.240]   And if they're going to invest in a device that costs $400 but can't run real local apps,
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.240]   that's going to affect the decision.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.480]   So I'm really not surprised that they said it in advance.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.480]   We're doing it.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.000]   It's going to be a while, but we're doing it.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   We're doing it.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   We're doing it.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.400]   Well, I think after the breaking incident, the Up War was kind of enough to make it obvious
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.400]   that you're okay.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.920]   You've got to come out and say something now.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:10.800]   I wish Steve had said, okay, we heard you and we now understand that you want these and
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.120]   we're going to do it.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.120]   He didn't.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.120]   Well, that may not have been true though.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.560]   I mean, it totally sounds a little long.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.320]   And also implies that they didn't always intend to do it.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.320]   Right.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.080]   I mean, I find it impossible to believe that they did not intend to release an SDK.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:28.760]   As a matter of fact, if you even during WWDC, when they had their first public sessions
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:34.040]   about the iPhone development, it really seemed as though Steve was saying we are working
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.040]   on it.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:39.520]   We can't say anything about it right now or promise anything right now, but we know we
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.400]   know we know we're doing this.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.280]   So yeah, I think it makes sense that they plan to do it.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.240]   It also kind of lends credence to the thought that maybe the iPhone was released before
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:54.400]   its time and really the real iPhone will be maybe this time next year or June of next
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.480]   year when the iPhone we have right now is real enough.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.600]   Well, it's real, but it's not.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.640]   It maybe isn't where it should have been.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.480]   I disagree.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.760]   But I can't find anything that's majorly a major oops in this entire design.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.760]   Really?
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.440]   Even when you have something that that people have legitimate complaints about, which is
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.520]   the speed of the cellular connection, there's a reason why the.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.120]   That I can understand that's why they chose.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.280]   Yeah, that I can understand.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.680]   But what no cut and paste, no to do list, no third party apps at all.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:29.440]   Those seem to me things they probably didn't want to put out a phone that way, but didn't
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.440]   have much choice.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.480]   It's still better than the other phone I had.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.480]   That's true.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.960]   But the third party apps, there are so many things to consider, especially when you're
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:41.400]   talking about a device that's always on and always has a very intimate connection with
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.480]   a huge network that's owned by another company.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.400]   Well, I think every other smart phone has figured out how to do it.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.400]   I don't know what's.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:55.440]   Well, because they don't need to have as much control over the device.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.840]   I'm saying I'm not saying this is necessarily the case.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.200]   I'm saying that there's a lot of iceberg under the water on this one.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.160]   Yeah, no, I'm so a president to really say that that they made a mistake there before
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.200]   I know exactly what the background is on it.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.720]   Do we agree that'll be sold on iTunes?
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.720]   Yes.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.480]   I'm positive that's going to be the gatekeeper.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:20.200]   And what will that mean for shareware and freeware apps?
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.200]   I don't know.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.640]   I just have to deal with Apple to get into the pipeline.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:29.720]   But but more importantly, I think what that means is that we'll control the problems that
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:34.440]   many people with open smartphones run into today where you get your phone bricked in
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.640]   a whole new way because you get new apps on it and end up screwing it up.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.920]   And this way they'll be able to test them.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.120]   And that's that's fine for me.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.800]   I mean, I'll look at the third party apps that come through iTunes because I think then
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.240]   I won't be worried about them crashing my phone.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.280]   I think that doesn't give a lot of credit to users though.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:53.320]   I mean, I've installed third party apps in a lot of my phones, all my phones.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.000]   I mean, that's one of the reasons I'm using a BlackBerry not an iPhone is I want those
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   third party apps.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.200]   And sometimes you're right.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.800]   Sometimes they don't work very well and I take them off.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:06.120]   Yeah, but you know, but I was just looking back through my Flickr feed and I have pictures
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:11.680]   I took with my last Windows mobile smartphone of the box that the iPhone came in when it
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:12.680]   was.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:13.680]   The last picture.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.680]   Exactly.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:20.400]   And there's actually a comment saying because I'm I don't know where I was typing this from,
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.520]   but it says, ah, the phone is just said, I'm sorry.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.520]   I'm out of memory.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.400]   Please close applications of restart the device.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:30.520]   It is just make give me this error message for the last time because I installed an application
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.000]   a week earlier that for some reason it hosed a whole bunch of memory.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.960]   I couldn't figure out where the files were to remove and I've been dealing with this
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.400]   every fourth key price with.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.400]   Sorry.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.400]   I know you have a two gigabyte empty memory card in me, but I'd rather try to deal with
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.400]   the 16 K of memory that I've been given for applications instead.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.960]   No, now I'm going to now.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.960]   Absolutely.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.240]   I mean, it's it's it's not a perfect world.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.520]   And I guess in you know, you get to make the choice as a consumer.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.920]   Do I want this kind of walled garden that Steve Jobs is building where everything works
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   perfectly and plays together nicely?
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.200]   Or do I want the flexibility to put my own stuff on?
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.000]   I choose the latter, but many people would prefer the form.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Because you kind of you kind of defined it there saying once you say to the consumer,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.240]   okay, you have this one solution where everything works perfectly.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.480]   But what what why is there a second choice?
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.880]   I'll take the thing that works perfectly.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.600]   Because I want the flexibility to do what I want to do.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.480]   Like that's such a important thing.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.480]   The first thing they're like, well, okay.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.480]   Okay.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.600]   Well, this is thing called a dial tone.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.600]   I really like it when my phone gives me that.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.240]   And so I really want that to work.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:38.280]   So let's get on to leopard because that's of course the big story, not that much to say
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.800]   since it will be out on Friday.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:46.680]   And there was a good article which I put in our links on them, MBWI.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:53.480]   A list of the 16 coolest features in leopard that you perhaps didn't know about.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:59.480]   John Henshaw wrote it in the siting blog and some interesting stuff here, although this
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.680]   is his choice.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.840]   You guys have features you think will end up being important in leopard.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.920]   Those of you who have played with it.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:12.040]   My favorite feature is back to my Mac for two really big reasons.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.000]   This is the feature where it so long as you have a dot that that's going to sell a lot
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.800]   of dot Mac subscriptions because so long as you have if you have a desktop Mac and a notebook,
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:25.800]   your Mac book will be able to find your Mac no matter where it is on the network, whether
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.160]   you're in the same room or half a continent away.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:34.480]   And it will basically give you access to all your file shares, all your network printers,
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.680]   everything, just all your keychains, everything.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.800]   The other cool thing about that though is, and I didn't really figure this out until I
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:46.520]   started, the seed got a lot more stable for me a couple of weeks ago.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.280]   So there were a lot of things that I have not been able to use in the past three months
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.200]   I'm just playing with now.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.120]   And screen sharing works over back to my Mac.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:37:00.320]   So essentially, there is sort of a hidden VPN that comes free with every copy of leopard.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:06.240]   So if I'm in public Wi-Fi somewhere at a cafe or coffee house, I can simply now, I
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:11.880]   don't, instead of using the Wi-Fi built into my back book to access to taxes, the internet
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:16.960]   directly, I use the Wi-Fi to connect to use back to my Mac to connect to my home Mac.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.920]   And that's a rock solid secure tunnel.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:25.080]   And then I simply launch Firefox or Safari on my home Mac, look at it through a window
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.600]   on my remote Mac.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:27.880]   And I know that that's a secure tunnel.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.120]   I can get my email, I can move on.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.160]   And that's like, I'm sure that someone's going to come up with a simpler way of doing
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.160]   this.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.280]   And someone doesn't come up with the utility saying, well, why don't we, instead of using
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.400]   this sort of klugee thing where I'm looking at a window that's actually hosted 80 miles
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:45.520]   away, what if I simply use that secure tunnel that's already there to simply use internet
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.520]   sharing?
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:50.280]   And for all I know, I haven't been able to verify that internet sharing over back to my
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.040]   Mac is actual internet sharing.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.400]   I'm still tamering on the credit figure out what's actually going on.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:38:00.080]   So for all I know, you can do internet sharing over back to my Mac, but that that's just such
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:05.080]   a huge in every articulation of back to my Mac, that's such a huge feature.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.080]   I'm doing it.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.760]   There's going to be a column that's going to be online on Friday in which I basically
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:14.840]   run down all the features of leopard and talk about, well, if this wasn't an update
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:19.720]   to the OS, if these were individual utilities that share where authors were offering, how
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.640]   much would I pay for each one of these?
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.400]   And back to my Mac package, I put that at $89.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.440]   I would spend $89 to get this feature on my Mac.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.040]   Have you played with a leopard or you?
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.480]   Just briefly, I'm on somebody else's machine.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.480]   I don't have an install.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.480]   And these are resident leopard expert.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.480]   Right.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.640]   But one of the other things I think Andy did not mention that I'm looking forward to is
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:45.960]   automator changes in automator being able to record your activities and then play them
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.960]   back.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.960]   I think that's going to be really good.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:48.960]   It couldn't do that before?
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.960]   No.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:50.960]   Wow.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:56.640]   That's pretty much picked through and trying to find the available Apple script could, but
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.640]   Automator could not.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.640]   Right.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.720]   Even though even even there Apple script, it has a record button, but practically no
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.640]   application supports recording.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.640]   Right.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.640]   So I mean, it was a good idea.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.640]   And that was it.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.200]   It first came out right, but that's about it.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:13.640]   The other cool thing about the changes to Automator is that they finally added some sort
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.880]   of support for variables where there's now in addition to Automator actions, there are
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.240]   also Automator variables so that if you want a file name, you no longer have to sort of
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.440]   come up with this blue way to generate.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.440]   Right.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:30.000]   You can simply drag current date, current time, base root of file, these little like
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.760]   beans into the box and they will generate these variables for you.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.440]   Then you can access those variables later on in the workflow.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.200]   Much needed that one.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.920]   Very simple too is what I like about it.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.680]   Just to run you through John's picks, he mentions that text edit now supports Word
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.080]   2007 and open document formats.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.080]   That's nice.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.080]   Workspaces.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.080]   That is.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.080]   Go ahead.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.080]   Say again.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.080]   I'm adding color commentary to everything.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.080]   Color is fine.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.120]   I don't want to read a list.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:05.900]   It's interesting that both text edit and preview are now they are just one spring break
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:11.320]   vacation away from being a really credible commercial word processor and a commercial
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.840]   picture editor.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.760]   Text edit in Tiger was already really, really solid.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:21.760]   I mean, believe it or not, I think that it would serve the needs of 50 to 60% of everybody
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.760]   who used it.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:26.360]   Yeah, surprisingly, I'm always surprised when I run into people say, "Oh yeah, I used text
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.360]   it all the time."
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.440]   I mean, all it needs are some tweaks like a Word count feature.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.320]   It's a little creature conference, but you can add those easily enough with AppleScript.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.320]   Right.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.320]   Anyway.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.320]   Very cool.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.320]   All right.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.320]   Number two, terminal has workspaces.
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.440]   This is something kind of like, I guess, what I term has always done.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.920]   But that's a good thing.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.480]   System preferences can be synced over .mac.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.920]   I think .mac is going to come into its own with leopard, it sounds like.
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:56.480]   Apple's finally finding a use fork that goes beyond having a lame web page that no one's
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.480]   going to visit.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:02.160]   I mean, if they start off with a mail account that did nothing, you couldn't get for free
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.280]   and better on Google or Yahoo.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.640]   It started off giving you a eye disc share that was probably too small to do a lot of
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.440]   really useful stuff with.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:15.480]   Now, it's still the service where there isn't that one killer feature that says, "Yes,
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.200]   this is why I'm spending $100 or $60 or $70 a year for it."
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.800]   It's all these little things to add up to.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   Okay.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.000]   In total, there's more than $100 worth of value here.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.760]   That'll be doubly good with leopard.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:31.760]   Guest login accounts, which means that you can use some of these Mac as a guest and it
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.760]   will erase.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.480]   It'll purge the account after you're done removing all traces of activity, which is,
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.680]   I think, a very useful system-wide grammar check.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.080]   I never use grammar check because I'm a perfect gramarian.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.920]   I think this is why my Mac was giving me so much trouble with leopard.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.880]   It was, "I can't deal with the way this man writes.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:49.880]   I give up."
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.880]   This isn't grammar.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.880]   This is typing.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:56.160]   If I don't start a peek at the grammar, you read this stuff.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.960]   Say again, Scott Borne.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.640]   Grammar Girl has gone on quite a campaign to keep a bull from upgrading.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.640]   Really?
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.640]   Because no one will need her.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.640]   Oh, okay.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.640]   Because of the system.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.920]   I found often that computer grammar checkers are just wrong.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.160]   Just, you know, balls out wrong.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.840]   We kid with grammar, so we kid her.
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:13.840]   She's perfect.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:14.840]   We kid, we love her.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.840]   No, I'm not talking about her.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:16.840]   I'm talking about leopard.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.840]   We'll see.
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.840]   Not active windows.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.440]   Scroll any open window, even if it's not active.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:26.800]   You've got the front most window, but let's say you want to see what's on that spreadsheet.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.520]   You can hover your mouse over and scroll it.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.000]   That's kind of an oddball feature, but I think very handy.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.600]   Software update will update your printer drivers.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.400]   A big improvement.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.800]   I don't know if they had to wait for leopard to do that, but maybe.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:46.560]   PDF manipulation in preview, which means you can move pages around, remove pages, combine
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.280]   PDFs with drag and drop.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.160]   He mentioned self-tuning TCP and networking.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:55.160]   I think that's a minimal use, but archiving mailboxes and mail.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.360]   Just like Outlook, boys and girls.
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:01.800]   iChat will support SMS forwarding through AOL.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:06.080]   iCal has an event drop down.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:10.120]   So you can share photos, video or any kinds of documents in an event.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:15.280]   So I could email you a picture of me when I invite you to Mac Break Weekly next time.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.160]   That'll be nice.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   Font auto-path.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.680]   It's the deal right there.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.920]   All of that.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:27.360]   Font auto-activation, activate fonts as you need them.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:31.320]   So when an application requests an installed font that's disabled, it'll activate that
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.000]   font until their application quits.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.360]   That'll be handy for a lot of designers, I'm sure.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.680]   Screen sharing, that's what you talked about a little bit, Andy.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.040]   I think that's going to be very nice.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.560]   Ricky Pedia is in the dictionary and you can synchronize the address book with Yahoo.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:49.040]   There's 16 cool new features you didn't know about according to John Henshaw.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.320]   Thank you, John.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.320]   I think I'm excited.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.480]   I'm going to go down to a Cupertino on Thursday.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:44:00.680]   They asked me to go down and probably they'll just set up a projector and show that video
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.960]   that's on the Apple page right now.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.120]   Is that the Bizarro Steve Jobs or what?
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:09.000]   Do they somehow find a Steve Jobs clone?
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.720]   Guys, he's got the gray hair, the turtleneck.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.680]   I'm sure he's wearing jeans even though you can't tell.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.680]   A little wire.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.920]   He must have worked 80 at some point in his life.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:23.320]   Doesn't he look like he says he's hi, I'm John from the Apple store.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.320]   Not his real name.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:28.000]   I tried to watch this thing three times and I've fallen asleep at the halfway point each
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   time.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.160]   Yeah, he's a little left compelling that Steve.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.680]   That's quite the very, very end.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.240]   They announced the new Terms of Service.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.720]   Oh, Andy, back to me.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.720]   So long.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.280]   By the way, I think, well, I sacrificed goat.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.680]   My assistant had a theory that what was happening was I was actually getting caught up in Time
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.680]   Machine.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.840]   Ah, you know, that's why what asked the halfway point.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.720]   We talked a little bit about Time Machine on Windows Weekly.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.600]   Paul Thorett was talking a little bit about Liberty.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:59.440]   He said, what's the deal with the space motif and the stars going?
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.040]   He says, did you really have to spend all that energy doing that?
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.040]   Is that really important?
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.400]   And he said, as far as I can tell, you can't turn that off.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.960]   Andy, you probably used it.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.320]   Is this a nice feature or just eye candy?
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.480]   What's the point of that?
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.480]   I'm still traw...
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.200]   You mean the star field?
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.200]   Star field.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:24.280]   Oddly enough, if you saw the way that it works, the Time Machine doesn't affect everything
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:26.160]   you're looking at all at once.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:30.160]   When you're using it, when you click on the Time Machine icon, it's for this one thing
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.160]   you're looking at.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.160]   Oh, oh.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.320]   This one application, this one finder window, this one thing.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:40.480]   So there is a necessity to make everything else go away lest you think that, well, actually,
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.880]   what I really want to do is want to make sure that this new Photoshop document that I screwed
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.480]   up this morning, I'll rewind that.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.080]   You have to specify this zero thing.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:54.960]   So it's very, very correct for Apple to send you to a whole other place temporarily while
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.560]   you decide where you want this thing to rewind to.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.320]   Welcome to the alternate universe.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.400]   It is a little bit, I don't know.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.360]   It's kind of cute seepoo.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.440]   It becomes less distracting the more you use it.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:15.240]   I wouldn't be surprised if a year from now, in the next update, they find a simpler way
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.840]   of getting the same job done.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.840]   Yeah, like a drop down list with dates.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:19.840]   You could go back to it.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:26.080]   Well, I wouldn't be surprised if something just like, you know, you've ever been to like
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:31.280]   one of those really, really bad, like dramatic productions of like our town community theater
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:34.440]   where everyone has the character has their big monologue.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.520]   And so suddenly everyone freezes in the background lights.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:37.520]   Right.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.520]   There's one spotlight on.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.880]   I think we're going to see something like that where just there'll be everything will
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.880]   fade into the background.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:42.880]   They'll be dim.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.400]   They'll get the god light shining on this one window you're working with and a different
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.960]   sort of tool control because the way they've got it now, it's not distracting.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:51.960]   It's not bad.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:56.600]   It's just that it's more like, hey, we've got this new tool with new set of toys called
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:57.840]   called for animation.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.840]   Let's use them.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:02.280]   Let's be in Star Trek for eight seconds out of a day.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.280]   That's what it really is.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.240]   It's core animation demo, isn't it?
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:12.160]   Question from Dan Frakes in the Mac world about a time machine using airport disk.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:20.040]   It was a feature of betas, but according to the time machine page on Apple's website,
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.440]   they don't mention airport disk use.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.800]   It seems like that would be useful.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.280]   Maybe it's something that's been removed.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.280]   We won't know.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   I guess still it comes out.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:29.280]   That's a frustration.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.160]   There's some things that have been appearing in public statements have not been appearing
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.160]   in the sea.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.480]   There are things that have been appearing in the sea that haven't been mentioned elsewhere.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:40.680]   The things have been appearing in that demo site that Apple set up that I haven't seen
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.040]   for months and months.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.120]   I really think that the ball is still in the air and we're not going to know where it lands
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.120]   until Friday.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.120]   Right.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.440]   It'd be very interesting.
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.440]   I'm looking forward to it.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:54.520]   I certainly will put it on a sampling of my machines, if not all my machines.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:59.320]   It would be a scene, by the way, if time machine does not work with the airport extreme base
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:03.960]   station wirelessly, because the big Achilles heel of this whole system is that you can't
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:07.200]   simply say, "Well, I know I've got this 300 gig hard drive.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:11.480]   I'll just want to use whatever free space is available for this time machine feature."
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:15.720]   Obviously, by necessity, you really want to have a second drive, but it works best if
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.960]   you have a whole drive that does nothing but time machine backups.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:20.960]   Right.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:24.040]   It's a really, really cool thing if you have the ability to say, "Well, you know what?
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.040]   I've got three Macs in the house.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.240]   I'm going to buy myself a 500 gig hard drive.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.880]   I'm going to put three partitions on it."
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:30.880]   Right.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:31.880]   Exactly.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:35.720]   I'm not sure how much I would use it if it only benefits me when I happen to have this
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:41.400]   special hard drive plugged in, because most of my work is done on my MacBook on Lilith.
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.400]   Right.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.400]   And I don't always have that drive.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.520]   It is smart enough, though, if you disconnect to kind of disable and then sync up when you
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.040]   reconnect, which is kind of nuts.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.040]   Right.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.040]   It does it well.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.040]   It does work with the partition that?
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:53.880]   Yes.
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.880]   It requires either a partition or a second drive, though.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:56.880]   You can't do it on this.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:57.880]   You need to have a dead-
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:02.360]   You can't do it on the same drive, but you can use a partition on the second drive, then.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.240]   Well, what you can do is you can take your home drive.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:09.760]   If you have a 200 gig drive, you can partition it into 200 gig drives and use the second
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.520]   volume as your time machine volume.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:15.040]   That's sort of short circuits for the benefits of doing a backup, because your backup is
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.120]   the same volume as your original.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.760]   But a lot of people are going to be thinking of time machine, not so much as a backup solution,
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:21.760]   so much as a whole.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.240]   Why the hell did I do that time machine?
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.240]   Take me away.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.640]   You know, three-
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.920]   So help me with your wizard.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:35.120]   I shouldn't have deleted that project for you.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.080]   So, okay, that's interesting.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:43.760]   So you, it's kind of, is it a backup system that will, it's always running if you have
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:44.760]   a second drive.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.960]   Do you, does that second drive have to be the same size as the original drive?
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.440]   Not necessarily, but it has to be at least the same size.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:55.880]   There's also something that I'm trying to, I'm just getting into stress testing of time
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:50:02.240]   machine now, now that I have like three, four, five weeks worth of backup data on it.
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:07.360]   The way that it works is that it's, it's really, really sophisticated, the way that it's
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:12.520]   figuring out just the changes that have been made and basically having a breadcrumb trail,
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:17.760]   what's happened to all the, to this drive over a period of hours, days, weeks and months.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:23.480]   What I want to know though is if I have a 250 gig internal drive and I'm not, I'm not using
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.480]   it the way I'm supposed to, where I'm, I know I'm supposed to be keeping at least 10 to
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:30.440]   15% of that free at all times, but let's say that I'm really pulling it close to the
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.280]   margin where I only have two or three or four gigs left.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:37.200]   At what point is the backup drive going to say, look, I don't have enough room to backup
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.280]   all of this data plus all the changes that have been made to this data, I'm going to
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.400]   have to start to start throwing things away.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:47.560]   I haven't managed to break it yet, but I haven't really started to really be mean to it yet.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.640]   So I'm curious to see how well it deals with all that.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:55.160]   I mean, it does, it does remain to be seen how people are going to use this.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.160]   I still think that super duper is the best backup solution.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:02.840]   I really do think that it's best to have a standalone application so that I can tailor
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.800]   a solution that's going to fit to every solution that I can work with.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:10.480]   I'm not convinced that I obviously I have time machine working on my test bed and it's
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.000]   been working for the past month and half, two months.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:19.080]   But I'm not convinced that if I were relying on this for day to day backup, that it wouldn't
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:23.280]   be one of those several backup systems that I used it for a couple months and then stop
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.360]   using for some reason and then just never react to me.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.720]   Will it work on a NAS?
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:29.720]   If it doesn't do Apple Disk, will it work with a network attached?
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.080]   I mean, go over ethernet in other words.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.520]   It will work on an ethernet drive.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.440]   I have a couple of those volumes in the house.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:40.040]   Basically, so long as you have a separate volume that appears on the desktop, supposedly,
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.040]   it will work.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.920]   Again, for now, I'd have to go back.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:48.680]   I only did a quick test to see if it worked on my airport extreme shared drive and it
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.560]   seemed to work then about a month, a month, a month, a month, a month, a half ago.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.320]   That could have changed since then.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.080]   So I can't really vouch for anything.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.640]   So what's coming out Friday, well, by next week, we'll certainly have lots to talk about
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.640]   in terms of new features.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.960]   I'm sure we'll all install it.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.240]   Here's my question, though, to you.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.640]   Which computers will you install it on?
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.720]   Will you install it on all of them?
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.720]   Will you wait and see?
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.120]   Will you install it on one?
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.080]   Andy, you've already got it running in beta.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:14.080]   Will you put the gold master on all your machines as soon as it's available?
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.080]   Absolutely not.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.080]   Absolutely.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.880]   There's the answer for you.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:24.000]   Yeah, I mean, this has been one of the flakiest seeds that I've dealt with.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.520]   I've dealt with like pre-seeds, I think, two or three times in the time.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:29.720]   So your advice for people would be maybe wait a little bit?
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:30.720]   Not.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.720]   Don't treat it like plutonium.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.640]   I'm saying that wait and see.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:36.880]   If there is something, if you think there's a reason you absolutely must have this, it's
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.920]   not going to be the worst decision you make in 2007.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.800]   However, I think that there will be a real benefit to waiting until November or December
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.320]   or even Mackerel Expo in January.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:50.800]   Because I'm absolutely positive.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:57.360]   Not because of any inside information that I have, but just on the lack of air that exists
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:02.200]   between the last buggy version that I received and the arrival of the gold master, there's
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.360]   just not a whole lot of time between those two releases.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.680]   Just on that basis, I'm convinced there's going to be a massive bug fix.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:13.120]   I mean, even bigger than the massive bug fix you always expect when there's a major OS
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.120]   release.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.640]   I'm certainly going to be something big released by the end of the year that will make a lot
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:22.800]   of people pity the people who may their entire business rely on leopard.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.040]   Don't put it on your production machines.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.560]   How about you, Macelope?
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.600]   How quickly will you roll out leopard in the Macelope's duties?
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.600]   Probably pretty much.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.600]   I'm going to put it on my production machine immediately.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.400]   You're not listening when you're not interested.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:39.480]   Well, it's interesting for me because I've got basically two data points on both on either
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:45.680]   end because I know somebody who is currently using the development build on their production
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.640]   machine and has been using it for a few weeks and says that it's been rock solid.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:54.280]   I've got Andy, I mean, and I perfectly, I completely respect Andy's opinion.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:57.160]   It seems like your mileage is going to vary.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:01.920]   So I'm obviously going to do a complete backup before I do it, but I'm going to go ahead.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:06.920]   Don't use time machine to back it up.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:09.400]   I'm going to install it first, but then use time machine to back it up.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.400]   That'll work.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.040]   Scott Borne, I know you're going to install it immediately, aren't you?
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:16.440]   No, actually, I'm not going to install it ever.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:19.240]   I'm going to wait until I buy new computers that it comes on.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.240]   Oh, interesting.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.240]   And then I will have it.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:26.120]   Because I don't ever, you know, I've been around this rodeo too long.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:28.640]   I don't ever have very good luck with these kinds of things.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:33.640]   I mean, Tiger works perfectly well.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:36.640]   There's nothing wrong with Tiger.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:40.640]   No, but when it first came out, when you try to migrate to the new OS, there's always
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:41.640]   problems.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.640]   And for us, in the studio environment, it just can create disaster.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:45.640]   You don't want to mess with that.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:49.640]   I mean, because, you know, the audio software is never updated, you know, in time with
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:50.640]   the OS.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.640]   So you always have to wait for, you know, the patches.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:55.640]   So we're just going to wait until we buy new computers.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:59.280]   But you need it now, if that changes, then of course, what we'll do is we'll throw it
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.840]   on one of the old iMacs and see if it goes nuclear.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.800]   And if it doesn't, we'll move along.
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:09.240]   I really think one of the major drivers for people upgrading to Leopard is going to be
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:14.520]   when all these awesome new apps start showing up that take advantage of Leopard technologies.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:18.040]   And people start to have that sort of envy saying, gee, how come my word processor doesn't
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.280]   look as cool and as neat and as slick as that?
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:25.600]   I've also already seen a lot of shareware updates already for Leopard compatibility.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:29.640]   So yeah, I mean, there's so many major apps that you just see this little flag saying,
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:31.720]   yeah, we have something ready for Leopard.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:34.920]   We can't release it until Leopard is off, but baby.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:36.920]   Bye bye.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:41.320]   You know, I hear I heed your warnings and I know I shouldn't install it, but I'm going
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:44.560]   to anyway, because I just I love the new thing, right?
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:47.680]   And I'm just going to probably put it on everything.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.600]   If let's put it this way, Mac break weekly doesn't come out to next Thursday, you'll
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:51.600]   know why.
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:57.080]   Well, remember that as an as an audience, we are the people who had the Mac 128 and we're
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:01.680]   willing to have a hard limit of eight pages per document at Mac right and have to swap
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.680]   disks 20 times with every save.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.200]   We're used to this sort of thing.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.200]   You haven't.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:11.040]   I think we've trained we've trained Apple very, very poorly to ship products that don't
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.040]   annoy us.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.040]   That's a good point.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:18.480]   But and you know, this interesting, I don't know who chicken and egg who came first on
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.800]   this particular topic.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:24.960]   But you know, if you read Guy Kawasaki's stuff lately, he has a mantra.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.400]   It's okay to ship crap.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.400]   Really?
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.400]   That's that's a change.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.560]   He says that over and over and over.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.560]   It's okay to ship crap.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.560]   You can fix it later.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:36.880]   And I don't know if that started when he was at Apple or if that's something you picked
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:41.560]   up since, but I think Apple's potentially listening on this one.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:45.440]   That is the new 2.0 way of doing things, which is you put out a prototype and you let the
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.160]   market tell you which way to go.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:52.500]   So long as the crap has a drop shadow and a glossy thing lighting effect in the top right
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.840]   left corner, you can ship it.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:56.000]   I will love it.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   I love it.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   Look at this drop shadow.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.680]   All right, let's get to our.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:05.280]   Say again, can you smell the Ajax coming off of this thing?
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:06.280]   That new application.
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.840]   No, it's happened.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:08.840]   Smelly Ajax.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:13.160]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to give you our Mac picks of the week starting
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:15.160]   this week with the Macalope.
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.160]   You got a.
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:18.160]   Busy sync.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.160]   Busy sync.
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.160]   Can we do busy sync?
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.160]   I don't even know busy sync.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.160]   What is busy?
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.160]   Oh, good.
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.160]   And that would that's close enough.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.160]   That's close enough to it.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.160]   I don't remember that I'll keep going.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.160]   Busy sync.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:34.480]   I actually saw this on John Gruber's blog during Fireball and it is a it's a control panel
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.320]   which you can install our system preferences.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:42.400]   I guess they're called now that you install on your Mac and it basically makes a little
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:46.520]   ICal server for your home network.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:52.880]   So instead of having to go out and buy OS 10 server, you can run this control panel and
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:58:00.400]   share your calendars throughout your network from one of your regular, you know, not.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:03.000]   Would it be a value to somebody who's not working with other people?
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.400]   It's really for sharing with other people.
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.560]   It's for sharing with other people.
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:10.440]   So I mean, you know, you know, like a small business or a home environment where you want
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:14.360]   everybody everybody wants to have the same calendar so they can plan family events or
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:17.920]   they can plan presentations or whatever it is.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:23.320]   You can do it all through one set of calendars on the server.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:27.080]   I frankly, I frankly have not installed it yet because I'm going to be getting a new
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:30.440]   Mac near future and I want to install it on that one.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.200]   So I'm waiting for that.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:36.200]   So the Mac loop works with others.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.800]   Well everybody works with others.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:38.800]   Not I.
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:42.400]   You're working with us right now.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.920]   No, but I don't tell you what I'm doing on my calendar.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.280]   Not working with us.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.280]   We're working for him.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.280]   Let's get that straight.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.280]   Yeah, man.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:51.280]   That's a good point.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.960]   You don't know what I'm doing in five minutes and I'm not playing and I'm telling you.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.320]   No, I actually looked at it.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:59:00.760]   John Foster put a link to this in the Mac break weekly ideas and I did take a look at it thinking
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:02.320]   but it looks so cool.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.960]   But I thought, but who do I want to share my calendar with?
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:07.640]   Well, don't you want to see your calendar at home?
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:12.200]   Does it work only on a LAN or will it work over the internet as well?
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:18.840]   See I do in fact put use.Mac to put my iCal on every one of our computers and my wife frankly
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:22.600]   got annoyed after a while because she kept getting pop-ups saying it's time to go to
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:23.600]   work.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.600]   It's time to know.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.520]   She finally said, can you get your calendar off my machine please?
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:28.600]   So I don't know.
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:31.880]   Well this uses Bon Jour.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:32.880]   Yes.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:33.880]   It works over the LAN.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.400]   It sounds like it's LAN specific.
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:36.400]   I believe it's LAN specific.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:40.000]   You want your calendar going out over the internet?
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   Oh well.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.080]   If you go to googlecalorbox.net you can see my calendar too.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:50.280]   BusyMac.com b-u-s-y-m-i-c.com for the Busy Sync which is cool.
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.280]   The thing right I'm looking forward to getting it installed.
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.840]   Yeah looks very cool.
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.440]   Mr. Scott Born.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:58.440]   By the way BusyMac is what 19 bucks?
[00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.440]   20 bucks.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.440]   20 bucks.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.440]   So that's I don't know.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.440]   Somebody do the math.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.240]   That's one 17th of an Alex or something.
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.240]   Scott Born are you there?
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.240]   What is an Alex?
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.080]   Alex is 700 bucks.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.080]   700.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:17.680]   So I'm going to open my, by the way does leopard have an improved calculator?
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:20.680]   Probably the same damn calculator since OS 7.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.160]   You get an iPhone for that.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:24.160]   You know what?
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.960]   Yeah they at least have shadows on their buttons.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:32.800]   I wonder if they maybe they'll bring back the puzzle app or scrapbook.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.240]   It's got to be new because the current one is brush metal.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.360]   So it can't be brushed metal.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.360]   That's right.
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.840]   We dropped all brush metal.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.840]   Yep.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.840]   Pretty much.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.840]   Yeah that was an ugly look.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.840]   It is a 35th of an Alex.
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.840]   There we go.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.560]   We're going to go kind of the other way on my pick.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.560]   Okay Scott Born.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.520]   We're going to go 12 Alex's.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:55.160]   Holy, holy, I don't think we've ever gone that high.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.360]   I think this is our top ever most expensive pick but when you hear it you'll understand
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.360]   why.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.760]   It better be a BMW or a motorcycle.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:03.760]   It's close.
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.680]   It's the BMW of cameras.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.200]   The Canon EOS 1D Mark 3.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.200]   You got the Mark 3?
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.200]   I'm so jealous.
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.000]   Well, nobody's actually got it.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.800]   I've seen I got to play with it at PhotoPlus and get pictures from it and I've got one
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:26.320]   on order from my good friend Gary Farber at the camera store there in Boston.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.960]   He takes care of me.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:28.960]   And I'm on the list.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:34.760]   Now this is a $9,000 camera body that 100 people have already put in orders on sight
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.760]   unseen.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.760]   That's how cool this is.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.760]   What's going to make this better than the 5D say or the Mark 1?
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.600]   Oh, I'm so glad you asked.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.600]   20.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.760]   Doesn't see through the outer layer of clothing and the underwear or just the outer layer
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.760]   of clothes.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.760]   Because I've been burned like that before.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.920]   When you want point one megapixels my friend.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.920]   Holy cow.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.960]   That's more than the eye can see.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.400]   To the black hat and the white hat at that resolution.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.040]   I'm sure by now that's sort of resolution.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.000]   And it's a full frame camera.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   It's not.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.240]   It's point and five frames a second 56 JPEG buffer 12 raw.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.680]   Now it has two count of two digics processors in there.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:14.840]   Most of the Canon cameras only have one and that's important because that's how that's
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.240]   how the data gets processed through it and converted.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:23.120]   It uses the 14 bit engine instead of the 12 bit engine.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.280]   And you know it's just beefed up all the way around it's waterproof.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:30.640]   It's got a 300,000 cycle rated shutter.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:37.240]   It really competes with a $39,000 hassle-blad H3 digital camera which is why I'm getting
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:42.400]   it because it's actually got picture quality that matches a camera that costs a lot more.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.360]   And if you're if you're someone who takes pro level pictures which I do it's a camera
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:50.960]   that absolutely has to interest you and I just couldn't stand on.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:58.920]   So if it has a full frame CMOS and it is 21 megapixels is it still a 35 millimeter
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.920]   a CMOS?
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.920]   Yeah, it's a 35 millimeter.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.600]   You just packed all those pixels into that 35 millimeter.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:09.000]   And it's very important that people understand not all megapixels are created equal.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.200]   The size of the megapixels, the receptor area on the pixels is important.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.800]   The quality everything is this is the top quality product and I've seen images from
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.800]   this thing.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:24.440]   It's just frankly, it's better than medium format quality.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.720]   It's like you know somebody got a view camera and threw a black hood over their head and
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.880]   it's just a truly stunning piece of gear.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:34.240]   Now here's kind of interesting aside for those photo geeks out there.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:40.600]   The only lenses you can use on this camera and get really good results are Canon's L series
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:41.600]   lenses.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.600]   That's all I buy.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.600]   Thanks to you.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:51.120]   So, I'm being, now get this, the sensors ability to resolve horizontal line pairs is greater
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.760]   than 90% of the lenses sold.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.160]   Oh man.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.960]   Well, that's good.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.360]   I'm glad I stuck with the L lenses then.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.360]   Wow.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.360]   Because someday I aspire.
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:06.160]   So Scott, next week are you buying like a YouTube spy plane so you can really see
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.160]   the camera.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.160]   It seems like that's like you would buy.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.160]   You could read that newspaper.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.160]   Yeah, you got to get the motor out of your picture.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.160]   I don't know.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.640]   You see, those are cold water lines going to the reactor course.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.640]   This is not weapons grade plutonium.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.640]   It's fine.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:22.880]   No, actually I'm taking this puppy up to Alaska next year to go to Denali and my natural
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:23.880]   park.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:27.680]   I'm going to be over a cat my do in the bears, keen I fjords national park in Denali even
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:31.880]   go to Rand Jells and get dropped off by a helicopter on top of one of them big old Ashburger.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.240]   Yeah, get there before they melt.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.240]   That's great.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.880]   And you'll have pictures to prove it.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.760]   I'm just going to start hating you now.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.480]   Post as soon as you get the back post some images.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.480]   I'd love to.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.440]   My friend who has a leaf 22 megapixel leaf back that just blows my mind.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.640]   I mean the rest of the.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.640]   And compare the price of that thing to me.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.640]   Oh yeah.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.240]   I was a camera body and it's still 22 megapixels.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.240]   It's awesome.
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.240]   Yeah, I can't wait to see it.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:54.240]   This really is.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.240]   I'm serious.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.240]   The reason this is my pick.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:59.040]   I mean if you're not a photo buff you're just going to completely ignore this part of
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.480]   the show but this is a sea change.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:05.120]   When you can get this kind of quality at this price point this will be one of these things
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:08.280]   where like three or four years from now you're buying this camera for two thousand.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.600]   Well and that's why people should pay attention to the lenses they're getting now because
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:15.080]   you're going to get a new body sooner than you get new lenses I guess.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:19.560]   So yeah that was at least my explanation of my wife why we bought a thirteen hundred
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.280]   dollar lens.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.280]   Which one was that?
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.480]   The 50 millimeter 1.2.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.840]   Oh that's so sweet lens.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.240]   It has a very good bokeh.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.240]   It's bokeh's beautiful baby.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.480]   Actually that's why I got it.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.840]   I was listening to you and your bokeh.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:35.840]   Yes.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.120]   Keep your bokeh shut from now on.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.960]   Maybe not going bokeh.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.880]   Andy and Naco your Mac pick of the week.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:48.640]   I just want to say before we move on that see I'm single so my option was to spend $160
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:53.360]   for the F1.8 and use the rest of that money for modeling fees.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.680]   I'm getting much better pictures of probably F1.2.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.520]   I'll show them to you sometime.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.160]   If your wife will let you see them.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.160]   I don't think so.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.160]   Whoa modeling.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:07.560]   That may be the best line in Mac racing.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.880]   I'm going to write that down.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:10.760]   Don't forget to budget for the modeling fees.
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.840]   The best use of an Alex.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.800]   One Alex probably.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:19.200]   We started out with a horny Macelope and we ended up with models and these back through.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.200]   I don't know.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.520]   Okay my Mac pick of the week.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:28.440]   Actually we sort of like how to recurring theme about how you're kind of hosed if you
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:31.360]   don't have lots of storage set aside.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.680]   For leopard you need an external drive to really take advantage of time machine.
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.840]   If you want to buy the sort of camera where as long as you aim the camera at the correct
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.680]   side of the planet you can crop it down to a picture of anybody who was on that side
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.320]   of the planet.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:48.400]   I'm guessing those take really big picture files.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:53.560]   So over the past like nine or ten months I have bought like three or four new pocket
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:58.560]   drives because I keep filling them up both with all the pictures I'm taking with my Nikon
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:04.640]   both with the need for to add more storage to my notebook and for the need to have a
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:05.920]   time machine backup.
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:11.080]   And it seems like every time I go to buy another one I wind up buying the same drive.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.800]   It's made by Simple Tech.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:21.120]   It is their portable hard drive creatively very creatively named and it's designed it's
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:26.040]   very very distinctive because it's they this has peanut farena on the side of it.
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:29.160]   It was designed by the same people who designed the Ferrari bodies.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.440]   That's what they really want you to know in all the press releases.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:38.240]   But the key is that it's nice and small it's less than this it's a little bit larger.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:43.680]   It's about the same footprint as an iPhone is a little bit wider and a little bit thicker.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.880]   It's small it's cheap.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:50.640]   You can buy the 160 gigabyte model for 110 the 250 gigabyte model will set you back only
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.520]   about 40 or 50 dollars more.
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:56.240]   They're beautiful too by the way I have played with them and they're just gorgeous.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:00.840]   Yeah and it's not just that they're beautiful they're also functionally beautiful because
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:05.320]   again companies will loan me pocket drives today and I travel with a lot of them.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:10.400]   And oddly enough it's sort of like a rounded off wedge shape that I find is very very easy
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:15.000]   to fit into pouches and also it's shaped they're like little dented curves in the top
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.440]   of it so it's very very easy to get it out again.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:22.000]   You don't need an external power supply you do need to have to if you don't want to run
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.320]   it off of external power you do need to have two USB ports free to suck enough power to
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:28.560]   get it running.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:32.640]   Just little touches like that and in addition to that it's available in different colors
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.520]   which is sort which in computer technology saying that a case is available in different
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:40.800]   colors is a lot like going to college leadership and saying oh look all the cup holders this
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.280]   model has.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:46.480]   But considering how you're going to be using pocket hard drives the red one is for my
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:52.600]   backups the blue one is for photos the gray one is just basically your date my big dump
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:57.960]   data drive so I'm never grabbing the wrong one for what I need I've never left the house
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:02.560]   for a five day business trip and found that oh good I was hoping I'd have 40 gigabytes
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:06.000]   worth of book files but it looks like that I have all the pictures I took in the past
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   four months.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.360]   Yay Andy you're not an idiot.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:14.200]   Anyway so but and the key is that I've had a lot of these pocket drives that they work
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:18.520]   great for a couple months and then they suddenly decide that they're done with you.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:22.200]   These ones have been kicking around all my travels for the past the first one I got was
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:25.920]   a loaner and that was like eight months ago and by the time I sent it back it was still
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:29.680]   six months old and still working just great it looked like hell but it still was working
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:34.720]   great and so it's cheap it's durable it's pretty it works great so simple tech portable
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:39.200]   hard drives are my usual go to whenever I burn through some more data.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.200]   Simple tech with a TECH.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:48.480]   TECH would be look for the capitalized T in the middle it's that stands for tectonics
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:49.480]   something.
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:52.240]   T stands for tech.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:59.040]   On my pick the T stands for tasks it's another to do list but it's from my I want to say
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.560]   good friend because I've used his software for a long time.
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:07.320]   Jesse Gross-Gene of a Hog Bay software he sold off Moray which was a I thought a great little
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.000]   and notebook application.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.960]   He has two products still in his product line and the right room is one it's a distraction
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:19.440]   free writing if you'd like the idea of writing on a green screen or green text on a black
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.040]   screen you'll love right room.
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:25.320]   I don't use right room but I do use task paper he just sent me a this just came out he just
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:30.720]   sent me a copy of it and I really liking it is I'm channeling Merlin man here still looking
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:36.080]   for the perfect getting things done application this one is very simple it's a to do list that
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:42.880]   supports projects and context so if you're a GTD guy you'll understand or gal you understand
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:46.720]   those are kind of necessities for it.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:54.560]   Scripting is all of Jesse's stuff does keyboarding of course and you can search through the
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:00.560]   list because it saves him out his plain text you can tag it which makes it very handy for
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.760]   searching.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:09.280]   It actually even supports a text mate and and vi if you use vi so it's a it's kind of
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:17.240]   a neat simple to do list not free it's $19 but as as with all of his stuff I it's just
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:23.600]   going to get better with time and it's already quite good it's got tabbed in your face.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.600]   I just like this now I'm looking for the capabilities sink and I'm looking for a few other things
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.560]   that the apple scripting probably make that possible and I'm sure Jesse will include that
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:36.080]   in time but a neat little programming download and try it for free from hog based software
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:43.440]   dot com it's called task paper a very simple but I think pretty effective to do list to
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:48.240]   get things done and that is I don't know how many one 70th of an Alex or something like
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.240]   that.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.600]   No I'm sorry it's a 35th of an Alex as well.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:57.200]   It is I've done that calculation before my calculator I'm going to miss the brushed metal
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:02.440]   is it just going to be like a window what it makes one are you are you looking are you
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:06.920]   looking at leopard right now Andy what is the what is the calculator look like now.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:11.800]   I actually believe it I have the leopard machine quarantine work it's bad but I cannot
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:16.240]   spread to the count on well that's the first thing I'm going to do when I get to apple I'm
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.680]   going to say where's the calculator I want to see the calculator believe it or not I
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:24.920]   have not I have no distinct memories of using the calculator I think I think the last time
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:29.200]   I looked at it was your basic you know it doesn't want a window you don't you don't have to
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:34.720]   multiply by you don't divide by minus one in order to get a matrix man but can it can
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:38.680]   it speak results that's the question and that's the that's speeches everywhere I'll tell you
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:43.680]   I'll I'll break this news here leopard has I think my favorite feature of all of the
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:50.840]   leopard is related to speech it pronounces my last name correctly in a oh I got I got
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:57.240]   I got an email back in March or April from someone at apple say could you send us a recording
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:01.400]   of how you're doing we want to make sure that it says it correct I'm going to be heard
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:07.880]   if it says la porti yeah my dad my dad my dad my coffee be angry well no because remember
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:13.480]   that it pronounces it the way that I pronounce it my I pronounce it and not go oh dad pronounces
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:17.560]   it and that go oh other other members of the family from other parts of the country but
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:22.200]   they their opinions don't matter because now we set this and now it's 10 million computers
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:27.480]   all like oh two or three dozen people I think my my army of machines can beat them all that's
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:32.440]   a huge honor Andy do I wonder if they asked other Mac pundits how to pronounce their names
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:38.960]   it's not me Mac allo they didn't ask me what it sounded like they did send it to me to let
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:47.040]   me know what it would sound like and it's borny no just Barney Scott Barney don't like
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:51.400]   money to me Scott the voices the voices are supposed to be much better though yes they're
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:57.560]   awesome the new voice Alex you will be a little bit put off by how good it is now there's still
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:02.960]   places where you could you could sort it might stumble a little bit but I mean hi this is
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:09.000]   Alex the new professional voice with with Mac OS leopard I would like to come in for you
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.240]   oh boy we're also with you know even the best ones like in tiger our Mac and talk pro English
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:23.360]   me well that's exciting something to look forward to good speech so important I mean
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:27.440]   hopefully we'll see it in a lot of more stuff I mean I'd speech is something I use a lot
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:31.400]   of me I wind up burning a lot of documents to speech so I can listen to them in the car
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:36.040]   and just basically burn me a book on tape what it's to it and so with this I mean it's
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:39.840]   a like a four step automator thing there's a there's a whole chapter in it in my iPhone
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:44.560]   book because I you this is just something I use so often but and the difference between
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:50.880]   using it using you know Victoria and Alex is you know you know I'm single so yes I like
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:56.120]   having Victoria be alone for an hour and a half but Alex is good enough to see what
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:01.920]   she's saying I'm gonna say what what is Victoria charge for modeling oh do me big boy
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:07.320]   well all right for the rest of the Alex is going this is our last post a last tiger
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:16.000]   Mac break weekly thanks to everybody for being here to the mac-a-lo at zeta is at blogs.cnet.com/mac-a-lo
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.960]   thank you so much for being here we'll talk again soon I hope my pleasure to Scott born
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:26.160]   at the Apple phone show.com girls gone geek.tv and are you gonna do a leopard podcast you
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:32.680]   might well we I don't know right now we're working on we got a podcast for an independent
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.640]   movie we're involved with around June we want everybody to check out our pound down June.com
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:41.920]   you can cut the trailer and win an iPhone around June.com that's very cool it stars the
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:49.280]   movie features the girl from the new ABC hit series dirty sexy money. I like the name anyway
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:54.920]   yeah and Scott and I will be along with Alex and a number of other famous types at blog
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.880]   world coming up next month the member eighth and ninth in Las Vegas come out and see us
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:04.000]   at the Hilton at the convention center that should be fun and he and Akko is at the Chicago
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:12.480]   Sun times and his website www.cwob.com the yellow text colossal waste of bandwidth and
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:17.160]   I think we should say farewell to a tiger and give it one last chance to wrap up the
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:21.200]   show tiger hit it another mac break is broke.
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.960]   Thank you everybody.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.560]   (upbeat music)
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:28.140]   (upbeat music)
