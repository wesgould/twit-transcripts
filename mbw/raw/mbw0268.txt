[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.600]   Hey, everyone.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.120]   Welcome back to Macbreak Weekly.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.360]   This is Alex, sitting in for Leo, who was on vacation this week.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.760]   And we have an excellent crew, as usual.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.400]   Jason Snell from Macworld.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.400]   Hey, Jason.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.200]   Hey, Alex.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.600]   Adam Inks from Tidbits.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.160]   Hey, Adam.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.480]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.400]   And of course, Andy Inatko from the Chicago Sun
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.440]   Times in the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.940]   Hey.
[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.600]   Hey, dude.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.520]   Hey.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.680]   So before we get started here, one of the things
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.320]   I want to set people up for is that we're experimenting
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.240]   with something for the show.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.640]   And this experiment is already running full tilt.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.360]   We started before the show started.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.880]   And if you go to pixacore.force.com/pixacore,
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.880]   I know that's confusing.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.880]   And I just couldn't fix the URL before the show.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.880]   So pixacore.force.com/pixacore.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.880]   You can log in here.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.160]   You can create your own login.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.240]   Anything that looks like an email is going to get you in.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.360]   You just got to make an password.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.400]   Use your own name if you can, because it helps us when
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.960]   we answer the question.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.920]   And what you can do here is ask questions
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.480]   that we're going to use in the show, as well as vote them up
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.040]   or down.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.840]   So you can vote-- it's basically like dig, except in real time
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.760]   for questions on the show.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.040]   I just thought, we use this a lot in some of the pixacore
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.540]   streams.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.280]   And I thought I would use it on a larger platform
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.200]   being here at Macbreak.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.600]   So hopefully, you guys will play along with us.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.200]   And so far, a lot of people have,
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.680]   because there's already a lot of response.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.920]   So we'll start at the top soon.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.520]   And we're not going to jump to that one immediately.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.640]   We've got a couple of things we're
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.160]   going to talk about.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.080]   But then we're going to be coming back
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.640]   to some of these questions throughout the show.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.000]   So stay tuned for that.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.320]   All right, so coming up, of course,
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.360]   the top piece of news is Steve Jobs, of course,
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.200]   passing last week between the last show.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.320]   Now, we've talked about it a fair bit on the show.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.760]   There was some Twitch special pieces.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.400]   And I'm sure that a lot of people have seen it.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.560]   But I do think it's important for us to talk about it
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.640]   a little bit.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.120]   One of the things that I think is really interesting
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.280]   is I think everyone seems to be talking about this.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.960]   Why are we so sad about this?
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.720]   Because I know that I have been.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.840]   For some reason, I've been listening to American Pie by Don
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.240]   McLean for the last week.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.240]   And it's just feeling really--
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.120]   it really does feel like the end of something.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.040]   And it's kind of hard for me to put my finger on Andy.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.920]   Why do so many people don't know him
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.360]   feel so sad with the passing of Steve?
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.760]   I think that anything that ties so deeply into your childhood
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.160]   will have a really powerful mojo on you until the day you die.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.280]   Whether it's a style of car, whether it's a movie,
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.080]   a piece of music, even a computer.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.240]   And when you have someone like Steve Jobs, who's
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.840]   in that very, very short list of geeks who, even back
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.280]   in the '80s, were famous geeks.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.880]   People who you sort of imagine as not absolutely
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.880]   not as a surrogate father, but at least as.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.160]   Well, here's what you could be like in 10 or 15 years.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.280]   Yes, you're a nerdy, geeky kid who spends most of your time
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.440]   reading books and most of your time building things
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.280]   as opposed to trying to get a spheroid or oblate spheroid
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.040]   across some sort of chalk mark on some sort of piece of real
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.040]   estate.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.560]   That's good for you if you like that.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.320]   But those of us who basically knew
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.200]   what the smell of solder, flux, and overcooked circuits
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.920]   were at the age 11 thought that, you know what?
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.800]   It would be really cool to be--
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.200]   if we lived to be 27 and have the sort of achievements
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.120]   that Steve Jobs has made.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.800]   So when that sort of element is gone, it sort of reminds you.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.160]   This guy who in some way has represented you 10 years from now,
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.840]   he's gone now.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.440]   And so now there's a certain lack of steering focus,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.040]   even if it's a very, very tiny one.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   Again, I don't think anybody rational
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.960]   was pattering their lives against following Steve Jobs
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.560]   and trying to, oh, what would Steve do in this situation?
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.960]   But nonetheless, of all the different things,
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.120]   the stars that you navigate by, now one of those
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.280]   is not there anymore.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.560]   And that's a little bit--
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.840]   takes a bit of getting used to, I think.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.800]   And Jason, didn't he seem like he was the cool kid in school?
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.520]   Like, he was the kid that you were trying to fall.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.240]   You always wanted to dress like him and be like him.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.760]   Yeah, I'm not sure I go for the--
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.880]   he was a geek like us thing.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.560]   I think he was cooler than that.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.240]   But I think this has a lot to do with the products
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.760]   that Steve Jobs helped bring into being with Apple.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.520]   Are products that people feel an emotional attachment to?
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.680]   If it's the Mac, people made a choice to use the Mac
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.040]   and to be using a computer that wasn't the PC
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.920]   everybody was using.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.840]   And more recently, people feel really attached to the iPod
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.160]   and iPhone and iPad.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.680]   And he was seen as the person who ushered these products
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.520]   into the world.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.680]   It was his company.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.440]   We can argue about how much of that is him.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.360]   There's a lot of myth making.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.480]   It's not like he was soldering things in his garage
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.480]   and then bringing them out.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.280]   But the fact is, he was the guy who brought them to us,
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.800]   who introduced them, who got us excited about them.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.320]   And I think that some aspect of this
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.720]   is its selfishness in a good way.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.920]   I think we all feel like the world's a poorer place.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.640]   And without Steve Jobs in it.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.880]   And we're all a little worried about the fact
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.600]   that he brought us all this great stuff.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.880]   And now he's gone.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.960]   So what happens next?
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.480]   And I think that's all understandable.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.600]   I think any time you see somebody who seems like it,
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.160]   they're so talented and they've created things
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.440]   that have had an impact on your life.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.560]   Even if you didn't know them personally,
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.520]   it's an absolutely natural reaction
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.240]   to look at their passing and say, boy,
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.320]   it's not going to be like it was ever again.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.480]   - And I think that even though he wasn't writing the code,
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.480]   even though he wasn't soldering the boards together,
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.280]   obviously what he brought, that clear vision
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.720]   of what makes a difference and what doesn't make a difference
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.880]   and what needs to be removed,
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.920]   made just such a massive impact.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.320]   Adam, where do you think the tech world would be without him?
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.760]   I mean, what would have happened?
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.600]   I know it was a big question, but I mean.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.000]   - There's a taste of Steve Jobs?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.320]   - It feels like we'd still be writing code.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.640]   - Well, I do think there's a lot to that.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.040]   And one of the things that we looked into
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.800]   with Tibbets in our special issue last night
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.120]   was just what would have happened
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.520]   if we hadn't had Steve Jobs
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.960]   pushing the personal computer very early on?
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   Because you had a bunch of really kind of weird stuff.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.280]   You had the Commodore, you had the TRS-80, stuff like that.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.000]   - It's not like you created some of that too.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.480]   I mean, Xerox had the idea of graphical interface.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.200]   - Oh yeah, but he's the one who really turned it
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.400]   into something that people wanted
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.640]   and that made it into a market.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.840]   And you can't even just eliminate the fact
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.640]   that that's in large part why IBM started
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.360]   the Skunk Works Project to do the IBM PC.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.000]   So if you take Steve Jobs out of the picture,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.240]   I think you're talking a very, very different
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.200]   personal computer world if in fact you even get one.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.040]   And as the guy who wrote the article pointed out,
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.720]   Tim Berners-Lee essentially invented
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.040]   the World Wide Web on a next machine.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.640]   So there's a whole, it's one of those parallel universe things
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.760]   that what if could be very, very strange without Steve Jobs?
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.360]   - There could be a very good short film there somewhere.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.440]   The world without Steve Jobs.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.160]   It's very, sometimes I wish that Steve Jobs
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.800]   had never been born in the deep future.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.880]   - No, Steve Jobs come back.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.320]   - Yeah, it's a wonderful life without,
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.320]   I was thinking more about the most
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.040]   amazing films where they say, well,
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.880]   - Well, it took a very sick outside.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.200]   - Now, Andy, how long do you think Apple
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.600]   can continue his trajectory?
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.320]   Like in the same vein or do you think
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.920]   they're gonna start pivoting quickly?
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.760]   Is it gonna be something that that trajectory
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.440]   is just gonna continue to go out for some period of time?
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.240]   - Well, it's, I think everybody pretty much knows
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.600]   that the strategy's been mapped out for several,
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.880]   a few years in advance at least.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.520]   So it's not as though they keep Apple's
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.520]   the least reactive company in the world.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.120]   They just keep looking four or five years out.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.120]   But I really hope that they are no longer
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.320]   following Steve Jobs's map or template
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.760]   three years from now because remember
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.440]   that he himself was looking four or five years
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.080]   in the future and now he has stopped
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.400]   looking into the future because he can't really see
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.480]   what's coming in his current state, unfortunately.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.640]   So I would like to think that by having a set of,
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.000]   a roadmap for how to think and how to plan
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.200]   and how to run the company and also a roadmap
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.160]   for what the company is by its very nature,
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160]   we'll start to see some shifts, shifts
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.960]   in the next couple of years when a new opportunity arrives
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.760]   for, be it a new manufacturing process
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.120]   or a new way of moving data from point A to point B
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.480]   or even just a new basic shift of noticing
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.320]   that the people in Starbucks who used to be using
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.760]   an iPad and an iPhone X of them are now using an iPhone
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.200]   and a laptop next to them.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.040]   What does that tell us about how people
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.480]   are using computers these days?
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.440]   And it's those things from a large scale stuff
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.440]   to the simple things of just noticing how people
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.160]   are holding a certain phone that will really shape Apple's
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.240]   destiny and eventually have much more of an impact
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.760]   than any plans that Steve might have made.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.760]   >> Well, I mean, Jason, is it how necessary
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.360]   is it for Apple to change the direction right now?
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.120]   I mean, the question is they built a new industry
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.520]   and it's now expanding very, very quickly.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.200]   I mean, I think we just saw the news this week
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   that 97% of all tablet traffic is the iPad.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.600]   Is it something that for at least the short
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.360]   and the next two or three years, they almost just have
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.480]   to not screw up.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.640]   It's kind of like one of those things where
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.680]   your football team is winning by 24 points
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.200]   in the end of the third quarter.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.600]   They just have to not throw any interceptions.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.960]   >> Right, well, I think there's an aspect to that, right?
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.280]   I've read out the clock of saying,
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.800]   how do we maximize the growth?
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.560]   How do we deal with the growth and expansion
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.480]   of our products that are ascendant?
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.240]   How do we deal with the products that are kind
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.720]   of coming down the other side?
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.480]   But if that's all you do, then you'll get yourself.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.320]   >> You're Microsoft.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.320]   >> You're not going to lose the game, but you'll lose.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.760]   You won't even make the playoffs
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.080]   because to extend this metaphor way beyond it's due.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.280]   But yeah, I think the key for Apple is to use
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.360]   the Steve Jobs playbook in terms of how do we do what we do?
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.880]   How do we find new products?
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.000]   How do we make judgments?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.840]   How does everybody here make decisions about what's next?
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.760]   What they need to not do is sort of slavishly say,
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.800]   well, Steve liked this thing, so let's do that
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.800]   because Steve liked it.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.240]   Because at Tandy's point, the fact is,
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.440]   Steve's not around anymore.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.520]   He's gone, he can't make those judgments.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.360]   You know Steve Jobs wouldn't sit there and say,
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.640]   I pretty much believe what I believed five years ago,
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.800]   so let's just keep doing that.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.440]   He would continue to adapt.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.240]   So if they've done their jobs right,
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.960]   everybody's going to think,
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.320]   we're going to adapt like Steve.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.720]   We're going to always question
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.160]   where things are going like Steve.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.960]   And if they can do that, they're in much better shape.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.440]   I mean, they've had what, eight years of knowing
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.240]   that their leader had a pretty serious form of cancer
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.080]   and has spent, especially the last four years,
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.240]   he's been very sick.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.160]   Apple has gotten itself pretty well prepared
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.320]   for this period in its life,
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.080]   better than most companies, I think, do.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.640]   Whether they'll succeed or not, I don't know.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.760]   But for me, you know, you got to go with the playbook
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.560]   and that means always questioning,
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.400]   always asking those questions
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.120]   and being really critical about products
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.640]   like Steve would do, not just say what it's Steve like
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.480]   when he was here.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.320]   - And we also see that.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.680]   We see that culture in Pixar, you know,
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.320]   where the questioning is really what makes a lot of,
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.920]   what Pixar movies great, that everything is up for grabs.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.480]   Everything is constantly being attacked.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.320]   Everything is, you know, it's a, you know,
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.440]   this intense cauldron of creativity that's going on there.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.720]   So hopefully we'll see that now.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.600]   Now, Adam, you know, Tim Cook has taken over.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.280]   We saw a much different keynote
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.280]   than we've seen in the past
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.000]   where he's not doing a lot of the stuff himself.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.920]   He's handing that off.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.000]   How else do you see Apple changing under his leadership?
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.240]   - Well, again, in the near term, not a whole lot
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.200]   because Cook has really been in charge in a lot of ways
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.240]   for frankly quite a few years.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.160]   I mean, you know, as COO,
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.120]   he's been in charge of the day to day
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.800]   and certainly as interim CEO,
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.240]   whenever Steve took a medical of absence
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.560]   or, you know, when he's actually stepped down, you know,
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.240]   as a CEO in June, you know, Cook has been able to,
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.240]   as far as we can tell, just continue along the same game.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.280]   So I'm not seeing a whole lot changing.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.720]   Honestly, I don't know Tim Cook very well.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   He's been one of those people sort of behind the scenes
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.440]   at Apple who has,
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.440]   they've just always gotten the job done quietly.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.440]   And so I don't really know if he has a particular style
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.000]   that will become obvious over time
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.240]   that's radically different in terms
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.640]   of how the company will be run.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.800]   Do you think it's going to be a little stressful
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.640]   working in Apple?
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.040]   I mean, I know there's a lot of stories about it.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.640]   There was a story in one of the things we were looking at
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.000]   about photographers, you know, being used to be yelled at by Steve.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.120]   - Definitely not.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.240]   There's already one Tim Cook story,
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.280]   which is they were talking about a problem
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.920]   on the production line in China.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.160]   And he had this guy there who was working on it
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.160]   that they were talking this about.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.440]   And then like two minutes later,
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.600]   they're continuing to talk and Tim Cook looks at the guy
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.360]   and says, why are you still here?
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.320]   Go to China now.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.120]   I'm a guy like,
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.160]   a little hack that he drove to SFO,
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.480]   got on a plane, the next plane to China.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.320]   He had nothing.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.240]   - No luggage or nothing.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.160]   - So Tim Cook is an intense guy.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.200]   He's a really operations focused guy,
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.000]   hence the go to China and see what the heck
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.160]   is going on over there.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.680]   But, you know, he's an intense guy.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.320]   And I know that all the reports say that he and Jobs,
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.120]   one of the things that they really connected
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.240]   were Jobs interviewed him and was like, this is the guy.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.200]   This guy is great.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.520]   He is intense in, he's got different skills
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.520]   and different interests, but he's got that.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.480]   So I think Apple is going to be similarly managed in that way.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.480]   Why are you still here?
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.480]   - Yeah.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.320]   (laughing)
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.640]   - Yeah, so, and I think that it'll be really interesting
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.640]   to see, I mean, I think it seems like we won't really know
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.080]   until we see another large product launch.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.400]   You know, like until we see something significant
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.640]   that isn't just a continuation.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.520]   And it's hard to say, you know, what that next thing will be.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.800]   I mean, I still, I'm still holding out hope for,
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.720]   you know, for a TV.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.240]   - I wanna hold TV.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.080]   I don't want to-- - Come on,
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.480]   go all the way to a car.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.320]   I mean, we will-- - Yeah!
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.880]   - Yeah, you know, if Apple made a car,
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.280]   how many people here would buy an Apple?
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.120]   - Buy it.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:19.960]   - Buy a car, you know.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.480]   It'd be electric and it'd be round
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.680]   and you'd be able to use Siri in it
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.580]   and you'd just be going,
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.520]   "Car, take me to San Francisco."
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.640]   You know, and it would just, it would just drive you there.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.080]   You know, so, so the, so again, so we're gonna,
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:32.920]   we're gonna jump in.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.560]   So that's, we're gonna jump into talking a little bit.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.680]   We're gonna answer one of the questions
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.680]   that we have in our feedback loop.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.480]   Again, if you guys are just tuning in,
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.840]   you can go to pixacore.force.com/pixacore.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.320]   We'll put up a lower third here.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.600]   And you can vote on the questions.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.640]   And so you can decide which questions
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.600]   you want us to talk about next.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.960]   We're gonna just kind of insert these throughout the show.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.160]   This is kind of a bit of an experiment
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.920]   to see how well this goes.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.080]   The first question here we had from Kevin Morgan.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.200]   And he said, "Would love if you talked a little bit
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.240]   "about how to share iCloud between husband and wife,
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.720]   "for reminders, et cetera."
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.400]   Jason, do you have any insights on how you can use iCloud
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.440]   for this kind of stuff?
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.200]   - Yeah, and I think this question actually suggests
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.240]   something about where iCloud is and where it's going.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.080]   iCloud is not gonna sync everything with everyone.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.960]   I think when iCloud comes out of the gate,
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.200]   it's gonna sync very specific things like documents.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.000]   I think the whole family aspect is really unclear.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.600]   I think if you've got reminders and things like that--
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.280]   - It's never been clear.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.120]   - No, no, no, it really hasn't.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.560]   And I think that Apple's grappling with it.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.120]   I think that they will get to the point
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.200]   where there's stuff that's shared
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.160]   between different iTunes IDs.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.640]   But right now, if you wanna share reminders,
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.800]   I suppose you could have multiple phones with the same ID,
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.480]   but I think where Apple is really going
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.160]   is the concept that each individual human being
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.320]   has their own iCloud ID or Apple ID
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.240]   for the iCloud stuff, for their backup
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.560]   and things like that.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.160]   And then you can have a separate ID for things like purchases,
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.920]   media purchases and app purchases.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.320]   You can have two sort of IDs happening at the same time.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.360]   So if they go down that route,
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.280]   then what Apple's gonna say is your wife
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.640]   should probably have her own iCloud ID.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.800]   And so in the short term,
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.480]   if you wanna share reminders with your wife,
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.800]   I think there are third party apps
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.440]   that are probably a better that sync and let you,
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.720]   like my wife and I use a thing called Cozy,
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.720]   which is where we do all our groceries.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.120]   And she signed up for it and then signed me up
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.920]   as another person on the account and it's free.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.200]   And we just share our reminders
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.760]   in our grocery list that way.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.720]   So iCloud, a lot of this stuff is not gonna be there.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.680]   They're Apple's focusing on like find my iPhone,
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.240]   some documents in the cloud stuff,
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.400]   iTunes in the cloud and a backup for iOS devices.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.520]   It's a really limited set at least to start with.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:56.160]   It's not a complete picture of like every bit of data
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.240]   that you have is suddenly gonna sync
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.800]   and they really don't know to Adam's point
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.680]   what how they're gonna deal with this concept
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.200]   of many people who wanna share some things
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.240]   but not other things with other people.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.160]   I'm hopeful that something like find my friends
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.240]   is a suggestion that maybe they've figured out
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.560]   that that's important but it still doesn't resolve
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.320]   like one family has a single iTunes account
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.920]   for all of their app purchases.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.240]   - Well, it seems like you almost want it circles.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.440]   - Well, you know, sharing of some sort
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.280]   I think has to show up eventually.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.120]   Yeah, you're saying.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.920]   - But this is gonna be a typical Apple
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.000]   where they're gonna start small
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.800]   and then sort of expand the margins of the pond
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.680]   as they figure more things out.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.400]   There's obviously some things I cannot talk about
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.440]   regarding iCloud's functionality
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.840]   but I have been talking.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.680]   - Show off.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.040]   - No, no, it's just that there's a lot of vulgarity.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.680]   It's mostly a porn distribution.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.560]   - Oh, oh, oh, I see.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.560]   - No, it's, you get to this,
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.280]   you try to learn as much as you can
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.200]   and you try to prepare for the stuff you have to write
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.360]   and the stuff so you're gonna be educating other people on
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.200]   and the worst thing possible is when you reach
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.640]   the conclusion that a lot of this has not been figured
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.040]   out yet and it will basically be deployed over time
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.520]   as Apple and other people observe how people are using
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.760]   the service and then figure out the best features to add
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.800]   and also the best ways to implement them.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.720]   And that's the sort of conclusion that you draw
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.440]   that you realize you've got to double check,
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.920]   triple checking, good, triple check,
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.520]   'cause the easier truth is that no Andy,
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.760]   you just don't get it.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.720]   But yeah, I've been talking to the people behind
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.720]   some of the most popular Mac apps in the Mac App Store
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.640]   and they've been telling me,
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.320]   no, well, we've been doing mockups of what we might do
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.240]   in the future if Apple chooses to implement it this way.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.640]   And if iCloud goes in this other direction,
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.640]   we decided that we might want to do it like this.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.120]   But yeah, if you ask anybody for,
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.600]   well, can I, do you have a beta or an alpha you can share
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.040]   with me just so I can get a feel for how document sharing
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.640]   would happen between the desktop and a mobile device.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.360]   It's like, here's a JPEG.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.960]   - Well, and isn't the danger though?
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.080]   - Yeah, and isn't one of the dangers with Apple is that
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.960]   if you're a third party developer
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.600]   and you develop something that works really well,
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.400]   you know that you got to make the money at some soon
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.080]   because if it works really well
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.080]   and it integrates really well,
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.440]   there's a high probability Apple will just do it.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.280]   You know what I mean?
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.600]   You were seeing that with the postcards.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.440]   - And we sell reminders kind of,
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.400]   which is screenshots of which have been distributed
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.000]   freely online and pretty much well documented.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.040]   The reminders app kind of kneecaps a lot of the middle level
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.840]   people who are doing to do list managers
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.040]   and appointment managers because this is the sort of thing
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.880]   that integrates so well with iCloud
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.200]   and demonstrates a really well written iOS 5 app so well.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.120]   But I think for iCloud, it's more like the game really
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.840]   doesn't start for another few months yet.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.040]   We thought that a lot of us thought that when you flip
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.080]   the switch on iCloud, that's when you start to see
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.360]   a lot of things happening.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.520]   It's really going to be, okay, now we finally have
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.000]   the infrastructure where we can start to test out ideas
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   of where as before, all we had was a sketch pad,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.760]   a whiteboard and a whole roomful of people
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.320]   who would be floating question marks over their heads.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.080]   - Adam, do you think Apple already has a roadmap
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.960]   or do you think it's just really wait and see?
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.880]   - You know, it's really hard to tell.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.240]   Joe Kistel's working on our Take Control of iCloud book
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.760]   and he is tremendously frustrated right now
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.360]   because a whole lot of stuff simply doesn't work.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.520]   And this is supposed to ship tomorrow.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.680]   So you know what I mean, presumably there's going to be
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.520]   some changes since the last developer beta and whatnot,
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.520]   but he's like, I don't know how to document this
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.840]   because I can't get it to function.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.160]   And again, developers I've talked to have said
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.600]   basically the same thing, that whole chunks of it
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.880]   are still broken.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.040]   So, you know, there's a real question as to
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.280]   what's going to be on there on day one, functioning.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.480]   And I mean, I presume Apple has some ideas
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.840]   about where they want to go, but you know,
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.040]   a lot of the stuff seems relatively obvious
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.560]   and yet, you know, Apple does not accompany
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.800]   the ever telegraphs, their moves.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.800]   So, you know, until we actually see something happen,
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.600]   we're really not going to have much of a clue.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.880]   - All right, well, we'll see how that goes.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.440]   And once again, if you have any questions,
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.920]   go up to go to pixxcore.force.com/pixxcore
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.360]   to ask your questions.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.120]   And we aren't looking at the IRC, by the way,
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.440]   but it's just that it moves really, really fast.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.440]   And so this kind of slows things down and allows us
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.200]   to kind of see what people are asking.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.040]   So we are paying attention to that as well.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.840]   But before we go any further, we've got some,
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.840]   we've got a lot more in talking about the 4S, of course,
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.000]   which is shipping this week.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.960]   And before we get to that, we'd like to thank
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.120]   one of our sponsors, GoToMeeting.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.720]   Of course, GoToMeeting is something
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.920]   that I am very accustomed to at this point.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.280]   I use it at least a couple times a week
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.280]   for pixxcore meetings, for meetings with other clients.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.000]   And it's just such a great way to save a lot on jet fuel,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.960]   save, you know, reduce your carbon footprint
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.080]   and make sure that you actually stay in touch with everyone.
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.880]   Of course, you can be sharing your screens,
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.240]   you can be talking to folks.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.080]   It handles all of the voice over IP,
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.400]   so you don't have to sit there and make--
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.760]   everyone doesn't have to make phone calls.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.880]   They can simply-- and it sends reminders.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.360]   It gets everyone set up.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.320]   It's super easy to manage that process.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.240]   And now, one of the things to remember
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.720]   is that, of course, you think about it
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.960]   going from computer to computer,
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.480]   but one of the things in addition
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.440]   to being able to add video, which you can see here
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.880]   on the screen right now.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.200]   You can also use it with your Android and iPhone app.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.320]   There's an Android and iPhone app,
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.160]   so you can actually be on your Android or iPhone or iPad
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.560]   and actually take part in these meetings.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.960]   So you can be sitting in the cab, you can be, you know,
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.080]   sitting in the airport, you can easily just pull out
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.600]   whatever you need to to be part of this process.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.440]   And so it's just-- it's becoming easier and easier
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.440]   and easier to annotate stuff, to talk to people about stuff,
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.520]   to put all that stuff together.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.760]   And so it is-- I mean, go to meeting--
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.960]   it's one of those things that I was kind of resistant to
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.880]   for a little while when we first started.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.960]   I was like, this isn't the same.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.840]   But we use it so often now for so many different meetings
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.440]   that it's just-- it's a really, really powerful way
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.440]   to stay in touch with everyone.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.960]   And you can use it for product reviews, sales presentations,
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.280]   training sessions, just status reports.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.480]   I mean, all of that stuff can be done.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.880]   And you can do it with your desktop,
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.040]   or you can do it with your iPhone, iPad, or Android.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.120]   So if you want a 30-day free trial,
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.680]   you can go to go to meeting.com.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.360]   And you can go ahead and try it.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.840]   Just go to meeting.com if you want that free 30 days,
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.680]   use the offer code MAC break.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.840]   Should be simple enough.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.960]   And try it out for 30 days.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.960]   Call your friends, call your coworkers,
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.840]   and collect a couple meetings together.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.760]   I think you're really going to like it.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.080]   It's very addicting.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.240]   Once you start getting used to it, it's hard to give up.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.080]   And I've tried-- because we have a lot of different clients,
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.400]   we've tried them all.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.120]   We really tried all these different options.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.240]   And yeah, go to meeting is definitely the way to go.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.600]   So definitely check it out.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.240]   So of course, we have the--
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:01.200]   the hard part with the iPhone 4S was that people saw the keynote.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.840]   And they panned it.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.760]   They said that a lot of the pundits
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.120]   said that this is just not a very good update.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.760]   And I probably wasn't going to sell the way
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.840]   that we had seen iPhones sell in the past.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.200]   And Andy, as you can-- as the news came through,
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.960]   it looks like it was really just a complete failure.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.680]   It was just the iPhone 4S.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.920]   It's a lot, really.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.760]   So no, of course, they have sold a million the first day,
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.120]   $3 million over the weekend, I think, is the projection.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:36.840]   And I think that's pretty much as good as it gets
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.880]   for any product launch ever, Jason.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.400]   Yeah, well, I mean, it's up there.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.400]   And the people who said that this was going to be disappointing.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.280]   Come on, first off, the iPhone 4-- these
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.840]   are the people who say, oh, the iPhone 4, it's so old.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.040]   It's been out for 16 months.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.920]   There have been about a zillion Android phones release.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.520]   The iPhone 4 was still the best-selling phone in existence.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.600]   Month by month, it was the best-selling phone.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.800]   It keeps selling.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.400]   And now here comes the iPhone 4S.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.520]   What a disaster.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.960]   It looks the same on the outside and is faster, a lot faster,
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.720]   on the inside.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.200]   Plus has a new camera that's better.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.600]   And this crazy voice technology.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.600]   So it's the most popular phone in existence
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.280]   for the last 16 months with more stuff for the same price.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.800]   What a nightmare.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.480]   Yeah, well, also, it's weird to have these--
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.440]   I keep having these conversations with people.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.880]   As though it's expected that you're
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.160]   going to buy a brand new phone every single year.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.840]   And I'm the biggest nerd in almost any room.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.800]   And I don't want to buy a new phone every year.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.240]   I really like the features.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.600]   Actually, the feature that I want the most from the iPhone 4S
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.720]   is just the camera.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.840]   That is one-- looks like one kick butt camera,
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.840]   according to specs.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.000]   But really, there's a reason why there's a two-year contract.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.720]   You have a phone, you use it for two years, you drop it,
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.120]   you break it, you put it through the wash,
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.560]   you feed it to the dog.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.320]   At some point, you need a new phone.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.880]   And that's when you buy a new one.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.640]   But yeah, people--
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.880]   You're sampled this two-year cycle, right?
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.200]   It's because all the contracts are two years long anyway.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.400]   So you do the major phone revision.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.520]   And then a year later, you add an S on the end
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.880]   and make it faster.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.720]   And then you sell that.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.480]   And then every two years, you get a new one.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.120]   The people who are upgrading to this phone,
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.120]   it's mostly going to be people with a 3GS or maybe a 3G.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.640]   It's not the people who just bought an iPhone 4 six months
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.000]   ago.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.160]   Yeah, it's not the suckers that bought the iPhone 4.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.680]   Like, oh, wait, that would be me.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.520]   It's not your phone.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.160]   It's a great phone.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.560]   It's a great phone.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.520]   I bought the iPhone 4 because I had a 3GS for about a year
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.640]   and a half, two years.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.400]   And it was-- the difference in the camera
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.760]   between the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3 wasn't incremental.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.960]   It was revolutionary.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.760]   This is another incremental increase in camera quality.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.600]   And not enough to get me to pay--
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.720]   to go through all the rigmarole of taking my iPhone 4 back
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.320]   and pretending there aren't scratches in the side of it.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.280]   To sort of hopefully get that $200 credit
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.440]   that I can then apply on a brand new contract that'll
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.360]   put me two years in the future and put the iPhone 5
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.480]   with its 4G chip and its 8-inch display
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.480]   and its folding hover mode and all that sort of cool stuff.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.440]   And they were the retina projector.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.800]   I want the iPhone 5.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.720]   That's what I'm going to be spending the $200 for.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.880]   Adam, do you think that they just added just what they needed
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.800]   to get everyone to react to me?
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:18.480]   Was it just a matter of just a perfect incremental upgrade?
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.960]   Yeah, I think it was very, very well thought out.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.120]   And the camera is indeed one of the big things
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.040]   that people rely on with their cell phones at this point.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.640]   And making an 8 megapixel camera with all
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.840]   of the sort of under-the-hood improvements,
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.000]   I'm dying to see how well it works, too.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.800]   And the cycle, I think, makes sense.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.600]   And people connect.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.360]   What we've done is that my wife and I are a year set.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.160]   So we always get the latest phone, one of us.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:49.800]   And the other person gets to stick with the previous model
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.600]   for another year.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.600]   But it's not like we have it to see.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.440]   One-- and I think that's interesting.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.560]   What's interesting is because of some of the stuff that's
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.640]   tying all these pieces together-- and we'll talk about it
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.040]   a little bit later-- but because it's tying together--
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.480]   I mean, that seems to be the culture.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.480]   I know that's in my family.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.680]   That's the culture where basically I end up
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.240]   getting the newest one most of the time.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.880]   I say, it's my job, honey.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.160]   I'm on a show.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.240]   I have to know what these things are.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.280]   And so I usually get them.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:17.680]   And then--
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.120]   And then the whole thing passes down.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:24.040]   The whole thing-- someone ends up with the four.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.720]   I mean, I think my smallest kids will end up with my four
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.960]   because it turns out the 3GS does not work in the bathtub.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.880]   Just in case you're wondering.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.920]   It's just-- it doesn't recover.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.880]   So they tried it.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.440]   My four-year-old tried it.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.840]   And it's not that didn't work.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.840]   So it does seem like that is that kind of trickle down
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.640]   phone and ommix that Apple has created
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.240]   seems to be kind of the common story you hear in companies
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.720]   and in families.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.520]   Well, plus, you wanted to--
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.520]   you wanted to this trap where you're
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.240]   doing releases that are based mostly on style.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.640]   It's really hard for me to routinely review Android phones
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.360]   because what am I going to say?
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.640]   It's a 4G phone with a 4 inch screen.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.360]   And it runs Android 3.0.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.440]   And it has a camera.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.720]   And it also has a game on it that you can't remove.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.040]   And that's really the review of almost every single Android
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.560]   phone that comes along.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.600]   It's more important to simply--
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   it's more important for Apple to say
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.520]   that we're going to put in something important every single
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.320]   year, every other year apparently.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.000]   It's going to be super important.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.680]   But we're not going to simply say, and now we
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.960]   decided to move the button two millimeters
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.480]   to make sure you'd have to buy a new case and a new charger.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.280]   Well, it's part of the secret to Apple's success, though,
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.880]   the fact that they've kind of latched on
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.720]   to the type of consumer.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.120]   It's not just their product.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.080]   But they've latched on to the type of consumer who just
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.600]   wants the next best thing and is willing to pay for that.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.280]   And they seem to have cornered most of that market,
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.720]   maybe not all of that market.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.880]   But it seems like they've cornered this market
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.320]   of that type of person.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.120]   Because it seems to affect the music sales.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.400]   It seems to affect the app sales.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.800]   It seems to affect the iPad and iPhone sales.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.640]   That there's a certain personality of folks
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.320]   that want to stay on that front edge.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.840]   And it seems that--
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.960]   I mean, Jason, does it seem like Apple has really kind
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.120]   of taken over that part of the market?
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.840]   I don't know if I'd say they've cornered the market
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.440]   as much as they've created that market, right?
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.840]   I mean, people love these products
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.880]   and are excited about them.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.680]   And that excitement is what Apple capitalizes on.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.000]   And yet, when they went to Verizon,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.480]   there was obviously a lot of pent up demand even then
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.640]   from people who couldn't or wouldn't switch to AT&T.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.280]   We're going to see that with Sprint now
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.080]   that there are going to be some other people who--
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.840]   the carriers get to fight over these iPhone customers now,
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.440]   which is going to be interesting.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.080]   You know, Apple has cultivated a market.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:37.960]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.160]   But they've reached a lot of people
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.880]   who never really considered themselves Apple people.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.920]   But they know what the iPhone is and they like it.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.600]   And that's why Apple has been so wildly successful,
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.640]   is that they've gone beyond what we think of as the traditional
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.360]   kind of Apple user and make this whole new collection
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.040]   of people love their products.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.720]   Now, one of the things-- the purchasing has not gone smoothly.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.400]   I mean, it's gone-- given that they sold $3 million,
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.600]   it's gone pretty well.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.120]   But a lot of people have been complaining.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.400]   I actually did not order online because I couldn't figure out
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.200]   on the Apple.com site how to make sure that my text messaging was
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.600]   still part of my plan.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.240]   So I went to AT&T.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.440]   I signed up for AT&T.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.720]   I don't want to mess with the other ones.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:24.160]   And then I signed up for my minutes.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.800]   And then I signed up for my unlimited data, which
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.760]   is still grandfathered in.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.480]   Thank you, AT&T.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.960]   But then when I got to the thing, it says, no texting plan
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.160]   in the actual last page before you hit order.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.040]   And so now I'm kind of-- for me, it's kind of like, well,
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.360]   I'm going to go to the Apple store.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.240]   I don't want to end up without--
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.560]   I don't want to start getting charged 20 cents a text message.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.440]   That'll get really expensive for me.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.600]   And so--
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.440]   I will--
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.200]   Go ahead.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.080]   I will say that my experience with the AT&T text support
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.600]   people, whenever I've had any kind of plan issues or whatnot,
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.720]   has absolutely been stellar.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.640]   I mean, they certainly-- the company
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.400]   takes flack for coverage and all that.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.040]   But the actual people I've talked to,
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.880]   both in person at the stores and on the phone,
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.840]   whenever there's been a plan blip or whatever
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.400]   store has been really, really good.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.480]   So in that kind of a situation, well,
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.000]   they're not going to change it until you activate the phone.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.560]   So I just get the phone and then call them and text them.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:18.040]   Just all day.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:18.640]   Well, what's going on?
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.140]   Yeah.
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.200]   And I have to admit that every time I've had interaction
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.880]   with AT&T, they have been--
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.080]   I will say that the customer service has been very good for me
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.960]   all over the world.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.000]   So because most of my AT&T questions are usually
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.960]   I'm international and I'm-- oh, I forgot
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.120]   to turn my international plan on.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:39.640]   And you can actually call AT&T a week after you left and say
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.320]   you want to-- and they'll back date it.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.920]   They probably don't want me to tell you that.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.440]   And even they can even do things like if you have been
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:50.040]   green-fathered and on the unlimited plan for iPhone and iPad,
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.440]   and let's say your credit card expires and you forget--
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.360]   and it fails to auto renew or something like that,
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.800]   and you get tossed out of it, they will actually
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.360]   reactivate it for you exactly once.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.680]   So if you call and say, yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.480]   I guess I forgot to tell you guys that I've
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.760]   got this brand new card here.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.720]   They will go through-- they have to do a little bit of tap
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.040]   dancing to make it happen.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.560]   And they'll make it very clear that we don't have to do this.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.120]   And we can't do this a second time,
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.200]   but congratulations, Wish Granted.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.400]   You will be seeing your--
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.320]   yes, you will be seeing your unlimited Netflix streaming
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.320]   once again in three seconds.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.280]   Now, a lot of people are deciding what phone they want
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.600]   to get and a lot of-- over 3 million have already decided.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.760]   But what should they be considering
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.760]   when they're thinking about which service?
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.960]   Adam, is there a certain service that people
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.720]   should-- is there certain parts of the country?
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.560]   Is there certain things that they should be thinking about
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:43.000]   as far as whether they're getting sprint, Verizon, or AT&T?
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   You know, my experience is that that's
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.400]   one of those sort of local knowledge things where everyone
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:51.720]   knows, oh, yeah, around here, we all use Verizon.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.080]   I live in upstate New York where, frankly, cell coverage
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.440]   in general sucks.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:59.800]   And the word is generally, yeah, you use Verizon.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   Sprint now, not so much.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.200]   AT&T works when you're in downtown Ithaca,
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.240]   but you get further out.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:05.760]   Nothing.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.760]   And once you get far enough out in upstate New York,
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.760]   nothing works at all.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.640]   So you know, you just do what you can.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.560]   And I suspect that a lot of places around are like that,
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.320]   where you talk to the neighbors, you just
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.160]   get the sense of what works, what doesn't work.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.920]   I also find it's actually helpful to talk to service people
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.360]   who go all over the place.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.400]   And what phone do they use at work?
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.800]   Well, and I believe-- and I don't have the Verizon phone,
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.400]   but the Verizon phone is the one-- is still
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.480]   limited by the CDMA limits where you can't use data and talk
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.840]   on the phone at the same time, correct?
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.840]   I mean, that's CDMA.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.320]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.840]   You got me there, so.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.520]   Right, well, I mean, because that's something that, you know,
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.680]   for me, that I use that all the time.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.920]   The other issue that I've had-- so I have a--
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.960]   I got one of the Galaxy S2s.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.000]   And one of the things that I noticed, I was in DC last week,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.240]   and I'm constantly getting alerts that I'm
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.280]   going to be roaming in the US on Sprint.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:55.960]   I just thought I--
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.920]   And you're roaming to Verizon data.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.640]   You're roaming to Verizon data, then.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:05.680]   Well, all I got to say is that that was like a massive wake-up
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.480]   call for me, because on AT&T, you know,
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.080]   you roam outside of the United States.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.600]   You don't roam in the United States.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.240]   To be clear, you're talking about a Sprint phone, not Verizon.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.120]   I am talking about a Sprint phone.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:15.640]   Right.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.320]   Yeah, so I'm--
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:16.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.920]   I was a little confused.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.520]   No, no, but it's--
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.520]   But it's--
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.920]   Yeah, I mean, I travel and I have two or three
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.200]   phones in my pockets because I'm testing almost all the time.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.560]   And just consistently, the best coverage is always Verizon,
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.080]   not only just for being someplace and getting
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.760]   the minimum number of bars you need to get the job done,
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:39.160]   but also when you start to think about 4G networks,
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.960]   I always have now at least two 4G phones with me.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.840]   And although 4G coverage is still absolutely spotty,
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.560]   if I'm going to get a 4G signal anywhere,
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.080]   it's definitely going to be on a Verizon phone.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.360]   So that's something to think about if you're
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.360]   thinking about the future.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.680]   As long as you don't have to talk and use the--
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.880]   So whenever the phone rings, I know
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.240]   that it's either two companies that always call
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.640]   and one of which is always worth taking that phone call,
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.240]   or somebody who did not get the memo.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.640]   But my entire outgoing message is, if you want to leave a voice,
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.120]   there's a reason why I didn't pick up
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.960]   because I almost never answer the phone.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.240]   If you want to leave a voice,
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.320]   Bell, and you're okay with my responding in a week,
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.360]   maybe, or never, go ahead.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.840]   But really, you should text me, or you should email me.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.320]   So that's not an issue for me,
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.080]   it might not be an issue for other people.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.360]   - Now, one of the things on Macworld.com,
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.400]   there's an opinion talking about the 3GS being
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.200]   the secret weapon.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.880]   Jason, do you think that the 3GS, this free new iPhone,
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.760]   this has been one of the reasons that Android has done
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.040]   so well over the last little bit of time,
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.040]   is that there's a free version.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.280]   And even though people aren't doing the math
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:43.960]   and realizing that they're spending $600 to $1,200 on the service,
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:48.240]   it turns out that not spending $50 or $100 on the phone
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.080]   makes sense to them.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.600]   Jason, how big of a deal do you think that this free 3GS
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.160]   is gonna be for the penetration of the iPhone?
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.080]   - I mean, it's easy for us nerds to poo poo it and say,
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.120]   it's more than two years old.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.080]   It's old news, forget about the 3GS.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.640]   But, and a fool needs a free phone, you can do the math,
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.400]   and all of that is true.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.280]   But first off, there's a psychological thing.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.000]   You are getting people in the door saying,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.840]   "Oh, free iPhone, I'm gonna check that out."
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:17.000]   And then maybe they say, "Well, I could get the four for $99.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.280]   Maybe I'll do that."
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.680]   The other thing, in addition to just the psychology of marketing,
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.520]   is markets that Apple isn't as strong and traditionally.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.600]   It's a free phone if it's something that is being offset
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.360]   by the carrier paying, where they're reimbursing Apple.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.960]   But in some markets, prepay, and no reimbursement is the model.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.360]   And in some of the biggest developing markets, including China.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.400]   So the cheaper you make that phone,
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.600]   and make it available at as low a price as possible,
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.480]   that's gonna give Apple inroads into all sorts of markets,
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.880]   where they can't compete using the model they use in the US,
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.840]   and a lot of Europe, which is especially in the US,
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.080]   with these two year contracts.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.440]   So I do think it's part of their portfolio.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.200]   I think it's interesting in that Apple's decided not to make
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.940]   a cheap phone, but just have their cheap phone be an older phone,
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:09.080]   that they continue to produce and presumably their margins on it,
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.240]   continue to increase so they can keep cutting the price.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.760]   And in the end, yeah, I think it's really smart for them to say,
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.720]   we start at free.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.160]   We start, if you go on Apple's website,
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.320]   it's starting at $0.00 and 0.00,
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.560]   and then going up from there,
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.360]   it gives them all these price points from $0.00
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.640]   all the way up to that 64 gig iPhone 4S.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.680]   And that's good.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.320]   That's good to get people in the door to consider an iPhone.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.840]   And it's good for developing markets,
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:36.060]   and markets where prepaid phones are more common.
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.700]   And I think the other thing is--
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:38.540]   Go ahead.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:39.780]   Go ahead, Adam.
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.620]   Is there any-- if you heard anything just about them actually
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:46.300]   offering the free iPhone 3GS in those developing markets?
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.620]   I mean, I had my understanding was that that pricing is only here.
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.140]   Well, they've only really announced the pricing in the US,
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.740]   and in some other markets where this is going to happen.
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.660]   However, on the last-- so almost three months now,
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.900]   quarterly conference call with analysts that they do when
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.760]   Apple releases its quarterly results.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.000]   Tim Cook talked actually for quite a while
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.480]   about the importance of prepay, especially in the Chinese market,
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:12.640]   and trying to find a way to reach those people with a lower
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.600]   cost handset.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:18.400]   And I can't look at that and this free in the US, 3GS,
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.120]   and not connect the two.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.880]   That is the strategy there, or it will be.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.240]   Because I think that one of the places where they've really
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:29.080]   had a lack in the US market, in fact,
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.540]   is the lack of a prepaid phone here.
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.020]   You want to talk about that, too.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.980]   You're a contract adding up over time.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.300]   And there's a lot of people who just say,
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.540]   the iPhone is too expensive because they can do the math.
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:45.220]   And the reason why-- I don't use Verizon,
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:46.620]   but I wouldn't be in the slightest bit
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:50.180]   perturbed about having CDMA such that I could only
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:52.020]   talk or browse the web at the same time.
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:56.500]   Because I don't talk on the phone basically at all.
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.140]   I'd be more than happy to have a prepaid phone entirely
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:02.500]   because I've got the smallest possible plan for our family
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.180]   plan, and we still have 5,000 roll over minutes.
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:08.700]   I think that talking on phones is really going away largely.
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.700]   And so--
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.780]   Yeah, just tell that to my six-year-old.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.380]   I think the--
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:12.940]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.540]   Well, but how much does she text versus talking?
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.460]   She does a lot of texting a lot of Facebook,
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.140]   but she also spends a lot of time on the phone.
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.300]   I always look at the minute time, like, really?
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:22.300]   Yeah.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.340]   That's the only reason we have the minutes plan that we have
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.180]   is my wife and my six-year-old daughter.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:31.020]   Well, you can buy an unlocked 3GS for 375,
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.860]   which is not a great deal because there's
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.260]   so much that goes into the carrier subsidy.
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:36.740]   But you can.
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.300]   For people like that who don't really want to call but want
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.980]   data, what I keep wondering is, will we
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.580]   see at some point an iPod Touch that
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.180]   has the same data plan as the iPad, where it's really just
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:49.980]   a cellular data device, and you'll pay a $20 a month fee
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.740]   or something, and you won't do voice,
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:52.780]   and you'll have data caps.
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.180]   So if you want to do voice over IP,
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.980]   you can, but you're going to pay for the data,
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.660]   I wonder if that may be where we end up.
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.380]   But the price of these phones, it's not
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.340]   cheap to make an iPhone.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.980]   So 3GS, unsubsidized, is still 375.
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:07.700]   It's not cheap.
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.380]   That might even be a better fit for a prepaid plan,
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:13.620]   because when you go to a mall kiosk,
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.740]   or you go to a drug store and you buy a $30, $20,
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:19.260]   a burner phone, really, all you're doing it for is
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.540]   connection to other people.
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:24.140]   But when you have an iPhone or any kind of a smartphone,
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.540]   you really are invested in the apps that you buy for it
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.820]   and the data that you put on it.
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:31.980]   You really can't-- you can pay month to month to month on it,
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:36.300]   and the real advantage of these plans is more that you can
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:38.780]   take a couple months off if you decide to.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.220]   But you really have a lot more tied up in that phone
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.860]   than just your contract.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.220]   So it's not just a case of making sure that they can make
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:47.620]   these phones available to everybody in every single buying
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:51.220]   situation, but also make sure that they've got a product
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:53.020]   that fits for that kind of consumer.
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:55.780]   One I also think for the 3GS, when you're looking at buying
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:58.620]   phones for kids, your kids and your family,
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.460]   if you're going to buy them their phone,
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:06.340]   the advantage of the 3GS is not only that it is cheaper,
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.140]   because the kids will more likely break it,
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.660]   but also that it is a lot more durable.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:19.700]   Until my kids introduced the phone to the bath,
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.900]   they had thrown it, pushed it, turned it,
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:22.780]   all these other things.
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:27.180]   And it was the little phone that just kept on ticket.
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.020]   And--
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:28.580]   It's tough.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.020]   Yeah, it's really much more tough than the other one.
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.580]   If you're looking at what you're going to get for your kids--
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.500]   Little cracks, and it's still alive, right?
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:35.340]   I mean, this thing--
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.420]   Yeah, and that thing-- you could drop this,
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:37.380]   it won't shatter.
[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:37.900]   Yeah.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.540]   Yeah, and the other thing to remember
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:43.780]   is that when we look at the cost of subscription,
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.020]   remember that that's a lot less when you do the family plan.
[00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.260]   I think it's like $15 a month incremental,
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.060]   and then you get more minutes or whatever.
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.020]   And so you keep on adding people up to it,
[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:54.860]   and that starts to really add up, where you might have a couple
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:57.860]   of people with iPhone 4s, but then they get the kids all 3GSs
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.180]   or whatever.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.580]   But I think that that definitely
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.660]   may to some degree offset that.
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.580]   So it'll be interesting to see how this goes.
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.540]   Now, have you guys all ordered your phones?
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.540]   Or no, Andy, you're not ordering your phone?
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.940]   I'm going to hold off, because again, like Jason said,
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.660]   I just bought this phone like 16 months ago.
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:23.740]   And I'd much rather make it an easy decision for a 2012 upgrade
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.100]   than a 2011 upgrade.
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.980]   So I'm going to hold off for now.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:27.820]   Jason, are you--
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:28.420]   Me too.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:29.260]   Yeah, I got it.
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:33.620]   I got one I'm probably eligible for the AT&T subsidy
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:35.300]   on Black Friday, which seems to be where they're
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.140]   pushing all the people who bought the iPhone right
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.820]   at the beginning of the iPhone 4.
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.940]   But my iPhone 4 is in pretty good shape.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:43.300]   I actually had a warranty replacement a couple months ago.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.500]   So it's basically a brand new iPhone 4.
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:47.580]   And it's in good shape.
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.700]   So for now, I'm going to stick with it.
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.420]   We'll probably have a 4S around the office to use.
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.220]   And maybe I'll use that from time to time.
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.220]   That might be nice.
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.700]   But as from the one that I own, that is for me,
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.900]   it's going to be the 4 for a while.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.140]   All the points Andy brings up.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.580]   I mean, it's a new phone.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:07.380]   I don't need a new phone again right now.
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:07.900]   Right.
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:12.300]   Yeah, I think I'm going to try the Friday night Saturday/Saturday
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:12.800]   thing.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.300]   I don't think I can do the line.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.460]   But I'm going to see what happens at the Apple Store.
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.180]   I'm not going to say which Apple Store I'm going to try to go to.
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:22.460]   But a lot of times, it used to be that they'd sell out.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.140]   And I'm taking the risk of them selling out.
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:27.460]   But a lot of times now, if you show up later in the day,
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:32.300]   past the line, you get a little bit a better situation.
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.220]   So anyways, we'll see how that goes.
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.580]   We're going to go into our feedback loop again.
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:42.100]   We have the votes-- another voted question here
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:46.260]   in the pixelcore.force.com/pixelcore.
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.820]   This is the Apple TV update.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.100]   This is from Paul Adams.
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:53.820]   He said, have any of you heard about updates coming soon
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.220]   to the Apple TV?
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.020]   I bought one yesterday.
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.460]   Oh, man.
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:02.180]   But then heard that the A5 Bluetooth update was coming soon.
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.220]   Andy, can you confirm this?
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:10.500]   Andy, tell us, how is the new Apple TV 3?
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.500]   Let us know.
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:16.340]   Let me just-- who's a good boy doesn't ask me questions
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:19.500]   about unreleased-- who's yes, such a good old bus trip?
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:20.380]   I love you, bless you.
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.540]   You never ask me questions about it, release them.
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:23.820]   So that's all I have.
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:27.260]   So Jason, have you heard anything about this news?
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:28.780]   Only the rumors, everybody.
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:30.420]   It doesn't seem like it's imminent
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.660]   or what happened on Tuesday last week.
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.940]   So I think it's something that Apple's looking at.
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:39.620]   I think sure an A5 Bluetooth snazier Apple TV
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:40.900]   is inevitable.
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.620]   For me, though, it's not so much about that hardware.
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.940]   It's about the software.
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.700]   I want to see more services on the Apple TV.
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:52.220]   And I really want third party plugins, third party apps,
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.380]   basically, for the Apple TV.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.780]   I think it's got a lot of potential.
[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:57.820]   Last year, we were all talking about what if Apple put--
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:58.660]   It's just an iOS.
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:46:59.500]   It's just the iOS.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:46:59.980]   It's just the iOS.
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.060]   It's iOS underneath it, right?
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:03.540]   So there could be an app store, and it could have games on it
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:06.100]   that you used your iPhone or iPod Touch or iPad.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.740]   And you don't need to upgrade for that.
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.060]   That could be iOS 5.
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.940]   I mean, it could just do it, right?
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:11.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.620]   I mean, I would love to see that.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.860]   I think that's more likely something
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.740]   that you hear about in a developer conference.
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:20.620]   And then the developers get a few months to put it together.
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:23.140]   But one of the weaknesses of the Apple TV
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.500]   when you look at something like the Roku players that
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:29.540]   are out there is that they have a much broader selection
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:33.300]   of content and a third party interface where
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.180]   you can write your own plug-in if you're a provider.
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:38.700]   I have a Twitch channel on my Roku box, right?
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.180]   Whereas Apple, if majorly baseball wants to go in there,
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:42.100]   they've got to work with Apple.
[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.660]   And then there's an Apple software update that enables it.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.260]   And then it's there for everybody.
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:47.260]   And that's kind of crazy.
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.180]   You want to be able to say HBO, here's
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.100]   how you make HBO go on the Apple TV.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.180]   Well, you don't even have to say that.
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.660]   All you have to do is just open it up.
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.060]   So it basically has much of the same interface
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:57.180]   that you would see with--
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:01.300]   I mean, it is an iPhone just sitting inside of a little box,
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:01.500]   right?
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.780]   Yeah, app store for Apple TV.
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:04.700]   So I hope that happens.
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.660]   I mean, so I think to me, I think that would be more interesting.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:08.580]   I would love to see them go Bluetooth or something.
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:10.780]   But the first thing I get rid of with an app--
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.460]   I have two Apple TV twos.
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:15.620]   And the first thing I get rid of is the stupid little controller.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:16.980]   And the great thing is the controller--
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:18.300]   Not even rather to ship it.
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.540]   It removes itself for you.
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:21.500]   Yeah, yeah, just--
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.020]   It's like, oh, I thought I had a remote.
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:24.820]   I guess I didn't.
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.580]   Thank God, they made something tiny and slippery
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.180]   that it's completely invisible inside a living room.
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.620]   Inside of something big and chunky that's easy to hold.
[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.660]   That's good.
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:36.300]   It floats around, and I see it every once in a while.
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.060]   I'm like, oh, right.
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.020]   This is that--
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:41.900]   Anybody who's using an Apple TV, generally, you almost--
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:43.660]   everybody, I think, has an iPhone.
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:47.460]   And then you're controlling your Apple TV with your iPhone.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:48.740]   And I actually just got a box.
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:50.060]   I'm still working on it.
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:52.100]   But that controls the rest of your TV and everything
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:54.540]   else with your iPhone, too, because it's--
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.900]   So some of these everywhere, the old ones--
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:57.700]   Oh, I'm just kidding.
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:58.980]   --literally within arms reach.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.580]   At any point, I have one of these.
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:02.580]   And no matter how hard--
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.420]   how much time I spend trying to pair that with my Apple TV,
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.020]   my little silver one, if I--
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:08.180]   I have another computer.
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:10.900]   As soon as I go into it, I'm in like that, whatever.
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:11.900]   I mean, it just takes a--
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.100]   Front row pops up.
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:14.780]   Flying will take care of that, because this
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.260]   line doesn't have front row anymore.
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:17.740]   So upgrade the line, and you'll just
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:18.780]   kill front row entirely.
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:19.620]   Thank goodness.
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.420]   Anyway, because I never use front row
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:24.340]   except to complain about it when it accidentally--
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.100]   There's a place in the--
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:27.540]   I think it's the security preference
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.860]   pane where you can turn off infrared on your Mac.
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:30.740]   Here's a tip.
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.980]   Go into the security preference range, just turn it off.
[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:34.900]   And then it'll never do it again, Alex.
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:35.740]   Thank you.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:36.240]   Thank you.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.380]   Why didn't I-- well, anyway.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.220]   Now I know.
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:38.700]   Now I know.
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:39.980]   So I'll be able to go through it.
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:40.980]   So I'm good.
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.620]   So it's kind of significant that Roku just--
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:45.220]   I think it was just today or yesterday,
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:48.500]   announced a new $49 version of the Roku box.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:52.580]   So I think that this is them realizing that, OK, we--
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.620]   our device even looks like the new Apple TV.
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:57.500]   So we got to make sure that we keep selling to our strengths.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:58.740]   Do you think the Apple TV's putting
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.340]   a lot of pressure on Roku?
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:00.860]   I think so.
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:02.380]   I think absolutely.
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:05.140]   But now Roku, not only do they have an extra tool
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.800]   in the fact that you can buy two of ours for one of theirs.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.640]   But also, I think they're going to be
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:14.640]   caught up in the halo effect of Amazon's new online initiatives,
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:18.360]   where Amazon Instant Video was already a very good service.
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.760]   But they've been-- over the past year,
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.120]   they've been doing nothing but striking more deals
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:23.560]   to get more content.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.880]   And when the Kindle Fire gets released in a couple of weeks
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.280]   in November, that's only going to elevate
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.600]   the importance of that service.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.720]   And now if someone is evaluating,
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.400]   trying to choose between-- do I get a Roku,
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.780]   or do I get an Apple TV?
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:38.080]   They're going to say, well, it will do everything
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:42.320]   the Apple TV does, only minus the access to the iTunes store
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.640]   and iTunes content, but plus access
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.120]   to all this Amazon content and independent channels.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:51.140]   And does it do screen saving with your photos?
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:52.400]   Because that's the main use of it.
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.380]   I'm telling you, that is the main use for my wife.
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:57.440]   I think there's like a Flickr channel and a Facebook channel.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.840]   And there are lots of photo sharing channels.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.340]   OK.
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.720]   Because that is like the number one piece.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.120]   Are you sometimes in your office,
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.760]   and you see that big 60-inch display connected to your Apple
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.320]   TV with all that family photos?
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.240]   And it's only a photo of your wife holding up
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.000]   a mascara-written thing.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.200]   You were supposed to meet me in the car 10 minutes ago
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.960]   for our dinner together.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.520]   She looks angry.
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.320]   That's what photos for you might be referring to.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.200]   That's what you give her the new iPhone, Andy.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.680]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.880]   So that's another question from the--
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.560]   if you want to ask some questions or vote on them,
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:30.320]   we've got a lot of votes, a lot of stuff coming up here.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.280]   So go ahead and keep on voting there.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.560]   Oops, I'm moving it around while Eileen is trying
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.040]   to keep up with that.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.480]   More news here coming up soon.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:39.840]   But before we do that, we're going
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.360]   to thank another one of our sponsors, Carbonite.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:47.400]   Of course, if you haven't started backing your work up
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.800]   to the cloud, your most important documents,
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.600]   you really need to start thinking about that.
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:53.040]   It is extremely important.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:56.160]   It's not truly backed up until you have it.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.520]   And I always-- people ask me about backup,
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:01.160]   and it's always got to be in two places and in the cloud.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:05.200]   So we tend to put it on two DroBos and then in the cloud.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:08.040]   But either way, you've got to get the most important documents,
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.520]   whether it's your family photos, your family documents.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.000]   More and more of our stuff is no longer on paper.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:13.920]   It is electronic.
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:19.760]   And that means that your one drive failure away, many of us,
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:22.760]   are one drive failure away from losing everything.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.360]   Losing all those photos that we've
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.960]   been taking on our iPhone or our Canon or whatever it is.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.040]   So it's very, very important.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.960]   With Carbonite, of course, you can keep all that stuff safely
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:36.000]   away from computer crashes, viruses, fire, theft.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.120]   All those things are stuff that you just--
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.160]   it's a local problem.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.040]   Your files are automatically and continually backed up.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.160]   They're stored safely offsite.
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.520]   And if you have a computer disaster, of course,
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:49.680]   you can easily restore them.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.000]   And plus you have-- you can access your backed up files
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.080]   privately on any computer.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.160]   So if you need them somewhere else, you can get that.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.040]   So it's just such a great way to kind of back all of those files
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.080]   up for your computer.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:04.680]   You can have unlimited backup for your PC or Mac
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.400]   for only $59 a year.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.480]   All you got to do is go to carbonite.com
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:12.080]   and use the offer code MAC BREAK.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:16.340]   And you'll get two free months, two extra free months,
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:18.320]   a bonus three months with that offer code.
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.840]   So MAC BREAK is the offer code.
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.480]   And so definitely check it out, carbonite.com
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.600]   and use the offer code MAC BREAK
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.400]   and start getting backed up today.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:33.600]   All right, so the--
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:34.680]   I'm sorry here.
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.400]   So anyway, so we have a Facebook for the iPad.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.680]   So the Facebook has finally-- this was--
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.840]   there was conspiracy theory about why, about what it was
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:44.760]   about, about how long it was going to take,
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.160]   was going to be part of the Apple announcement,
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.840]   were they holding off for that.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.000]   And then they just announced it.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.760]   They just kind of like rolled it out.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.880]   Jason, have you gotten a chance to take a look at it yet?
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:53.880]   I have.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.680]   I played with it last night.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:56.760]   It's--
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:57.600]   It's Facebook.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.320]   It's Facebook.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:01.960]   It's the Facebook app for the iPhone on the iPad.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:04.400]   For the five people out there who've used the HP Touchpad.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.800]   It's the Facebook app for the HP Touchpad.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:11.040]   It's a little weird in that it has the chat so prominently.
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.520]   And I never use Facebook chat.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:14.360]   And I'm always afraid I'm going to suddenly touch
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.080]   the wrong place and be chatting with somebody
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.560]   I vaguely knew in high school, which is kind of--
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:19.240]   I don't want to do that.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.120]   Creepy.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.560]   Yeah, I kind of don't want to do that.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:24.000]   But it's fine.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.480]   I realize that I don't go to Facebook very much
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.800]   because it's a website.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:32.800]   And I don't remember to open my browser and type in Facebook.com.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.200]   And I go to Twitter all the time because I have clients
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.040]   on my desktop and on my phone.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.040]   And I just hit the app.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.280]   And I'm there looking.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:43.480]   So I think Facebook for iPad is a good fit.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.760]   I'm much more likely to check Facebook on my iPad
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.520]   than I'm not a heavy Facebook user by any stretch
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.360]   of the imagination.
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.080]   But I think I'm more likely to use it now.
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.280]   And it looks like it's decent.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.160]   It's a little weird.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.640]   And they're going to have time to update it.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.000]   But it's a start.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:58.880]   It's fine.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:02.160]   I liked some things and commented on some things.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.280]   And I fortunately didn't chat with anybody.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:04.840]   So--
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.800]   Do you find that oftentimes--
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.800]   I think I'm finding the iPhone and iPad apps for a lot
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.920]   of these things, whether it's Twitter, Facebook,
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.800]   is actually much better than the web experience.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:14.760]   Sure.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:16.320]   Sure, because it's a rich client.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.320]   And that's what apps are great at, right?
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.920]   Because it's actually all this rolling that experience.
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:21.840]   It's simpler clients.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.840]   I mean, the Facebook web app is so horrible.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:27.480]   And it changes every 30 seconds as far as I can tell.
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.960]   So every time I learn how to do one thing in Facebook,
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.760]   keep in mind I visit Facebook only about once a month,
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.520]   if I can possibly keep it at that level.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:39.240]   But it's an inscrutable, horrible, nasty website.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.280]   And so the apps are just a lot easier.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.280]   Go ahead.
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:46.200]   I would disagree with the Twitter app.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:49.680]   But I think the Twitter app is just someone who
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:53.080]   tried LDS a little once too many times.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.320]   I've been using it for, what, a year, year and a half.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:56.600]   I still think it doesn't work.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:59.200]   I still think it's stupid and cluttered and clumsy.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.360]   I think it breaks so many basic rules
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.920]   and doesn't do it in a productive way.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:06.600]   And I still use the-- actually use the web client for Twitter
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.240]   whenever I use Twitter, as opposed to any application
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.080]   that's put on, at least the iPad.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.680]   And the iPhone is OK, but on the iPad is abomination.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:16.120]   But we're absolutely right with Facebook.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:19.840]   You need a front-end app to actually make that interface
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:20.600]   work.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:22.880]   Well, I think that using Twitterific for the iPad--
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.560]   and I think it's great.
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.960]   But you're right, the Twitter app for the iPad is bizarre.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:31.440]   But Twitterific for me is best, actually, on the iPad.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:34.120]   And without it, I would really not use Twitter, I think.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:34.960]   I agree with Jason.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.800]   Same thing, Twitterific.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.200]   So that is the-- and I guess some people
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:41.040]   are saying in the IRC tweet deck.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:44.440]   But yeah, what's interesting is that a lot of the apps--
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.840]   and I just get back to it.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.600]   This has always been my argument-- is that the web is--
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:51.080]   in a lot of ways, I think there's a challenge for the web--
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.600]   is that all these little apps--
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.440]   I'd much rather go to a lot of these things.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:55.920]   I don't want to go to NPR.com.
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.040]   I just want to open up the NPR app.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.400]   I don't want to use Facebook.com.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.760]   I always want to open up my Facebook app.
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:05.440]   And the question is, does that start to water down the web?
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:08.520]   As we start to kind of siphon off a lot of apps.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.000]   Well, I think that one of the very original conceptions
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.160]   of the web was that it would be as much a transport medium
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:17.040]   between clients with custom interfaces
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.720]   as this sort of generic browser that everything
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.520]   would have to try to fit into.
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:24.000]   That if you go back to some of the early stuff written
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.920]   by the people who were creating it, that was their intent.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.960]   And so I've always been very interested
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:36.320]   to see just how impressive some website interfaces can be.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.320]   When others, again, you just cringe
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:41.080]   because it's so much better than with a custom interface.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.840]   And the apps really make that even better
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:45.760]   than frankly than the Mac.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.160]   You know, there's a lot of apps.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:49.880]   A weather bug, a big weather fan.
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:53.920]   And so I use Weatherbug on the iPhone or the iPad.
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.960]   And never, ever, ever visit a website.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.960]   Or even use frankly an app on the Mac.
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:00.080]   It's just a better interface.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:04.560]   I think I'm more of a fan of these websites finding a way
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:08.480]   to project their services in a more context aware manner.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:11.280]   I've just been playing with the new Mango phones,
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:14.080]   Microsoft's new version of Windows Phone 7.
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.240]   And they're sort of carrying over something
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:18.440]   that they were demonstrating in Windows 8 a few weeks ago,
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:20.360]   which is that you will have a Twitter app
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:23.680]   or you will have a phone app or a photo app or a Facebook app.
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:26.040]   But not only will it be an app just for Facebook,
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:29.280]   but whenever you're in any other app that deals with pictures
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:32.360]   or deals with contacts and moving things
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:34.560]   from one place to another and publishing things,
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:37.080]   you won't launch the Facebook app.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.400]   But that part of the Facebook app that can take a picture
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.600]   and post it to your Facebook profile
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.560]   will simply make itself aware that,
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:44.360]   "Hey, he's doing something involving a photo."
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:46.920]   If he asks for different things that can be done
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:48.440]   with this photo, I should be there to say,
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:49.720]   "Oh, by the way, I'm a Facebook app
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:52.040]   "and I can help you post this thing right now."
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:54.480]   I really think that's a level of sophistication
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:57.920]   that's missing from most of these independent iOS apps.
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.600]   - Yeah, so I think it'll be interesting
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.960]   to see how they continue to progress.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.680]   I just find myself spending less and less time
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:03.800]   on the web and more and more time
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:05.240]   and spend on my internet apps.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.640]   So that's an amazing--
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.640]   - Can you imagine that this was gonna be
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:11.120]   one of the big rumors about,
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:12.160]   "Hey, we got a scoop.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:14.440]   "There might be a Facebook app for the iPad
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:16.000]   "announcer at Apple."
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.760]   (laughing)
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.120]   Okay, dude, it's Facebook app.
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.120]   I've got four of them.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:25.120]   - So now another question from our listening audience.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:30.760]   The top vote getter now is iCloud versus Google.
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:32.560]   They wanna hear the comparison.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.320]   So-- - iCloud.
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.440]   - It doesn't seem like this comparison.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:36.280]   - Man, first is Google.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.800]   - This is from, yeah, this is from J.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:40.360]   - Go ahead.
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:42.080]   - This is not really the same thing.
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.680]   - It's just, right now,
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.520]   well, I mean, that's the whole thing
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.560]   is it's two completely different worlds right now, isn't it?
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.400]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, iCloud,
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:51.880]   first of all, as we were saying before,
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:54.640]   not done, not gonna be very impressive at the start,
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:57.000]   but hopefully it's a good foundation
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.360]   for Apple to do some of this stuff right.
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.520]   That said, iCloud is really basically
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.440]   a fancy virtual cable.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.320]   It's going to let you sink between endpoints
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.680]   of apps on devices you own.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.000]   That's what it's for.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.360]   - But here's the question is,
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.200]   but as you look at the app support that's coming,
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.880]   and as you look at the APIs that are gonna be available,
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.560]   do you get into a situation where it,
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.800]   you do start to be able to collaborate,
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.240]   like for instance, could you think--
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.160]   - No, not that-- - Do you see,
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.040]   do you see someday when we're able to collaborate
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.040]   where two people can be on inside of Keynote,
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:32.680]   collaborating on a presentation, you know,
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:33.520]   using that type of stuff?
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:34.760]   - We can fantasize about that,
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.760]   but Apple has said nothing about it.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.640]   - It works in my head. - It works really well.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.320]   - It does work in your head, but this is Apple.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:43.000]   This is the company that's come out with iWork.com.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.920]   I mean, Apple sucks at collaboration.
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.840]   They really don't understand it, they don't do it well,
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.120]   and they never have.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.440]   And so if you look at iCloud,
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.720]   from developers I've talked to,
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.920]   there are no APIs surrounding collaborations,
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.240]   surrounding real-time stuff,
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.880]   any of that kind of thing right now.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.680]   And maybe they'll have it.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.400]   That's, I certainly hope they do.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.240]   Don't get me wrong.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.960]   - So really iCloud is just-- - So really iCloud is just--
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:08.800]   - Don't do it now.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.520]   - Really iCloud is just sync on steroids.
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.040]   - Sync on steroids, absolutely.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.440]   And there's nothing wrong with that,
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.920]   but it's sync on steroids,
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.120]   whereas Google is doing a heck of a lot of stuff.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.600]   I mean, I'm a Gmail user, I'm a G-book Google Plus user.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.360]   They do a lot of interesting things.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.200]   - Jason.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.880]   - I think the only place where I'm gonna draw a parallel here,
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.840]   I'm gonna interpret this question in a certain way.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:33.400]   What iCloud and Google haven't common is this,
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.040]   which is it's about smartphone setup and operation.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.200]   The big, I think one of the biggest advantages
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.880]   Android has had over the iOS,
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.640]   has been the fact that when you take an Android phone
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.640]   out of the box, you basically tap through it,
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.880]   you put in your Google ID or sign up for a Google ID
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:47.720]   if you don't have one.
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.720]   And then you are, you know, your phone has access
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.200]   to all of these different services.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.560]   It's online, you never had to connect it to your computer,
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.880]   it's just on, and all of your data is syncing,
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.800]   and you're connected to email and all that.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.000]   And Apple hasn't done that.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.040]   You had to connect it to iTunes,
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.200]   and you had to have an Apple ID and all of these things.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:10.080]   And now with iCloud and with iOS 5,
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.320]   you get that phone out of the box,
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.560]   you put in your Apple ID or sign up for one,
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.440]   an iCloud ID, it'll back up,
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.080]   so you never have to attach it to a computer.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.280]   It'll give you email, it'll give you,
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.800]   the find my phone feature, a bunch of other stuff.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:26.720]   And from here on out, Apple can assume
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.240]   that every single person who has this phone
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.320]   has access to those services or can get it for free
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.720]   in a way that mobile me, which was $99 a year,
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.320]   never, they could never assume that mobile me was there.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.480]   So in that way, it is huge for Apple
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.800]   because it allows Apple to assume some online
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:46.800]   connectivity and syncing that Google could always assume,
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.640]   but that Apple couldn't.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.320]   So in that way, they're similar,
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.480]   but beyond that, you know, Adam is absolutely right.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.480]   This is not, it is not Google Docs, it is not Dropbox,
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.320]   it may become those things eventually, maybe,
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.560]   but it's a long way from there.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:01.760]   >> Annie?
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.760]   >> Yeah, they're just fundamentally different services,
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.920]   but I think that one of the most important features
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.280]   of iCloud is that it's being presented
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:13.160]   as a ubiquitous feature.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:17.840]   Google's biggest weakness is that they tend to sort of
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.160]   hold up the new, hey look, here's the new thing,
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.800]   so beautiful, it's gonna be the future of everything,
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.040]   and we're doing things exactly the way that
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.880]   people aren't doing it, and it's being great,
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.720]   and then they simply put it out to the pastor,
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.440]   close the door, and forget that it exists.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.320]   So it either forages and survives,
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.320]   or it starves the death out there.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.880]   People have to be reminded that, okay,
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.880]   Google has a music store, Google has a video store,
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:44.120]   Google has a bookstore, nobody ever uses these things
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.240]   because they don't promote them,
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.160]   they don't give you any sort of a reason
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.960]   why you should use this instead of the Kindle store
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.840]   or the iTunes store or Amazon instant video.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.600]   So that's sort of a tactical advantage of iCloud,
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.360]   just the simple idea that Apple is saying
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.920]   that this is a product that's on the same level
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:04.840]   as the iPhone, as the iPad, as anything else that we do,
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.520]   that means that this infrastructure is going to be
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.520]   in place for the next generation of apps
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.720]   that choose to support it.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.360]   Now, tomorrow, the world will not have changed.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:18.120]   Among the list of surprises related to iCloud
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.440]   is that Apple apparently is not going to be releasing
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.960]   a new version of the desktop iWork suite
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.560]   that supports iCloud, so that's gonna have to come
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.520]   into the future.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.760]   But a year from now, things could be pretty interesting.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.560]   It really comes down to, do you define most
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.400]   of your computing as me and the data that I do
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.280]   across several devices, or do you define your computing
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.720]   as me and the several other people that I work with
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.960]   that have to share a certain amount,
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.840]   not sharing amongst lots of devices,
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.600]   but sharing amongst lots of people.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.680]   Google approach is definitely good for sharing things
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.240]   across lots of people.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.520]   I think that the iCloud approach is gonna be superior
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.920]   for people who have to share things across multiple devices.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.880]   >> Well, when I know that I have iPads and computers
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.200]   and everything else, and I find it,
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.320]   I'm dying for the iCloud.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.080]   I mean, I'm dying for that to start thinking
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:03.920]   all that stuff up.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.880]   I take, just like taking a photo with my iPhone,
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.360]   I'm like, okay, now, if I wanna get it on my computer
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.000]   for some reason, I'm just like, okay, well--
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   >> If there was one thing that Apple clearly
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.920]   was designing iCloud for, it was the idea
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.200]   that you've got your stuff, and your stuff
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.280]   is always accessible to you.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.320]   And if you're on your Mac or an iPad or an iPhone
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.720]   or whatever, your stuff is there,
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.440]   or it seems like it's there,
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.600]   'cause it's everywhere, and that could be photos,
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.520]   and that could be your documents.
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.240]   It's not gonna be all there on day one,
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:31.600]   but that is what their approach really is all about,
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.560]   is you never have to find your stuff, or sync your stuff,
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.440]   or copy it from one place or another.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.280]   It's just there magically, really.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.840]   I hate to say magically, but it's like that.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.360]   It's like, oh, it's always wherever I look for it,
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.520]   it's there, that's what they want iCloud to be.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.680]   >> Right, absolutely.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.120]   And it's gonna be very disruptive too.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.920]   There's another hour long top, I'm sorry,
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.880]   I'll cut myself off soon, but--
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:56.080]   >> It's 'cause, I mean, Jason, Jason is the lovely man
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:59.280]   who put me on "Discrivenor" a couple of years ago.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.960]   And after I downloaded the demo, after about four hours,
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.920]   I switched 10 years' worth of how I do things
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.920]   from Word and BB Ed at "Discrivenor,"
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.480]   'cause I love that desktop app so much.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:13.920]   But Dropbox and the iPad basically have forced me
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:17.720]   to switch from "Scrivenor" for everything to "Scrivenor"
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:21.320]   and "Pages," because the ability to start a document
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.640]   in pages on my desktop and then simply pick up
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:28.480]   exactly where I left off on my iPad at a bakery
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.200]   or at a coffee shop, wherever, and also be editing
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:34.280]   on my iPhone without having to do any exports or imports
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.520]   or worry about compatibility.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:39.240]   That's such a huge feature and it breaks my heart
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.840]   and I still use "Scrivenor" for all my big,
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.440]   like, book-length projects.
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:45.320]   But that's, it just shows me that that's gonna be an issue
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.540]   in 2012 when iCloud is up and spinning.
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.320]   And I'm looking at "Scrivenor,"
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.280]   which I don't know if this can be supporting iCloud,
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.400]   in the future, but it's gonna be between apps
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:57.800]   that don't support that kind of holistic approach
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.240]   to your data everywhere, no matter what device you have,
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.320]   and the apps that don't support iCloud
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.320]   and don't have an iOS equivalent,
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.400]   that's gonna be so disruptive.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.520]   - Yeah, and fortunately that information,
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:12.800]   I mean, those API should be available to those developers,
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.320]   so it's just a matter of them deciding
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.880]   that they're gonna integrate those.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.520]   - Well, you gotta build an iOS app too, though.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.080]   That's the trick is that, you know,
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.240]   what if you're a "Scrivenor,"
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.640]   you don't have an iPad app, so--
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.480]   - No pressure.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.640]   - They're gonna have to build one
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.800]   or make a deal with somebody who's got something,
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.960]   and so it's not just supporting the API,
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.640]   it's being on all the platforms
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.040]   and then being able to sync between them,
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.480]   and that's gonna be a lot of work.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.680]   Some developers are really gonna have a problem with that.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.960]   - Yeah, another question from our listening audience,
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.360]   this is from Stephen Bond, any guests as to if Siri
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.360]   will come to the iPad too.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:47.120]   And I guess I would extend that question to,
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.000]   is it gonna be available on desktops?
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:49.840]   Is it gonna be available?
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.000]   I mean, do we think that Siri is gonna be something
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.720]   that we see system-wide, Andy?
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.040]   - I think that this is gonna come
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.120]   to those other devices eventually,
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.640]   but I think that Apple explicitly feels
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:04.200]   as though Siri is a better solution
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.280]   for when you're operating a device that's this size
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.080]   and you're operating it like this.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.240]   'Cause when you're operating a device that this size,
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.000]   you can't really type things in.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.520]   And also, you're gonna be walking,
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.560]   you might even be driving,
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:18.000]   you're not in situations where it's safe or practical
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.520]   to have access to this thing.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.280]   So that's why the ability to say,
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:25.480]   to simply say Siri, how many movies was Don Nots in?
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:28.400]   And get back the answer, Don Nots was in 17 movies
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.360]   and keep on walking is gonna be more important.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.080]   So when you get into a situation where you're in front
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:37.360]   of a big 101 keyboard and you got a trackpad,
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:39.600]   you got a mouse, you got all these other sort of things,
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.080]   that's why I think Apple is gonna think that,
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.200]   well, of course we own this technology, it's cool,
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.360]   it's a signature feature that we're very proud of.
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.680]   We'll move it to the desktop,
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.000]   we'll move it to the iPad eventually,
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.800]   but that's really by no means a priority.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:52.840]   - Another question really quickly,
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:53.960]   I'll send this one over to Jason,
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.000]   I'm just gonna go around the horn really quickly,
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   AirPlay to Max, this is from Jeff Perface, I believe.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.520]   And he said, am I missing something in this discussion
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:09.840]   of iOS, is there no way to have an AirPlay to a Mac Mini
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.160]   that's attached to an HDTV?
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:14.760]   So instead of going to your Apple TV,
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.120]   is there a way to do that, Jason,
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.840]   is there a way to do that with your Mac Mini,
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.840]   or is that just something that Apple's left out?
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.640]   - Wow, I do not know of one,
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.920]   I think they really want you to put an Apple TV
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.240]   attached to that TV, I think so.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.000]   It's a good point, you'd think that Apple would tighten
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.360]   the screws on a lot of this stuff, to Andy's point,
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.000]   they may throw Siri and other devices,
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.320]   even if it doesn't make a lot of sense,
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.880]   just to say, well, it's everywhere, and that's important,
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:40.840]   but I think not, I think that AirPlay out onto a Mac
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.360]   is something, Apple's just sort of stepping away from that,
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:46.960]   they've got a device for TVs and it's not the Mac.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.640]   - Yeah, pushing the Mac forward is not really,
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.640]   I mean, continuing-- - But you could run AirPlay.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.880]   - Go ahead, go ahead.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.880]   - But you could run AirFoil,
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.840]   ROGOMIBA's AirFoil, which allows you to,
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.160]   with AirFoil speakers to get AirPlay on a Mac.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.400]   - To get for audio, right?
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.600]   It does a dupe-- - For audio, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.240]   Oh, sorry, video, I didn't, yeah.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.680]   - Yeah, so the-- - Well, yeah, no,
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.600]   I'm doing furious searches right now,
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.280]   'cause I could have sworn that I saw an app at some point.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.120]   (laughing)
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:10.940]   - Why are you doing that?
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:11.780]   I'm gonna answer one more question
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.440]   before we start going to know our tips and tricks.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:17.000]   One, we already talked about the Apple TV,
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.040]   Siri on the Mac, and I'm just gonna answer one here
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.800]   that is, someone's asking about my Galaxy 2
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.960]   versus iPhone 4, 'cause I now have a Galaxy 2S
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.960]   and an iPhone 4, and this is from Salava Rosov.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:36.880]   And so I have to say, I mean, there's a lot of geeky things
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:41.880]   that I like about the 2S, I think the 2S is a lot of fun.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:46.080]   I do find it to be a little bit overwhelming
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:47.640]   about all the different options that I can do
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.280]   and all the little things, and I still can't like,
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.160]   when it started going off,
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.160]   I find a way to silence it quickly
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:55.520]   was not as simple as an iPhone,
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.960]   or finding, I somehow got it into airport mode
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.840]   and then figuring out where I go back
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.080]   to take it out of airport mode.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.840]   There's lots of little things that are just,
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.840]   with an iPhone, I feel like I'm really, really straightforward
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:11.840]   with the Android, I don't feel like it's nearly as straightforward.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.600]   I don't think it's just because I've been using an iPhone
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.280]   for a long time, I just think that it was,
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.000]   there's just a lot of different places to go.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.120]   There's one set of screens,
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.720]   and then there's another set of screens for the apps,
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.240]   and there's another set of screens for other things,
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.480]   and I'm fine with it, I actually, I'm definitely enjoying it,
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.760]   so it's not like I'm complaining about it,
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:27.760]   I think that it's a lot of fun,
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.200]   I wouldn't trade it in for an iPhone 4,
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.240]   and I definitely wouldn't recommend it
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.640]   to people who are not technically savvy.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:38.880]   So I think it's a much heavier from a user perspective,
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.760]   it does require a little bit more technical knowledge
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.120]   than my iPhone 4.
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:45.960]   So anyway, so that's my little thing.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.680]   And last question, because there was one right above my question,
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:52.320]   iOS upgrade, will there be any issues from going from the GM
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.680]   to the general release version,
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:55.680]   like, well I have to do anything,
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.640]   like start with a blank iPod iPad.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.320]   Andy, any thoughts on that?
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.160]   - Yeah, right.
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.280]   You had access to iOS 5 for months before anybody else,
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:06.160]   and now you're looking for people to help you make,
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.960]   oh, oh, pity me, pity me,
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.560]   I have to transition from having this wonderful operating system
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.440]   three months, you know what, you make me sick.
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:15.200]   It's just take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:18.280]   - Only Apple knows for sure anyway, I don't know.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.120]   - I don't know.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.280]   - Whether the GM will be real or not.
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.760]   I do have an answer for Jeff, by the way,
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.360]   there's at least Erica from the unofficial Apple web blog
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.720]   hacked together something called AirPlayer
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.560]   that's supposed to do, AirPlay Video on the Mac.
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.600]   It pretends to be an Apple TV.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.080]   Worth a try, I haven't tried it.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:36.840]   It looks like it's very, very beta kind of hacked together,
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.400]   like I said, but who knows, it might work
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.600]   worth the shot, just Google AirPlayer
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:42.960]   and see what comes up.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.440]   - So now we are going to,
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.480]   so we're about to go into our tips and tricks,
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:50.760]   and but before we dive into that,
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:51.960]   and by the way, I want to thank everyone,
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.360]   before we go into that, I want to thank everybody
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:56.200]   for playing our little Q&A game.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.160]   I hope you guys enjoyed it.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.160]   It was really a lot of fun for me
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.320]   to see you guys so active.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:02.320]   - Square.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:05.160]   - Well, no, no, no, to see all the listeners
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.800]   really participating with great questions
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.480]   and the voting and all the other stuff.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.440]   I wasn't sure exactly what was going to happen.
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:12.240]   I was afraid that we might have like three questions,
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.640]   and we had obviously so many questions
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.680]   that we can only get to a small percentage of them,
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:18.000]   but we were able to figure out which ones
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.280]   by the voting and everything else.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.280]   And so hopefully let us know
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.000]   whether you want us to do that again.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   And as a reminder, we also have an email.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.200]   You can actually let us know via email
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.240]   or you can send questions in via email
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:31.880]   at macbreak@twit.tv.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:34.280]   So let us know what you thought of the Q&A
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:38.440]   at macbreak@twit.tv as well as,
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:39.800]   you know, any questions that you may have
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.320]   or any comments about the show.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.360]   So definitely try that out.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.880]   Also, we of course want to thank our another sponsor.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.680]   We would like to thank Smile Software
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.160]   and specifically Smile Software,
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.080]   of course, makes a lot of great software.
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.520]   And one of my favorites, one of my growing favorites
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.800]   is PDF pen and PDF pen pro.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.680]   I'm using PDF pen pro, a fair bit now.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.560]   And you know, basically one of the problems you get into,
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.360]   you get people who send you an email
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.400]   and they have a PDF and you have to mark it up.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.680]   And you just try, you know, it used to be,
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.680]   I tried to open that Photoshop and I draw on it
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:13.880]   and then I'd save it out as a JPEG
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:14.720]   and I'd send it back to them.
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:16.360]   Or you try to have, you have to sign things
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.680]   or you have to put, and yesterday we were talking about,
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.880]   I was talking to one of our clients about
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.960]   where to put cameras, you know, in this room.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.480]   And they said, oh, just put a couple of Xs
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:24.400]   and they sent me a PDF.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.600]   And I'm like, well, how do I do this?
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.000]   And like, you know, and I opened up PDF pro
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.560]   and just with my mouse, I mean, where were my trackpad?
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.120]   I just sat there and just drew little Xs
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.480]   in that, you know, it just popped up immediately.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.240]   There wasn't a lot to think about, just drew some Xs
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.360]   and then just immediately sent it back.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:42.000]   And it is just so fluid.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.960]   I mean, if you're signing things, if you're updating things,
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:47.800]   if you need to, you know, it's just a great way
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.320]   for you to mark up a PDF and get it back out there.
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.720]   Now, you know, you can, you know, do some of this
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.200]   if you have Acrobat Pro or whatever,
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.680]   but this, being able to do it so easily for something
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.120]   that's a lot less expensive.
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.960]   And to be honest with you, more fluid and more powerful
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:05.720]   in many ways, it's just really the way to go.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.400]   So if you get PDFs mailed to you,
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.720]   if you, instead of printing them out,
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.840]   signing them, faxing them back, if you wanna update them,
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.320]   you, you know, these are all things that you can do
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:18.720]   with PDF print and PDF print and PDF, you know,
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:21.280]   you can edit them, you can, of course, you know,
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.560]   you can use, you can go paperless with OCR,
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:26.840]   you can make your business processes just a lot easier.
[01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:29.240]   You know, your PDFs are just so much easier
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.440]   to work quickly through the process and update them.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:34.200]   So you can even add, you know, of course,
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.400]   you can add text images and signatures,
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:40.120]   so you don't need, it's not just simply marking pieces up.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.400]   You know, the big thing that I use it for is corrections.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:45.520]   So circling things, making comments on things,
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.040]   you know, deciding on, you know, you know,
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.560]   putting, giving people input is the number one reason
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:52.680]   that I use PDF pen.
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:54.480]   Now PDF pen lets you do all of those things.
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:59.480]   PDF pen pro lets you convert and create interactive forms.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:03.480]   That's something that's built into the PDF format
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.640]   is to be able to do interactive forms.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.880]   Most people don't use it because they have, you know,
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.720]   something very basic and they don't have the ability
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:10.920]   to build that easily.
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.600]   And PDF pen pro will let you do that.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.920]   You can also convert websites to multi-page PDFs,
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.560]   including the hyperlinks.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.720]   So all of that stuff can also be done.
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:21.880]   Now if you're interested in checking this out,
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:25.320]   you can go and get a free demo of PDF pen
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.440]   at smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:32.720]   So you can go there and PDF pen is $59.
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:37.320]   $59.95 and PDF pen pro is $99.95.
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.320]   If you're just doing updates, if you're just marking stuff up,
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:41.720]   you can probably get away with PDF pen.
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:44.120]   If you are interested in the interactive forms
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.760]   and converting websites to multi-page PDFs,
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.520]   go with pen pro.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.720]   And again, it's smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:55.360]   And if you have to do this as often as I do,
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.520]   it's worth every penny.
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.040]   So anyway, so check it out once again,
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.560]   smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:06.640]   Andy, do you have a Mac OS tip for us?
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.240]   Just a quick one that I picked because it's sort of really
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:13.840]   helping get through my inbox this morning,
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:16.160]   that they've added now quick look previews
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.120]   to every link that comes to you basically everywhere.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.360]   So if you go into, so especially if you're inside mail
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.360]   and someone sends you, oh, by the way, I've got,
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.920]   here's a, I've got a new product.
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:27.920]   Here's, it's really cool.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.040]   Here's a site we can take a look at what it's going at.
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.680]   Believe it or not, it actually is faster for me
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:35.520]   to just take the second and a half to keep my brain
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.200]   in the mail game.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.640]   And if there's a simple, simple selector pop up there
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.240]   that will let you quick look at that website
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.600]   that URL right within mail,
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.000]   it'll just be a little bit of a pop up
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.480]   just like every other quick look.
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.680]   And it seems to work for pretty much every single type
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:50.200]   of link that you could possibly get to.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.440]   So quick wait if it's not worth committing
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:53.760]   the tab over to Safari.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:58.760]   Or as I often do, I use the,
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:02.400]   I've got like 40 or 50 right now.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.400]   There's a, we promise, we promise a whole bunch
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.640]   of science fiction analogies here.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.680]   So we skipped the past 35 minutes.
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.400]   So I'm going to use the, the analogy of the thing.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:15.400]   We have this horrible monster that's frozen
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.800]   and so on, so stays frozen, it won't reek destruction.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.720]   As I speak on my MacBook Pro, would I do all of my work on?
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.640]   That's the status of Safari,
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.280]   because it's got like 40 windows each
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.040]   with like 10 different tabs in it.
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.600]   That's just choking everything to death.
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.720]   Unfortunately, a lot of those tabs have information
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:34.760]   that I need to copy over so I can quickly quit it.
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:37.320]   But every time, if I ever relaunch that Safari,
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:39.680]   it's going to quickly try to relaunch 200 tabs.
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:42.200]   So if I click on that link inside the mail,
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.080]   it will launch Safari and bring my entire Mac
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.600]   to a deathly death of death.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.680]   So being able to-
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:49.880]   - That's really a problem for me,
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.480]   the deathly death of death.
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:54.480]   - Especially if it's particularly deathly
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.120]   and mine is particularly deathly.
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:56.960]   - Yes, yes.
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:59.760]   - There's just, there's the well of souls effect every time
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:02.680]   that I even hover near the Safari icon at this point.
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:05.600]   So this is a way to be able to take a look at your roles
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.920]   without actually having to risk launching Safari,
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.440]   which sometimes is a bad thing.
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:11.280]   - Very good.
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:16.280]   So I think it's up, you know, my little tip for the iOS
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.320]   is creating capitals.
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.080]   So I don't know how many times you need to create,
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.240]   you know, you want to do HD
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.920]   or you want to capitalize something.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:26.000]   And you know, it's, I know it seems simple
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.600]   that you can, you click on the shift
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.840]   and then you click on the H and everything else or whatever,
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.600]   but there's actually a faster way to do that.
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.480]   And that is if you're moving really quickly
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:36.120]   and you don't want to, you know, just go into that mode,
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.480]   you can actually just click on the shift for a second
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.120]   and drag over to the letter that you want.
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.880]   And you can simply be dragging over,
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:45.920]   and it's a single, you know, you're getting the shift,
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.360]   but you're simply simply click on the shift
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.760]   and drag over to the letter.
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:52.480]   And you get that capital very quickly.
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:55.400]   And it's something that I know it seems simple,
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.840]   but otherwise, you know, a lot of times I find myself,
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:00.640]   it's just a constant extra, you know, shift this,
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.360]   shift this, shift this, shift this.
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.880]   And the drag is, I find to be a lot faster.
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:06.600]   So anyway, so that's a little one
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.440]   that someone showed me at the airport.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.520]   I was, it was not, I didn't come up with it.
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:12.240]   I can't, I should have kept their name,
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.720]   but we were talking about, what happens now is that
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.920]   if you see me in the airport, and I see, you know,
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.080]   we start talking about iPhones,
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.120]   because Apple users are still,
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.280]   even though we have, there's so many more of us now,
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:24.680]   we still have that kind of, this thing that,
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:26.120]   if someone else is using an Apple product,
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.680]   you feel like you can just walk up and sit next to them
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:28.520]   and start talking to them.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.360]   Or at least people feel like that with me.
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.600]   And so, you know, so you start trading notes,
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:34.640]   and one of my first things is, so what are the cool things
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:36.080]   that tricks that you can do with your iPhone,
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:38.800]   because I know that I have to couple something for the show.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.640]   So anyway, that's the one.
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:42.280]   I thought it was cool, and it's definitely sped things up.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:47.280]   We have an email, again, you can go to Macbreak@twit.tv,
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.560]   and this is from Valery, she said,
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.240]   I love getting all sorts of notifications on my iPad,
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:55.280]   Gmail, Twitter, Facebook, but when I go back to my Mac,
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.600]   I can't seem to find any similar options.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:01.520]   I've tried Growl, but the programs have to be open
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.440]   for the notifications to work.
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:04.720]   Is there any way to solve that?
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:07.640]   Is there any way to get some of these notifications,
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.240]   you know, going, I don't think that there is.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.800]   I think that this is a, I think all we can say,
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.200]   I think, you know, she said, "Help me, Macbreak crew,
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:15.320]   "I don't know if we're gonna be able to help you.
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:16.960]   "I don't hear that rope."
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.320]   - Oh, isn't there a push notification system now in Lion
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.560]   that nobody's taking advantage of?
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.120]   - Oh, there might be.
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.640]   Maybe that's-- - Oh, no, it may come.
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:29.800]   It would not surprise me if eventually apps get updated
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:33.720]   to do this, but you know, Growl, actually,
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.760]   some stuff like Gmail, Twitter, and Facebook,
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:38.400]   if you can set those services up to email you
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:43.400]   when things happen, you can use service, what is it?
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:48.120]   You can use a box car to send notifications
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.600]   and they go to your phone.
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:52.120]   I'm just trying to think, there's gotta be a way
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:54.400]   to send it to your Mac to using Growl or something,
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.640]   and I don't know if there's multiple hosts.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.560]   - Growl's actually sort of the same thing
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.760]   because the trick is, is that, although the apps do
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.440]   have to be running, the whole point of Lion
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.880]   and where Apple's going more is that you shouldn't have
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.360]   to worry about whether things are running or not.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:11.960]   And so if you can just have things running most of the time,
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.200]   then Growl will be the answer.
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:16.640]   Personally, I've always launched all my standard apps
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.520]   at startup because then I don't have to wait for them later,
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.080]   and so you just have this constant set available.
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.640]   So it's not, I mean, Growl's it, but maybe it's just
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.800]   a change in working behavior that might get it
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.360]   to work for you.
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.160]   - It would be nice if Growl could do something like
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:34.280]   check a mailbox or some service somewhere
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:37.440]   and get some warnings that things are happening now
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:40.240]   'cause then you could use like Google mail filters
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:43.240]   and stuff, but yeah, I think keeping a phone around
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:46.320]   for push notifications may be a better option right now.
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:48.920]   But Apple is moving on this, so it may happen
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:50.440]   in the next year or so.
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:53.400]   - All right, now we are ready for our tips of the week.
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.400]   Sorry Valerie, we want more useful for you.
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.120]   Andy, do you have a tip for us?
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:59.520]   - All right, not a tip, but a pick of the week.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.360]   - Yes.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.200]   (whistles)
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.200]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.280]   (laughs)
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:06.080]   - I'm sorry, tips, another tip.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:09.200]   - Yeah, I can only think of one useful thing at a time,
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:11.280]   but that was the one thing that was useful.
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.320]   (laughs)
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:17.000]   - My favorite, favorite new things on the App Store
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.520]   hit about a month ago.
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:21.720]   It's a really cool system wide utility called YOiNK,
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:25.880]   a YOiNK for non-Simpsons fans.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:26.960]   It's really, really cool.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.600]   If you ever had the problem where you need to drag files
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:32.640]   from one place to another, but sometimes you have to sort
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.760]   of hold this thing under the mouse pointer
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.720]   while you go to a mystical and magical land known as
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.680]   another space, or you're not really sure where you need
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:43.320]   to drill deep down into the file structure to get
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:45.800]   to the target point and you kind of lose it or drop it
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:48.760]   at some point along the way, or you know that you have
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.760]   to move, you're trying to collect together.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:53.280]   I got four or five or six files and they're kind
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.920]   of in different parts of the hard drive, but you need
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:56.880]   to open them all in Photoshop or put them all
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:57.840]   in this other place.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:01.440]   YOiNK will help you out in this regard.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:04.320]   Every time that you're in the finder and you drag a file,
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:07.520]   what happens is I've actually got it here on the iPad.
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:11.160]   And you drag a file, this cool little shelf pops up.
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:14.360]   And that only pops up when you're dragging something in.
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.960]   That's like a temporary shelf to hold files
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.840]   that you want to drag someplace else.
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:21.960]   And so long as that shelf is empty, it's completely invisible.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.880]   But when you have stuff inside the shelf
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.360]   and they're all files, it will remain there
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.640]   while there's still content in there.
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:30.000]   So now you can just simply navigate to wherever you need
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.360]   to go, be it a new finder window, a new folder,
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.520]   switch over to a different space or tab over to Photoshop
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:38.240]   or tab over to your work processor.
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:41.000]   We need to drag these image files in and then simply
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.560]   drag them right from the shelf and directly into your app.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:48.600]   So it's such a simple and natural and completely
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.160]   in obtrusive way to handle these really,
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:55.400]   which sometimes is a needlessly complicated operation.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.360]   And I love it because not only is it just $2.99,
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.560]   not only does it work really well,
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.600]   and not only does it work in obtrusively,
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.840]   but there are so many different ways
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.040]   that you can actually use it.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:08.600]   I did buy it for, but I am the sort of person who tends
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:10.760]   to just drop files wherever they happen to land
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.160]   and then I have to organize them later on.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.360]   That's really why I bought it for.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.560]   So I can just simply say this file, this file,
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:19.280]   and this file, okay, put that into the PDF folder.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:21.400]   But it seemed with this shelf available to me
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:24.520]   wherever I go, I keep using it time and time and time again.
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:26.400]   I wish it worked for random clippings,
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.240]   it only works for files, but it would be great
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:31.520]   if I could just have an image, just a selection of text
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.680]   or a selection of numbers and just keep it there
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.840]   because I know I'm gonna need it in a couple of different places
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:39.080]   or markup template that I'm gonna need someplace else.
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.720]   But I think that they're doing the right thing
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.680]   by simply keeping the focus on one task
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.040]   and do it exceptionally well.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:48.040]   So you like, love it, and it's, I think the vote
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:50.400]   of confidence on any app that you buy through the app store
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:53.720]   is how long does it take for it to go from only installed
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:56.640]   on the Mac that you were in front of when you purchased it to
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:00.400]   if the first time you sit in front of your MacBook
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.000]   and then your iMac, you notice, oh wait,
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:02.920]   I can't do that cool thing,
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:05.400]   I can do in that first one and then you click on the update
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.560]   to install it on the others.
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:09.440]   And this one spread throughout my entire network
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.120]   in about an hour, so useful.
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.920]   - That's great, yoyke.
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.360]   - It's a next shelf, it's just like NextOS.
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:19.000]   - Adam, you're a pick for the week.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.600]   - My pick for the week is the group of photo sharing website,
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:25.600]   Zang Zang, which is a whole lot of fun to say.
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.800]   And as far as I can tell, utterly random
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.360]   as far as the name goes.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:32.080]   But the basic problem is you're in a club,
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:35.200]   you have a team, you have a group of friends
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:38.720]   that you all are at an event and you all take pictures,
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.200]   how do you share them?
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:43.920]   And so what Zang Zing does is allows you to create an album
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:48.920]   that everyone can upload to and then everyone can see
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:52.120]   and there's privacy control, so albums can be private
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:56.000]   or they can be hidden or they can be entirely public.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.760]   And it's a very simple site, what's astonishing to me,
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:03.320]   honestly, I mean, can't quite tell this from the video,
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:06.480]   but it's entirely HTML5, no flash,
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:09.240]   and yet this is one of the most stunning web apps
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:12.240]   I've ever seen in what they can, in terms of what they can do.
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:17.240]   So it's yeah, zangzing.com and a free site right now,
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:19.760]   they'll probably have some kind of premium upgrade
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.200]   for people who want unlimited amounts of storage
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:26.160]   and they'll also be able to buy prints as the business model.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:30.680]   But basic accounts are free and it's definitely worth a look.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.400]   Some of the people who did it actually were behind
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:36.600]   Claris Organizer way back when and then moved on
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:39.320]   to the Newton team, so there's a Mac heritage
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.680]   behind it as well.
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:43.200]   - This is great, I mean, I've often thought about
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.640]   what would be the best way to be at a wedding
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:48.280]   or a birthday party or a football game or whatever
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:51.360]   and just have everything kind of all put it now.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:52.520]   Does it go somewhere where you can,
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:55.080]   and then you can look, you can get a hold of that album
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:56.080]   quickly and easily?
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:59.120]   - Yeah, yeah, if you go to zangzing.com/atomanks
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:00.480]   for instance, you can see with them
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:02.080]   the public albums I've done.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:05.560]   And but basically, one place I'm using it,
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.680]   which is a non-public way in fact,
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:10.040]   is with the Ithaca cross country teams
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:14.320]   because all these people have kids who are running,
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.040]   the parents go, they take tons of pictures,
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.720]   but they don't necessarily get pictures
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:22.640]   of all the kids and so, but merge them all together
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:24.360]   and there's a pretty good chance of it.
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.560]   And so for every meet, we're getting hundreds
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:32.240]   and hundreds of pictures now and everyone just adores it.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.800]   So you click on one of those and if you click the play button,
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.160]   you get a screen, you get a slide show.
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.040]   And again, all in HTML file.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.920]   - And that's all updating in real time.
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:43.560]   So you could theoretically have that projected on the wall
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.680]   and have it be, you could be at a party
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.040]   with the pictures from the party constantly
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:49.400]   updating to the screen.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.400]   - Absolutely, you can even email photos into it.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:53.280]   So if you've got a photo on your phone
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:55.680]   and you just wanna get it up there really quickly,
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:57.720]   you can just send it via email.
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:01.440]   Very impressive site and what I like about it
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:04.040]   is that it's really designed for groups.
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.600]   A lot of the websites, Flickr, Smug Mug and whatnot,
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:11.160]   you can kinda do it, but it's not really designed
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:12.240]   for that problem.
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.200]   So someone ends up having to collect the photos
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.440]   and upload them and manage them.
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:18.800]   And as we all know, the more managing of photos
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.800]   you have to do, the less likely you are
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:21.920]   to share them with anybody.
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:22.920]   - Right, right.
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:24.840]   So it's zang zing.
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:26.840]   - Yes.
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:27.840]   - It's not a whole word.
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:28.680]   - It's not a whole word.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:31.800]   - We're running out of words for things related
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:32.640]   to technology.
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:35.200]   That's the reason we gotta call it yolink
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.840]   or we gotta call it zang zing or exactly.
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.360]   - Everybody have fun tonight.
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:40.680]   - Everybody zang zing tonight.
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:42.240]   - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:47.240]   Jason, do you have another crazy name for us?
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:49.280]   - I don't.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.440]   My pick, you will be able to figure out
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:54.040]   what it is from the name, which is always good.
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:55.400]   It's a $3 app.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:57.160]   It's brand new from AppCubby.
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:59.120]   It's called TweetSpeaker.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.600]   And it does what it says on the tin.
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.640]   And this is something Siri doesn't do.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:06.600]   Siri will not read your tweets to you,
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:07.960]   but TweetSpeaker will.
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:11.000]   You can actually go back in your timeline on Twitter
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.760]   or to a list or however you wanna do it and press play.
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:15.720]   And you know what it does?
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:18.960]   It starts to read your Twitter stream out loud to you
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:21.000]   so you can be running or in the car
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.640]   or somewhere else and wanna hear what's going on
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.320]   on Twitter without actually reading it.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.720]   It does some smart expansion.
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:28.320]   It'll take a link and try to find the title of the page
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:30.240]   that's being linked to and say the name of the title.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:33.960]   If it sees an @name reference and it will try to expand
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:35.000]   that out into the full name.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.240]   So it tries to become fairly personable
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:40.640]   and interpret what these short Twitter messages are
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:43.440]   and expand them out so that they sound like a human being
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.960]   would say them and then it reads them with a computer voice.
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:47.840]   But it's a pretty cool idea.
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:49.240]   It's brand new.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.320]   There's still some bugs in it.
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:51.360]   It's trying really hard.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:56.000]   I mean, speech synthesis on an iPhone app is tricky.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.360]   But I think it's a great idea, especially if you're in the car
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:00.880]   or somewhere else where--
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:02.480]   And you have to say what's going on here.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.960]   What's the connection?
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:05.320]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:06.160]   Then it'll read it to you.
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.520]   It's like having a book on tape except it's Twitter.
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.440]   So $3.
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.680]   AppCubby tweet speaker, yeah.
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.800]   I think we have a title.
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.760]   It's like a book on tape with Twitter.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.960]   Anyway, so a tweet speaker.
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:18.680]   That sounds good.
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:20.160]   It's one of those things that you'd have to decide
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:21.960]   who you're going to listen to or what list you're going to listen
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:22.480]   to.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.640]   I'm quite frightened.
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:25.160]   No Kardashians alone.
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.200]   You could never do the people that I follow.
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:29.520]   I get a good sports list while a baseball game is on.
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.040]   I don't know.
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:30.560]   I don't know.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:31.480]   It's a cool idea.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:32.560]   That would actually be cool idea.
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:35.600]   That would be very cool to be able to grab that.
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:38.000]   So my pick of the week--
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.480]   one little one for the iPhone and then another one
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.120]   that copies the hardware.
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:44.960]   One of the-- one thing I started doing--
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:47.360]   I started testing this because I just didn't trust it.
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.840]   And it's turned out to be really useful,
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.640]   which is the United.com.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.240]   And I don't know if we have an overhead here, but--
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:54.840]   We do.
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:58.840]   Yeah, so the United.com application, which is--
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:00.520]   you can book flights, check in.
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:03.240]   But most importantly, you can have a mobile boarding pass.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.520]   And I don't think it's going to show mine.
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.000]   I already used it, so it doesn't show it.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000]   But a mobile boarding pass.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.080]   Now, what that does is that it's got a QR code
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.400]   that you can keep in here.
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:14.040]   So if you actually have one, I just used this last week.
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.480]   And you can have your boarding pass.
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.680]   You don't have to print anything out.
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:19.960]   And it feels very weird.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.880]   And it's just-- I still printed it out.
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:24.120]   And so what was funny was I went to the airport.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:25.560]   I still printed out my boarding pass.
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:27.640]   And I put it in my jacket just in case someone asked for it.
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.920]   It was like, I'm not going to get stuck somewhere without it.
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.200]   But essentially-- and you can do this through their web page
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:35.400]   as well, but the app holds it a little bit more effectively.
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:39.040]   But basically, what you end up with is a QR code
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.600]   that you can get through security.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:43.320]   You can get through-- you don't need to--
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:44.480]   yeah, you can get through security.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.560]   You can get to the gate.
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:46.680]   And when you get to the gate, they just
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:49.200]   have you just put your phone over the--
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.480]   over there, a little reader on the way in.
[01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:54.480]   And you can see all the little geeks going by.
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:56.680]   And I thought that I was really on the cutting edge,
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:59.320]   but it was like half of the people
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:01.840]   that were getting on with me all had it on their phone.
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.680]   But I was terrified to do it the first time,
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:05.080]   but I got to say-- yes.
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.560]   Very exciting, because I am constantly losing.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:11.520]   I don't lose my phone as often as I lose paper.
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:13.320]   So I wouldn't say that I never lose my phone,
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.120]   but I don't lose it as often as I'm losing paper.
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:19.200]   The only thing that got me nervous was my phone did start--
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.240]   I got down to 10% before I got on the gate.
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:24.120]   And I was like, if my phone dies,
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:26.240]   I'm not going to be able to get on the plane.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:27.760]   So that was--
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:29.200]   it's like a see from an updated version
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:30.600]   of "Plane's Trains and On Popules"
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:31.840]   where Steve Martin has all booked.
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:33.680]   He's OK to go, but then--
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.480]   Dell Gros was talking about the phone for 40 minutes.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.800]   I didn't really think about it.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.160]   I was sitting there, I was sitting there,
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:40.640]   waiting to get on, and then I was playing Angry Birds.
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.600]   And suddenly, I realized that my phone was dying.
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.720]   And I was like, I could be in a lot of trouble here.
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:50.560]   So I love these apps, and I have three different versions
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.120]   of these for all the different carriers on my phone.
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:55.200]   But every time I leave for a trip,
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:57.320]   I still print out the boarding pass.
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:00.680]   And I think to myself, you have an app that you know works,
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:02.720]   but you still have to print it out.
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:05.400]   Andy, this is something your dad would have done.
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:06.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.120]   And I have to admit that I'm--
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:11.000]   so I just started doing it.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.320]   And I'm probably going to print them out
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.200]   for the next three months.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:15.320]   And then slowly move over.
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:17.240]   So anyway, it's really a great thing.
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:18.800]   Now, the hardware piece that I wanted to show,
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:20.560]   I didn't expect to spend so much time talking about it.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:22.760]   A lot of people ask us how we back stuff up.
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:23.680]   And I thought I'd show this.
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.840]   There's a couple different developers.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:25.920]   This is the one we have.
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.640]   This is called a-- this is by Newer.
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:29.040]   And this is Voyager.
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.800]   And I don't know if you guys have seen this.
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.120]   This is-- I have-- I love it.
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:34.960]   This is a raw-- you basically put a raw hard drive in here.
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:36.040]   I should have brought a hard drive.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:37.080]   I just brought the piece here.
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.680]   But you basically drop an internal hard drive into here.
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:41.560]   And you can get cases.
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.440]   Webitec makes actually reasonably good cases,
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:46.480]   another company that makes some more padded cases,
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.480]   that you can hold them like a set decks
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:50.600]   and what you can-- like little cassettes.
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:52.160]   And so there's your little eject.
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:53.160]   You can eject it out here.
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:54.280]   You can put the power in here.
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:56.240]   The great thing about this one specifically
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:58.240]   is that you can plug it into anything.
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.080]   There's a lot of versions of this.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.920]   Having two Firewire 800 connectors is important,
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:06.160]   because it means you can put it as part of a chain.
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:07.480]   You've got Iseta.
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.960]   You've got Firewire 400.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.320]   You even got USB.
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:13.440]   So there's just-- you can get those internal drives plugged
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:14.000]   into anything.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.040]   The reason why would you want to do this was a lot of us
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.520]   are using storage.
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.640]   We're just kind of backing stuff up.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:22.720]   And then we always want to put something on the drive.
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:24.720]   And we actually transfer stuff to each other
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:25.880]   with these internal drives.
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:27.880]   Put them in a cassette deck, wrap them up, and send them.
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:29.880]   And now we're not paying for the extra case.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:31.000]   We're not paying for those things.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.520]   If we use them as a backup, we always back it up to two drives.
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:35.960]   Not one of them.
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.160]   But we do it fairly often.
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:40.880]   And I think almost every computer we have
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.880]   has one of these connected to it.
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:47.200]   So as I said, it's the Voyager Q, I think,
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:50.320]   and it's by newer and definitely worth checking out.
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.800]   I think it's about $100 or $150 or something like that.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:55.120]   It could be a lifesaver, too, because there are times--
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.240]   it's great to know that if you're
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:57.840]   having problems getting machine to boot up
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:59.200]   and getting the data off of it, you
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:01.900]   know that the nuclear option is, OK, I'm just
[01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:03.920]   going to crack this open, take out the mechanism,
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:06.320]   and then just put it inside my toaster.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.040]   And I'll at least be able to mount that hard drive
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:08.880]   and get the data off of it.
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:09.380]   Exactly.
[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:09.880]   Exactly.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:11.080]   So it's really--
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:12.480]   yeah, the little toaster is--
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:13.800]   We're saying, I don't think you mentioned
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:15.600]   it works with desktop hard drives, but also
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:17.040]   the little notebook hard drives, too.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:17.560]   Yep.
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:18.560]   Oh, it does.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:19.880]   It's got the little spot on there.
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:22.040]   I've never actually used it with a smaller one.
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:24.960]   Anyway, so those are our picks for the week.
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:27.080]   Andy, where can people find you?
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:28.800]   You can find me at Twitter.
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:32.240]   On Twitter, I'm an outgo on Google+,
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.520]   I'm also an outgo.
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:35.080]   On the web, I'm an outgo.com.
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:36.680]   I'm pretty much an outgo wherever you go.
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:40.320]   But if you can't spell, go to cwob.com
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:42.480]   and you'll find links to all that sort of stuff.
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:44.080]   Jason, where can people find you?
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:46.480]   Find me at macworld.com.
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:48.760]   On Twitter, I'm Jay Snell.
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:51.440]   And you could listen to my geeky podcast
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:54.200]   at theincompible.com.
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:57.160]   And Adam, where can people find you?
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:00.360]   Tibis.com and take control books.com and on Twitter,
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:01.560]   people can find me at Adam Anks.
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:03.000]   And luckily, having a--
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.520]   like Andy, a relatively unusual name,
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.400]   I'm pretty much Adam Anks everywhere.
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:07.400]   I'm very good.
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.360]   Or you can find him in his office
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:12.040]   at the very, very top of the Washington Monument.
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:15.120]   Pricey real estate, what a hell of a view.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:17.120]   Leo, of course, we'll be back next week.
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:18.640]   This is Alex Lindsey sitting in.
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.840]   And until next week, break time is over.
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:22.560]   You get back to work.

[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:29.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
