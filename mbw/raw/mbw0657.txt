[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.560]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we talk about the latest Apple news.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.600]   And there is Apple news. Lori Gill is here. Hello, Lori Gill.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.240]   Hello, Leo. How are you today? I am wonderful star of the fabulous Rock 'n' Roll band
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.440]   Sick Burn. And managing editor I'm more. Okay. That's a date. The boring part. The day job.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:08.320]   Also here, your boss from I'm more Renee Richie. Hello, Renee. Oh, never mind. I take it back.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.720]   Whoever the boss is. I'm talking about today. I'll hear songs and music.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.360]   Andy Inako also here from WGBH in Boston. Andrew. Hello, hello.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.960]   Andy's joining my band next to. Are you? Is he going to be on the sideburns?
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.280]   Oh, yes. Yes. I've got the professional set of spoons for her band.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.800]   And as we do almost every year, we welcome back Oliver Bridenbach. He is the founder and
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.600]   chief at Boinks Software, B-O-I-N-X.com, situated in Munich.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.880]   Yes. Hi, Oliver. Great to have you. Thank you for having me on the show.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.640]   You were out for NAB. NAB. Yeah.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.480]   Las Vegas. What used to be the National Association and Broadcasters Show?
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.000]   And what is it now? I don't know. NAB. You nabbed them, though, Leo.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.760]   You nabbed them. NAB.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.680]   NAB. And that's because Boinks does a lot of video stuff.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.920]   Yes. Boinks originally was the VVidia program, right?
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.000]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you still do that or?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.440]   It's now rebranded as MemoLife, so live video production application for Macintosh.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.640]   Yeah. So if you've got a Mac, you don't need a Tri-Caster.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.200]   You can just do MemoLife. Exactly.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.440]   This is new too. What's this mouse pose for?
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.720]   Mouse pose is if you do presentations or screencasts, you might want to show people
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.160]   where your mouse is and what keys you press and stuff like that.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.040]   Oh, yeah. So it exposes the mouse. Yes. And draws a... It's a virtual laser pointer.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.440]   Oh, I like that. Look at that. That's really cool.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.760]   It's one of those things not everybody needs, but if you know, if you do.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.160]   Yeah. I need that. I need that like now.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.520]   Do you do presentations a lot or? I do. That's videos.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.680]   Yeah. And I never... Yeah.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.080]   You know, this is one thing that always kind of bugged me about Mac OS.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.520]   Windows lets you change the cursor and make really big ones if you want or...
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.560]   And it's just like it's hard wired in the Mac.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.360]   You can shake it.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.920]   Yeah. You can shake it against big. I do that.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.000]   I do that too. Yeah.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.880]   Yeah. I think it'd be nice to have an all-time large though.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.680]   Yeah. The mouse pointer is sandboxed for our safety.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.000]   You may not mess with it. Do not let the mouse escape.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.400]   Hey, before we go to... Anyway, great to have you, Oliver.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.840]   Thank you for coming. Oliver gives us the developer's perspective,
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.760]   which we like to get from time to time.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.760]   Thank you, Renee, for filling in for me last week while I was working on my tan.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.120]   Oh, you were chasing 5G. That was a decision we made.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.440]   You were chasing the oops of 5G. It's out here somewhere on the beach and the surf at Kauai.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.840]   Yeah. Can I just say that it's kind of unfair when you come back from Hawaii looking so much
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.440]   like less pale than the rest of us? I don't know if the studio can give us any help with
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.040]  ... Oliver, that's your next feature for your streaming space. Basically, an anti-pale...
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.400]   Anti-nerd skin.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.200]   A neo-filter.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.720]   I really didn't go out into the sun to get tan at all.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.520]   And I covered myself, slathered myself with the...
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.200]   As we do these days with sunscreen, but to get a lot of sun, you can't help but turn a little orange.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.800]   You wouldn't hassle off. You can't help yourself.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.440]   You can't help but...
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.600]   Can't help it. Our hearts go out to... It was just tragic watching an other day and burn.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.040]   Yesterday, my heart was in my throat.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.480]   Already, hundreds of millions of euros have been pledged to its rebuilding.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.760]   Tim Cook, including Apple. Tim Cook tweeted... They didn't say how much, but he did sweet
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.880]   that Apple will be donating to the rebuilding efforts to help restore Notre Dame's precious
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.600]   heritage for future generations.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.720]   Isn't that ironic? Because for years beforehand, they were having enormous amounts of trouble
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:09.520]   raising money just to get the thing back to its glory and to make safety and stability
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:16.400]   improvements that it was such a big deal. And now, it's horrible that they lost their roof and
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.320]   their spire, but in the long run, we might look back and say they would not have gotten
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.800]   300, 400 million euros to absolutely fix up this place and make it safe and stable for the
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.520]   next 200 or 300 years had not this tragedy happened.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:42.000]   Yeah. Although it would be sad going to Paris and seeing what used to be the central piece of
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.160]   the architecture there. People talk about the Eiffel Tower, but I always went to Notre Dame
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.920]   on day one. It's the first place I could.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.440]   We have a little replica of it in Montreal. What's that called?
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.360]   I think it's just Notre Dame. I think it's just they built a day.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.880]   It's a day of life here. They're nothing like a...
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.120]   L'otre d'on.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:10.480]   All right. There is a lot of Apple news today. I can't be right.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:17.520]   I know. What happened? I spent two hours reading up last night. That's no fair.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.920]   I know. This is supposed to be our vacation in between WWDC.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:30.880]   Yes. Apple, according to the Financial Times, which I would pull up except they're paywalled.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:37.040]   So I can never read their articles. Fortunately, others rehash for us. This is from 9 to 5,
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.520]   Mac. Financial Times says Apple is spending half a billion dollars
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.480]   to develop games for Apple Arcade. That kind of makes sense,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:52.720]   because we were wondering, well, who's going to do this, these exclusives,
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:59.920]   and forgo a chance to make money? Well, if Apple's given you 20 million to write a program,
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.720]   maybe you would. Maybe you would.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.440]   Getting a full season order from YouTube TV and not having to worry about something you show.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:14.640]   This news comes alongside the news that Apple's spending almost the same on texture.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:22.240]   So we didn't know. We knew Apple bought texture last year, almost more than a year ago.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.120]   That was the magazine subscription app that eventually became news plus. But we didn't know
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.400]   how much. It's the New York Post of all people, not the most reliable of papers,
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.680]   but they say that Apple paid $100 million upfront. That sounds about right.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:45.200]   To the publishers who started a texture, which all magazine publishers kind of
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:53.600]   nasthurst, Meredith and Rogers, KKR, which invested there in VC from also got a cut.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:09:01.440]   But according to the Post, there's also a guaranteed pay out, minimum pay out of $145 million for
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.040]   the first year for those publishers. In the second and third year, Apple guarantees $240 million.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.520]   When you add it all up, we're talking almost half a billion dollars for texture.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:18.960]   Real money. The Apple's laid out if you include what they paid or were rumored to have paid for
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:25.200]   TV+, now $2 billion to beef up its services business. But since they made $9 billion last year,
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.640]   I guess maybe it's worth it. Yeah. I think they're really banking that this is going to work.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.400]   That's like putting all of it chips on it. Yeah.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.120]   On red. Right. That's like. It's a known strategy. It's just not an Apple strategy.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.160]   Apple typically would run things at break even. Apps were quickly went above break even,
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.000]   but they would run iTunes content and movies and all of those things, which were expensive to
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.280]   acquire, but they would sell them for just barely above break even so they could provide content
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.400]   and increase hardware sales. Now we're, again, at that point where the hardware markets are all
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.680]   super mature and they might just see that this is the sort of what they need to do to increase
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.080]   the value of their devices, to keep selling and encouraging upgrades on those devices.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.560]   And then it becomes sort of an investment in the overall experience, if not the specific devices.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.320]   Well, that's what changes when you become a services company, as opposed to a hardware company,
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.720]   right? I mean, they've always been a product company. To me, like when you say it's a software
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.320]   company, but they make hardware, they're a hardware company, but they do. Apple has all of those
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.960]   sort of pieces. They like, there's like a full widget company from the very, from the silicon
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.840]   all the way up to the pixels. And this, but they were in, but not the services picture,
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:40.080]   but not a content company. They made so much, right? Yeah, well, they made like iWork and iLife,
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.800]   which aren't content the way you typically think about them. But when you look at like arcade is
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.920]   also software, it's just entertainment software and not productivity software. So it's like they,
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.160]   they want to provide this full on experience for you. So you get an iPhone, you sit down
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.000]   and yeah, you can run apps and you can use the web and you can make phone calls, but you also have
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.800]   all this. And the TV itself is becoming a problem. It's not homogenous like music. You can't just
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.320]   get Spotify or just get Apple music and get everything. You have to get Netflix and then do you want
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.640]   Disney Plus? Because I know I do now and do you want these other things and they might be seeing
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.440]   themselves as a modern day digital hub where you don't, you don't necessarily want or get everything,
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.160]   but it's the easiest place to watch and manage all these different services that keep accruing
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:29.120]   into our wallets. But it also reflects the fact that this streaming services, whether it's digital
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:36.960]   music, whether it's a video, music or even games, it's becoming so fragmented at this point because
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:42.720]   of companies like Disney being able to aggregate so much content in and of themselves and being
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.520]   able to build the infrastructure to launch their own services. The idea that you can subscribe to
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.600]   Netflix and have a really good chance that whatever movie you want to see is going to hit Netflix
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.320]   eventually, that window is really closing. The idea that you'll be able to subscribe to something
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:05.760]   and not have to factor in, well, what studio owns the content that I really want to watch on
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:11.200]   Hulu, that window is also closing. And so that if Apple, I think Apple is just aware that if they
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.880]   don't start creating their own content or locking in their own content that's unique to their services,
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.480]   they're going to get locked out by Disney and by Hulu and by Netflix and by every other service
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:28.960]   that is also trying to get things within their own private walls and try to turn us into a world
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:34.480]   in which we owe $9 a month to eight different people to get what we used to get off of a $40
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.240]   cable subscription 10 years ago. I mean, I've actually started thinking that there might be a time where
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:47.680]   I cut the cable like two years ago. I might come back to Verizon and say, hi, can I have my cable
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.560]   back? That didn't work out so well. I'm sorry about those all the things I wrote about you.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:59.360]   The way you're describing Apple versus like Hulu and Netflix and Apple being locked out,
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.320]   though it doesn't, there's sort of different ways of describing this because Apple's never been
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:10.960]   a streaming service. It's been basically a store that provides these streaming services from
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:17.360]   distributors. And in this case, it doesn't seem like Apple would be getting locked out because all
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.880]   Apple was ever doing previously was providing a means to share those apps, to share those services.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:31.680]   I do think it's odd to me that Apple is joining the content creation world when Disney Plus was being
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:38.080]   unveiled and they were talking more about the details about it. I thought, well, this makes sense.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:45.200]   Disney makes movies. Disney makes TV shows. So an app that delivers the content that Disney has
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.480]   been creating all these years, all in one tight little package, it makes sense to me. But now,
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:57.120]   Apple is the new, it's trying to be Disney, it's trying to be Warner Brothers, it's trying to be
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:05.280]   all these other movie and TV show distribution companies. But so late to the game that it's
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:12.320]   hard for me to kind of wrap my head around what Apple is doing when it comes to its exclusive movies.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:17.360]   Not alone. I don't even know if Apple understands what it's, but it's plans. I mean, for a while,
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.080]   I think Apple had hopes of being an aggregator. They wanted to be the place you'd go if you cut
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:28.400]   the cord, Andy, because all the stuff that you wanted would be in this one place on your Apple TV.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.280]   But then that didn't work out so well because the networks wouldn't play ball. I couldn't get
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:38.400]   other content creators to play ball. So then they said, oh, okay, maybe we should maybe we should
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   create our own content. And I think that's what we saw last month in their announcement, which is
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:51.840]   a very confused Apple. They didn't know, are we a creator? Are we an aggregator?
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:57.600]   Did you see Benedict Evans essay on that? I thought that was super interesting because a lot of times
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.680]   we look at things through the lens of we've been following Apple for 20 years, and this is what
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.600]   we expect Apple to do. And they're a tech company. I remember somebody asked Apple at the event,
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.320]   you know, are you still a tech company, which got a real interesting sort of, yeah, of course,
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:15.040]   we're a tech company, but we're using technology to do XYZ. And Ben's point was, I think, really
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.560]   apt. He said that, you know, we're looking at this and when he doesn't make any sense. And
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.800]   meanwhile, if you step back and you look at it, Apple is transforming from it just works to you
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.200]   can just trust it. And that sounds like something really simple and stupid. But when you look at
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.840]   all the various things that are coming up, the services, everything that's going on, trust is a
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:37.040]   fundamental issue. I was joking about Facebook before the show began. But just being able to go to
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:42.320]   a place and sanely manage all of these things with a company that you trust to respect your privacy
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.200]   could be a huge valuable service. And I think it's entirely in keeping with Apple's sort of
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:54.240]   product outlook going back to that digital hub day. He says really that it's brand. And I think
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:00.080]   that that's pretty clear that Apple, even going back to when they first announced the addition
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:06.640]   Apple Watch, the gold $25,000 Apple Watch, had started thinking of itself and its strength as
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:12.800]   being its brand more than any more than any product. Yeah, and almost a fashion brand.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:18.000]   I don't know if a fashion brand, but I've always for a long, for a long, for a long,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.920]   for a long, long time of voice thought that Apple is a design company that articulates its
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:30.560]   desire to design things and a point of view through technology. I don't think it's been a long time
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.600]   since they've been, I consider them a technology company. That doesn't mean that they don't make
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:42.000]   brilliant technology, but I think that what moves them is design. And they're facing kind of a bad
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.160]   mojo coming up because I really think the Apple TV hardware is the their ghost of Christmas
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:54.160]   future when it comes to the iPhone and even the iPad, because there's really almost no reason to
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.760]   buy an Apple TV device, because you can buy something that is even more capable that will also get
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.720]   almost all of the content with let's rewind the clock to 2018. Every single piece of content that
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.880]   you could possibly get is not through an Apple app. It's going to be through a third party app,
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:15.040]   and you can get that on a $40 Chrome stick. It's very or a $40 Roku stick, very, very easy.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.800]   And they're really looking, seeing the writing on the wall that there's going to be a time where
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.440]   a iPhone is also going to be negligible. And if they're, they can't let themselves be in a
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.000]   position where they never have a product that is interchangeable with something else. So if they
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.880]   can no longer make a streaming box, okay, they never did make a streaming box that really made a
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.720]   really good convincing case that yes, you should definitely buy this thing with an Apple logo on it.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:43.040]   They can say that number one, we have content that no one else has, but also as as said before,
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:48.560]   the idea that we're going to give it to you in a package where you're going to trust us that
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.840]   all the companies telling us, telling, telling consumers, we're not going to tell you exactly
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:18:01.280]   what we're doing or how we're making or how our business plan requires you to be complacent.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.280]   But trust us that we're going to hit you with a much, much blunter stick
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.200]   that anybody else is going to hit you with. Oliver, you develop only for the Mac, right?
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:16.240]   Do you have Windows products? No. No. So I'm really curious what a software company thinks
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:21.680]   when it looks at this, because when you started Buynx, you were writing software for a computer
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:27.520]   company, right? A company making hardware to run software. How does it feel to make a software
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.520]   for a fashion brand or a luxury brand? It's a different business. It's great. It's great.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:38.800]   You don't mind? No, no. But with the announcements last month, I was also very confused.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:47.440]   And I'm looking at this from like the user and the fan is in design perspective. And the TV app
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:54.000]   is the strangest thing Apple has ever done, because they created this Apple TV and it was supposed
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.120]   to be this cool thing with the apps on it. And now they have an app with the apps inside it.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:06.080]   And so it's like... And not very well represented inside it. No, it's not. It's like, why should I
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:12.880]   start the device and then start an app to get to the content? Right. I mean, to the content that's
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.960]   already there in other apps. I agree with you 100%. Because I know that I exit out of the TV app
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.200]   half the time. Not 100% of the time. Half the time, which means it's half working.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:26.560]   Yeah. Which is the worst kind of working. For me, it's not working because I have different
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:38.560]   different iCloud and Apple and iTunes accounts. And if you have that, then you see the movie
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:44.880]   where it says coming up or next up or whatever. And you click on it and then it says, this movie
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:50.400]   is not available in your country in Amazon or whatever. I was looking at it. But this place,
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:56.480]   the movie I was watching, so it's very confused. I think the confusion in the app reflects the
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:05.120]   confusion out of it feeling inside inside. Maybe that's it. Maybe Apple internally,
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:10.000]   because they don't really tell us. But maybe internally they have a coherent plan for all this.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.240]   But it doesn't look that way. It seems like Apple is always in sort of a transition. And
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:20.240]   everything is in chaos. And they are transitioning from one thing to another.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:28.160]   And that's kind of, I think they have to either accelerate the transitions or maybe be more
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:36.480]   consistent. One thing is like the new iMac, which is faster than the iMac Pro.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:41.760]   And cheaper. And it doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.040]   Benedict in his piece, which you're right, Renee is a very good piece,
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:56.640]   says this is the nature of an evolving tech space. He says it's a broader narrative about the
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.840]   evolution of tech as we've moved to higher and higher abstraction layers, from a command line
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:08.160]   to gooies, then to touch, and from local software to cloud software. Some stuff disappears in the
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.920]   lower layers. But new problems appear in the upper layers. It's a confusing space. And I don't think
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.440]   Apple is alone in kind of having lost its way. But I think it's a challenge. And I don't know if
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:26.800]   deciding, okay, brand, that's it. That's our future. It's the brand in an era where
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:33.360]   brands seem to be becoming less important. That as consumers become more sophisticated,
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:40.640]   as information becomes more easily accessed, people are making smarter decisions. And I think
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:45.440]   consumers who in the past might have said, well, I'll just do Apple and not worry about it,
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:50.080]   are now saying, well, but do I want to subscribe to this and not that, they're actually doing
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:55.440]   what Andy's doing. They're trying to make some some fiscal decisions that are smarter than just
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:01.120]   saying, well, I'll buy Tide because that's the best. I think Apple's brand right now, though,
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.200]   and I think going forward is going to make it really stand out as privacy.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.600]   That's what I'm saying is brand is brand is less important now than ever.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:16.240]   But if your brand is privacy, I think that makes it more important. It's not that Apple is trying
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:22.320]   to be its own brand so much. I think is that it's trying to campaign to the public that privacy
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.520]   is its brand. The problem we had at Tech TV, I've told a story before an executive told me this.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:32.160]   He said, Leo, advertisers don't like us because brand is the refuge of the ignorant.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:41.520]   A smart consumer isn't just going to buy the same. When I was a kid, you were a Chevy family
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.320]   or you were a Mercedes family. You just bought the same car brand year after year. There was a
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:53.520]   loyalty to the brand that seems to be going away because people aren't as ignorant anymore.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.480]   They want to make good decisions and they have the information now easily available
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.120]   to make those good decisions. We had problems at Tech TV because advertisers thought,
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.480]   "Well, I don't want to put ads on that channel because that's smart people."
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:12.240]   And they won't fall for it. My argument was, "Well, yeah, well, then what's Apple?" Because
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.560]   clearly smart people buy Apple because of the brand. They buy one Mac after another.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.200]   But I don't know if that's true anymore.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.960]   Lego Nintendo has a special cache that's based on brand.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.800]   But isn't that wearing nostalgia?
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.760]   Isn't that wearing all of it?
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.680]   But if you look at brand marketing, Samsung still spends billions and billions of dollars
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.280]   so that the Samsung name is everywhere.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.960]   They just had a terrible quarter.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.040]   But nobody had a good one.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.280]   It's relative to the market.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.760]   And if you walk into that carrier store, they're still banking a lot of money that you're going
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.960]   to see 800 phones and maybe you've done research, but you'll immediately recognize the Samsung one.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.200]   Or at least that's the name you're going to know and that's the point.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.440]   It's there. So they're doing it so that you will have to opt out of Samsung rather than opting
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:58.080]   into somebody else. You'll have to discount them for some reason and then move on rather than them
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:58.880]   being the next thing.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.200]   Is that exactly what the iPhone is? The iPhone doesn't innovate in any respect,
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.280]   but people just buy iPhone after iPhone.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.880]   Well, so I would argue, I think innovation is the most misused word in technology right now
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.720]   because when you look at even simple things, I was going over this last week because
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.240]   I was with my friends from Android Central and they're taking all these amazing pixel photos
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.440]   and they're like, "Ah, the app's not launching." They're like, "Oh, look, the update came out and
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:24.160]   now it fails to save fewer photos than it used to save." And if Apple said that, they would be
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:29.040]   annihilated in the press, but it's just part of living with that thing. And when you look at Apple,
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.040]   like, it doesn't get pressed, but they make a custom storage controller so that you don't fail
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.680]   to save photographs. And they put a ton of effort in doing things like Apple Watch, like AirPods,
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.920]   that it's not a folding phone and they've never been like first to the folding anything or first
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:47.760]   to any market, but they have so many things that I would term real advantageous innovation that
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.720]   just ends up making a more reliable, more trustworthy, more satisfying product for the end user.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.640]   Oh, come on, right. And I think that does the often loyalty.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.720]   I think you're crazy. What are you smoking?
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.560]   Oh, I mean, that's nuts. I would say that I could tell you that.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.960]   How do you like that Apple keyboard, that ultra reliable Apple keyboard you've been using?
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.640]   It's like, "Oh, they screwed up on a keyboard."
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.920]   No, but there's a lot of that. There's a lot of that, right?
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:15.200]   Yes, there is. I would argue that you could actually stack up every issue that Apple's having right
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.440]   now. You'll find more of them in almost every other company and they're not dealt with as well.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.520]   And when you look at the market relatively, you take a frustration point to move,
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.600]   but you also take a satisfaction point to stay. And I think one of the reasons why Apple has such
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.920]   high retention rates and they lose far fewer customers to Android than they gain from Android
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.600]   every year and they do that in almost every market, it's because they're doing those simple
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.640]   things. They're not doing all of them right. They're not doing all of them well, not doing all of them
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.000]   timely, but if you actually sit down and make the list, they're doing enough of them that it's
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.520]   letting them increase market share and increase in most quarters, increase market share and
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:52.720]   increase revenue, even in maturing markets. I think Apple succeeds because it's got a brand,
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.840]   but I don't think brand is ultimately going to save anybody in the long run. People are getting
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:05.840]   smarter. I'm fortunate because I can try any phone I want. And I just use the phone that is the
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.480]   best in that quarter and there's no winner every year.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:15.200]   Right now, the Samsung Galaxy S10 plus beats Apple iPhone in every respect. And I was very
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:22.240]   happy with the 10s Max, but once I started set, you know, I set up the Samsung, there was it was
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:27.120]   not even close. I think that's I think still like again, six months later, and we'll see what happens
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:33.120]   in another six iPhone, maybe Apple. But we're not living with this brand. And admittedly,
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.880]   most people do go by brand because it's convenient. It's easy. I just get another.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.400]   They also have to live for three years or four years with the phone they buy. And I think that's
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.320]   a different experience than we get where we move from phone to phone so often. Yeah.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.760]   Well, on the other hand, we do have our daily drivers. And so we do accumulate experience,
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:56.480]   a deep experience with one platform, even as we sample other platforms. I would only say that my
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:03.040]   experience with Android is not what you describe from your conversations with the folks at
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:10.720]   Android Central. I really can't find a stability difference between my Android phone and a
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:16.960]   iPhone at this point. I do believe knowing how the iPhone works internally that it is going to be
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:22.880]   more stable in the long run. But the Apple's real difficulty isn't so much that people are
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:30.000]   stupid or people are getting smarter. It's that the level of craftsmanship in both hardware and
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.520]   software is now so high across the board that you would have to have a certain level of incompetence
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:42.400]   not to make a phone that works really, really well, that rarely rebalances rarely gives you a problem.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:48.640]   And so it's now above the level where people think, okay, this is a stable phone no matter
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:54.560]   which one I buy. And so now Apple has the problem of making sure that they're keeping their existing
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:28:00.400]   customers happy. And they continue to create these really wonderful phones every other year that
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:05.920]   has that feature that really will tempt any fan of any other platform to come on board.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:13.280]   So it's the difficulty is that most people aren't like us. They're not necessarily fans of technology.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.560]   They buy phones the way that I buy cars. Like I want, I've got a level that I need to hit.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.800]   Where is it reliable? Yes, good few mileage. Yes, it's a good condition. Yes. Okay, it could be any
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:27.920]   of seven different makes any of seven different models. I'm not going to get nitpicky about how
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:34.240]   well wrote and here's a 10 year study of how the Honda functions over time versus how the Toyota
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:39.920]   functions over time. And if Apple has really made its business, if they've made its business,
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:47.280]   on making sure that they are 5% better than everybody else, and that 5% won't get them above
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:53.280]   a certain palpable level of stability or fit and finish compared to their competitors,
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.400]   then Apple now has a hardware problem they didn't have five or 10 years ago.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:01.920]   Yeah, I mean, I think Leo's point about Samsung is really up. And I think Samsung is getting lost
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.840]   in the shuffle this way too, because there are so many new and exciting phones come out. But when
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.960]   I was going back and looking like again, it's not me, it's Android Central. I was an article
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.400]   saying I'm fed up with the Pixel. Droid Life has an article saying what the hell is happening
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.680]   with the Pixel. Mark has is like I'm switching back to the OnePlus because I can't take the
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.000]   Pixel anymore. And that's after the review cycle. And it's not published as much. And people are
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.440]   unlocking Samsung phones with YouTube videos and they're beating the sensor with fingerprints.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.200]   And all those stuff are small and insignificant and people may not care about it. But in some
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.000]   total, when you talk to a lot of people, that's one of the reasons why they get intense scrutiny
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.200]   on iPhones. They can see every flaw up front. They get beaten up early on the review cycle.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.880]   It's probably a lot of the devil universe is the devil you don't know. But there does seem to be
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:50.240]   an underlying threat of just trust and reliability that is at least maintaining Apple's image as far
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.240]   as phones are going. It's a valid point for marketing. Absolutely.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:01.840]   Yeah, we'll see.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:07.680]   Like you said, Samsung had a terrible quarter too. So it's not getting any easier.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:14.880]   No, it's also significant to know that Pixel as I think do think I do think the Pixel is the best
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:21.200]   Android phone all around as a whole package. But the studies just came out a couple years ago
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:27.680]   looking at who is buying where are Pixel by who where are Pixel phone buyers coming from? And
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:33.920]   five to one they're sappet the Pixel sabotaging Samsung sales, not iPhone sales. So they really
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.480]   not there's really is very little compelling reason for a lot of people to switch from an iPhone to
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.320]   Android if they're already happy with the iPhone, including if they're happy with the price of the
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:52.080]   Android of the iPhone. Well, it seems to me like maybe Apple is at a comparative point like
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:58.480]   Microsoft was a couple of years ago when a lot of people stayed with Windows just because they
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:07.040]   were locked into the ecosystem. And I see a lot of people, you know, telling me that they're using
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:16.480]   Macs or iPhones only because they invested in the iPhone and the iCloud stuff. And so it's
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:22.960]   it seems to be for them to be more inconvenient to move to a different platform than to stay on
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:29.600]   the on the iPhone platform or the Mac platform. And then I think it's something maybe Apple is
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:36.000]   not aware of or if they are then they've cultivated. They've cultivated it. I mean,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.320]   I mean, they want to know, of course, now, I mean, the you have to look at what I could
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:48.880]   really have to say to Microsoft. I mean, they they've rebounded, but they they really crashed
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:56.320]   because they had to pivot because once custom once is locked in went away or this perceived
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:04.080]   lock in went away. So it was for for the IT department, this was easier to just let people use an
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:12.320]   iPhone than to make them use Windows, the Windows phone. And so so the whole Microsoft thing crashed
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:19.200]   and and burned. And I think Apple is sort of at this this point where it's it's fairly dangerous
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:25.920]   for them to assume that just because they have a lot of money that's gonna, you know, make sure they
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:33.600]   and a high market valuation to make sure that this and true is their right continuing success. And I
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.680]   I'm, you know, I think that's why you see them thrashing around a little bit. I think I understand
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:44.320]   that that and Microsoft was very fortunate or very clever to make that pivot. Yeah, I think a lot
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:49.680]   of bring your own device killed Windows because all of a sudden IT department couldn't say, no,
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:56.640]   no, you can't you can't use an iPhone for for a while. I thought having the same people at the
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:04.400]   top of the company is sort of, you know, I guarantee for stability, but I think maybe some of the
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:11.920]   people most of the executive team has been their way too long now. So that's I think though,
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:17.200]   you have to give them some credit for at least maybe they're efficient on hook, but at least
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:24.640]   they're squirming. They're not a small people. I mean, they have to they have to know some things,
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:30.640]   but for example, the whole keyboard disaster where it seems like they're totally unaware of
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:36.000]   the real problem, because most people don't take their laptops to repair the keyboards,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.920]   and they look at the numbers and see, okay, like, well, half percent of the of the laptops come back
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:47.280]   for repairs. So everybody's happy. Everybody's happy, but nobody's happy because nobody brings in
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:55.840]   his laptop for repairs. If it takes like, what is it now two weeks to get back and yeah, and so I
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:04.400]   think I think some of the I mean, you know, it's just my feeling is that maybe it's time for a
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:10.880]   couple of changes now, you know, I feel like there is an imminent crisis, I agree. And I also feel like
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:16.960]   Apple's recognizing it, but I don't but it's a challenge for any company. It was kind of a miracle
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:22.960]   that Microsoft was able to make turn that corner. And but they only were because they made big
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:28.800]   changes to the management. They covered his uniform. Yeah. Yeah. All right, let's take a little
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.880]   grateful. It wasn't even in that picture. They got it the basketball game. Was he at the Clippers
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:37.680]   game? Was he using an iPhone? That would be ironic. Here's the guy who laughed when the iPhone
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:43.200]   came out and said, nobody will buy that. Oh, he had to, right? Well, it's true. That was his job.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:49.840]   Hey, it's great to have Oliver Briden back here of Boinks software, B O I N X dot com. I want to
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:56.080]   ask you about N A Bs in town for N A B the big broadcasting show Renee Richie also hear from I
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:01.520]   more Renee will go down with a ship, right? You're gonna you're gonna know I was only on
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:06.560]   Microsoft and they stopped. If Apple stopped serving my needs, I will quit so fast. All right.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:14.640]   All right. Good. All right. I finally bought a ThinkPad X one extreme because I just I was waiting
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:20.480]   for the 16 inch MacBook Pro. I was waiting for Apple to say, Hey, we've got a great new keyboard
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.960]   design. Neither things. Those things will happen on neither of those things will happen this year.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:32.960]   So unfortunately, I have to go to the dark side. We're glory. You'll also hear managing editor at
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:38.720]   I'm more dot com Andy Anaco from Boston Public Radio. Great to have all three of you. If you ever come
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:44.160]   to the studio, did you did we make you fill this out? Oliver? I think you're a guest. So you don't
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:50.960]   have to, but all of our visitors in our audience signed in via envoy. How was that experience? It's
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:56.320]   not if you if you'd come before and I think you guys had you probably remember that 18 page
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:03.520]   legal document that we made you read and sign envoy has replaced that a better way to welcome
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:09.680]   guests to your modern lobby and be ready for whatever comes through the door envoy visitors
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:14.480]   is one of the many apps. This is the envoy visitors. It's a it's an iPad app. We're running out on a
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:23.120]   nice iPad mini and it's a great way when visitors come to your business. You see our logo tap to sign
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:30.080]   in. They sign in on an iPad kiosk and are there details. They sign our legal disclaimer saying if
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:36.720]   you trip and fall over a wire, we didn't do it or NDA's. In fact, when you go to any almost any
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:42.400]   Silicon Valley company now, you'll be signing in on envoy. And then envoy notifies their host.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:47.360]   It automatically alerts the employee they're visiting that their guest is here saves you time
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:52.400]   and hassle and improves your security. Your employee knows who's coming and when no more
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:59.120]   surprises in the lobby. And you can even say, Hey, a VIP is coming and make sure that everybody
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:07.600]   knows the VIP has arrived. When that's happened. Oh, Oliver's here. We knew when Oprah comes to our
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:12.080]   studio, we will be ready. Oh, yeah, I just want to say we will be ready to get an envoy. You get
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:18.400]   an envoy. Envoy also has a we have this on here too, our delivery app. So when the delivery guy comes,
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:26.000]   the delivery log will automatically notify the employee that their packages at the front desk.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:32.400]   This is just more efficient. It's a better way to do it. Smart security that isn't intimidating.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:38.160]   Your guests actually enjoy. There's no paper logbook, which is too bad because when Colombo comes,
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:44.240]   he can't say, I want to see your your dash calendar. Actually, it's much more useful.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:48.320]   They can you could search for through stuff you can sign in unlimited visitors. Yes, you could
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:55.840]   print customized badges, even notify security or administrators if unattended guests are
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:02.240]   wondering the building. It works with your existing security systems. So you can give people Wi-Fi
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:08.000]   access. You can check IDs, emergency notifications, and you'll have the data on who comes to the
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.240]   office, when and more. I love envoy. Envoy visitors works with the tools you already use. So those
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:20.080]   notifications can come through Slack. It can save to G Suite box. It works with Salesforce chatter.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.760]   Everything that you use already, it's designed to help companies of all kinds and sizes,
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:32.640]   even those in highly regulated industries meet security and compliance requirements.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:41.440]   Nike uses envoy, Pinterest uses envoy, Spotify uses envoy over 30 million visitors have been
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:47.920]   welcomed and signed in to the modern lobby. We're so thrilled to have envoy. I think you will be
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.800]   to protect your people, your property, and your ideas without being less welcoming.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:58.960]   The welcoming way with envoy. See why 10,000 workplaces worldwide choose envoy to make a
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:05.840]   great first impression, including Twit. Go to envoy.com/twit envo.com/twit and you can get a free trial
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:15.200]   right now, envoy.com/twit. Oh Deutsche Bank uses envoy. We'll be subpoenaing those records any day now.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:21.760]   Thank you, envoy. This is a better way to sign it. Now we've got to put this back at the front desk
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:29.920]   and we're so moken use it when somebody shows up. I don't want to be hard on Apple. I'm a little
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:37.920]   frustrated I have to admit by the current Mac situation. I have to say that in hindsight,
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:47.680]   that event with all the movie stars was something less than satisfying. It was more confusing
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:57.840]   and disturbing I think than ultimately. I think everything else that Apple is doing in terms of
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:02.480]   services makes a lot of sense to me. I think Apple Arcade makes a lot of sense. These are
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:09.120]   developers that already exist in the world and Apple is giving a platform or a spot for them
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:16.640]   and making it special and exclusive and saying for a little bit of extra money we can invite you
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.960]   into this world where we make sure that the developers that are putting their games in this
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:27.360]   particular sphere are top notch and we're helping pay for that. The news app is similar to that.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:37.040]   Buy into these magazines and you've got this sort of network of media that you can really dig into
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.680]   but Apple didn't make these magazines themselves. They didn't create the content for these magazines.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:49.840]   They're not creating the content for the apps. To me that makes a lot of sense. I think very
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:55.680]   specifically I'm still struggling with the TV related and I think maybe when it comes out we're
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.440]   going to understand it better and we're going to know what Apple is doing with it. I think we just
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:05.120]   weren't given enough information to really get what's happening or where they're going with it.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.840]   I think that's why we're reading a lot of negative information about it. A lot of people saying that
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:16.400]   I think I read I don't remember the article but that Disney Plus is definitely the winner when
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.880]   it comes to the two services that are coming out at the end of this year. Disney Plus and
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:25.840]   Apple TV Plus are coming out later this year around the same time. We should mention that
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:33.040]   AT&T has sold its stake in Hulu to Disney. Disney now is 100%. No? They didn't sell to Disney.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:38.960]   They sold it back to Hulu. NBC Universal for instance didn't want Disney to get an even larger
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:44.640]   stake in the service. Disney now does not control Hulu. I thought that was the case. They have
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:49.920]   their name. They own 60% of the shares. Yes exactly. But it's important to know that AT&T didn't sell
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:55.840]   it directly to Disney. They sold it basically. That's basically it was Hulu buying itself back
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:00.720]   and they've yet to decide how those percentage points are going to be distributed amongst Hulu's
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:07.680]   partners. So they're going to try to distribute it in a way that Disney 60% is not.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:13.760]   So this is just as i-gird needs. But that's exactly the problem that we're going to be facing.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:21.600]   That it's very much in now that Disney owns Fox. So many Fox programs are important parts of the
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:27.840]   Hulu service. How long is it going to take before Disney says that we'd much rather have 100% of
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:33.680]   the profits from the Simpsons and Bob's Burgers and Family Guy by having as part of Disney Plus
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:42.560]   than 60% of what it makes for Hulu. So a year ago Hulu was evenly divided among Disney Fox and
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:51.280]   Comcast. But then Disney bought Fox and they said Disney Fox that's 60%. AT&T had 10 Comcast had
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:59.360]   was another 30. So now it's Disney 60 Comcast 30 and there's this 10 points which could be awarded
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:04.960]   at Comcast but it still would be only 40. Tom Castones and E.C. Universal. Is that right?
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.880]   So I mean Disney controls Hulu at this point. Is that correct?
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:17.040]   Yes and no. They would be if they did decide to unilaterally pull all of the Fox content or
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:23.040]   basic every piece of content that they necessarily own off of the Hulu channel. They would have to
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:28.880]   explain to regulators and to their partners why they weren't just trying to kill Hulu.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:33.760]   They would have to make sure that that they could defend that they need to have to defend that
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:39.440]   choice to the government and to their fiscal partners. So why is Apple not done a deal with
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.720]   Disney of some kind? I thought they were tight. Disney doesn't need them.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:49.280]   You know what I would love though is if Disney Plus and TV Plus were combined into one low-cost
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:56.320]   streaming service that you could watch. Plus 50 a month. Yeah. I'd spend 50 cents extra for that.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:00.880]   That $7 price has to be an entry price right? They're not going to. It's too low for them.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:06.640]   I was thinking that too. I don't know but my immediate thought was oh $7.99 for the next
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:12.480]   two or three years and then it'll go up to $9.99. Yeah look what Google just killed me with YouTube
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.480]   TV. I started at the very beginning. It was $35. I've been paying $35 a month and then just sent
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.680]   me no saying oh by the way it's gonna be $50. Sorry. Yeah. That's a big shock too.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:31.680]   So is that it's like so when I saw the presentation where they brought out Oprah as the new Messiah.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:38.080]   Do you know who Oprah is? Yeah I know who Oprah is. She's known. I think I remember that she tried to
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:44.880]   when she left the major network she started her own network and that didn't
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:54.480]   obviously didn't work out so well. So now she's trying to get back. So I wonder if that is
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:02.480]   sort of like a model for what's going to happen to Disney plus I mean they are going to try to
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:09.920]   do their own thing and then maybe. But Disney has a lot of content. Disney has Star Wars Disney
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:15.440]   has Marvel Disney. It has 92% of my childhood. Yeah it always Renee Richie's childhood. That's
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:21.360]   better than anything. It has the Magic Kingdom it has Muppets it has Fox it has Star Wars it has
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:26.720]   Marvel doesn't have to digress high school though right? It might be aggressive. It has
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:35.040]   digress here not. Yeah but I think I think the current kids a lot of their childhood is on YouTube.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:41.440]   And so I'm not sure if that is a really interesting world we're in but where everything is up in
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:48.080]   the air because of this new generation that didn't grow up watching TV at all. So there's so much
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:54.320]   content now and Netflix does their own content. You can't watch it all. So maybe if it's only
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:59.760]   available for an extra price then people will just not watch it. I mean it's like do you have to
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:05.360]   watch that stuff or don't it seems a little retro for Apple to say. We're going to watch a streaming
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:10.640]   TV service today out of original programming right which upsets me because I loved Cobra Kai.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:17.280]   Yeah I'm going to do a written on any YouTube is just as confused as everybody else. They've gone
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:23.440]   from growing kick videos to original content to quality content to I don't know.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.240]   Just an easy Mark has Brownlee show today which is interesting.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.560]   What's that? He's going to review the original Game Boy.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.840]   Like that's a show. Yeah it's going to be a YouTube original he's going to review technology
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:38.720]   I think that came out before he was born. See what I think happens and I think what Oprah's doing
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:43.520]   is all of these people are saying well let me just cash out.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:49.200]   Who will write a big chess? He's an Apple money. Let me just cash out.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:55.680]   And they don't I don't think Oprah has a long-term investment in the success of Apple TV plus.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:01.280]   Any more than Mark has Brownlee really cares whether RetroTech is a long-term thing. Let me just
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:12.480]   show me the money. It's weird. I think that we're not talking about audience share or audience size.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:18.320]   We're talking about audience period that the value of celebrity or the value of creating content is the
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:23.200]   idea that you're going to have a group of people that are going to watch you no matter what.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:28.560]   If they see your name on something if they see something posted to your channel you are going
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:34.080]   to watch that no matter what it is. It's no longer it's no longer good enough to have a big bang
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:39.520]   theory sort of show which is a good show but there are I would say that there are very few people
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:44.080]   who are so passionate about it that they schedule their Thursday nights around making sure that they
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:49.680]   don't miss an episode. Whereas for me it's the reason why I said that that was an interesting choice
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:55.280]   for Marcus Brownlee to be doing a retro tech show is that now he's going to be competing with
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:02.160]   creators like TechMone and other channels that are really really good at this. This is something that
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:06.960]   he decided that he liked to do before there was any sort of an audience for it. Just like there's
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:12.240]   so many people who might want to create an auto channel. Again you're competing with Project
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:19.200]   Vinky you're competing with three or four or five years of a fascinating project with people who
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:24.320]   absolutely know what they're doing and they're bringing not people who might be dipping in every
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:30.560]   now and then but people who will absolutely be seeing every single episode. If you can tell me
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:36.240]   what day of the week the new Wintergarden Marvel Machine video comes out on that is exactly the
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:41.440]   difference between new style viewership and old style viewership. I'm just going to go home and
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:45.920]   read a book. I can't even one division. I don't know if they name a series one division. I don't
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:50.080]   know. I want an answer Bob I don't know any of these shows you children are talking about.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:56.160]   No idea. What is YouTube? I'm alien. Who's older than me?
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:02.320]   Is it nine year old or 13 year old? This has happened to every generation where they just get to a
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.720]   point where they go. I don't know what the hell the kids are talking about. My kids came up and
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.560]   told me how to get to Nintendo's. Yeah my god kids told me how to fix something on the Nintendo
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:15.280]   switch and I literally felt myself fixing my parents BCR. Oh god. Just that that's the moment
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:20.160]   that happened. That's the moment. Well speaking of moments there's a big breaking story that just
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:24.000]   came in. I'm going to take a break and we're going to come back. Apple and Qualcomm have settled
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:32.080]   their trial began yesterday with jury selection just in over the wire a settlement and just to
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:39.920]   give you an idea of who won and who lost Apple stock up 1% Qualcomm stock up over 13% at last
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:48.240]   check. So we'll get the details on that in just a second. But first I am getting old.

[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:16.000]   Dude. Apple and Qualcomm the trial began yesterday with jury impanlement according to CNBC this came
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.480]   out just a few minutes ago they've settled they announced in a press release the settlement
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:29.280]   includes a payment from Apple to Qualcomm as well as a chipset supply agreement which would be a
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:34.240]   great relief for Apple maybe not so much for Intel but Apple has been having trouble getting
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:39.200]   those Qualcomm chips went to Intel Intel had to have a crash program to make the radios and so
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:46.080]   forth Apple stock up less than 1% Qualcomm I'll have to check that again though this is this is an old
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:55.920]   story now Qualcomm up 13% this was one of those things that could have gone on for a decade more
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:01.840]   it was ugly it was a there were billions of dollars and claims in both directions
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:07.600]   and November Qualcomm CEO Steve Molinkop said he thought the two companies were on the doorstep
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:18.160]   to a settlement Tim Cook said nah uh or are you again nah uh so the full press release is short I
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:24.560]   will read it in its entirety now do not go get a sandwich Qualcomm and Apple today announced an
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:30.560]   agreement to dismiss all litigation all litigation between the two companies worldwide the settlement
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:34.960]   includes a payment from Apple to Qualcomm the companies have also reached a six-year license
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:41.360]   agreement effective April 1st 2019 including a two-year option to extend and a multi-year chip
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:47.680]   set supply agreement and that's it yeah we kind of got to this again in eight years yeah in eight
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:53.920]   years we'll be back and no I think this is it's over now for sure right yeah absolutely yeah that
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:55:01.120]   must have been a really late breaking development because it seems more often than not when these
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:05.680]   things have been in the works for a long time they've already lined up who they're going to leak
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:10.000]   the information to to make sure that the background information about this and other details that
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.360]   they don't actually have to support in public get out there the fact that there is a one paragraph
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:21.280]   summation plus the and the only I've been ever since the the break I've been not doing nothing
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:27.840]   but looking at news sources and every single news item is is entirely about what other how this is
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:34.560]   affecting Intel stock Qualcomm stock Apple stock Qualcomm is up 16 percent 16 points rather
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:39.920]   Intel took a big dip but seems to have recovered Apple is up just a little bit but yeah it looks
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:46.800]   like there are a lot of basically that at Qualcomm made nine point seven billion dollars just on the
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:51.920]   basis of people knowing that they've settled their their disagreements with Apple yeah so that shows
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:56.640]   you who is here's the here's the Huawei thing is it the Huawei offer to help the
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:04.720]   here's the here's the Qualcomm chart for internet this is today I think you can see exactly when
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:11.200]   the announcement was made the market is not closed right it's got another hour to go so
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:14.960]   this kind of surprising they would make this announcement before the market close
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:20.400]   and also we don't know the details and it's amazing the market react that strongly without at least
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:27.200]   some some form of details yeah I think the assumption here then based on the way the market is going is
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:33.920]   that Qualcomm will continue to be able to charge the prices that it charges which is a huge benefit
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:39.920]   to Qualcomm and not it's not necessarily any kind of benefit to phone makers like like Apple so
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:45.200]   I think yeah I think the settlement is a big deal for Qualcomm because they can they can continue
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:51.680]   sort of business as usual in into the future based on the fact that Apple that that the two of them
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.920]   came to a settlement obviously we don't know what was in the settlement if the settlement was
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:01.440]   something along the lines of Qualcomm will now reduce the prices that it charges for its chips
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:09.120]   or it will no longer require a license for for the for the chipsets I don't know but I think the
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:14.720]   implication is that Qualcomm doesn't have to reduce its prices which is a big boom for that I'm not
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:19.840]   sure that that's the case I'm sure that you remember Apple stock prices is conditioned by a lot of
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:25.680]   stuff Qualcomm is a little simpler and honestly I think just the removal of this hanging over
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:31.520]   Qualcomm's head no matter what the deal is and the fact that Apple will continue to buy Qualcomm chips
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:36.160]   is enough to say does that mean that Apple has to put their modem does that mean Apple has to
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:40.960]   put their modem in the drawer now would that have to be part of any of what I wonder you know um yeah
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:44.480]   well at least for the next six years do you think we'll know you think that I'll get at least
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:49.680]   out I guess it has to because we'll know what chips are going in I think that I think that we've
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:55.280]   just seen Apple announce here's how long it will take us to develop our modem chips six to eight
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:01.200]   years no less than six years yeah yeah I'm being seriously if they if they had something that they
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:06.560]   thought that they could launch in a year or two they I have a hard time believing that they would
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:12.160]   have settled this it really shows you how important a Qualcomm chip set is to any company that wants
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:20.800]   to launch a 5G phone anytime in the next two years they it's hard yeah yeah and this is isn't that
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:26.880]   where go ahead isn't that where we're sort of getting into that friend sort of specifics here
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:32.240]   of like once that once a once a company is making something that becomes so ubiquitous within technology
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:36.640]   that they have to start kind of navigating toward this this sort of fair
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:42.960]   competition amongst the rest of the other tech people it really does seem like Qualcomm is kind
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:48.720]   of stepping into that friend sort of sort of realm when it comes to their modems you know
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:53.440]   it's possible Qualcomm has stepped right in it already there they're being they're being chased
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:59:02.240]   after by every every law internationally regarding anti-antern competitive behavior they're required
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:11.200]   to make sure that they make their technology available to all comers on a sort of equalish
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:15.360]   basis mean they don't have to give the same price to everybody but they can't simply decide that
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:20.160]   this is a are because this is such an important technology they can't say that well we're only
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:24.880]   gonna allow Huawei we're only gonna allow Samsung to have access to these chips or we're gonna charge
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:31.200]   double triple quadruple at the drop of a hat and so this was this this will I imagine this will also
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:36.800]   help them out on that score where other companies are going to maybe think twice about suing them if
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:41.600]   even Apple decided to fold given their worth just given their resources and given their ability
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:46.560]   to simply take a hit for a couple years that's got to send some chills to anybody in order to
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:52.560]   build their own phone it's it may what may have also I mean this is on the eve of the trial right
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:56.480]   so who knows it could have been that they saw that major league baseball player in the jury and
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:02.160]   they went oh no we got to settle but but more likely Apple I think Apple did a calculus I think
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:10.000]   you're exactly right that they said look 5g they might it could be something as simple as we need 5g
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.520]   in the next iPhone we're not going to have it ready we've got to get Qualcomm chips that's just the
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:20.640]   way it is it could have been that kind of thing that ultimately was the final pressure it's also
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:24.320]   possible that you because they're they're gonna have to meet both ways because Qualcomm's got to
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.880]   want to settle to and Apple's not paying them and they've complained bitterly about how much money
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.160]   that's costing well that's one reason the stock price went up so much they're gonna get some
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.800]   yeah some of that money finally being a silicon merchant is not like it sounds like it's profitable
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:41.440]   but Qualcomm has had a lot of trouble making non-phone chips profitably over the last few years
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:46.000]   because literally they did not have the money to do things like mobile chips at any at any scale at
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.640]   the price that many factors going to pay for it and if they get a huge influx of capital that's
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:55.600]   probably hugely beneficial to them as well so we don't know how much we don't we own really the
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.000]   only substantive thing we know is that Apple did write a check could have been for a buck
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.400]   but more importantly agreed to buy six years of Qualcomm chips for the next six years and I'll
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.200]   tend with an option for two more that's I think that's really the the bottom line on this and this
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:14.800]   all I all I know is that I no longer have to spend the next eight months to three years reading
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:21.120]   PDFs of court filing I know I know I'm pretending to understand I was actually looking forward to this
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:27.360]   I wanted I wanted to see how this was gonna go I was really looking I I'm very fascinated with
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.160]   this kind of idea of these tech companies that are kind of because when they get too big and they
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.440]   there's there's this sort of like the fair use kind of idea of when does a company get to
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:44.320]   protect its assets and when does it have to kind of be a little bit more equal so I was actually
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:51.040]   I was actually hoping for for some some closure on this particular this particular thing because I
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:56.560]   think like both Apple and Qualcomm had some pretty good arguments from just the information that
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:02.560]   I've read about it and I don't know so we just have to wait for the next company to to jump on that
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:06.160]   board to find out what's really gonna happen it's a bummer for me you know it could be very
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:13.120]   usually this kind of thing is settled before you go to trial the threat of going to trial and of
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:19.840]   discovery often is sufficient to bring the parties together it wasn't in this case it may be that
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:27.120]   once the trial began the judge set the two parties down and said I don't want this trial to go on
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:33.840]   you need to be both of you yeah it may be that Apple saw something in Qualcomm's presentation
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:39.520]   or Qualcomm actually I think Apple presented first I I'm not sure you know what happened but
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:45.120]   something happened obviously maybe they looked at the jury and said we're gonna lose but something
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:52.320]   happened on Monday that caused them to come to the table and settle today so that's that's actually
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:59.360]   good observation because of sometimes a judge will not direct to the two parties to settle
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:04.960]   but indicate that things the situation as it stands right now says that you there's that wasn't
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:10.720]   really great time wink wink you to settle before we move forward for reasons that are apparent to
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:16.080]   everybody inside this courtroom that that will take that will take the bravado out of a law out of
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.880]   people yeah I think that's the case I don't have a lot of experience but I have a little bit of
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:27.600]   experience with this and I I kind of know you know the stages of how this happens of course
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:33.840]   these companies have millions to spend on attorneys but these fees get high and I think really one
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.840]   of the things that's most scary for these companies I know it has been in the past for Apple's discovery
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:43.520]   and you know that's already happened so I'm not sure what happened I think it's very
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:50.720]   intriguing lawyers one Leo lawyers lawyers always win Renee that's a that's a given yeah I think
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:56.160]   here you could say Qualcomm probably had a victory I think that's what the market is telling us
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:00.720]   they had more they had more to lose so yeah this is a victory for them but you just made me a
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.800]   little bit sad because we learned so much about the development of the iPhone through the discovery
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:10.160]   process on this last time so now actually maybe a little am a little bit sad yeah yeah that those
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:16.080]   I think that's one thing Apple realized there is a collateral damage in any lawsuit
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:22.800]   and Apple a company that embraces secrecy more than any other might have just well said yeah
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.000]   let's let's stop before we have to get testimony
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:37.440]   um wow like an era is over yeah it's not as sad as Notre Dame burning but it's the end of
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:43.760]   any area yeah um let's see like a Nokia paddle settlements bad pet and settlements a lot and
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:50.000]   it is a bit of a surprise um yeah I guess all those lawyers are gonna i'm gonna have to go to work
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.200]   like a genius bars or something they got they got to be giving billable hours somewhere
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:01.920]   uh cautionary tale if you had heard if you'd read maybe you read on reddit that you can bake
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:12.160]   a laptop to uh to reflow the solder don't no this is well I don't know just don't turn it up past
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:19.120]   speed required yeah i think the conclusion here is make sure your temperature in your oven is
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:26.720]   accurate before you try to do this yeah um reflowing solder is not necessary as a as a as a
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:32.240]   technique is not stupid but usually it's done by visibly but basically the story was this guy had
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:37.920]   a he dropped his is macbook air clearly it was not functioning anymore so he felt he was little
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:45.200]   to lose the the reflowing solder technique means that you visibly inspect the board and if you see
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:52.080]   a crack or a break in the solder you can use a tiny heat gun or a soldering gun to simply melt
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:58.160]   the solder in place and cause that breach that that crack to flow back together i'm not sure that
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:08.000]   i would do it don't put it in a toaster oven and then gosh things are going great at 160 degrees
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.840]   i'll just crank it up to 180 let's see let's see what could possibly go wrong uh you make an
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:19.200]   excellent point and he repair shops that do this kind of repair will use a very targeted heat gun
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:26.160]   to and very carefully uh heat areas to reflow the solder the idea of baking the whole mother board
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:30.480]   although as the guy points out he's making fun of himself in the blog post he said i at least
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:37.120]   five people on the internet did this with success and you're probably the best person to ask a
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:41.360]   little bit more detail about this since you do a lot of diy computer stuff why
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:47.200]   why did anyone even come up with this idea that you could put your mother important in an oven
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:53.360]   period like i get that you know the kind of loosening of the solder but i mean
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:02.000]   it seems like sorry it's this it's this website how i record rare from 2014 how i resurrected my
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:10.320]   macbook bro by putting it in the oven again it's a recognized technique if you are bold and
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:14.880]   recognize though you have nothing to lose make no no not not the technique of putting it in the
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:21.840]   oven it's just the idea it's just the idea of uh the idea of doing this cautiously carefully
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:29.520]   and appropriately is just too much for me to handle i like this idea i like this idea of
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:35.600]   picking up tips on how to fix a two thousand dollar laptop off of like a 15 second looping
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:42.240]   gif or instagram it's like no no no no i don't i don't think i fix it will sell you a toaster oven
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:49.440]   yeah pdf is correct yes on how to do this yeah yeah this is this is hysterical i'm really
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:54.240]   glad that you'd wanted to talk about this one just because it made me laugh so hard to read this and
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:08:00.720]   i think that the the writer actually has a really great angle the way he or she describes the
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.760]   the process is pretty funny too i think it's essentially an acknowledgement that it wasn't
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:11.840]   going to come back so yeah you know you know if it didn't work which it didn't you know the most
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:16.240]   of the most interesting part of any process like this is when you've done everything that a rational
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:21.760]   human will do and you realize that you're now between there is your if i just if i just throw
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:26.880]   this away or put this in a closet there is zero chance of this working again if there if i put it
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:31.840]   in the oven now there is a point oh one percent chance or a non-zero chance of it and it will end
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:37.600]   and it will be an interesting data point as he as it is a well-written blog post he does he makes
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:42.960]   the point that it was well out of apple care it was going to cost him at least 800 to a thousand
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:49.360]   dollars for a logic board replacement or so a high enough amount of money that is like what's the
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:55.680]   point of of not buying an entirely new laptop if that's the cost of the fix and if it worked oh my
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:03.280]   god he would have been a legend it's true i you know i i put keyboards in dish in the dishwasher
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:08.160]   knowing that there is you know maybe a 50/50 chance there'll be d o a but sometimes it works
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:15.040]   why why would you put your because you were in the dishwasher i mean it's only 20 bucks to buy a
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:20.800]   new keyboard it just cleans it out i wouldn't put the butterfly key butterfly three is a chance it'll
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:27.600]   be better leon is a chance it'll be clean give it a try put it in monocle you can't do it with a
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:32.480]   macbook because uh it's hard to get that keyboard unglued from the battery and you know you don't
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:38.160]   really want to put your battery through the dishwasher i know that much i'm not an idiot safety first
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:47.600]   kit angela arance is gone she's left the building yesterday was her last day at apple the CEO of
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:56.640]   burberry apple famously hired away five years ago to run retail on the weekend apple this is a
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:01.360]   this this is this is kind of cold they removed her profile from their leadership page
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:08.640]   gone uh she we don't know she but she's going to do a new personal and professional pursuits
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:15.520]   and of course uh former head of HR did ro brian vice president of people
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:19.680]   will it take over she's now senior vice president of retail and people
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:28.160]   um she was a gladiator i got there's no yes they think they could have worded that
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:35.280]   worded that title a little bit better sv p and people retail and people retail retail is made
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:44.160]   of people don't you know um oddball story we reported uh on ios today from nine to five mac
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:52.240]   apple warren's ipad pro users of bizarre interference issue between apple pencil and car key fobs
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:58.880]   turns out if you have the new ipad pro and pencil and you're charging the pencil and it comes in
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:06.240]   proximity to your uh touchless you know key fob that it can interfere with it
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:12.000]   signal interference between your pencil and your car's keyless entry device
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:20.720]   might prevent you from unlocking your car apple's solution take the pencils off the
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:27.280]   iPad yet stop using your car you need to charge um store your pencil separately actually that's
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:33.680]   good advice it also drains the battery and interferes with air power it does tell you a little bit
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:40.800]   about how much rf is coming off of that yeah yeah yes the reverse square law the the how
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:46.160]   how cool if it's absolutely in contact that's nice but every millimeter you bring it apart from
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:52.800]   the actual source inside the device reduces by what half or is that a first yeah half yeah reverse
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:59.120]   square so the square but uh but uh so really that means there's quite a bit of rf and i did see
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.640]   a couple of pictures i think on reddit of apple pencils with kind of brown marks were almost
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:10.160]   looked like burn marks where they were on the top of the ipad i feel like there is there's heating
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:14.080]   going on there's i mean this is there's some stuff out there when doctor of charging like the
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:18.960]   charging creates heat that's the whole right right gambit and i guess this is part of the reason why
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.120]   air power doesn't exist anymore is because of how powerful it was this is kind of a tiny version
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.560]   of it who wouldn't be able to drive their cars no no keeping apple employees cups of coffee warm
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:35.840]   on desks all across this facial canvas um mozilla calling apple out and i'm curious what you all
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:44.880]   think of uh this one the bug in apple's latest marketing campaign the new slogan privacy is that
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:53.360]   iPhone i don't even know what that means but uh i read through this it's like new selena now it's
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:59.120]   a strange slogan it feels like they don't know how that like it feels like they're talking about
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:04.080]   a basic feature that they just do not know how it understand like don't understand how it works
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:12.320]   and decided to press ahead anyway so i think it's really a case of maybe in my opinion apple not
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:19.680]   telling us exactly what's going on here because the switch says you can opt out of interest-based
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:26.960]   ads in the app store and apple news um but what it really does is and there is it does say this if
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:35.200]   you go into settings is reset the unique id and mozilla's point is if that apple in fact they've
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:40.000]   started a petition to get apple to do that automatically on a regular basis maybe monthly
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.960]   because having the same idea for years on your apple device allows people to create a quite a
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:51.360]   but it it doesn't because like this this this like they fundamentally misunderstand what this
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:56.000]   technology is all this is is you is a device identifier it's not related to your account in
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.760]   any way and all it does is work on the app store ads and on the news ads it doesn't go to any third
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:08.160]   parties ever so there's no way you can build a profile off you based on these tokens it reads
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:12.080]   to me like mozilla is desperately trying to get into the privacy narrative and didn't bother to
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:16.720]   actually read up on it and it's it's so weird i kind of want don melton to go back and put all
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:21.600]   those not safe for work words he painstakingly took out of the mozilla code base before it went
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:30.720]   public so let me get this clear uh the apple id which mozilla implies does go to advertisers
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:35.760]   does not go to advertisers my understanding and i read apple insiders coverage and i think there's
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:42.240]   at least two others who dug deep into it and it does not and it is strictly for app store ads and
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:46.400]   and my reading at least strictly for app store ads and news apple news ads and apple doesn't even
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:52.160]   share that with the developers or the news publishers so that's much less concerning
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:57.360]   obviously if it were a unique identifier like for instance verizon got in trouble for on
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:02.480]   verizon phones that went to third parties then those third parties could amass information about
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:08.400]   your you know travels on uh with the iphone but only apple skin accounts it would be nervous
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.880]   because i wouldn't want i wouldn't want them to know what i'm doing on home with a different
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:14.320]   device it's not that i have anything to hide but i just think privacy should be the default but
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:18.640]   it's literally locked to that device and it has no idea that an ipad or an apple watch sitting
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:24.240]   anywhere near it either well okay locked to that device doesn't reassure me completely because
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:29.520]   your iphone goes with you everywhere and does everything but it does reassure me if i if it only
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:37.520]   is available to apple in those two apps that's not as significant that's my read of it okay it's
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:42.320]   just every time that we talk about privacy particularly when we talk about the advantages of apple's
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:46.720]   form of privacy which is much much better than anybody else's and fortunately it skips over the
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:51.840]   fact that what we need is every single company doing any sort of transaction over the internet
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:56.880]   including advertising companies being just as strict and just as committed to privacy as apple is
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:02.400]   because we have it's great to have this device idea it's great to uh point to ways that which
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:06.800]   people are trying to get around it but even if it were 100 percent secure and 100 fail proof
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:11.200]   there are still so many different device fingerprinting technologies out there that will try to figure
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.920]   out that oh well this person has deliberately made the choice to turn off this feature so they're
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:20.640]   communicating to us that they don't want to be tracked that's great if we can fingerprint this
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:25.200]   person's device we will add them to our database of marketing people who don't want to be tracked so
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:30.800]   it's it's it's every time every time i i feel as though i'm feeling too good about the world i will
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:36.240]   google something like uh mobile device fingerprinting and see look at stuff i hadn't seen in the past
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:40.480]   couple months is that oh that is actually kind of evil the way that they're the way that they're
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:47.200]   doing that so yeah yeah all right good so uh i i reassured thank i knew this is i knew rene you
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:51.440]   would have the answer on this one that's why i wanted to i'm super sure why mozilla is doing
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:56.720]   this so i'm going to keep looking into that yeah i mean i you know i give i credit mozilla um but if
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:01.280]   but they sounds like they're misunderstanding what apple's doing with that id if it's not widely
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:06.640]   available then it's not then it's not a privacy concern because apple i mean apple knows who you
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:13.440]   are apple you can't i mean they go to great pains to make sure like they like when you talk to
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:17.040]   them about differential privacy for example they've been working on that since they announced it to
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:21.360]   make it better and they'll even do things like if if you're a super user and you're using stuff way
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:25.440]   too much for them to successfully anonymize you or you're in a such a sparse location that
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:29.520]   there's no way to effectively anonymize you they'll just remove you from the pool because they would
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:34.960]   rather do that than you having any greater any less privacy profile through their analytics i mean
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:42.400]   they really do not want your stuff i am excited about ios 13 you still do alabra you you do uh
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:49.760]   what is i stop motion is ios yes yes yeah i your motion we've got uh product called photo presenter
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:58.560]   for the iphone and ipad allows you to um do a ad hoc photo presentation so i'm excited about
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:04.560]   the ipad but i i think i'm not alone in this the new ipad pro as great as the hardware is
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:11.920]   is held back a little bit by the antiquity of ios uh i'm sure you can't talk too much about
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:18.400]   future ios is i don't know anything about it so i thought okay so um i'll have to go by what they
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:24.400]   say at nine and five mac ios 13 and you've said this before rene that and we we knew this that ios 12
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:31.680]   which had apparently been intended to make the ipad pro more of a computing device but they apple
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:36.800]   decided not to at the last minute they uh they said let's make this be the bug fix version and
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:44.640]   ios 13 the new version and now we're starting to hear some leaks about ios 13 dark mode ho hum
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:52.640]   but some interesting multitasking features upgrades to safari and mail and an ipad unique
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:19:00.880]   undo gesture which certainly would be welcome among many things to make the i uh pad more useful
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:05.520]   it's it's weird when you look at all these things that are supposedly going to the
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:11.840]   exploration of ios it it seems like like detachable panels and making making an app
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:18.480]   essentially being able to be a multi windowed app uh all of itself uh the new new gestures for
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:24.400]   uh i can't remember exactly what the sequence is but how do you do like a multiple options selection
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:31.600]   with just one hand or you know 18 fingers of one hand it just seems like at when they try to
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:38.160]   implement features like that you want to ask the follow-up question do you feel like this is the
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:44.640]   point to add trackpad support to the ipad it feels as though you're writing something for a
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:50.560]   conventional laptop to basically give it conventional laptop interface features without the benefit
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:57.200]   of having an actual trackpad or having uh a keyboard that is implied with the device as
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:03.440]   opposed to an accessory that they'd kind of like you not to have to use so i'm wondering if we're not
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:10.080]   if if if they really are putting as much investment into making the ipad line their version of the
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:17.760]   sub thousand dollar laptop and or their replacement for all macbooks to come i wonder if that we're
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:24.960]   not going to see an ios 15 okay we now have we now have limited trackpad support supporting these
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:30.560]   specific apple trackpads and with these specific gestures that's going to be conditional upon
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:35.520]   app support but it will be the thing that will make people finally decide that a thousand dollar
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:41.200]   or even a thirteen hundred dollar ipad pro is what they want and not a fifteen hundred dollar mac book
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:47.520]   or an eight hundred dollar windows windows notebook i think the the problems of ios in
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:55.120]   terms of can i use it for real work go much deeper than you know dark mode or undo gestures
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:21:02.880]   or stuff like that and and and one of the things that the the big question is how would they how
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:13.040]   will they you know deal with this that you know i have i have an i an i make book pro and an ipad pro
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:20.160]   and they are almost the same size and width and and same size and weight and and why do i have to
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:27.520]   carry both right and um you know it's sort of this do we want to go ipad and then we'll have to
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:37.520]   um you know make it much more like a mac or do we go or do we stay you know do we still have the
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:43.040]   mac around and then what's the place of ipad in this thing have you looked at developing with
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:48.480]   marzipan and and whether you yeah i i think i think i think that's not going to solve the problem
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:57.440]   because um marzipan is just for like making it easy for certain certain types of apps um
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:05.120]   mostly probably enterprise apps um to be able to be developed for both platforms and i think the
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:13.920]   they do that because they uh um because they they they know this problem is that you know how do you
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:21.920]   make sure that if you make an app um it's it's most cost effective um to have it both working on the
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:29.520]   work machine and the play machine so um and and i think i i'm a i'm a big fan of the the touch
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:37.760]   interface and ipad and ever since it came out um but i every every time every new iOS version every
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:46.240]   new sort of generation of ipads i try to move uh or at least partly move my my uh my work over to
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:52.080]   the ipad and i i give up after 10 of after two minutes because like i struggle with it because
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:58.160]   how i mean you photo editing is the one thing that i feel like i can do on the ipad yeah that's a good
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:05.440]   that's a good point um because um that's music mixing yeah i i think like for photographers taking ipad
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:10.800]   into the field and then being able to do um you know quick manipulation of the photos like a
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:16.960]   big benefit but that's a niche um small market a niche use use case right it's the one reason i
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:22.240]   would take an ipad pro and a laptop is so i could do lightroom and do quick triage and like i'm on
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:28.800]   the ipad pro and then so i brought the ipad on this trip and i haven't used it any other because yeah
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:35.920]   by the way a non touch bar macbook now this is this small travel thing and i the non touch
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:43.520]   the touch bar is like i mean it's a big don't get me started don't get me started yeah so what is
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:48.080]   it's it's it's one of the symptoms right where apple designs something and and it's not really clear
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:54.880]   what it's supposed to be and what what it's for and and you know uh making making a uh hardware
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:24:00.480]   designer the chief of user interface is maybe not the biggest idea uh you can have yeah so
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:04.000]   especially fizzant isn't it coming to the magic keyboard
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.520]   that's that's what we're here
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:15.600]   my thoughts pass looking better improving the magic keyboard i want to know a little screen on it
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:21.680]   i don't want working keys no keys who needs keys so one of the touches and this might confirm your
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:29.680]   point anti or might not uh the undo touch according to the leak is that you tap with three fingers on
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:37.440]   the keyboard area and then you slide left to undo slide right to redo so that seemed natural and
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:44.320]   usable it's it's also not um not in the least discoverable and if you if i mean you have to now
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:49.440]   go to the app store add to the apple store and get a two-hour training just to get started using
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:55.600]   your device that's not i mean i mean they should realize that that's not that's not the not the
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:02.000]   cuz on c was that discoverable either but by the head of yeah the menu i think that says undo and
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.880]   that's the command c right next to it so it's easy to discover because just that's right you've
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:11.440]   got a you've got a reminder yeah yeah and i think that's one of the problems with multitasking on
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:16.880]   ipad in general is that the the features are not that discoverable so the the things that you can do
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:25.040]   with it the split screen and and the pop-up side app thing um people like you and me we we use our
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:30.240]   ipads a lot and we kind of dig into those features but the average person someone like my mom doesn't
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:35.440]   even know that you can do split screen so i think the discoverability is exactly what you're saying
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:42.640]   is that it's it's not it's not use it's not um intuitive to find those things and to use them
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:51.680]   yeah absolutely i'm a huge ipad user and any any time i need to move like several things from
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:56.880]   like mail into a folder or i'm doing a presentation i need to move several things into a slide i know
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.600]   that there's a special gesture that will let me do discontinuous selection and i can just sort of
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:06.800]   toss things into a pile it's being held by my index finger but the amount of time it would take me to
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:13.040]   google that google for information how to do that learn how to do that then do that is always much
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:18.560]   much less time that would take me to simply move 18 things individually one at a time it's just i've
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:25.040]   just never had yeah i've i've just none of these shortcuts ever stick for me uh i can do most i can
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.600]   do a split window very very easily but none of these other deep sort of how many fingers do i have to
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:34.000]   have on the screen where do they have to go and what do i have to do with them they just never stick
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.520]   in my mind so i'm i'm glad they're there for people who want to use them the great thing about these
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:43.760]   features is that if you don't know about them they're not going to confuse you and they're not going
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:48.800]   to add any layers of complexity but the fact that they're there and so many so few people actually
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:54.720]   use them might indicate that they should be rethought or even their placement should be reconsidered
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:27:01.600]   apps will be able to multi will have multiple windows each window again this is uh giarm
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:07.200]   rambo from nine to five mac with the help of steven trout and smith who is i think we have to
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:15.280]   call him the source code whisperer each window will be able to contain sheets that are initially
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:20.640]   attached to a portion of the screen but can be detached or the drag gesture becoming a card that
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:25.760]   can be moved around freely apparently there's an open source project called panel kit that does this
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:31.200]   the cards can also be stacked on top of one another and will use a depth effect to indicate which
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:37.120]   cards are on top and which are on the bottom cards can be flung away to dismiss them uh it sounds
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:42.400]   like really they're reinventing the computer interface that's a tough thing to do yeah also
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:50.640]   i think one other issue is probably that um most iOS apps are not um don't offer the same kind
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:59.360]   of functionality than the desktop um you know mac uh equivalence and i think that's um because
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:08.400]   the the economics of the app store are something that don't work in favor of the of the developers
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:14.560]   and so i think that's another issue is like why should i do why should i go and implement all the
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:23.600]   stuff um if if then the application doesn't make money for you know it really makes me wonder how
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:30.320]   pixel meter can charge five bucks for pixel meter well they i mean they are um i mean they are front
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:35.760]   and center being promoted by apple i mean it's like yeah but but still uh it's millions of copies
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:41.360]   millions it's worth way more than five bucks yeah it's yeah i mean it really is close to light room
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:46.800]   yeah um and they're charged with five bucks for it i mean that's great for us as users i'm thrilled
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:51.360]   but yeah you do have to wonder about the economics of that yeah apple promotes them like crazy i
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.960]   i just i just wish this i just wish that in 2019 apple would put half as much effort into productivity
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:03.280]   features for the macintosh as they seem to be doing for the iPad how about like split view where
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:07.040]   they announced it once never touched it again and it's you know i love it but i still can't use it
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:11.600]   because you have to literally destroy it and go reclaim a window that goes full screen just to
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:16.960]   start another split view oh yeah it's so true the the split view on mac is like the bane of my
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:22.720]   existence i want to use it i love it for about five seconds when i'm using it but any little thing
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:29.440]   like a notification and slack and suddenly oh guess i have to exit out of split view entirely
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:34.960]   just so that i can see what this notification is yeah and it's so simple which what you do is you
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:42.960]   either buy yourself a copy of windows seven not even windows 10 copy that and complain and and say
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:47.920]   that you fixed it and that's how you did it or you find you go to the app store spend all of maybe
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:52.960]   twenty five dollars on the two or three really really good split for you manage menu managers
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:57.600]   they're out there write somebody an awfully big check that makes them and their family very very
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:03.120]   happy to own it and then you're done it seemed like such a weird it's it's the thing that gets me
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:10.000]   really frustrated about apple most regularly that you could you they their first thought about if
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.560]   their thought was we've got we really hand you to finally have window management that that
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:19.360]   automated split views on the desktop they're didn't they're not taking their inspiration from all of
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:24.880]   the desktop operating systems that do it so well their idea is let's let's copy and paste it from
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:31.120]   our mobile operating system let's do it from ios because of course when you think about lack of
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:35.680]   lack of limitations and the ability to work with huge monitors and multiple and multiple apps and
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:40.000]   tasks at once you think about the nine point seven inch ipad don't you you're joking but i
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.640]   would take you i've had version in a hot second that's that this is so much worse than anything
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:49.360]   if anyone's ever done on any platform you can't even change the app that's in the
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:54.000]   it's like i would just let me pull something from the dock and drop it in this blue view to change
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:59.440]   anything at this point again i say go ahead i'm sorry morai i was there i'll just quickly run
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:04.160]   through some additional features just to for complete this a torturous leave just a torture
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:09.440]   so far i will automatically ask for a desktop version of websites when necessary
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:14.960]   uh because otherwise you often get the iphone version of the ipad and like reddit and like
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:19.920]   youtube will load up the iphone version on the ipad as if they could care less about yeah yeah
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:24.320]   so you don't have to press that request desktop site button uh there will actually be an ability
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:34.080]   to add fonts that's called the adobe photoshop rio s feature because previously you were
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:38.800]   gonna have to download the formative cloud oh yeah a new standard font picker component will be
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:44.400]   available mail app is getting smarter it can organize messages into categories
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:50.800]   searchable categories users can add messages to a read later queue
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:58.720]   i'm looking forward to this i think the mail app has been a little bit frustrating
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:03.840]   for its whole existence and every time apple adds some new feature to the mail app i'm always very
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:10.960]   excited i purposefully use the mail app that's the built-in mail app on one of my ipads but
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:17.360]   only one of my ipads because i'm trying to maintain you know remembering what it's like
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:21.520]   instead of using a third-party app that i think works a lot better what do you use instead
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:26.000]   um you know this is contentious i i don't like to talk about it all whole
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.720]   up because everybody has very strong opinions on mail apps at least we have choice safe story
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:36.080]   this is a safe show yeah you're in a place of safety and work i use outlook on my iphone
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:43.920]   what my other i think it's very good but isn't it really just a comply they bought a comply yes
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:49.760]   which was great and so it's sunrise right they combined sunrise the calendar and in fact the reason
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:57.600]   that i switched over to um and wonder list outlook was because of yeah and and uh yeah in fact yes
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:02.880]   it was sunrise that made me look into outlook in the first place uh so that's why i switched to it
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:06.960]   and i've i've used a number of different ones and there's lots of great ones out there but that's
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:13.440]   the one i settled on that i kind of found fits my my methods the best and on my mac i actually have
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:18.880]   currently gone back i was using newton and loved it absolutely loved it i went when they when they
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:25.040]   folded and before they came back to it in under a different company i switched back to mac app the
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:32.400]   mac app the built-in mac app on on mac because again i'm trying to experience one with the version
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:39.600]   of it i will i will i will yeah i yeah i want to experience it i want to figure out the things i
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:43.840]   do like about it versus the things i don't like about it there's one thing that i love about the
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:51.520]   mac male app that i have not yet seen working in another third party app which by the way you can
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:56.880]   you can at me at twitter if you if you have a suggestion for me which is that i can actually drag
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:06.640]   um conversations or emails from one um account into a different folder so if i get something from
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:13.040]   my work email i can actually drag it into a folder that's from my personal um email account i i love
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:17.760]   being able to do that because i might have a folder that's something along the lines of um you know
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:22.880]   pr so any kind of pr information i get i can drag it all into one folder i don't have to have separate
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:28.160]   folders for my personal versus my work i can drag them all in the same place and i haven't seen any
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:34.000]   other third party app that allows for that so there you go that's that's actually a nice feature
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:39.280]   my point being when it comes to apples male app which is somewhat frustrating that it that it
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:43.360]   really does need a lot of a lot of work to be better that's one thing that it does that i've
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:49.280]   never seen a third party app do you know now now that most developers are using slack to communicate
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:53.840]   with their teams instead of email and i wonder if that's not partially responsible for the lack of
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:59.280]   really great innovation in email because a developer who hates the app that they're using right now
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:06.640]   is so well motivated to do something to replace it and well they all got bought and
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:09.280]   spark is great but a lot of them just get bought out by big companies
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:17.760]   yeah the good ones keep getting bought yeah as as a matter of fact i use the outlook mobile apps
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:24.880]   but uh on the desktop i use uh the outlook webmail app because it's not so it's i like the features
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:30.720]   of outlook but mostly there's server side features and i've yet to find a desktop app that is
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:35.600]   does anything better than that and that's and that's not really a praise necessarily for
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:43.040]   outlooks web app it's really talking about how someone stuck a pin in uh in uh in uh desktop mail
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:48.400]   apps about six or seven years ago or ten years ago and it just hasn't moved much forward since it
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:55.840]   seems well yeah i andy right there i can i can remember five years ago getting emails all the time
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:00.720]   from these app developers that were saying check out my new mail organizing app and it was just
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:06.880]   the whole the app store was just so full of them that it became it got to the point where i didn't
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:10.640]   i didn't even want to try them out anymore because there were just too many and most of them were
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:16.240]   doing the same thing and now we're we're kind of pulled away from that and i think some of us are
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:22.080]   sort of desperate for that that to come back to remind us you know of some great organizing
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:27.120]   features that we can use there was this huge in box zero was such a big thing and it wasn't even
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:32.960]   that long ago like maybe six or seven years ago in box zero was such a big thing and now nobody's
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:38.560]   even really caring about it anymore there's a handful of ios apps and mac apps for mail that have
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:43.920]   have kind of carried over and that have stood this test of time if you will not necessarily
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:48.800]   because they're great just because they they lasted and and everybody else just stopped trying
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:57.040]   well that is one good news uh point about the quarkam apple settlement i believe quarkam gave
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:04.320]   apple the rights to utdora so no that's a joke i don't excuse me but pine is still a very very
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:13.280]   good male i'm a mutter i use mutt i like mutt uh all right let's see a couple more stories here um
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:18.800]   apple has hired a and he's molly tomsen as apples head of documentaries
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:25.600]   that's a great idea i i've won the one the easiest ways you can differentiate yourself your service
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:31.440]   from other people is acquisition of documentaries they're they're a simple single unit they can get
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:36.400]   so much attention and i think that pound-for-pound dollar for dollar a minute for a minute the best
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:42.080]   quality content that's on streaming are documentaries so whether if they're whether she's going to be
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:47.840]   developing documentaries in house buying documentaries from festivals or a combination of both that
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:54.400]   that's a really good sign about apple plus i think i i agree with you i love documentaries i mean i
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:38:00.080]   don't know if documentaries are a big selling point but i love them and i'm glad to see apple
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:04.320]   putting some energy into it whether as you said whether it's creating original ones funding
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:09.120]   existing documentarians are buying but look i think there's no special effects and there's no
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:15.440]   stars so that you're taking away two of the biggest expenses you've got uh and it's and some of the
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:20.560]   and they're evergreens i saw the number of times where i've been on hulu or Netflix or even just
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:26.640]   youtube and found a documentary that's 11 years old that still feels as fresh as today and i wind
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:31.360]   up having to buy the find and buy it by the dvd because i love it so much i want it as part of my
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:36.000]   permanent library maybe i okay i guess i'm a mutant but i think that i think there are enough mutants
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:43.200]   out there to to make it worthwhile i agree i am also a mutant let's take a break and then if you
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:49.440]   will prepare your picks of the week that's coming up next on mack break weekly our show today brought

[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:19.440]   the uh this is we use SDI which is a serial what is it digital interface right yeah
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:26.560]   ndi is over ethernet it's network exactly it's it replaces the SDI and hdmi cables uh that you know
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:30.640]   and new tech's been really promoting that but is that starting to take advantage of it yeah yeah
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:37.840]   so yeah it's it's um it's now in more and more camera vendors that would be really good news for us
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:46.320]   mostly the ptc cameras um from now from uh from sony and control of an ethernet cable but also
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:52.080]   send it or say it's great because you only have one cable one cable with power uh video signal
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:44:00.480]   audio signal control um the uh there were competing technologies as i remember is ndi gonna win
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:06.000]   on this what what's the other one i don't know i was told by our team yeah there's like uh there's
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:12.640]   there's uh obviously not important anymore centi uh standard but the difference is that right
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:17.520]   it's the difference is that the centi standard is like a peer-to-peer cable so it's they only use
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:22.480]   the cables but they you have to have special equipment on the other ends and and and the i works just
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:29.600]   over your regular network ip based switches it's exciting yeah it's very exciting because uh for
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:35.600]   as we as you know we make the live video switching app mimulife and one of the big issues with the
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:42.720]   mac of course is that it doesn't have any slots where you can plug in uh uh SDI card um but it
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:48.160]   can't we can get on that work we can get uh we can't get around that with external pcie
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:55.040]   extender boxes but um you know just having to have a network connection is is a big benefit how
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:45:01.040]   many cameras could you support on a single network connection um there's no i mean there's uh
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:05.520]   there's a limit for not just control but data as well right uh yeah it's a it's a bandwidth limit
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:14.480]   right so um you know ndiHX which is uh compressed uh to to a h264 compressed standard i think takes
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:21.600]   like 10 megabits per camera so if you have a gigabit network you can do 20 30 cameras and that's
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:26.400]   that's cool very cool yeah that's exciting yeah yeah what's your pick for us this week
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:32.960]   uh pick for this week i just uh went to uh a monterey uh i was just a monterey yesterday meeting
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:39.440]   with uh california state parks people and they were showing me they're really cool open our
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:47.360]   are you rov uh underwater drone and i think that's my picker let's try dent try dent open rov
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:54.880]   yes drone drone yeah i click that all right yeah wow i want one of these yes this is one drone
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:46:03.120]   that i can't destroy by dunking in the caribbean like i did my last drone oh okay yeah
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:07.440]   yeah it wasn't made for underwater this one is well that's right with the
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:17.600]   yeah of course it's impossible to transmit uh uh uh our our our signals on the water so you have
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:24.320]   to have to be yeah and it has to be tethered uh but it's it's it's a great device actually that's
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:29.040]   first i often wish that i had tethered my mavic probe yes
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:36.640]   it would still have it you know so i don't mind the tether this is actually $1,699 is very
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:44.160]   cheap i'm stunned uh maybe i will get myself an underwater drone wow
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:51.600]   100 meter tether wow isn't that cool i was i was i was expecting to see like okay you can go to the
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:57.920]   bottom of your pool but the to actually be able to like drop it off a boat or a dock and explore
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:04.640]   that's that's what they do at the state park yeah wow use it to uh to explore the uh kelp forest
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:11.600]   outside of uh point lobos and uh they go deep down to the bottom of this thing so you want to
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:20.160]   you want to see some underwater video diving with sharks all right let's go definitely here we go
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:26.960]   doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo i hope it's sending this video signal back because if the shark
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:32.320]   grabs it runs off with it yeah it i i would at least want to have video of that yeah then you can
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:37.520]   you can actually stream life to the internet from the thing so oh wow i want this too
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:44.720]   this looks cool doesn't it you know i think you know i'm willing to chip in 500 for a 25
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:49.760]   share of this i'm thinking if i bought this i could take it back to the caribbean and find my
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:52.640]   mavic probe yes
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:55.200]   gary robert valard
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:03.120]   we see the mavic pro sitting on the sea floor surprisingly enough the mavic pro supports a
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:04.720]   a wide biodiversity of life
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:11.680]   it's now a crab it has created its own ecosystem yeah lori gill pick of the week
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:19.440]   well my pick of the week comes from logitech oh you have it finally i am so far behind you
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:26.240]   i just i just got the uh hyperdrive connector that you talked about oh you finally got it yeah
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:30.400]   and i'm waiting they say they're making my uh keyboard now i'll get it at the end of the
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:36.240]   month or something so tell us about how do you like it i well okay so a lot of people are going
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:41.200]   to question this and they and you need to know yes it's heavy it's called slim it's not it's not
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:47.600]   slim it's heavy it's big and it's heavy but see that's like double it looks like a laptop double the way
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:52.160]   there's some little things that i love about it so anybody who has already used logitech
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:57.680]   keyboards you kind of have an idea of what what their standard is and and i think they've grown
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:01.520]   this time one of them is in the material that's used on the back of the case which i think is
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:06.240]   much better it's a silicon style case like apple smart case instead of the fabric that they use
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:12.480]   which i think looks better but doesn't clean as well um the what they use for the apple pencil i
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:18.160]   think is pretty brilliant it's a flat this is actually that's the closure to keep your ipad closed
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:24.160]   with the flap um it does not charge while it's in the flap unfortunately on the upside you can
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:29.280]   drive your car and you can drive your car and here's kind of my favorite thing about this flap
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:35.440]   when it's open it just sits back there out of the way so when you're typing your your
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:41.200]   apple pencil is there but it's kind of hidden in the background you don't need if you don't need it
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:46.320]   you don't even have to look at it so it's nice um the keep the keypad the keyboard it keyboard
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:53.040]   itself is very uh logitech it has the nice springy scissor mechanism keyboard real clicky clacky has
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:59.360]   a good reaction so if you like the the logitech keyboards this is the same style of keyboard one
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:06.240]   more thing that i think is an improvement on the way um logitech is making their cases now um i
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:14.080]   haven't had a new logitech keyboard since the um third generation ipad pro 12 point or sorry the
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:19.200]   second generation 12 point 9 hi-ped pro so they may have already been doing this with like the
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:26.480]   the new ipad uh keyboard slim case that they they have for the standard ipad but they use a um
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:34.320]   a soft silicon corner now instead of the hard plastic corners which anybody who is on a logitech
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:39.520]   keyboard in the past knows those corners always break when you're pulling your keyboard out you
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:44.240]   always end up breaking one of the corners well it's now made out of a soft pliable material
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:50.000]   so you're not going to have that breaking problem anymore so that's uh that's my my quick short thing
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:57.440]   about the logitech slim folio pro that is now available finally for the 11-inch ipad in the
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:01.520]   third generation 12 point n hi-ped that that's my pick that's my pick that's actually i was confusing
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:06.560]   that with the the bridge keyboard which is coming at the which i also i also have that'll be my
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:15.040]   pick next week sorry but i finally got this thank you yes i do like this i do you've been using it
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:20.480]   yeah it's awesome i like it that i was a headphone jack so i can finally use my headphones
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:26.080]   and it's it's so seamlessly just clicks into the back ear i've had that's what i love about it it's
[01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:30.480]   not a dongle it just kind of fits in there real nice and tight well i buy everything why i
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:38.080]   recommend so i guess i guess i'll just take a look at it rene richy pick of the week so uh i was
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:42.800]   skiing over the weekend and i've used a variety of skiing apps including slope there's a bunch of
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:47.920]   really good ones and this time because i had some people with me who were using snow as well
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:56.000]   i tried it out is s no w w and it's created by this really excited british guy who just wanted to ski
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:01.040]   and want an excuse to ski and so made an app as basically a way for him to get more skiing and
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:06.320]   which i think is delightful and it does all the sort of ski tracking that the apple watch api
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:11.360]   allows you to have it'll work with the apple with the iphone too but uh if you drop your iphone
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:15.920]   off a ski lift it's not as much fun so it's better just to go with your apple watch when you're skiing
[01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:19.920]   it'll do everything you know but the photos it'll track how fast you're going
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:25.520]   where you're going it even has this amazing ar mode so if you get to a rest point and you can't
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:30.240]   find your friends you hold up your phone and it'll show you elevation and direction for where
[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:34.320]   your friends are so you know oh i just got to ski down there or just got to jump on the chair
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:39.360]   left there and i'll find my i'll get back with my group and it has leaderboards it's a nice social
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:45.600]   aspect you can follow people and be followed by them uh when i was skiing there was a festival
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:49.600]   going on and they had quite a few people from the Canadian Olympic team there and you it was just
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:55.120]   amazing to see them turn down the mountain straight and fire off like fastballs from
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:59.200]   100 mile an hour zoom straight down the mountain not a care in the world
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:05.680]   well i was terrified of every kind of starfish turn so um and you could see at the end of the day
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:09.120]   because there were a bunch of people at the festival just sharing their speed it's a real
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:14.240]   difference between someone skiing for fun and someone who's like olympic level and not actually
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:18.560]   training at the time but just sort of having their day off and they're still like 800 times
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:23.280]   better than you can imagine being but it made it into a real fun experience because they had the
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:28.400]   leaderboards up at the different chalets and you could look at it and uh and see just how you were
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:32.080]   doing how everyone was doing if you wanted to include photos they had a bunch of the photos up
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:37.200]   um and it's you know it's it was just having a group of people on a mountain it made for an
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:44.560]   incredibly enjoyable experience this is free yeah is are there in that purchases i you know there
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:51.200]   might be i didn't i just given it away it's an amazing there is serious again it might be an excuse
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:56.480]   for his hobby serious skiers yeah exactly now i can write off all my ski and my lift tickets yeah
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:01.920]   i like the i message interface that's awesome you got stories yeah the whole thing is really nicely
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:06.880]   done look at that the watch interface and you can you can use series shortcuts so that if you don't
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:10.560]   even want to i just have my watch on and i could reach it between my glove and my jacket but
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:15.280]   i'm gonna go and do that you can create series shortcuts so you can just say yo jimbo you know
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:20.160]   what was my last beat or start you know all those sorts of things hey schlomo i'm at the bottom of
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:27.920]   a ravine with two broken legs for chances of some milk it was terrifying automatically yeah
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:32.240]   because there they were part i i'm used to having fences at the edge of anything even remotely steep
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:40.000]   and they were not there so i was like turn turn turn and the anaco pick of the week
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:46.560]   uh my pick is a new app called one switch that does one one simple thing but it's such a handy
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:51.520]   thing like there are times where i'm doing a screen a screencast and i don't want people to see
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:55.680]   all the messy icons on my desktop so i gotta take all i got to hide all of my desktop icons or
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:00.880]   i'm like i'm on radio and i'm using my laptop to for notes i want to make i just want to make sure
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:06.080]   the system doesn't go to sleep while i'm speaking and instead of having to go into settings and do
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:11.040]   multiple steps for this one switch puts all those functions into literally one switch so i can just
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:16.640]   click one button one switch that says keep awake and suddenly but whatever it needs to happen in
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:22.480]   order to make sure that my macbook will not go to sleep it will not go to sleep and if i want to
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:27.600]   switch to dark mode i can switch to dark mode if i want to hide my desktop icons i will hide the
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:35.120]   desktop icons it's five bucks but it's such a it's like why why did i have to like go into system
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:39.920]   preferences to do a lot of this stuff for the past ten years when i could have just done it from
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:45.360]   like a menu bar app it's very very nice and five bucks they have a it's brand new it's i think
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:51.520]   just came out about a month ago it's because of what it does it doesn't it will not be sold in the
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:56.000]   app store because it violates sandboxing rules obviously uh not that it's dangerous it's just
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.880]   that it's not it's the kind of app that is just impossible to sell through the app store but it's
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:06.640]   a seven-day free trial they've got a roadmap so that says all other features that they intend to
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:13.040]   keep adding to it as they keep going uh but yeah i was i i downloaded it just four days ago and
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:19.600]   uh i have not paid for it yet because i'm a slug but i will certainly pay as soon as it tells me that
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:24.240]   i can't do that anymore because it's a free trial i will definitely be paying for it actually you
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:28.080]   remind me and i meant to talk about it today i don't know if you guys talked about it
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:32.560]   uh last week but the announcement that apple made and i was unclear about this that they were
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:38.240]   in the next version of mohavi going to require notarization of apps
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:46.320]   did you talk about that last week or not okay i think they announced that a while ago did they
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:50.720]   well they did and they said it's going to be a default in the next version of mohav yeah
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:56.880]   which i think was the new announcement i was just wondering what that means
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:04.720]   for developers my concern is i want to understand what apple means by default does that mean is a
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:09.680]   user i could still right click and say open or does it mean that we're going to have to have
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:15.520]   everything be signed you can still right click and say open i think it's just a tighter requirement
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:20.800]   for apps that that are signed do you do you have any insight on that have you heard about that all
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:26.320]   over of course i've read about it you gotta do it gotta do it but you're already an apple
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:31.600]   developer so it's an easy thing for you yeah it's it's it's not a it's not a big deal i think it's
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:39.440]   it's it's kind of a um change in the way they sign they use they do uh app signing that allows
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:48.000]   them more control over you know how how they are able to disable um how they are able to disable
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:56.640]   malicious um stuff on the um on the on the on the computer so um that's a good thing for users
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:03.200]   it's for the users a good thing um i'm not sure about the developers um if i mean potentially they
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:11.200]   can use that to uh strong arm you into doing things you don't want to do or um prevent you from
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:15.680]   from they deny you notarization if they actually want to they can do so that would that was i guess
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:22.880]   my concern and it was this particular sentence in the documentation and it isn't the next version
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:27.440]   actually the next version all new or updated kernel extensions and all software from developers
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:33.200]   new to distributing with developer id must be notarized in a future version of mac os at some
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:39.120]   point notice notarization will be required by default for all software that's what worried me a
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:43.840]   little bit um is that different than them just denying you assert though like if they wanted
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:47.920]   to previously they could have denied denied you sort of right i don't know i mean that's
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:53.120]   yeah i was hoping that somebody here would say oh yeah that's just that's just another way of
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:56.160]   saying that i think the certification was being abused like there are people were
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:59:00.400]   saying yeah there was that that's yeah phony turkish actually they were real certificates from
[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:07.360]   a turkish developer that were used in malware um yeah i think that's that's that's what this is
[01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:12.960]   replacing certificates with no to recession um i don't i don't know about replacing i think
[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:20.960]   it's just a second level of you know we could sign our stuff ourselves self-signed and and
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:28.800]   and and there was like you had to trust that we we were the the company really doing the signing
[01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:36.000]   so if we lost our keys or whatever and the notarization is just adding this the this step where apple
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:42.000]   verifies that it's really us signing the application with our certificate so that concerns me because
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:46.720]   if i can't run an applications that have not been submitted to apple for notarization
[01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:53.360]   that you don't have to you don't have to submit the app it's it's it's it's just um well it's a
[01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:59.280]   switch in next code either yeah it's it's it's um it's it's a um it's a um but this is the headline
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:04.400]   give users even more confidence in your software by submitting it to apple for notarization
[02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:10.960]   uh it's been checked by apple for malicious components and it's going to be a requirement
[02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:14.720]   in future versions or see this is my question what does default mean
[02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:20.880]   default for all software i Renee i'm gonna sign you look into this we just so we could talk about
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:26.320]   it next because i'm just absolutely i that would concern me if you had if every it's what happens
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:34.080]   on ios you can't distribute ios software without apple approval they say this is not an app store
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:38.960]   but it sounds like it's a step toward that yeah and that's my concern so i don't want to see the
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:43.920]   ios application that this just replaces the old certification but the old not certified doesn't
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:47.680]   change okay choose to opt out of all of this it doesn't change by all the required by default
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:53.600]   for all software does not mean you have to do it well to be part of that sort of it like if
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:56.480]   you're going to be in the store or you're going to be a registered you know what i think
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:00.640]   it would have called certified the thing that lets you do that little trust so it must be
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:05.920]   notarized in order to run but if you use the develop ID thing so that's yeah i think that's
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:10.160]   the key if you develop by designing then yeah because you'd have to be able to write scripts
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:15.600]   on my own darn machine that i can run without a developer ID i would think yeah totally well
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:20.720]   you would think that's my concern you understand my point all right i think i'll i'll i'll i'll
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:26.080]   rich seagull from bare bones is coming on next week is he well good great but he will
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:32.960]   it's now that uh bb edit is in the app store i'm sure he has some stories to tell yeah i'm very
[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:38.080]   curious so it is in the app store now uh yes as a matter of fact Phil Schiller actually tweeted
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:44.960]   out hey congratulations to bare bones oh that's good uh for yeah i think they got paid to do it
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:48.480]   well yeah they announced remember they announced it a year ago that this is and everybody and we
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:52.960]   asked rich what what's the deal yeah yeah well well the one the person who can actually
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:56.160]   tell which one answer as we continue talking to developers
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:03.680]   my pick of the week very quickly Princeton has a project Princeton University is a project
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:07.440]   they're looking at smart devices and what information they're collecting
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:13.040]   and they are offering back only at the moment although they're working on a windows version
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:19.600]   and an android version or i'm sorry a linux version the Princeton iot inspector
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:24.240]   which is a tool for Mac OS that you install and i'm actually running it at home that will tell
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:30.560]   you not only all the devices the iot devices on your network but what data they're exfiltrating
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:37.840]   how much data they're exfiltrating what exactly is going on and uh this is really geeky and nerdy
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:43.040]   in fact it looks like it's an apple script as you can see uh but i uh and it does require a
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:49.040]   modification of the kernel you have to give it to permissions uh but i think this is very
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:55.840]   interesting and if you've been curious what your iot devices are doing as i was and i have many
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:03:02.240]   uh this is a very interesting new project it is a research project you'll be giving
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:11.680]   information to this team at Princeton but i trust Princeton iot- inspector.prinston.edu if
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:16.400]   you'd like to play with this uh and i will be talking more about what i learned it's been running
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:22.400]   the last few days on my system at home but i'll also tell you uh if your devices have been hacked
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:29.200]   who do they talk to what information is gathered it tells you what security protocols they use
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:32.720]   whether it's using broken encryption which a number of my devices are
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:40.560]   uh oh are you one of the favorite channels in letleria yeah this weekend just watching your
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:48.720]   cameras yeah exactly it's so much fun uh mr uh all of her britain bock it's great to have you

[02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:20.880]   like as we talked about last week georgia actually fell down the stairs and needed it so wow he has
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:26.000]   done some good i didn't hear that is she okay yeah she was she was home and she was going down the
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:29.280]   basement she was wearing socks and the basement steps were slippery and she fell down and she
[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:34.160]   heard herself pretty badly and it came up and luckily her brother was visiting who's not there
[02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:38.480]   very often and he heard and came running but her husband wasn't home so she would have she was
[02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:42.800]   happy that that that that that went off and she had the option of canceling it yeah that's a line
[02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:48.320]   there waiting for someone to come home cool i'm more dot com slash vector and of course laurie gill
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:55.280]   managing editor at imore anything you'd like to mention upcoming in your life yeah you know actually
[02:05:55.280 --> 02:06:03.280]   i've been lucky enough to interview um women in tech uh founders of companies entrepreneurs
[02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:09.920]   developers so if you search for me on imore if you search for my my articles on imore you'll see
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:14.880]   too so far that have come up that are interviews with different women and i have a few more in the
[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:19.840]   future and and hopefully this will just continue i'm really enjoying this talking to women who've
[02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:26.000]   just done a lot of amazing things that um there's there's the right sukim right there a brilliant
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:32.240]   oh i love brilliant brilliant saucer great yeah absolutely yeah and and these women have just done
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:36.960]   a bunch of great things and i think for me from my perspective is that i'm trying to normalize
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:44.960]   women in tech because it it is amazing and important and special but i also want the future to know
[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:50.080]   that women have been doing things too all along instead of instead of them sort of accidentally
[02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:55.200]   getting written out of history i'd like them to be kind of just sort of incorporated into all of
[02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:59.600]   our history in the future so i've been really happy to be able to talk to these women and
[02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:05.120]   get some amazing insight into how they got into what they were doing so that's a great series and
[02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:12.240]   it's easy to find laurie's work if you just google laurie gill and imore g_i_l_ and imore uh you will
