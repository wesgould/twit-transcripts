[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.680]   Here I am Leo LaPorte joining me, our esteemed panelist starting with Merlin Mann from 43
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.000]   folders who came all the way from uptown to be here today.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Came all the way from the West Side of San Francisco to the regular part of San Francisco.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   How's it going Leo?
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Good Merlin Mann.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Say hi to Scott.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   It's been a little sick.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   I'm a little sick.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   We've got the Toronto Flu, both Alex and I.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   It was cold and nasty there wasn't it Alex.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   It was cold and I think somehow we got the cold.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   There was something going around the studio and we picked it up.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Everybody was sick.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   It was a little grieving going on.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   It was the last week in Toronto for Call for Help.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   I think that's part of it.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core is here.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   He is in his own offices so he didn't go anywhere.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   The guy who came the longest, so you get the tote bag for the show Mr. Scott Born drove
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   all the way from Medford to be with us today.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Yes.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Thank you Scott Born.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Medford is a wonderful place to be from.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   That's in Oregon.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   You're in Seattle.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I'm in Gig Harbor.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Gig Harbor.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Gig Harbor is in Washington state, but it sounds like it should be Maine.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I'm in Gig Harbor.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Yeah, it does.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   It's actually in fact if you were to drive your boat into Gig Harbor you might think you're
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   in Maine except for the giant Mount Rainier in the background.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I have a new goal in life.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   What's that?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I'm going to come up and visit you in my boat.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I'm going to buy a trawler.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I talked to the Dicty Bartolo as a boat guy.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I said, "I want a boat."
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I told him all the things I want.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   He said, "Oh, you want a trawler?"
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   A Boston trawler?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   A Boston trawler.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   They only go eight knots.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Nice.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   They're very wide.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   They sleep like two or three couples.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I'm going to come up to Gig Harbor and my Boston trawler.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   You are welcome to use my slip.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   You want to bring your slip bar?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I do.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Okay.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Anybody want to just supply a slip joke?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Just go ahead and do that.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Here I set everybody up.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I handed you a softball.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   What are you going to do?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I caught a softball.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Slip is showing.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Do you have anything in your slip right now?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Negative.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   The happiest day of my life was when I sold my boat.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It was just a hole in which you poured money.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Is that it?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Well, it's very romantic to get a boat until you find out you've got to pay some schmo named Joe $5,000 a month to keep it looking good and acting good and running good.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You've got to paint it all the time.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   You've got to scrape the barnacles off.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   It's just a whole lot easier.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   What kind of boat did you have?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I had a criss craft.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   You had a nice boat.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Fast boat.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Yeah, but you know, it's like, here's the thing.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I rent boats.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Maybe I should do that.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Renting.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I would certainly recommend renting one for a while, but I will tell you that a Boston trawler is a very nice boat.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Yeah, they're wide.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I'm going to get it like a Nordic tug.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   We can actually set up a recording studio in there.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And then of course, we'd have to replace it every six months because of the salt water.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   But other than that, it'd be cool.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I'm thinking I'm going to go down to Tierra Del Fuego, my Boston trawler.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And I want to be a hit now.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   If we can use this access thing, I could be able to do the show from anywhere.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Right.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   It would be so cool.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Either that or Skype from here.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Where are we going to go?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   No.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Tierra Del Fuego, my friend.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Oh, yeah, that place.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I can't believe even talk about this last week.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I'm going to bring it up.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It's kind of old news.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.760]   But Apple made a little bit of money.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.240]   Almost a billion dollars this last quarter.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.920]   Not so bad, huh?
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.680]   One billion dollars.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.000]   With apologies to Dr. Evie.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Yeah, they did it.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Okay.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   They sold 21 million iPods.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Oh my gosh.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.800]   21 million iPods.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.800]   As an Apple shareholder, all I can say is that this might be appropriate time for a moment
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.200]   of silence and thanks.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   We should full disclosure here.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   I do not know.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.400]   I need more accurate about Zapplstock.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.440]   No, I own virtual Apparstalk.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.880]   I don't really don't own Apple stock.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.000]   I refer to it that way because I've said it in earlier ones.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.200]   I actually just have like play stock.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.560]   Oh, you actually don't own any Apple stock.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.720]   I actually don't own stock.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.560]   It's only Scott here owns Apple stock.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.040]   I don't own stock in any company because, yeah, when we get into them.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   You're poor.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   Cool.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   No, no, I just don't.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.040]   I don't really like stuff market.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.200]   So anyway, so anyway.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.640]   The worst part is like I'm slaughtering in my little virtual world.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.120]   I'm slaughtering the market.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.960]   Who else did you buy with your phony money?
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.840]   I got Apple NVIDIA ATI Adobe Pixar, but I bought Apple at like 11.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.560]   So now I really wish I had used it.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.080]   Hey, I bought Google at five in my imagination.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.320]   You guys got to help me out here because see, I have a real broker and I call him and I
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.840]   take some money out of my checking account.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.200]   How do you buy stock?
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.200]   In our imaginations.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.640]   No, there's a thing called marketocracy that you can go up and you can actually set up
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.920]   your own little fund and then you can do it all.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.920]   So just do it.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.440]   Then it sends you this email and you can look back over your last, you know, whatever.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.200]   You know, my, I think my portfolio grows at about is running about 30, 35% a year.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.280]   Alex, you don't have a portfolio.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   Tony portfolio.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.080]   My virtual portfolio because it shows you that.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.080]   It keeps track of it all.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.080]   So you can watch it all.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.080]   It's something to say.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.080]   And you can sit there and...
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.560]   Is this anything like my make believe girlfriend on Battlestar Galak?
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.160]   It's very, very similar.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.160]   It's fun.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.760]   It takes you through all the things that you do except for the actual money part.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.000]   And it was, you know, because it was just one of those things that I started to experiment
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   with.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   It's great.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   What's the deal?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I don't understand.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Alex, I started like three or four years ago.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   I haven't really done much with it.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.680]   You know, I changed the stocks every once in a while, but I mostly just, I bought a bunch
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.240]   of stuff and every once in a while I put something else in the portfolio.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.560]   Actually Apple stock was off a little today.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.960]   I think it's, there's a little profit taking.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.320]   They, they've sold now.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.960]   I can't, this is amazing.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.600]   I saw like 21 million iPods this quarter.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.520]   I think they've now sold 90 million.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.520]   Is that right?
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.520]   Let me check that again.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.520]   Let me check that number again.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.120]   90 million iPods since they went on sale in October 2001.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.120]   Is that, is that mind boggling?
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.120]   Is that more people than...
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.120]   I have five.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.120]   Yeah, that's why.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.680]   You can't buy just one.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.880]   They're like Lay's potato chips.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.880]   No, they are.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.520]   I mean, I just keep on buying, you know, as they release them, I, I buy them.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.520]   That's what I do.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.680]   By the way, a computer sales did well too.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.880]   I mean, you know, well, let's, I know Apple dropped computer from its name, but Mac sales
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.440]   rose 40%, two and a half billion dollars in revenue.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.120]   Mac shipments up 28%.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.560]   I don't understand why the sales were so much higher than the shipments.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.640]   Double the growth of the, now this is the key one.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.360]   Double the growth of the overall PC market.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.480]   Now maybe PC folks are just waiting for Vista, but it was a very good quarter if you're a
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.480]   Macintosh fan.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.480]   Wow.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.480]   I think that, I think that the ability to run both windows and...
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.720]   OS X makes a big difference, you know, for a lot of people.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.920]   And I think that that's what's pushing the Mac sales harder.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:45.160]   I know a lot of people who used to, you know, still want to use their PC, but have always
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.720]   wanted to have OS X as well.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.720]   Get ready for this.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.920]   I'm doing Regis and Kelly next week, and they never want me to show computer stuff.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.440]   They want me to show parallels.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.440]   Oh my God.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.320]   I mean, they don't usually even let me show a computer, but they want me to show parallels.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:04.360]   I think that there is, that just shows you that the general audience is kind of grokking
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.920]   that you can run Mac and Windows on OS X and Windows on Mac.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.640]   And the funny part that we talked about this a bit before, but I think the funny part that
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.800]   people are going to realize is that they're going to find that once they're used to OS X
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.800]   and they get over that hump of just not being on Windows, that they're going to see there's
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.960]   a lot that they didn't even realize they were going to be able to do transparently.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.000]   So that becomes like a, maybe even like a security blanket to just know that the Windows
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   are...
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   That's what it is.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   They'll stop using Windows, I think.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.840]   Oh, and I use Windows occasionally, like when we got the juiced, you still have to hold
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.840]   to that.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.840]   You have to have Windows for juiced.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.840]   It was nice.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.840]   It was nice.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.840]   I just reboot.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   Did juiced run on parallel?
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.840]   Oh, you did boot camp.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   I boot camped.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.240]   So I restarted and it worked just fine.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.280]   So, but I think that having that, it's just such a luxury for me.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.760]   A 30 gigabyte luxury, which I'm always complaining about, but a luxury to be able to just switch
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.560]   over if you absolutely need to do that.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.560]   I think that a lot of people are looking at that.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.920]   Even if they're PCs, there's a lot of people that talked to that had PCs that were in
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.760]   the media field really saw this as a time when they upgraded the next time.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.880]   They just bought one just because they could go both ways.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.520]   So is this incredible quarter for Apple?
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.520]   A bellwether?
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.840]   Is this the way it's going to be now?
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.840]   Is Apple surging ahead?
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.840]   Their one-year target estimate price is $112.32, which is way more over than my prediction
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.840]   of $100.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.840]   So I think that's a safe bet.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.840]   But they're way down off $100.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.840]   You know, they're at $86.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.840]   Why?
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.840]   I know.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.000]   But let's get in perspective.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.920]   They're 52-week run is anywhere between $50.97.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.440]   So a year ago, they were $50.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.520]   Today, they're $86.79.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.400]   But let's look at an important number.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.880]   And that's market cap.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.080]   Microsoft's market cap is $302 billion.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.280]   And Apple's is $75 billion.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.960]   So most people think of Microsoft being a lot larger than Apple, even larger than that
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.080]   ratio and with the ability to- Well, it is four times bigger.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.080]   Right.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.760]   Most people, if you ask them, Leo, think it's 40 times bigger.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.280]   When they find out it's not.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.720]   And here's another thing for those that follow this stuff, the PE ratio is $3,145 on Apple.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.480]   It's only $24.56 on Microsoft.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.520]   People believe a little bit more in Apple.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.520]   What do you Apple's mean?
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.360]   Apple's PE is now up to $38.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.360]   Okay.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.160]   Well, last number I got is $31.45.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.720]   But anyway- Yeah, so it's gone up quite a bit.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.040]   I mean, that's because of this new profit.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:27.720]   Now if you just want to look at other PC companies, Apple, it's market caps doing quite well.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.760]   I mean, well, IBM's $146 billion.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.080]   But it's right up in there.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.200]   And I think that's a reflection on the ability to start to penetrate the Windows market.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.520]   So that's why this stuff is important, not that I'm ever going to use it, but I think
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.520]   it's important.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.080]   Hewlett-Packard's $114 billion.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.640]   Just looking at market caps here.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.200]   Dell is about the same as Apple $55 billion.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.240]   And I think you're right, there was some profit taking here when they started bumping
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.240]   up around.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.240]   And it's always psychological.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.120]   The $100 market's psychological.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.240]   Once it hits that, it'll just go, "Baaah!"
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.240]   Right.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.240]   Right.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.240]   People say, "Okay."
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.240]   Well, didn't- No, split it.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.240]   That's my prediction.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.240]   Remember that was a split-up prediction.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.760]   You know, Apple, the rumor is, according to Apple, insider that Apple is going to have
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:18.280]   a Super Bowl ad, according to- actually, Toronto Sun says, "Siting sources with knowledge
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:24.880]   of the product that the Beatles will be available on Apple's iTunes Store as soon as next month."
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.840]   And people think that that's what the Super Bowl commercial is going to be.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.760]   It's a special announcement on the Super Bowl on Sunday.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.600]   You think that's what the announcement is?
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.000]   Well, we saw the use of the Beatles during the keynote.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   He kind of grinned a little bit when he did that.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.240]   And he's saying, "He's playing Sergeant Pepper, you know.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.240]   There's the album art.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.240]   Where'd he get it?"
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.200]   I think that makes more sense than an iPod.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.320]   I mean, I think if they'd had an iPod ready, I'm guessing we would have heard about it.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.760]   I don't know if it would have.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.040]   I think that there's a possibility that we may see- I mean, I think that they put all
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.280]   that work into that widescreen format.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.160]   I don't see any reason why they wouldn't release it.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.200]   They've got to do a widescreen iPod like that.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.640]   So the story in the Toronto Sun said, "A Valentine's Day," because the Beatles album's called,
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.920]   "Dove," that would be a suitable time to release the Beatles CDs.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.120]   February 4th, of course, is Super Bowl Sunday.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.800]   Maybe February 4th, you announce, you know, "Valentine's Day, the Beatles come to iTunes
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.160]   and you'll have a new way to play him."
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.200]   You would do it on the Super Bowl, would you?
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.960]   Is that the way to announce it?
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.600]   The Beatles are the iPod.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.120]   Well, the Beatles is a given.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.560]   We know they're doing that.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.560]   I'm talking about the iPod.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.080]   Yeah, I think the iPod makes more sense than the Beatles.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.240]   I'm not that- I guess if I saw an ad that said the Beatles were now available on-
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.240]   You might say-
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.240]   I mean, they weren't.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.240]   Yeah, well, I'm-
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.240]   Yeah, well, I'm-
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.440]   And I have to admit, I own all the Beatles CDs and I have them all digitized already.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.240]   And I think a lot of people, because if they were going to buy them-
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.120]   Somebody was saying to me, this is going to be-
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.680]   Maybe it was you, Scott Borne, who said that this is going to be a whole new generation
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.120]   discovering the Beatles.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.600]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.320]   I mean, I'm a huge Beatles fan and I talk to young people all the time that don't really
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.320]   know who they are.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:14.000]   So once it shows up in iTunes, it's real and since they'll make such a big deal of
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.520]   it, it's not like you'll have to search for Beatles.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.040]   It'll be all over the front page of the iTunes.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.040]   I'm kind of with Alex though that if the average guy, I think of the average Joe Blow
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.520]   sitting there watching the Super Bowl and the ad comes on and says, "Good news, the
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.000]   Beatles are now available on iTunes."
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.520]   He's going to say, "Huh?"
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.000]   Okay, how about this?
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Here you go.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.040]   What's going to be a Beatles touch screen iPod?
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.080]   Oh, you're right.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.080]   A special Beatles.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.080]   Like the bottom one.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.080]   I'm not done.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.080]   It's an iPod.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:47.480]   It's a special edition Beatles iPod plus it's a new remastered version of the albums coming
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.480]   out.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.480]   You got it.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.480]   Well, it's fact-
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.720]   Because the remastering thing is so hot right now to get people-
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.440]   No, George Martin's has been doing it.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.440]   George Martin said that-
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.000]   George Martin's son has been-
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   That's right.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   worked on that love thing.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.440]   And Martin said, "Our first priority, we're going to do this Cirque du Soleil love soundtrack.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.440]   We're going to do that.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.680]   Then we are going to remaster all the Beatles and we will put them on."
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.680]   He said this months ago, "We will put them online."
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.680]   You hit it.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.680]   You got it, Merlin.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.920]   It's a special Beatles edition iPod.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.920]   That's amazing.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.760]   Just 45 seconds ago, that was in my butt.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.320]   And now it's a prediction and it's out there.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.320]   Silent but deadly, brilliant ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.800]   You think that's even conceivably possible.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.800]   Absolutely.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   They got the YouTube one.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.800]   They got it.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.800]   They've totally got it.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   You're selling past the clothes.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.800]   You've totally got it.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.280]   You're selling past the clothes, dude.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:35.000]   You had me an iPod.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.440]   And I think it's one thing you left out though.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.040]   It'll have a little green apple on the back.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.720]   Oh, there is one little detail.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.440]   This lawsuit thing.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.400]   That's a good point.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.480]   But maybe that's how they settled a lawsuit.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.720]   We'll make a special Beatles iPod.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.400]   We'll give you 10% of the profit.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.240]   Oh, that's good.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.120]   That's more and more.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.920]   That's what I call a good negotiation.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.920]   That's like the easiest way to put one.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.920]   I mean, at first.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.680]   And if that would be a super bowl and that's it.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.640]   And wouldn't you run to the store and buy it?
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.640]   I would.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.800]   Especially if it looks like the iPhone.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.280]   Would it come with all the Beatles out?
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.280]   Whoa.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.000]   If you had it all black, you know, this whole red thing.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   I mean, I wouldn't be red.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Red's cause.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.320]   Well, the thing is that there's got to go.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.480]   The really, the biggest thing would be for them to put out all of the major, the UK edition
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.080]   of all of the albums at one time.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.800]   You don't want to start with like, please, please me.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.800]   Like that's not a lot of people.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.800]   No, no, no.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.800]   It should be the original definitive albums.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.800]   You're right.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.800]   The UK albums.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.800]   Like the white album.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.800]   It's not that many albums.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.800]   Right.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.800]   I mean, it's fewer albums than you two.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.800]   Oh gosh.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   I mean, what they.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.800]   Half as many songs.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.800]   Oh, I'd be pretty cool.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.800]   I would enjoy that.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.800]   Let me just write this down.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.360]   Please mark this 122 at 4.41 PM.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.600]   Merlin Mann made the definitive prediction.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.400]   Leo, you were in Toronto last week, but I have sworn off prognostication.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.560]   My predictions are so bad and so off target.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.560]   I think you got it.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.560]   All right.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.120]   Well, I was the one who said leopard was going to ship it at Macworld.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   I mean, please.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:06.480]   And I was the one that said they were going to now see iPhone.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.480]   I'm sick of the iPhone.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.480]   I'll tell you something.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.840]   I'm not buying the iPhone because he's not allowing third party apps on the iPhone.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.280]   Steve Jobs has screwed the pooch.
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.720]   He's in bed with singular and can we just calm down one second here?
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.720]   That was a mistake.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.560]   Oh, look who's talking people off the ledge now.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.160]   Listen, listen, listen, listen.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.680]   I mean, what do you think that's the biggest thing?
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.680]   I don't know what we are.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.680]   What versions of the apps that it's a huge mistake.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:33.480]   But when jobs says, oh, no, we want to preserve the integrity of the singular network and
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.400]   having people put their own applications could be terrible.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.640]   That's what Western Electric said when you used to have to rent your phone from them.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:46.280]   Leo, we just, there was a survey done and asked how many people actually put applications
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.920]   on their so-called smartphones.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.400]   It's like 7%.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   Come on.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.240]   I think most of the, well, now that 7% of all cell phone.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.000]   Where did you come up with that number?
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   I pulled it right out of your butt.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.600]   You as a, anybody who has a trigger.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.120]   That's why I feel so relaxed now.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.520]   I don't know if I buy that at all.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:07.520]   I mean, the part that we talked about this, I think, what I can remember of the 21st Amendment
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.520]   evening.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.960]   But I think we talked about this a little bit.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.440]   The big missing opportunity here is for all these Apple developers who potentially would
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.680]   have the chance to get their amazing application in front of all these people who think they
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.680]   hate apps.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.680]   Oh, it's just crazy.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.680]   It's crazy.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.680]   It's a conversion one app, you guys.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.680]   Would you just-
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.840]   No, but he, no, I would say that except for all this lip service to singular.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.200]   By the way, I was told that if you go in a T-Mobile store and say, are you guys going
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.600]   to have the Apple phone?
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.600]   They said, oh, yeah, no problem.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.600]   We'll have it.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.600]   You know, the FCC requires or not requires-
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.840]   It's meta vaporware.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.360]   I think it'll, I think you'll be able to, how to unlock it.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.360]   It'll be, I'll come unlock it.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.600]   People will be selling it all over the place.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.560]   You won't get that cellular, that to singular voicemail thing.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.000]   Well, you guys, feel free to sell it short and let me know when you're good.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.640]   I'm buying, I'm buying a Prada phone.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.640]   I'm buying-
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.640]   Here we go.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.640]   I'm buying the LG KE-H50.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.640]   That is-
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.640]   How much is that?
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.640]   It's exactly what the phone is.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.640]   Who cares?
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.640]   It's better than the iPhone.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.080]   It looks just like an iPhone though.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.080]   Don't-
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.280]   Of course, and that's what everybody's saying is, hey, wait a minute.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.480]   Did Apple steal their design from LG?
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.880]   It seems very, yeah, that seems very-
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.440]   It seems highly unlikely.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.320]   More likely than the LG stole their design from Apple.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.080]   I mean, yeah, that seems unlikely too.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.880]   I mean, how would they do that that fast?
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.400]   Well, there was a lot of, it wasn't, there was a lot of patent stuff that had come out
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.680]   of what Apple was applying.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.680]   So months ago-
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.200]   Oh, we started seeing patent office-
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.200]   Apart from the black phones-
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.920]   The phone doesn't have buttons though.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.920]   How is it the same?
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.920]   I mean, you can see my buttons.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.400]   I'm reading from the LG press release-
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.120]   Glowing icons on the face of the phone.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:38.360]   Disappear when not in use to reveal a pure, unadulterated black exterior.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.760]   The phone is ultra thin, just 12 millimeters.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.760]   Nevertheless, I'm sounding like the guy at the Haunted Mansion.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.760]   There are no windows and-
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.920]   Your ghost host.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.760]   No doors.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:55.000]   Nevertheless, it hosts an array of additional multimedia functions, MP3 player, music multitasking
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.400]   for messaging, external memory slot, which the iPhone lacks.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.440]   Starting at 600 euros, so that's very expensive.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.160]   I think without the issue with a lot of these phones, I still think it is going to be without
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.160]   being connected to iTunes.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.080]   They're going to have a hard time.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.240]   That's the killer app right now.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.240]   I think-
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.880]   I don't think people listen to music on their phones and I don't think even with the iPhone
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:17.880]   they will.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.480]   Not on five hours of battery life time.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.680]   I think that that's red herring.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.640]   I don't think people really want music on their phones.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.120]   I don't think I don't see myself carrying both my video, iPod and my phone around it.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.240]   What I've been wanting is to have both of those one thing.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.840]   And so as soon as I get that, I don't see myself carrying both of them around anymore.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.640]   I think that it'll just be the thing that I carry.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.720]   Why don't you have your imaginary stocks?
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   You can have an imaginary iPod.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.280]   I would think about that.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.240]   To sell 12 kabillion of these things.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.920]   You mark my words.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.320]   There are a kabillion people.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.320]   People will complain.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.840]   How many zeros are in kabillion?
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.840]   A bunch.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.840]   People will complain.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.840]   Okay, I'll make a more realistic number.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.120]   They will sell 98 octillion.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.000]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.160]   There are only 60 million singular customers.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.960]   So I think we have a ceiling here.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.040]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:14.560]   I've been watching all the traffic on the forums as you have the distortion field fade
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.000]   away and then everyone starts to attack.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.320]   But I remember some of these conversations right after the iPod was launched and right
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.280]   after the Mac was launched.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.840]   And everybody was like, oh, no, but I'll ever buy that.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.120]   You remember back in 1984?
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.440]   I'm old Leo.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.880]   You remember when the Mac was launched?
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.840]   What did people say when the Mac was launched?
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.480]   They were saying, who would want to buy an ugly computer like that?
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.720]   It doesn't run any good software.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.720]   Actually, they were right.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   It was $2,500.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.120]   It had one floppy disk drive that held 400k.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.880]   And how many Macs have been sold since?
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.880]   Well, that's right.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.480]   So you're saying this is like the first Mac?
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.720]   I mean, this is like the first iPod.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.960]   It's like the first Mac.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.840]   Everybody's going crazy about, oh, I done do this.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   I done do that.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.080]   We were looking at the first Mac or the first iPod.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.400]   We'd have lots of negative things to say.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.360]   But yet, these are just revs.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.400]   You go through rev after rev and all of a sudden you got something the whole world
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.400]   wants.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.840]   I think if you look at this as a 1.0 app, it's pretty darn good right out of the gate.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:12.000]   And I'm sure that they will address some of these things as they go.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.240]   And I'm going to be very happy to have the 1.0 version and the 1.1 and the 1.2 and all
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.920]   the way up to version 99.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.400]   One of the things I think that's important also is that whatever Apple's doing to get
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.600]   the deal with Singular, the interesting thing about having an OS 10 or OS 10 like operating
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.440]   system is of course, there's lots of things that can be changed without you having to
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.800]   change the phone.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:39.840]   So the how, what features are limited and what features are not limited is a malleable
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.280]   thing a year or two into the system.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.280]   And I think that is, you know, Apple doesn't have a lot of leverage until they have 30
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.560]   million phones out there.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.720]   And then they have a lot of leverage.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:55.240]   And as John Grubber pointed out, even though it may not, Coco may not be open to developers
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:59.400]   on the outside, it still will be available to developers on the inside.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.400]   And that's a lot to do something with even if you're just having internally developed
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.400]   apps.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.400]   All right.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.400]   All right.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.480]   Now, now I think we should, since we've started this conversation, I think we should
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.960]   all make a prediction by the end of the year.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.680]   How many do we think are going to, how much do each of us think are?
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.080]   Well, no, it's, it's got allowed to do one of those Brian Epstein things where he goes
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.680]   out and buys a bunch of copies to make stock.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.520]   So, so the Beatles.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:30.440]   Scott, Scott, what's your magic number for 2007?
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.840]   Okay.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.800]   What did jobs predict they would sell?
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.560]   10 million by 2008.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.520]   They didn't say he said 2008, not 2007.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.840]   I think of the shoes.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.840]   I will.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.200]   I predicted they will sell the 10 million he predicted by 2008.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.360]   I predict they will sell it by 2007.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.360]   You're so crazy.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.360]   What are you smoking?
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:52.680]   They'll have sold two million at best by the end of 2007 at best.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.480]   I'm the guy who told you to short everybody on the day of the announcement.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.640]   Merlin, what's your prediction?
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.640]   What did that cost you?
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.640]   What's yours, Alex?
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.640]   I hope I stock.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.640]   No, it's your turn.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.640]   It's your turn.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.640]   I like going less on the prices right thing.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   You can see.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.640]   I know.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.640]   I was going to do 11.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.640]   I was going to do 11 million.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.640]   11 million.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.640]   I was going to say one.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.240]   No, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say 18 million.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.240]   18.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.120]   If I'm smoking something, if I'm smoking something, Alex is growing it.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.480]   I'm growing it, man.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.480]   I say 18 million.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.800]   The phone comes out in June.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.800]   Okay.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   Maybe maybe.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.480]   Anyone talking in June, June through December, right?
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.480]   They made.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.480]   Six months.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.480]   I'll say it.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.480]   Six months.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.560]   They made 12 million, supposedly, according to Han, huh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.720]   The Taiwanese guys, Han, ho, ho, ho, no, I'm calling it.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.720]   I'm calling it.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.600]   You say there's, they made 12 million, but they're going to sell 18 million.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.600]   Okay.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.840]   Well, they can make more, you know, there's this thing called a factory.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.840]   They could make more.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:49.840]   They could make more.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.840]   And I think they're going to, I think they're going to make it.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.840]   They can sell it in the cell.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.000]   It's contracted for 12.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Okay.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   I'm saying.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.760]   And that's the only reason why I'm writing this down.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.640]   I'm not saying that they'll ship 18 million.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.640]   I'm showing it.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.640]   They'll sell 18 million.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.640]   People are going to sell it.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.640]   They're going to sell it to them.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.120]   And then some diamond late 19 people are going to get them.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.360]   I think people are going to be on wait lists.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.360]   Okay.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.360]   Wait lists.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.360]   Do you think it'll be over?
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.360]   Yeah, there are.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.360]   They are available.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.360]   That's why I'm saying that once it's available, I think it'll sell this.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.360]   So let me give a second.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.440]   So Scott, you said 10 million by the end of the year.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.600]   By December 31st.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.600]   Okay.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.760]   Alex said, what did you say?
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.760]   20 million 18.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.160]   I didn't say 20.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.880]   20 is way too hot.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.320]   I said, I said 2 million.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.480]   And Merlin, how many?
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.480]   780 million.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.480]   You know, the old price is right thing, right?
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.840]   So see, that's why I want to go $1.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.800]   Yeah, no, I have no idea.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.560]   I mean, they'll sell out of what they've got.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.240]   Scott has to, you know, pick up every last one of them.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.600]   You say they're going to make 12 million in this restaurant.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.520]   That's what they supposedly agree on.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.520]   In the background is, oh, ho, ho, they've contracted that.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.520]   The six months between a notional June release and the end of the year.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.520]   Is that the question or over the life of the time?
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.520]   Yes, that's the question.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.520]   No, no.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.320]   Rev one, six months, how many do they sell?
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.320]   Yes.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.320]   780 million.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:16.600]   OK, he's deflecting us with humor, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.600]   No, no, I have.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.440]   You know, how would I have any way of knowing?
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.440]   I don't know.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.440]   I don't even know.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.440]   I don't even know.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.440]   I don't even know.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.440]   I don't even know.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.440]   I don't even know.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.440]   I don't even know.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.440]   I don't even know if fake stock like Alex.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.440]   You know what?
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.440]   I'm going to go.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.440]   I'm going to go with, there's no way that I'm 20 yet.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.440]   No way.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.440]   No way.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.440]   No one's 20 yet.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.440]   You would be the top.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.440]   You would be the most.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.440]   That's the most, huh?
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.440]   Yep.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.440]   Alex only went 18 and we mocked him for that.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.280]   I got to warn you.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.880]   60, how many pound people subscribe via a singular right now?
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.880]   60 million.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.880]   60 million.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.880]   That number is miserable.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.680]   The six number is utterly irrelevant.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.880]   60 million miserable singular customers.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.880]   21 million.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.480]   That is 21 million?
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.480]   Sure.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.480]   OK.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:02.640]   So Leo, did you ever think that I would be conservative in this group?
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.960]   You and I are closer than Merlin and Alex.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.960]   I do.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.200]   I don't think they're going to do nearly as well.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.080]   I certainly don't think they're going to sell out in the first six months.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.040]   And you didn't think they were going to be announced either.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.040]   Did you?
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.240]   Well, no, I never said they wouldn't announce the iPhone.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.080]   I thought I was pretty likely they would.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.480]   Let me ask you this.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.720]   So we talked about this just a bit last week.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:30.080]   So the thing I was ribbon Scott about for the longest time was that it seemed like he
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.240]   wanted whatever an iPhone was regardless of what it was.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.240]   Yeah, I just wanted the name.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.680]   So I think we need to call up something that we said last week.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.800]   This is still vaporware.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.960]   This is announced hardware that we've seen some kind of working, supposedly working demo
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.960]   of.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.200]   Now, the question is of the things that were announced in there and the flavors that were
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.520]   announced, we're saying we think it's going to sell X number of units based on what they
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.520]   announced.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.520]   Features that were announced.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.520]   We're giving Apple credit for actually delivering on what they announced.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.440]   Let me ask you this, Leo, would your number change if they decided between now and then
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:05.440]   that something along the lines of let's say dashboard or certification program came along.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.040]   Two things would change it for you.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.240]   Two things would change it for me.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.640]   Third party apps and a lower price.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.480]   So you think they should have multiple models maybe?
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.080]   I think the price is a little steep.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.360]   You know, if this is the thing that's not completely clear, it sounds like the price
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:25.560]   is including singular's because you have to sign up for two years.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.880]   And so that's what I think that's where I think everybody's missing the ball.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.560]   I hear everybody screaming about the phone.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.600]   But as I understand it, the intent was to deliver a two year contract with that.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.200]   And at that price, we're now cooking with gas.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.400]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.400]   You don't.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.400]   That's not, no.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:46.680]   No, the standard for, if when you say a cell phone price, you say the price and it's contingent
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:52.920]   on signing up for a contract usually for one or two years to has become the kind of standard.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.600]   So that's the subsidized price is $600.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.600]   That's kind of a high subsidized price.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.560]   It means the actual price of the phone could well be over a thousand.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.360]   I heard a rumor though that they were going to include some service.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.760]   You know, that's the rumor I heard.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.960]   That's somebody who misunderstood what that's.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.640]   Well, if you heard a rumor, it must be true.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.600]   No, when, when, when we do things on this show all the time based on, oh, yeah, we don't
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.200]   have to have any journalistic.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.400]   I heard Ringo is actually going to bring the phone to your house.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.400]   I love to give you an iPhone.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.040]   And then it's going to play the solo from the end right there in your house.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.040]   I just love this.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.600]   You guys, you just keep saying your names because I'll just be sitting over here with
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.600]   your.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.760]   I'll give you a singular ain't going to give you anything for free.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.520]   In fact, that's the other thing that is going to be a very big question mark.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:40.120]   Singular is actually fairly expensive for data plans.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.400]   How much is it going to cost to use the iPhone, let alone buy the iPhone?
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.120]   I think this is a, this is a rich man's toy.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.320]   And I don't see it being a mass product.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.240]   I don't, I, I have to admit that I don't really think of myself using that, the edge
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.240]   network at all.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.040]   I mean, I, and I have to admit that I'm just around Wi-Fi enabled areas.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.040]   90% of the way.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.520]   You're in a big city, you're in San Francisco.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.520]   Now you have free Wi-Fi.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.520]   Every Starbucks.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.920]   I walk in any Starbucks.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.360]   Have you used the new Google Wi-Fi?
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.400]   Cause that's a, isn't that any minute now?
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.560]   It's sometime this year.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.560]   Oh, okay.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.040]   But so you'll have, you'll be able to go anywhere in San Francisco.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.880]   This is, you know, on the car, you're stuck there.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:20.520]   But he does have a, a really nice nav unit.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.000]   Do you really?
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Do you really?
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Yeah, I do.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   You have a GPS.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   You don't have a car.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.480]   But it, Hey, when I'm walking around, I'm never lost.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.480]   No, I have a GPS.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.560]   My favorite bit of Alex trivia.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.560]   No, I have a GPS because I spend a lot of time in LA.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.960]   Alex, you were such a weird person.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.960]   I got.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.440]   You really are.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.680]   You're just strange.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.680]   He doesn't have a TV.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.600]   He doesn't have a TV, but he works in a studio full of TV equipment.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.600]   He has an imaginary portfolio.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.600]   He has no.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.600]   He has an imaginary portfolio.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.600]   He has an imaginary portfolio.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.600]   Yes.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.360]   Hey, like there's something wrong with me.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.440]   I spent, I spent half of my, I spent half of the money.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.080]   I spent a month traveling and I'm in cities that I don't spend a lot of time in.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.760]   And so I take GPS works with my, with my trio.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.760]   So how's that?
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:07.760]   How's that?
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.000]   Tom, Tom worked down there in Zimbabwe.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.080]   The Tom Tom, the Tom Tom doesn't work at all in Zimbabwe.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.080]   Okay.
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.080]   And won't get into that.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.680]   Well, you get a GPS signal, but there's just no maps, right?
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.680]   It just doesn't know what you just said.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.680]   You're here.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.720]   And it's like, you know, there's no roads.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.520]   There's plenty of roads, but.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.560]   But anyway, so I got, you know, I got lost in LA one time and ended up in Compton in the
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.560]   middle of the night.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.120]   So I bought a GPS.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.120]   So that's a good reason by a GPS.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.120]   So, so anyway, but the.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.680]   So, so that's why I have a GPS on my thing.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.320]   And I'd really, I'd love to see one, but I think that's going to be kind of exciting
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.560]   is a GPS product built for.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.400]   And I think we're going to see a lot of developers developing stuff for the iPhone.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.840]   What Apple's basically saying is they're going to be the gateway, at least at the beginning.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:49.840]   Don't forget that.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.920]   I think we'll, we'll be able to partner with them and they will be able to sell it.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.560]   It'll be sold through Apple and it'll be sold.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.040]   But there will be individual developers developing for the iPhone.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.040]   That's my other, that's my, my big procrastination.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.120]   Don't forget that dock port there.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.600]   They can, they can attach all kinds of goodies to that thing.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.720]   And Apple makes money on everything that goes on that port.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.720]   All right.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.520]   I think it's enough for the iPhone.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.280]   Can I change my guest to 5000?
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.280]   5000?
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.280]   No, no, no.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.400]   He goes from 21 million to 5000.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.760]   I just feel I'm very certain it'll be somewhere between 5000.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:27.200]   So Apple's going to make a little bit of money, Buck 99 on all of those folks who have a core
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.960]   two Macintoshs and want to upgrade to.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:36.200]   And Apple says it's because of accounting, we've already booked the revenue for those
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.000]   new MacBook Pros and MacBooks.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.440]   And if we're going to upgrade the chip to end, we've got to charge you a buck 99 so that
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.040]   we can keep the books straight.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.960]   Wall Street Journal says that's, that's who we.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:53.400]   Yeah, but the Wall Street Journal isn't, isn't the one that has to do with the SEC if it turns
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:57.400]   out in 10 years that some, someone decides that it's not the right way to handle it.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.400]   I mean, that's the problem.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.960]   It isn't like a big amount of money.
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.080]   I mean, it's not, if they were charged at 15 bucks, I might be a little more suspicious.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.320]   I don't think that's any, I guess I just don't think that there's any reason that Apple would
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:10.440]   charge it just to make a little extra money because it's such, it's such a rough PR.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.840]   If they think that this is an issue, I mean, I, I do believe that that's, I don't know
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.440]   whether it's valid or not, but I do believe that their legal team is saying, and it has,
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.840]   it doesn't have to do with you have to charge for everything that you, that you provide.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:27.480]   It's what it's dealing with directly is, is they've already accounted for the, the revenue
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.920]   from the hardware that they sold.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:35.000]   And if they, you know, add something to it, there's a question about whether they, you
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.080]   know, it's, that's the accounting issue related to it.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:44.000]   So I don't think that it, you know, I don't really care, but, but the, the, the
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.560]   has to have something with the fact that they're on the line with the SEC over the options
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.640]   scandal and that they don't, maybe they just want to bend over backwards.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.640]   Well, I just know that we've dealt with Apple and a couple of other things that are related
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.640]   to this.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.400]   I don't want to get too much into them, but the, but the Sarbox stuff is real Apple is
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.000]   really, really concerned and careful about that.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.520]   Probably overly concerned, but obviously in the current situation, I think it's pretty
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.520]   a, that's pretty reasonable.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.680]   You might want to tell people what that means.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:08.680]   Sarbanes Oxley.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.880]   Sometimes notice socks.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.480]   It's the US accounting rules that were adopted after the Enron scandal.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.320]   And, you know, we talked a little bit about it on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:24.080]   The consensus is it's one of the reasons why you see no IPOs in the US because people
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.320]   are terrified.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.880]   They can't comply with Sarbanes Oxley.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:32.520]   And, and frankly, it's taking a lot of a lot of the economic wind out of the sales of
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.520]   the US.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:40.520]   7% of the market in New York City's financial district allegedly going offshore because
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.520]   of it.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.760]   Of course, there's some rumor that the new Congress might do something about it.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:46.760]   So we'll see.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.640]   Now, Apple will charge according to rumors for bootcamp.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:56.760]   If you don't buy leopard, according to some folks, Apple will charge $30 if you want to
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.720]   keep using bootcamp without upgrading a leopard.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.280]   It will be free in leopard.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:07.320]   This is according to Mac scoop, which isn't exactly what is that one that you listen that
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.760]   you, you, you subscribe to Merlin?
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.600]   Is this going to be an opportunity for you to make fun of the Mac-a-lope?
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:19.440]   I'm in talks doing an interview with the Mac-a-lope, so don't, don't get any bad blood going there.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.720]   Is the Mac-a-lope pretty tough to get an interview with?
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:26.320]   We had to, we had to find the, the right level of sophistication to be able to mask the,
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.320]   the Mac-a-lope's voice.
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.200]   But yeah, we're going to be doing that for a...
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   No, isn't it true that the Mac-a-lope hangs out with the Keibler elves near the pot of gold?
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:39.520]   So, and, and, and pot of gold is Alex's, oh, portfolio.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.640]   So Mac scoop claims to have inside information that 29.99 for book camp.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.640]   I think that's fair.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.400]   That's a very reasonable price.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.560]   And, and it will be in leopard.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:52.280]   And don't you think, now here's an interesting, don't you think everybody, people do complain
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.400]   about 129 bucks every couple of years or even every year to upgrade OS 10.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.680]   But I think leopard is going to be worth 129 bucks.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.680]   They're all worth it.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.280]   I mean, I have to say, I mean, I've, I've upgraded.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.280]   Tiger was.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.280]   Yeah, tiger.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.280]   I upgrade each time too.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.480]   I mean, it's, and usually when you look back on what the last one was, you, you, you, you,
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:13.440]   know, it was great when it came out and you don't really want to be stuck with the last
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.280]   version of OS 10, especially this one.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.960]   I have to admit that this is, that there's lots of great features and tiger and everything
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.560]   else, but 10 for eight is like the new 10 to nine.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.120]   I mean, it's, there's so many weird little things in it.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.920]   I'm, I'm looking forward to moving on.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.560]   I just buy a new machine every year and that's how I get my OS out one way to do it.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:36.080]   Jim Allchin, who is turning out to be the biggest, uh, friend Apple ever had at Microsoft,
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.480]   you know, he's the guy that Steve Jobs quoted.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:43.120]   He's the, he's, he was in charge of Windows Vista just recently left Microsoft.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.720]   That was his plan as soon as Vista came out, he was going to leave.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.240]   Alchin said, if I didn't work at Microsoft, I'd be using a Mac.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.800]   Now word comes out in 2003.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.120]   Alchin proposed, well, I'll quote the email.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:00.480]   He said, uh, Alchin was very unhappy with all of the third party, uh, MP3 players, uh,
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.360]   based on Microsoft software.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.360]   I have to tell you a quote, I have to tell you my experience with our software and this
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.360]   device, the creative Nomad Zen extra is really terrible.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.800]   This is in 2003.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.400]   Apple is just so far ahead.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.880]   How can we get the ISVs to create something that is competitive with the iPod?
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.120]   I looked at the Dell system.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.120]   That's not close either.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:26.800]   Alchin apparently suggested Microsoft should partner with Apple to make an MP3 player.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.960]   Dun dun dun.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.160]   I think Apple should talk with jobs right now.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.040]   I think it should open up a dialogue for support of the iPod unless something changes
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.040]   the iPod.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.920]   This is again in 2003.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.680]   Will drive people away from Windows media player.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.560]   Alchin was right.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:48.000]   This came out by the way in an ongoing antitrust suit, Combs versus Microsoft.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.560]   So this is it, then, and this is an actual email he sent.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.680]   And you guys have absolutely nothing to say.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.480]   Well, yes, we've said it before over and over.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.480]   Oh, it is.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.160]   You know, well, you know what's funny about that?
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.680]   Well, if you're, if you're looking at controlling for opinions, I had a kind of funny experience
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:08.560]   at Mac world where, you know, when we were, you know, we wanted to spend some time talking
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.040]   to independent developers, but occasionally we would go over to the big booths and want
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.600]   to talk to people at, you know, some of the larger companies, including those that are
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   based in Redmond.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.320]   And it was all we could do to find anybody who would even like point us to somebody who
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.160]   would eventually talk to us who would get, you know, we, we did finally talk to people,
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.520]   but it's, I think it's, I think the part about something like that statement that's amazing
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:34.480]   is you realize that these large companies and places like Microsoft and Apple for that matter,
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:40.960]   they, they control their messages so carefully that, you know, it's, it's, I think when something
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.280]   like that comes out, that's kind of when you go, wow, okay.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   Okay.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.040]   I guess I kind of understand why they want to be careful who they put in front of them.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.560]   Well, option is a president there.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.440]   I mean, he's a very high ranking guy.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.440]   Here's another great statistic.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:57.240]   We just mentioned that Apple sold, let's see, 21.1 million iPods last quarter.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.480]   In a Bloomberg, Microsoft sold hundreds of thousands of zoons.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:06.920]   Oh, that's got to hurt.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.760]   There's a new currency measure.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.420]   An Australian investment bank has developed a new indicator for tracking international
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:21.760]   currency values based on the Apple nano, the two gig nano, the, the economic principle.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.100]   It's underlying.
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:28.260]   This is that $1 should buy the same quality of goods across all countries.
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:35.100]   And it's most expensive in Brazil, a nano in Brazil costs $327.71.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.700]   That's the top of the index.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:42.940]   Canada is the cheapest place at 144 20 in the United States is 149 bucks in Australia.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.180]   It's 172 bucks.
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:45.420]   So I think that's good.
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:46.420]   The nano index.
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:52.940]   I think we should, I think I'd like to get some virtual stock in that.
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.940]   I'm not sure what I can track it.
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.820]   I think I got more nano's in that.
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:01.060]   I was thinking of proposing something kind of slightly similar to that, which would be
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.980]   a measure of cost called the Alex.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:07.780]   And that would be the $700 price point for software that Alex spends.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:12.180]   So we could measure based on how many, how many parts of an Alex, five Alex's or.
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:15.900]   Yeah, like most of the stuff I get is like a, what would be like a, a deck of Alex, it'd
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.340]   be like a 12th, a 12th of an Alex.
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.460]   I like it.
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.460]   That's good.
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.460]   Yes.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.460]   Fine.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.460]   Fine.
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.100]   We're making fun of him.
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.100]   Fine.
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.740]   You got to just beat up on me today.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:32.460]   You're kind of liking the fact that you're here this show, Alex, because I would probably
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.980]   be taking the brunt of all this and you're getting some of it back.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.940]   It's kind of fun.
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:45.100]   France and Germany are challenging Apple once again to dump iTunes DRM.
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.620]   They're asking Apple to allow the protected songs purchased from the iTunes store to be
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:52.820]   played on other music players besides the iPod.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:56.300]   Remember that Norway and try to do this France.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.260]   Of course, I've been trying to do it for a while.
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.940]   Germany's Frabauchkundtottslitzenhaven.
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:06.980]   Frabauchn, Frabauchn Zentrion.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.740]   You know, we're going to get a lot of posts over there.
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.340]   I think I've got enough.
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.540]   Frabauch, Frabauchn Zentrion.
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.940]   I don't know what it means.
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.620]   And then the French UFC ques Choisier.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.020]   There's such a difference between German and French.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.180]   Ques Choisier.
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:25.220]   And Frabauchn Zentrion.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:30.660]   By now, everybody who owns a digital music player is where, of course, are the problems
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:35.300]   trying to get iPod songs on other players and vice versa.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.260]   What do you think?
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.260]   Is there any chance?
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:41.380]   I mean, France had to back down when Apple said, "Okay, we'll just leave."
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.180]   Well, and I think that's still going to come up.
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.740]   I think that I'm sure that France and Germany are a big market, but they're probably still
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.020]   5% of the overall.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:52.540]   Norway has given Apple iTunes until September to change its policies.
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:56.300]   I don't think it's France, Germany, and Norway.
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.180]   It starts to put pressure on, right?
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:01.260]   I guess my whole thing is if it's all of Europe, it's still less than...
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.060]   I don't think it's worth Apple changing its...
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.340]   Because they make so much money.
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:05.340]   They make so much money.
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:09.140]   They make so much money in the US and Canada and the UK, which I don't think the UK is
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.620]   going to go anywhere at the moment.
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.140]   But I mean, if it's the rest of Europe, I mean, I just don't think that it's...
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:17.860]   It's a market big enough to push Apple to change what it's doing in the United States.
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:20.620]   So Apple's just going to say, "Up you for Brotjords and Taulin."
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.380]   Well, I think they'll go back down.
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.380]   We should put them in.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.980]   We'll do freedom fries and sweet crowd in retaliation.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.580]   Sweet crowd.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:31.780]   Okay, let's see.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.020]   I think I've gone through the list.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:38.140]   Anybody have anything else that you wanted to mention?
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.940]   Or should we go right to our picks?
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.180]   Let's go to the picks.
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.180]   Let's go to the picks.
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.460]   And since Alex Lindsey is so anxious...
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.460]   Oh, wow.
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.460]   I got a good one.
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:47.460]   To go.
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.460]   Is it one...
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.460]   How many units of Alex is...
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.460]   Alex, Alex, dollars?
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:51.460]   It's...
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.460]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:53.460]   All right.
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:54.460]   I think it's a million.
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.460]   I think it's a million.
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.460]   You start...
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:57.460]   One millionth of an hour.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:58.940]   You start and we will figure it out.
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:41:59.940]   Go ahead.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.940]   All right.
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:07.140]   So my pick for the week, and I just like to point out that it's less than Alex Merlin.
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.140]   It is a Tinker tool.
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:09.140]   Tinker tool.
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.140]   I love Tinker tool.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:11.140]   I like Tinker tool.
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.140]   I have...
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.740]   It's free or cheap, isn't it?
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:14.740]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.220]   That's why I said I think it's a one million.
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.100]   So it's like the download cost or whatever.
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:24.180]   So anyway, Tinker tool is an all-purpose app that has lots of little things that you
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.180]   can do with your interface.
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.940]   And I have to admit, I only know how to do one thing with Tinker tool.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:28.940]   This was...
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.300]   It was actually pointed out to me.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:34.220]   So one of our listeners, I was complaining about the doc.
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:39.900]   And Travis Tharp sent me an email saying that this is how you fix it.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.820]   And what you can do with Tinker tool is you can actually tell the doc to come out from
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.820]   the top.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:47.820]   And when you...
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.900]   So instead of being from the side or the bottom, you can set it so that the doc is on
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:52.900]   the top.
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:57.460]   And then when you set it to hiding, you literally have to roll your mouse over about three pixels
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:58.700]   or the doc won't come out.
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:01.660]   And you have to roll it over and for a while.
[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:02.660]   This is great.
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.660]   That's great.
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:04.660]   I have.
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:05.660]   I've been complaining about it.
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.660]   It's been...
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:07.660]   So I was complaining.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:10.380]   And it works like a charm.
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.620]   And when you get used to it, it is a little bit hard now to get the doc to come out.
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:14.620]   But I've gotten...
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.260]   I'm slowly getting good at that.
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:21.500]   But I'm so happy, especially when I'm doing production, to not have the doc.
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:26.980]   And it's not jumping out at me while I'm using Photoshop or Final Cut Pro or Shake or whatever.
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.660]   So that's the only reason that I really downloaded this.
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:33.700]   I haven't really played with all the other features, but it is worth every penny that
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:34.700]   you'll pay for it.
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:35.700]   Which is pretty...
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:36.700]   Exactly.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:40.580]   Just to hide the doc up above.
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.460]   And then if you want to change it, you can change it some other time.
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.060]   But especially when I'm doing production.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:49.460]   And there's just so many times, I think it's a huge oversight of apples to not allow us
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.460]   to turn the doc off.
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.020]   This is as close as you're going to get.
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:53.520]   That's excellent.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.100]   It's just really an interface, a tinkerer.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.100]   And...
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.100]   Yep.
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:59.100]   Highly recommended.
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.100]   I've always liked a tinkerer tool.
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.100]   All right.
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.580]   A free one from Alex.
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.580]   Wow.
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.140]   The world is shaking and shivering.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.820]   Scott Bourne, you want to make a software picture?
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.820]   Well, mine ain't going to be free.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:11.820]   Uh-oh.
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.180]   Mine is almost an Alex.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.740]   And it's not software, it's hardware.
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:22.300]   But after Macworld, I wandered down to Anaheim, California for the NAMM show, the North American
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:24.020]   Music Merchant Show.
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.420]   And there's quite a lot of podcasting stuff represented this year.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:30.940]   There's a company called SC Electronics that makes really nice stuff.
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:35.300]   And they make a new microphone that, well, I have to admit, I...
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.460]   You like it better than the aisle?
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:39.540]   I was lusting for this.
[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:41.980]   And here's the really interesting thing.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.500]   It is a USB microphone.
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.100]   Oh, no, really.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.100]   And?
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.100]   Yes.
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:49.100]   And?
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:52.540]   And it's also a traditional XLR balanced microphone.
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:53.540]   Oh, interesting.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.500]   So you have dual inputs.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:57.060]   You can run it as a USB mic.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:00.620]   Or if you're in a traditional studio environment, you've got fan and power available.
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:04.580]   You can run the balanced XLR connector out of it at the same time.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:08.380]   And just to top it all off, they've got the little port to plug your headphone in like
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:13.940]   our lovely road podcasters that we all use, the difference being you can actually mix the
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:19.100]   signal between the DAW that you're recording into and what's coming out of the mic.
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.260]   Nobody else is doing that yet.
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.260]   I understand.
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:25.380]   Okay, so like right now, if you have a road podcaster mic, a lot of the complaints about
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:30.020]   USB mics is that you can't monitor what's going into the mic without some latency problems.
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:34.540]   Oh, yeah, because of the delay converting that bits to analog to bits.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:38.980]   Yeah, so road put a headphone jack on the mic so you can actually listen yourself coming
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:39.980]   out of the mic.
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:40.980]   You're slightly doing it.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:41.980]   You're slightly doing it.
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:42.980]   Yeah.
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:45.660]   Well, what happens now though, is like for when we're using Skype, for instance, if you
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.420]   monitor just the mic, you hear yourself, but you don't hear everybody else.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:50.420]   Right.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:55.300]   So this little device would allow you to mix so you could hear everybody else plus yourself
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.700]   coming without any latency.
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:57.700]   I see.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:02.500]   And it's a big, huge, large diaphragm, side address condenser mic.
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:06.020]   So your voice sounds sort of like Leo's, even if you're a Pipsqueak.
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:10.460]   And it's coming out this week.
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.100]   They were showing it off at the NAMM show.
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:17.540]   I kind of oogled it and I caressed it and I'll be having one soon.
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:18.540]   And tabulous.
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.540]   How much?
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:20.540]   It's about $5.99.
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:23.260]   So it's a lot for a podcaster, but it is.
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:28.180]   But if you're a podcaster that has aspirations of voice over work or you want to try to move
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:32.460]   up to a real professional level, it's obviously going to have a limited appeal.
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:36.420]   But it's less than an Alex.
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.940]   It's 85% of an Alex.
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:44.300]   And the just in case anybody wants to know which mic this is, it's the SE Electronics
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.980]   USB 2200A.
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:47.980]   Mmm.
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:48.980]   Tasty.
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:49.980]   Yum yum.
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.580]   I just have a little app.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:53.580]   It's not really fancy.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:47:00.140]   And it's actually, we were talking about this on net at night on Sunday night.
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:04.020]   And I know you know about it and you mock it.
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:09.140]   In fact, Merlin Man, Twitter, Twitter, not Twitter, I'm not mocking.
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:10.140]   It's affectionate.
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:11.540]   It's from your friends.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:12.540]   I love my friends.
[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:13.540]   It's obvious.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:19.340]   They do ODO and ODO has that little bird and I guess that's where Twitter comes from.
[00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:23.140]   It's kind of a, you know, it's one of those things I'll probably stop doing after a while.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.620]   But there's something kind of compelling about it.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.820]   I wish you were on it because it's like you know what your friends are up to.
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:27.820]   I'm going to try.
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:28.820]   You've talked me into it.
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.140]   Because it's just asking you what you're doing.
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.140]   It's like the kids.
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:32.540]   And what you're doing right now.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:33.540]   What you're doing right now.
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:34.540]   And you don't have to do it all the time.
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:36.900]   Whatever you feel like it, you put in what you're doing right now.
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:40.100]   And you can, you could follow people unless they make it, you make it private.
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.300]   You can make it private so only your friends can see what you're doing.
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.660]   But you could follow people.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.980]   You can add them to your friends.
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:49.140]   So it's kind of this kind of social networking thing.
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.740]   So you have certain friends that you follow.
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:57.380]   To me, it's just a way of spying on Justina Zarek actually because she's on it.
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:00.780]   And I just like to know what Justine's doing all the time.
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.340]   She's out doing parkour.
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.340]   She's instant messaging probably.
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:04.340]   Right now.
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:05.780]   She's the most wired person I've ever heard.
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:10.100]   Remember when we were doing Mac Break Weekly at 21st Amendment, her trio kept going off.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.100]   Well that's what she was.
[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:12.100]   That's what it was.
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.540]   It was Twitter and Groover.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.460]   So anyway, there is now just came out from Icon Factory.
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.660]   A little application called Twitterific that really makes Twitter very easy on the Mac.
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.340]   It's a beautiful little application.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:26.500]   It has a little T in the menu that you can click to open the interface.
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:34.960]   You can type in like I'll type right now explaining Twitter to the dumbbells on Mac
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.960]   Break Weekly.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.140]   And then I hit return.
[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:41.380]   And then that goes to all the people who are watching me or following me.
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:42.380]   They can see what I'm doing.
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:45.060]   And Twitterific is just kind of it's got a transparency.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.060]   It's very pretty.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:47.940]   It's kind of a it looks like a bezel.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.980]   You know, one of those one of those quick time quick, quick silver bezel things.
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:53.140]   It's very pretty.
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:54.420]   So anyway, I just like it's free.
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.220]   It's from Icon Factory.
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:59.700]   And I just want everybody I know to be on Twitter so I can always know what you're doing
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:01.220]   at all times.
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:04.660]   Is it easy to find your name if we want to Twitter you?
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.060]   I believe I am Leo Laporte.
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:11.940]   And so you know that and it's public so you can follow along.
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:15.100]   And I try to entertain the troops while I'm typing things.
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:18.300]   So what if I were to sign up as Merlin Man?
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.220]   That is nothing to keep you from doing that.
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.380]   I'm now over at Playboy.com.
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:26.340]   I wish my taste for that mundane.
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.700]   You should go ahead and do that.
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:29.700]   You should do that, Scott.
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.500]   I would love to follow what I'm doing remotely.
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.700]   Well, I have to say Condoleezza Rice is on Twitter.
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.020]   And she is just a hoot.
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:38.300]   I'm still ruining America.
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.940]   She is just well, let me see what Condie's up to right now because she's not one of my
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:45.180]   friends, but I'm going to add her to my friend list.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.180]   And I'm just, let me.
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.420]   That's not very diplomatic of you.
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:50.060]   Well, she's the secretary of state.
[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:52.180]   I don't want to I don't want to stalk her or anything like that.
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.500]   Let me just let's see.
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:54.980]   How do we get Condie?
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:56.700]   How do I find Condie?
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.380]   Can you see a NDI?
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:49:59.620]   That's how you spell spell it, right?
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:00.900]   Oh, here she is, Condie.
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:04.300]   Let's see what she's been up to lately.
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:08.100]   OK, well, I thought Laura and I were best friends forever.
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:09.580]   And then she quotes a slate article.
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:10.540]   Here's one earlier.
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.580]   Oh, my God.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:13.060]   Accidental decapitation.
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:15.140]   Too funny.
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:16.820]   My Fox guy.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:17.580]   My Fox guy.
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:18.500]   It's all political.
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:19.780]   You have to kind of you follow the news.
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:20.620]   You'll be left.
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.500]   My Fox guys, I love every single one of them.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.900]   LOL, GW likes fruitcake.
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.340]   GW just discovered.
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:32.620]   Ain't nothing but a G- thing because Abramoff forgot
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.060]   a Zoom in the Oval Office.
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:36.060]   Now he won't shut about it.
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:39.980]   So it's kind of like a teenage girl's my space based
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.140]   on Condoleezza Rice.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:42.900]   Oh, my God.
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:43.900]   Kofi texted me.
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:44.900]   What do I do?
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.180]   Here's one stuck in traffic on Pennsylvania Avenue
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.700]   and guess who pulls up next to me?
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:54.500]   Colin and his avalanche.
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:57.060]   Awkward.
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:00.860]   Can I just say that you all have a lot more free time than I do?
[00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:01.900]   Anyway, you can become--
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:02.980]   I'm going to add her.
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.100]   She's going to become my friend.
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:08.140]   And that one, Condi, posts anything I'll have around my Twitter.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:11.260]   And Twitterific makes it very easy.
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.300]   Very easy.
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.100]   We'll tune in to find out what Merlin Mann's doing tomorrow.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.300]   Are you going to be Merlin?
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.580]   I think you could have a lot of fun as a faux Merlin.
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.100]   I'm thinking of being Merlin Mann.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.300]   The Merlin Evie.
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:27.020]   Shopping for electronic chia pets while scouringplayboy.com.
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:27.740]   And by the way--
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:32.540]   Now, by the way, Scott, just for you, when you go to iconfactory.com,
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:35.780]   they also have a beautiful Apple iPhone icon
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:39.460]   that you could put on your disk or whatever.
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:42.380]   And that way, you'll make you feel like you almost
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.260]   have it in your hands.
[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.780]   Well, I've received now something along the lines
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.900]   of 400 different iPhone widget countdown things.
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.860]   So I can always have one more.
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:51.540]   It's not a countdown.
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:52.380]   It's just an icon.
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:52.780]   So it's just--
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:53.860]   OK, well, that's fine too.
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:55.140]   You can make your hard drive look at it.
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:56.020]   It's beautiful.
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.060]   Iconfactory does beautiful icons.
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:03.140]   I made a beautiful iPhone wallpaper for my big screens.
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:05.820]   So this could be your new hard drive icon.
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:07.780]   I promise I can now not see anything
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.660]   because everything looks like an iPhone.
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.940]   You don't know what you got.
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.540]   I converted all my icons to iPhones.
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.860]   So now when I click on things, it's just like random.
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:17.780]   It might be Word.
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:18.740]   It might be keynote.
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:19.580]   Who knows?
[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:22.580]   Well, just in your honor, I've made my hard drive look
[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:23.780]   like an iPhone now.
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:24.220]   Thank you.
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:24.700]   That's cool.
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:26.020]   Just for you.
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:27.300]   I'm going to get that soon.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:30.020]   And finally for our picks, Merlin.
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:31.540]   Man.
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:35.140]   Well, I usually have a little piece of shareware, freeware
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:36.700]   to offer.
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:40.220]   I'm going to give a tip to something that
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.980]   was just a vexing problem for me that has finally been fixed.
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.340]   I posted this on 43 folders today.
[00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:48.980]   But I don't know if you remember for the last six months.
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:51.020]   I've been complaining about this key chain problem
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:52.700]   that I had.
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.180]   It's been unbelievable.
[00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:56.860]   And apparently it happens to a fairly small number of people.
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:59.300]   But when you get this problem, it's really bad.
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.540]   For those who refresh your memory, what's your problem?
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:02.300]   Absolutely.
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.860]   So what happens is if any change ever happens
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:05.980]   in any of your applications, let's
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:07.940]   say you get a fresh copy of Transmit
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:11.180]   or a fresh copy of updated version of Speed Download.
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:13.220]   The very first thing that happens when you launch that
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:16.420]   is it's going to try and reauthorize with the key chain
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:18.900]   to say, hey, is it cool if I have access to all the keychain
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:20.500]   items that you've let me get to before?
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:22.700]   And you say, well, of course, you're Transmit.
[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.260]   That's what I want you to do.
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:27.020]   But when you click to confirm this process,
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:30.260]   you can see this in the process in the--
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:32.140]   what's I call the application or the--
[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:32.620]   what's it called?
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:33.660]   The activity viewer.
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:36.220]   You can see this is one process called Security D
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:38.660]   that suddenly grabs all of the available RAM
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.180]   and basically locks up your computer
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:42.140]   into this horrible death grip.
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.740]   Until you actually force restart.
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:46.660]   You just can't do anything with the computer.
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:48.500]   And so as you can imagine, this becomes--
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:49.660]   That's somewhat of a problem.
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:51.420]   It's problematic for a productivity standpoint.
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:53.820]   Yes.
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:55.700]   And you think you've got problems with your iPhone
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:56.540]   running outside apps.
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:58.700]   I'm just here to tell you, when you can't use your Mac anymore,
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:53:59.660]   it's very frustrating.
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:01.420]   And somebody called--
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:02.780]   I want to get the name right--
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:06.620]   Rossino, R-O-S-Y-N-A, who works at Unsanity,
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.660]   heard my plea, had the same problem.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:11.460]   And instead of me just whining about it on the forums
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:14.820]   over at apple.com, went out and found a fix for this.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:19.260]   And so if you go to either unsanity.org or 43folders.com,
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.700]   you can see this fix, which is really just
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:24.620]   as simple as deleting the code equivalence database
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:27.460]   from your drive.
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:29.700]   And I've got to tell you, this is one of those things, though.
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.260]   It's like-- it's changed my whole world.
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:33.700]   I can use all my applications again,
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:36.700]   and I feel like I'm a fully fledged Mac citizen again.
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:38.580]   So if anybody out there is in that small minority
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:40.220]   that like me is having this horrible hang ups,
[00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:42.140]   I want to get the word out because of how much has changed
[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:42.700]   my life.
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:45.060]   So Haxi's is the place to get it.
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:47.140]   Yeah, if you go to Haxi or is it just this?
[00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:48.460]   No, no, this is a straight up.
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:51.380]   It's a line that you run in the terminal.
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:51.860]   Oh, OK.
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:54.340]   And was that disappointing in terms
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:56.380]   of my usual bringing software?
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:57.940]   It's not an app description.
[00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:58.860]   It's not an app description.
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.620]   I'm going to throw in a quick application as long as I'm--
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:02.580]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:03.340]   --high priority.
[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:05.260]   High priority runs up in your menu.
[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:07.860]   And it gives you an easy way to see all of your ICal
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:09.020]   to do's.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:13.300]   Sort it either by priority or by date due.
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:16.460]   And you can access them and you can click them off.
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:18.220]   You can go and make changes to them
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:20.300]   all without having to be in ICal.
[00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:24.540]   And it is what's $600, $600.
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:27.580]   So it's whatever portion of an Alex that is.
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:29.060]   And it's a really-- it's a nice way to not get
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:31.340]   to wound up in going into ICal and getting caught up
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:32.580]   in all that stuff.
[00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:33.500]   It's about high priority--
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:34.180]   It's about $3.09.
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:36.380]   $2.2 for $1.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:37.740]   Thank you very much, Merlin.
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:38.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:39.980]   I'm just so excited.
[00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:41.860]   I can use transmit again.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:43.940]   I can use OmniWeb, all these apps.
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.340]   No, that would have driven me crazy.
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:45.980]   That's ridiculous.
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:46.580]   It's the worst.
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:48.100]   How long has this been going on?
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:48.980]   Since September.
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:49.500]   Wow.
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:50.700]   I said, "September."
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.060]   Anytime you guys get this, right?
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.940]   You get the little pop up and it goes confirm application
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:54.140]   change.
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:55.060]   I just click it instead.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.220]   Yeah, in the past, you just jov--
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:58.460]   imagine clicking that, having that become the spinning
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:59.180]   beach ball.
[00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:00.980]   And you can literally do nothing with your computer
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:02.580]   until you do a hard restart.
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:04.580]   Is it a permissions issue?
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:04.940]   What is it?
[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:07.180]   It appears to be that something got corrupted
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.780]   in this little database.
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:11.380]   And so that process gets confused
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:13.740]   and keeps spinning off into outer space
[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:15.500]   because it's got some kind of corrupt piece of data
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:16.420]   that it's chewing on.
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:17.700]   And when you delete this database,
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:21.100]   it just rebuilds after you reboot and the problem goes away.
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:22.260]   Excellent.
[00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:24.140]   Excellent, excellent.
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:25.540]   That is fantastic.
[00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:29.980]   That is one of the best free files I have ever heard.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:30.300]   Thank you.
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:31.940]   Time for some more Therafluet than you.
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:33.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:36.940]   It's starting to kick in right around now.
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:38.740]   I think we're done.
[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:39.820]   Are we done?
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:40.420]   We're done.
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:41.940]   All right, that's another Mac break.
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:43.380]   We'll see you next week.
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:46.020]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:50.980]   I won't be here.
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:52.620]   I'll be doing Regis and Kelly in a second.
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.900]   She runs.
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.180]   Say hi to Kelly for me.
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.580]   And after she has any fantasies that involve rich,
[00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:01.540]   old, baldy, fat guys.
[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:02.260]   It's just a case.
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:03.460]   It can happen.
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:04.860]   You should do that, Leo.
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:05.780]   You should really--
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:07.340]   You should really literally do that.
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:08.100]   It's a live show.
