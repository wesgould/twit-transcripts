[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   We couldn't do to it without it.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers all things Macintosh.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Today we are going to talk about many, many things.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   But most of them will have to do with Apple.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Some of them not.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Joining us in studio today, Mr. Alex Lindsay of the Pixelcore.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Hello.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Good to have you back.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It's good to be back.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Alex is having a baby unfortunately.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   You look good for somebody eight months pregnant.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Well, you know, diet.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Mostly diet.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   But his wife is having a baby.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   But I was hoping to get Alex to kind of fill in while I'm in China,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   but I don't know if that's going to work because the baby is due right when
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   you're in the middle.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Yeah, it's right in the middle.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   We'll figure out a way.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   We're going to get you on the air.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Also here kind of a surprise visitor out of, out of nowhere, but we're thrilled to have
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   her.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Jerry Ellsworth.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   She is the circuit girl of the Fat Man and Circuit Girl podcast.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Nice to have you.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Good to see you, Jerry.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   She brought, she actually also works with New Tech who does our video equipment,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   the incredible Tri-Caster.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   She designed the chips, the chips.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   She designed the chips.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Which is pretty important.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Not the software, the hardware.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And she has with her.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I could do that.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Shut up.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Shut up.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Also here, Mr. I could do that if he's not busy waxing his yacht.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Mr. Scott Bollorn, ladies and gentlemen, from...
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Man, I'm so intimidated to be next to somebody who's like 42.39 trillion times smarter than
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   me, but I'll do my best to hold my own today.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I see you say that about Andy and Aco.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Well, that too.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   He is to your left.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Andy is the guy from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   It covers tech.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   His hair looks fabulous today, am I?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I had a meeting this morning.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   This is one of those rare Tuesday mornings when my hair is actually washed and combed.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   But I can tell you where a hat.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Sherlock Holmes would know that you were a hat.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Maybe the first time I've seen Andy.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   It's mostly just because your forehead is a little bit about three shades lighter than
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   the rest of your face.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Oh, well, yeah.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Did you know that?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   You got a tan below the hat line.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Oh, well, see, that's part of my...
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Again, maybe I've not been the most attractive guy in the room, like to cause my nerdy
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   but the thing is, by wearing the hat all the time, my face is actually in constant shade
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   almost.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   So, now I'm not a...
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   All these people who've been...
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Not a line.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Not a wrinkle.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Well, okay.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Andy, not a line, not a wrinkle and not...
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Not a...
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Not at this resolution, anyway.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   So...
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   What did you know about...
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Say again?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Oh, that was...
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   No, I thought you were wrong.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   That was just gonna say, the only thing I know about ICs is how to release the magic smoke
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   that makes them work.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   So, I'm definitely a little man of the phone.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Sometimes I just...
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Sometimes I just do that for fun when they're really ticking me off.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   When you make your own, you can smoke them easily, right?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   That's right.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   There's always more where that came from.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   You actually were at the Maker Fair this weekend in down the peninsula in San Mateo.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Correct.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And showing off how to make chips in your own house.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Exactly.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Your home fab.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.080]   I brought in a diffusion furnace and some household chemicals and we were making solar
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.000]   cells and MOSFETs and...
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I had no idea you could do that.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I didn't either and a lot of people were against me when I was saying that I was gonna try to
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   do this and it took me three years to pull it off.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And they work like you can plug them in something and then they see and they work?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Well, they're very primitive.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   The most complicated thing I've made is an inverter.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   But it has pins.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   So you could put in a socket.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Oh, we can hook it up to lab supplies.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Oh, that's very cool.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I brought some to show you.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Oh good.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Well, it's an audio show, unfortunately.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   But for those of you watching at Home On Video, I should tell people that if you want to watch
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   at Home On Video, we do do this show roughly, and I mean roughly at 11 o'clock.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   We start sometime between 11 and noon.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Two p.m. to three p.m. eastern time, roughly 1,800 U.T.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   But at 11 you'll see a whole different side of us until it's actually...
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Yeah, that's very informal for the first half hour.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   It's kind of fun.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Then we finally get started.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   It's usually when we're experimenting with whatever new piece of hardware or gear that Leo has
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   decided to insert into the stream one today.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I don't really like to call this a studio.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   It's more of a lab.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   More of a lab.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   More of a work in progress, actually.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   It is beta, technically.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   We're still beta.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   The Twit Stunkworks.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I got from Elgato this video capture unit.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   They just came out with this.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   It's about $89.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.500]   I'm going to try it as a way to record our video so that we can put it on YouTube because
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.000]   YouTube wants MPEG-4 video.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   It turns out I talked to Google and they said what we want is you MPEG-4, H.264 and an
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   MPEG-4 wrapper.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Got it.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   So this will make that.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Excellent.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   We'll see if we can.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I'd love to get our video up on YouTube.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.360]   Then I could say or you could watch us on YouTube or you could even if we'd once we've
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.720]   done that, we can make it a podcast.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.560]   You could download a lot of people.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.560]   I'm daring.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.160]   That doesn't work with some of the new stuff that they came out with doesn't appear to
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:24.280]   work with the new version.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.200]   Can I say it all of a sudden?
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.600]   I just had a fine.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.320]   You mean is it software or hardware?
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.320]   I movie.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.320]   Oh, I movie probably.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.760]   It doesn't be doing any I movie.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.760]   I just wanted to point that out.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.760]   That's called posting.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.760]   I don't post.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.400]   You get what we record and that's and you'll like it.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.280]   No, I can use QuickTime to trim it though and I'll probably do that.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.880]   Get it at least the beginning and the end.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.440]   It's not going to be a fancy polished edited piece.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.440]   It's going to be.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.440]   It's not?
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.440]   No.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.440]   I'm so sorry.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.840]   I'm Mr. Live to tape, don't you know?
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.320]   Is there any Apple news whatsoever?
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.800]   You know, next week's going to be huge.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.560]   There's plenty of Apple news.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.680]   I'll tell us Scott born.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.680]   What is the other?
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.080]   There was a bunch of updates yesterday.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.080]   You mean the download?
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.080]   Oh, I didn't even see those.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.520]   You see there's this little thing.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.520]   It's an Apple.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.240]   It's in the top left corner of your screen.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:17.680]   On that software update and you should see GarageBand QuickTime and iTunes if you have
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.520]   those three programs installed.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.000]   Because last week they had an I work 0902 update.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.240]   So I guess they're slowly updating the apps now.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.240]   Well, there's a.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.640]   No, there's a very severe and we probably could talk about this.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:37.760]   There's a very severe hole in the Java that Apple ships with the Mac.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.120]   Remember that the couple of weeks ago, the 10th?
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.120]   They did not.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.440]   The 1057 update, this 450 meg update that they did.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.440]   Well, we were.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.040]   No, I'm not the expert on this, but Steve Gibson was talking about the exploit and he
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.200]   said the guy who discovered the exploit decided to release information because Apple didn't
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.200]   put it in 10.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   He gave him time.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.120]   He said they've known about this for months.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.840]   It's a severe exploit.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.800]   What that means is alarm bells now should be going off in your head because the bad guys
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.800]   now know how to do it.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.560]   The exploit is published.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.080]   This would be a complete on your Mac exploit.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.360]   You go to a webpage with Malformed Java on it.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.040]   I don't know whether it'll ask you whether you should trust it or not.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.600]   I presume it will, but I don't know that.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.200]   I'll have to look into that.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.560]   It will then take over your machine.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.360]   This is something to be very aware of and the bad guys have it.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.360]   And Apple, unless they patched it secretly with this latest patch.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.120]   I thought they patched it with the 1057 did not.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.880]   No, I thought they patched it with the, I thought they patched it in Safari.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.080]   Well, they have to, what they have to do is to give you a new JVM.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.080]   Right.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.000]   So I'm going to do some research on that.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.800]   I don't know.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.400]   But you put an actually an interesting article here from Mac World in the mix.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.520]   Despite a bongled Java fix, the Mac is still safer than Windows.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.520]   This is rich.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:57.800]   And by the way, Jerry, who is a Windows user, if you want to jump in at any point, are
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.800]   you all hardware?
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.800]   Do you cover software at all?
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   I'm mainly hardware.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   Okay.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.520]   So you're not going to say, Oh, well, let me tell you guys in the max or losers.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.200]   Well, I could if you want.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.760]   Unless you brought your boots.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.280]   While we might continuously debate glossy versus Matt screens, the visual aesthetics of a translucent
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:20.680]   doc or the value of mobile me, few issues in the Apple community generate as emotional
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.840]   and response.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.400]   It's badly edited as Mac security.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.360]   One extreme considers the Mac an unassailable platform immune to the problems plaguing
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.840]   Windows users, show of hands here.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.320]   Any extremes?
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.720]   I think probably, do you feel that way?
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.600]   Scott born, we're immune.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.560]   I think it's pretty close to immune.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.240]   I don't think it's going to stay that way.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:48.360]   The other tells us that a Mac security Armageddon is just around the corner.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.000]   I don't think any of us think that.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.760]   The vast majority of Mac users merely want to know what risks they really face and how
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.920]   to keep their system safe.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.400]   I think that's probably true.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.160]   I mean, there's, I won't call an Armageddon, but there's going to be, it's almost inevitable
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:07.720]   that at some point there's going to be a really major exposure of data that gets so much
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.560]   press attention that suddenly Apple loses the ability to make that both.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.560]   I mean, it does.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.560]   It does.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.480]   I don't care if some guy in some house two towns over gets broken into.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.720]   I care if the house next door to mine gets broken into.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.040]   Next week, I wrote a Winkler published an article in Computer World in which he said,
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.840]   "Apple is grossly negligent when it comes to security and should be investigated by the
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:33.160]   Federal Trade Commission for false advertising."
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.320]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.800]   This comes from this Apple's failure to patch the Java fix.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:49.320]   We got heaps of faux outrage available to us 24/7 now, thanks to the internet.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.320]   I just feel like, I think that we have, there are definitely exploits.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.200]   We just don't see any of them in the wild.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.160]   I mean, that's the thing that these are in the wild.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.160]   I tell you right now.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.320]   Are people actually being affected by them?
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.200]   No, people are saying that what I'm saying by, there's a lot of lab examples of-
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.200]   I agree.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.200]   This is an exploit.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.200]   This is an exploit.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   But until we see people actually getting it in the public, I think people are just kind
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.240]   of, Mac users tend to be a little blasé about it because you hear this over and over
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:23.240]   and you hear security experts say that this is a real issue.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.640]   What you end up with is still we hear nothing about anyone actually getting the virus.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.360]   That's the point I was trying to make.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:39.600]   I'm not seeing blue screens of death or having malware take over my computer or all the stuff
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   that I've seen Windows users deal with.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.640]   I believe it'll happen.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.640]   I agree with Andy.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.920]   I think someday it will happen.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.520]   But it's just not happening now.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:55.360]   To take a lab test and say, "Oh, well, look, this can happen versus the fact that it happens
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.880]   like two cajillion times a day already in the Windows environment."
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.840]   I just don't think it's much to do about nothing.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.160]   Yeah, right now I think it should be addressed.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.960]   It's mostly just going to be a way for semantic to make money.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.000]   Well, I do agree.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.600]   We probably haven't seen any sort of a widespread attack like we see on the Windows side.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.520]   But in terms of identifying one specific target whose machine that you'd like to compromise,
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.640]   I think that's a very, very doable, that's a very, very realistic goal.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.200]   So I don't think that we should really dismiss the idea that I would not agree with the statement
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.840]   that at no point are people's Macs being surpitiously compromised and is their work being observed?
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.040]   Is there a user on that machine that they aren't aware of?
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.640]   Because one of the Unix is one of the greatest pluses and one of the greatest minuses of
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.640]   the Mac operating system.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.160]   It's a great plus because so many of the most wonderful and powerful features that the Mac
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.160]   gets, it gets essentially for free by virtue of the fact that it has this great OS underneath
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.160]   it.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.160]   The problem is that it means that there is a lot more knowledge about the underpinnings
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.440]   of the Mac OS that the average user does not have.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.960]   If you were to go into the terminal mode, you can do things with an unrestricted computer
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.800]   that the average user would never know that there's this other piece of code running in
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   there.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.040]   They would never know that there is another user.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.680]   They would never know that there's a key logger going on.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.800]   They might not even know that there's also a script that could alert a third party every
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.760]   time that you've got screen sharing turned on so that person could then simply log in,
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.600]   check to see what you're doing and copy down anything that seems to be interesting.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:30.760]   Well at this point, the key is, and I agree with you Andy, mainly because Windows is so
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.760]   predominant.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.440]   If you're a hacker and you want to make money, you go after Windows just because there's more
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.440]   machines out there.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.120]   Why waste time with the Mac?
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.120]   Nevertheless, it's out there.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:44.240]   Well, and I think that as a computer user, I think that part of the reason, I know that
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.680]   one of the reasons that I probably don't worry as much about it is because I also don't
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.200]   click on things I don't know what they are.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.440]   No, I don't randomly click on it.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.720]   All you'd have to do is go to a site that had this Java on it.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.760]   I'm now looking now and you don't need to click anything.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.440]   You wouldn't see a Java running.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.440]   Just go to the site.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.440]   Just go to the site.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   The applet would launch.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.440]   You can also be sent the applet in email.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.720]   So email attachments are vulnerable.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.320]   You can have HTML mail with embedded at Java.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.280]   So it's pretty egregious.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.280]   It's pretty egregious.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.760]   It's the kind of, well, you know, this kind of thing that's happened on Windows for years.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:20.840]   Windows users know, you know, to be very careful and the fix on this at this point, here's
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.120]   point one.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.520]   Apple should have fixed this.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.080]   It's ridiculous that it's not been fixed.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.960]   This is a problem that was in a lot of Java's that has been fixed in a lot of Java.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.200]   I don't know if it was in all Java's, but it has been fixed in everybody else's.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.480]   Apple should have fixed this.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:40.480]   At this point, your only recourse until Apple does is turn off Java in all your browsers.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.920]   You still have this threat, though, of getting, you know, because WebKit is kind of integrated
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.920]   into the system.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.880]   I don't know what would happen if, yeah, I guess you have to, I don't know if it came
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.880]   in an email.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.920]   I don't know what you'd do.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.920]   Right.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.480]   So we're a little vulnerable on this, I think.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.720]   Does sound like Apple needs to do something like that.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.200]   Apple kind of screwed up.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.480]   We should be able to say that.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.760]   I think that, you know, this is a, well, if we know for a fact that they're aware of it
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.560]   and they haven't patched it if we know that.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.720]   Here's how we know they're aware of it.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.680]   The security researcher who discovered it has told them again and again.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.680]   And in fact, this is kind of the, this is usually what happens in the security community.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:21.640]   Most of them will hold back and tell the vendor because they know that if they publish, they're
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.480]   telling the bad guys.
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.680]   So they'll tell the vendor and they'll, and they'll say to the vendor, and I've talked
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:30.120]   to people, you know, Matt Conover, who was, you know, famously upset years ago about
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.600]   Microsoft, Microsoft knew about all these exploits would go eight months before patching.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.720]   And what happens as after a certain point in time, the security vendors probably rightly
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.000]   so say, you know, the bad guys are going to find out if we keep sitting on this, we're
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   going to publish.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Right.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Because that puts pressure on the apples.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Got to fix it.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.440]   And if that was not to get that, what I was trying to get in, I mean, at Leo is, do we
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.080]   know that we know that we know that they haven't fixed it?
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.880]   Yeah, we know they haven't fixed it.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.880]   Okay.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.880]   There's an issue.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.880]   And this is the point is this.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:58.880]   So this is what the security guy did.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.880]   He published it and he said, look, press this button.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.840]   Oh my finger.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.360]   And if you get this result, you're vulnerable.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.240]   So that, and that's the way to publish these is, is, is, and, but unfortunately, that has
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.160]   a consequence, which is the bad guys learn about it.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.160]   Right.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.240]   So maybe, and maybe the only way for Apple to learn is to have people suddenly get what
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.040]   to have, you know, have their computers taken over.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.040]   I agree.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.240]   If that's the case, then Apple should fix it and, and we should let them know that that's
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.160]   how we feel about it.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:35.500]   So what you need to do with in Safari is go to preferences, security tab, uncheck Java.
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.240]   Make sure also, this is something everybody should do in general.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.680]   There is a setting that's very convenient on Safari, but it's a bit of a problem before
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.040]   that open, safe files after downloading checkbox.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.600]   It's really convenient when you download a DMG file, it automatically mounts it and opens
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.600]   it up.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.600]   It's also really dangerous.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.440]   You should uncheck that and leave that unchecked.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.600]   It's in the general preferences.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:03.920]   Uncheck, enable Java and the security preferences and Java and JavaScript or just Java.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.800]   Well, don't get me started on JavaScript.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.240]   If you talk to Steve Gibson, he'd say there's no safe JavaScript either, but so far just
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.240]   Java.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.120]   Firefox, it's in preferences content.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.200]   Omni web preferences show all click security.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.080]   Camino preferences web features.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.920]   You know what they don't say here is WebKit.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.280]   And I guess it would be the same as Safari.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.920]   Opera, preferences, advanced tab, click content.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:36.000]   You know, this is an easy thing to do, but have I done it?
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   No.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.280]   I just did right there while you were telling me to.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.280]   I'm not about this.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.200]   It's Tuesday and you know, this is, see, this is the problem.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.080]   We are a little complacent as Mac users.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.080]   Let's face it.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.480]   I mean, it's hard not to be complacent when you're not affected.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.760]   I mean, I know that I was terrified of this.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:56.240]   I got one of the early viruses on OS 7 or 6 or whatever.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.760]   It was a Tetris game that was floating around.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.240]   This would be 1991 or 90 or whatever.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.760]   And it was a Tetris game that was well known that this, I didn't know until I read about
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:12.280]   it, you know, on the prodigy discussion boards after I got it, but it destroyed the, I mean,
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.280]   it destroyed the computer.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.720]   I mean, it just, it really, you know, it was, I mean, not destroyed it, but I just, I had
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.120]   to really, I lost everything, you know, that was on the computer.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.120]   I remember the stage.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.480]   It was a, it was a bad, it was a very, very bad one.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.800]   OS 7, I think was the first, the first widespread virus that I was aware of was on System 7.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.800]   Right.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.440]   And I think it was, I think this was System 6.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.120]   And it was a, and, but it was bad enough that I wouldn't touch anything that I didn't know
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.240]   where that came from for years.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.800]   So, you know, I, I think then it just slowly wore off.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.960]   We've lost our, our will to live.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.480]   We've lost our street smart.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.480]   We're like, we're like those.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:54.240]   We're like, we're like in the, what is it, the Time Machine, you know, movie where, where
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.120]   the people have just been safe for a long time.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.120]   We're like, okay.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.920]   But in the iPod commercials, we all were, it looks so happy and dancing.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.920]   What's the problem?
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.920]   There's too much dancing.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.920]   Oh man.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.080]   I had a woman on the radio show who had an HP laptop she just bought and reminded me a
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.520]   little bit of that ad, you know, Microsoft ad.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.680]   And she had nightmares upon nightmares and blue screens and all sorts of stuff.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.960]   It was all I could do.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.320]   I think I might have been a little snarky.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.520]   It was almost, I mean, just to say, oh, you watched that Microsoft ad, did you?
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.600]   You bought the HP laptop, did you?
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.600]   Right.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.960]   I have to say that Microsoft ad seems so pathetic.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.840]   I mean, maybe it's just because I'm, the new ones that they come out where they're going
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.000]   to pick, because the thing is, is they pick the, the ones you pick, they, they, they compare
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.600]   like this, this lawsuit and I guess is the newest one and she's comparing it to a Mac
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.280]   Pro, even though all she needs is a MacBook and, you know, and, and, you know, you're
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.600]   just kind of like, Apple's computers are $5,000.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.600]   Right.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.600]   Why would I buy one of those?
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.240]   I want to buy the most expensive one.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.120]   We're going to have this cheap piece of crap.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.360]   What do you think about this and how long is it going to last?
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.040]   According to Fortune and Palm, Palm said they would do this at CES and now apparently it's
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.040]   true.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.800]   The pre syncs with iTunes.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.080]   How long before Apple disables that?
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.440]   Um, next week.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.440]   Wait nine seconds.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.800]   Maybe, maybe, maybe it might even be in the update that just went out last night.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.800]   Do you see?
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.440]   By the way, don't download that update.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.840]   If you've had a, if you have a job, broken iPhone, a two is very boat.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.280]   According to the iPhone crew.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.280]   Do not.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.280]   And you know what else?
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.280]   When I did it, it did sound kind of thing where it said converting music.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.280]   Updating library.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.280]   Updating iTunes.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.280]   You thief you.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.280]   I don't, I don't have any thieves.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.280]   No, no, we're all thieves.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.280]   You have to understand from the record point of view, we're, if you, if you actually buy
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.640]   music, you're a thief.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.480]   It's a very Orwellian concept.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.240]   So what was that updating iTunes library?
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.720]   I don't know.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.720]   Best about.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.760]   Well, the main reason they do these updates is to change things like this, change copy
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.400]   protection or to mess with somebody.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.880]   And often that means you have to update the library, set a bit, whatever.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.320]   So I think that's all it is.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.200]   They're just updating you.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.200]   So you'll be safe.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.600]   Well, you know, and I'm waiting, I'm waiting to see, you know, we're, I'm looking at three
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.560]   or three, and looking at what we're going to do, because if, if I can't get a good screen
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:20.000]   capture, you know, utility, a video screen capture utility for my iPhone, I'm going to
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   break it.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Jailbreak it.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.240]   They're saying on, but what's wrong?
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.080]   No, I don't want, I don't want it stills.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.520]   I want the video, I want the video output and on a jailbroken iPhone, it works.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:35.320]   And on a, you know, an, an Apple, the worst part is Apple has software because when you
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.880]   see them do those presentations, we're watching the iPhone, you know, like they're, they're
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.520]   actually watching the iPhone up there, but they won't, they won't pop, they know how
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.520]   to do it.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.520]   They won't publish it.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.520]   And it works on a jailbroken iPhone.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.680]   And so we're just, I'm just waiting to see if we can do that.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.280]   We're going to do some tests over them this month.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.840]   And then if not by, because we're, you know, we're working on this, the show and it's just
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.320]   a frustration of trying to deal with the screen.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.720]   Jerry, could you design, would it be possible to design hardware that would protect you
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:06.320]   from, I mean, could you make a hardware safe system that would protect you from the bugs
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.880]   and the issues and the errors and the flaws and the.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.120]   I don't think so.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.480]   All these hackers are going to look at every corner.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.480]   They're smart.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.680]   They're really sharp.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.760]   Leo Apple is saying that the iTunes update was to make, make it compatible with 3.0.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.760]   iPhone 3.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.760]   Good.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.480]   You know what that means?
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.760]   That maybe on Monday, they'll actually have hardware.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.280]   Oh, we're going to get an announcement of hardware this week.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.240]   But I know in an, well, we all know there's an announcement Monday.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.480]   The question my daughter's asking just came back from France.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.720]   She says, Daddy, I want an iPhone.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.920]   I said, you can't buy one now.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.920]   Can you hold off?
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.160]   She's got the report blood in her.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.160]   All right.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.960]   She's like, I want to buy one because it's about once about to be released.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.960]   There's something we get itchy right before something new.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.640]   My knee does a thing and I have to go and buy something.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.200]   Now of course, she, if, if, if, now this is the, here's the, here's the, here's how
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.680]   I'm parsing this.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.080]   If Apple releases a new iPhone in the next 30 days, she could buy one because you get
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.080]   a 30 day return.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.080]   Right.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.720]   So she could bring it back.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.720]   But if they release it in 32 days, we're screwed.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   I'd wait.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.720]   It's probably not going to come out the line.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   I'd wait till Monday.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.280]   You think July lies when you're going to be able to buy the phone.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:26.880]   But see here now I'm reading tealies, but why do they push a 3.0 change to iTunes now?
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.800]   They usually don't push it that far in advance.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:35.760]   My guess is it has something to do with helping the developers who are going to get my act.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.200]   My guess is you're going to be able to get the snow leopard stuff happening after WWDC
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.480]   and they want to give them a chance to write for it.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.480]   I don't know.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.480]   Just a case.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.360]   Well, I think, you know, remember that the, the 3.0 is going to affect the current iPhones
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:53.480]   and I, and, and touches as well as so they might, will you think you have 3.0 before they
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.480]   have the phone?
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.160]   I think they're going to do that anyway.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:10.800]   I mean, they're, you know, they're requiring developers right now are required to be 3.0
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.360]   compliant, you know, with new apps that are going to the app store.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.560]   So, you know, you can't have them wait forever.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.040]   I guess for developers.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.040]   No, I don't buy it because you don't, you can tell developers or you can even ship them
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.280]   8 to I don't buy it.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.280]   They've never done this before.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:30.400]   The new version of iTunes that's designed for the new hardware comes out like the day
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.400]   of.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.640]   It does usually.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   That's true.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.600]   I think we should make sure it doesn't happen today.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.600]   Check the wires.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.600]   That would be typical.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.600]   Let's wait a minute.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.600]   Okay.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.600]   This is okay.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.600]   Shh.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.600]   Another Mac break is broke.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.600]   Okay.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.600]   Let's see if they bought it.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.600]   We'll wait.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.600]   We'll come back.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.600]   We'll check in the next half hour.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.600]   Don't tell.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.600]   Great episode.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.040]   Oh, now we could talk to Jerry about her purse.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.040]   Okay.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.160]   We want no, we're not going to talk about Apple anymore.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.520]   We're going to release this is going out on the internet right now.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.520]   Go ahead.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.760]   Refresh the Apple store here and see what happens.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.840]   They're sons of guns.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.800]   I know they're sitting there waiting.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.800]   All right.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:19.640]   So no, I'm going to, I'm going to go out and a limb here based on the thinnest of evidence.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.920]   I think maybe they might announce on Monday a new phone and ship Monday.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.920]   Why would they wait till July?
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.160]   Let's take a show of hands.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.760]   When are they going to ship?
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.760]   Monday.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.520]   What do you think I only want?
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:37.920]   I'd say I'd say Monday to Andy later than Monday.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.920]   Way to commit Andy.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.920]   Way to be Tuesday.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.360]   No, I'm saying that I'm not.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.560]   We know that it's imminent.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:51.040]   We've seen a really, really good demo video, like illicit demo video of iPhone 3.0 hardware,
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.880]   the sort of thing that's it's either the someone has the action.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.480]   The actual thing or they've put way too much effort into dumbing this up.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.720]   Did you see the stills too?
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.040]   The stills from the new camera look really good.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.040]   The auto focus.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.040]   I'm not.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.520]   I mean, the video, the video demonstrates close focusing on a focus camera demonstrates the
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.960]   compass demonstrates all the sort of stuff.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.160]   So we know that there's some things in the field.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:15.280]   I'm just trying to figure out why they would do it on Monday when they, Apple seems to
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.120]   be softening the world up for Steve Jobs and a second event coming on in July.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.560]   Oh, what tell me about that?
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.800]   I haven't, I know that.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   What's going on?
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.760]   I was about to correct myself in saying that given that there's there, they're being a
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.560]   little bit more specific as to when as Steve will have his public return to the company,
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.720]   they have not announced anything.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.320]   I want to make sure that I made that clear.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.960]   I think I probably over spoke just a moment ago, but they, they don't think it'll be
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   a WWDC.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.520]   You think it'll be end of June?
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:47.440]   I don't, I would be very, very surprised if it shipped at WWDC.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.520]   I would be my money would be on a separate event just for the iPhone.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:57.480]   My money would be against even a demonstration of the iPhone, but I would not be really surprised
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.840]   if it were demonstrated next week.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.600]   Again, I'm really, I really can't say anything more than this is an intuition.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.440]   It just feels as though they're going to have a separate event to roll out the iPhone.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:12.520]   Also, I don't know if this would have any impact whatsoever, but I was watching Microsoft
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:20.240]   Microsoft's Xbox keynote at E3 yesterday and man, when I, when I tell you that the opener
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.640]   for this keynote was they brought out all the surviving Beatles and the families of all
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.360]   the non surviving Beatles.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.400]   And that wasn't the highlight of the keynote.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.800]   That's one, that was one hell of a dog and pony show that Microsoft put on.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.880]   And not that they would change their schedule just to make sure that they don't take, they
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:41.840]   don't show off the new iPhone a week after E3, but it just, I'm just getting an intuition
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.560]   that they want to, but they want to put some air between the iPhone announcement, the certainly
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.680]   the Palm pre shipping and everything else they can possibly do.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.240]   Yeah, I'm going to get in the, get in line on Friday or maybe early Saturday.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.000]   I'm getting a pre I'm getting a pre I'm getting a pre I think it pretty.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.120]   Where are these lines for the pre going to be for?
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.680]   Yeah, we're, we're forming that's where I'll be like, it's going to be four people deep
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.000]   wherever there's a line after like 15 minutes people feel good.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.400]   We go or people deep in two of them thought there was rush tickets.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.880]   No, I get Lee.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.400]   Now I'm not going to, I know you probably can't say anything.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   I'm the Enoco.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.480]   So, but you've got, I noticed circumstances, I can't say anything.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.160]   I was listening to the show with a test.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.320]   Is that a foster?
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.960]   Is you drinking in that cup there?
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:31.960]   Oh, this is my US space and rocket center, Huntsville, Alabama, a Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.960]   Coca-Cola.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.960]   Oh, it's a Coca-Cola.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.960]   I don't, I don't drink coffee.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.760]   So I have to use these as cozy anyway.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.760]   Are you a Mormon?
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.560]   Cause you don't drink, you don't drink coffee.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.240]   Oh, I think you told my colorful attire.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.240]   I'm homage.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.240]   He's homage.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.880]   That's it.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:51.600]   If you had a pre, but already that Palm sent you, you would probably not be able to say
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.600]   anything.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.600]   Am I correct?
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.240]   That would be correct.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.240]   I don't know where to go.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.240]   What does he do?
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.080]   He's trying to craft his next question.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   If you're left, if you had a pre, I would think it would make the left side of your face
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.080]   itchy.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.080]   Okay.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:14.520]   For those at home, he's not scratching.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.520]   He's not even moving.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.340]   I'll go live is the cameras frozen and he's gone into a deep meditative state
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:29.940]   We've learned absolutely nothing you think you would not I'll give you the stone face you think you'll get one before Saturday
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:35.400]   All right I
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.940]   Need somebody to come on the radio show on Saturday and talk about the presets
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.080]   I won't have one by then perhaps you could do that
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.200]   Huh, hi, well, yeah, we just started the show. Yeah, it's good to see you
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.220]   I drink everything he woke up from his catatonic state and apparently has amnesia
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.320]   I
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:57.640]   Was in my happy place the same place. Do they film that Toyota Prius commercial? He's in his happy
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:02.240]   All right, I'm gonna. I'm gonna drop it
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.800]   It's interesting though
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.040]   They make such a big deal about sinking with iTunes since hey
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.960]   It's pretty obvious Apple's not gonna want them to do that and be Apple has absolute control over whether to be able
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:17.620]   To do that. Well, the gutsy the gutsy thing is gonna be will this ever appear in any ad for the pre?
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:25.400]   Because if that appears in an ad that means that not only do they have this but they are really really really willing to fight to keep it
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.840]   Because you know, it's okay for rumors to get out
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.940]   It's okay for people who happen to have them to notice that if they plug it into
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:36.480]   Machine-running iTunes it happens to sing properly. It's okay for people to say that it's nothing entirely when the company says
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:41.160]   Please buy this mission if you're worried if potential consumer if you're worried about it singing to the iTunes
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.920]   We are we're promising you it will work just fine. That's an entirely different thing
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:50.460]   So I'm curious to see what that if that appears in the data sheet or not during a recent conference call according to Apple's
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.920]   Apple insider I should say
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.160]   Acting Apple chief executive Tim Cook
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:31:01.120]   vowed to vigorously defend against any competitor who trends treads on his company's
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.200]   Sounds like King John Eel about his
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:09.480]   Dance on North Korean, you know, yes weapons. We will defend the motherland
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:13.800]   Let them feel our rap that our fury should take out our resolve
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.760]   Arise ye peoples
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.600]   I'm still buying a Priyad. I don't care if I could sing it with iTunes
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.000]   I know it's fine with I think for me though
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.480]   It used to be that I had all these these this music that was attached to my iPhone and my iTunes
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.040]   But now my problem is is I've got a lot of apps that are attached to this
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:35.640]   I've spent a lot of money on on on apps and so my whole thing is is that I become more and more resistant the longer
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:40.600]   I have my my iPhone the more and more resistant I am to looking at anything else because I've got too many apps
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.360]   I've got too many, you know songs the songs aren't a big of a deal anymore because they're not
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.920]   You know, they're not DRM, but my apps are
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:53.640]   The weird thing if Apple were to release go to app go absolutely insane and release an iPhone that doesn't play music
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.320]   That would kind of be okay by me
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:00.360]   I would simply buy a cheap $60 whatever it is to play the music because it is a
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:05.320]   It is an internet device for me. It's a software platform for me. It's much less of a media player
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:12.920]   Yeah, I don't I don't uh what's funny is I don't use the iPhone very often to talk to people on the phone or to listen to music
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:17.480]   I mean, you know, most of my iPhone experience is using the apps if they had a plant's
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.360]   Zombie it'd be plants or zombies 80%
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.360]   I don't I don't want to talk about that
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.440]   It's my fault. My wife my wife was last night. She was getting ready and
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.440]   You know, and she saw me in bed now sitting there and she's like she looked over
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.720]   She's like what are you doing on your iPhone? I'm like, um playing field runners
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:38.360]   Yeah, she was expecting me to be doing something serious responding to an SM. See it's the other way for my wife
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:44.120]   She she knows I'm playing a game. She says you're playing a game. Aren't you and I go no no? I'm uh, I'm researching on Twitter
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:50.920]   I'm checking to see if anything important has happened in the last five seconds in the Twitter verse in the Twitter verse
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.040]   P did he has a million followers
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.400]   Uh, so has anybody tried? I mean, this isn't really an apple story
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:04.600]   But it is a big news story of the week. They actually two big news stories that we've been covering on other shows and I think impact apple one is uh, microsoft
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.280]   The new search engine microsoft thing
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:15.960]   I just did a search on microsoft thing for palm pre and you know, one of the things it's not a search engine. It's a
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:21.000]   What is the phrase they use? It's a thought provoker. Yeah, they got some it's a decider
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:27.160]   Some cockamamie phrase that they go. It's a decision or so they have you know your search results down one side
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:33.800]   But then they also have related searches on the left so I searched for palm pre and here's what I got pre lit palm tree
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.840]   pre lit swaying palm
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.920]   So they have a little work to do on on that algorithm that figures out
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:45.960]   It's smart search. Oh, I could turn it on
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.800]   uh
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.400]   I'm sorry safe search smart search is something I'd like to turn on please
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.880]   This is the internet. What are you what are you three hits?
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:34:01.320]   Anyway, anybody use Bing anybody have a thought about Bing is this a credible google
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.160]   I
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:08.360]   I've used it and I really think it's about time that someone starts to you know, really just
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:13.560]   Want a good old-fashioned street fight against google in terms of search because they've been really
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:19.480]   serving people for years and years and years I know that their whole philosophy is that they
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:26.040]   Want sites and services that work fast through a very very streamlined and will work on anything and give the same experience to everybody
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:33.240]   But the thing is we're still stuck in 2001 2002 in terms of user interface. That was designed when you look at at Bing
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:36.120]   I'm still getting used to
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:42.040]   Though the the word it's okay. I don't think I'd be well. You ever you do a Bing search, but they were gonna call it a nato
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:46.040]   But they realized somebody else had the name. Yeah, well, they should they should talk to me
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:52.280]   It's someone had that URL is probably just a some 82 year old guy as a Bing Crosby, you know fan site
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:57.160]   And now he and now he has 40 million dollars this grandfills and have to explain where they came from
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:02.840]   Yeah, they must have bought it from somebody because I tell you what you can cut down on your copy your trademark infringement real easy
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:09.480]   Because very few people are gonna say hey you want to Bing me. Yeah, you know, I here's what I find interesting is the related searches connected to me
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:14.040]   Yes, so I put in Alex Lindsey and I you know I got a first page
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:21.400]   But the the related searches are Doug Chang who's the art director for Star Wars good Jessica Corbin who we all know. Yeah, uh grant
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:27.320]   Ema Hara who's in mythbusters, but I used to work with him in island. Oh, well and um steve Gibson good
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:33.640]   Um Lawrence Lessig. Well, that's nice. I just thought it was interesting. I mean, it's like I don't know how they make those connections
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.640]   I mean there are all people I know
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.360]   Show up in pages with your name, but yes, that's actually pretty
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.920]   It's actually it's actually but it's just a very fascinating cross section of people
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.920]   Not people that I would normally list as people that I would expect to show the mic
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:51.240]   Tails me that Microsoft spilling this as a decision analysis machine
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:55.160]   Not a certain mistake. They should they should just say it's a more modern more
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:36:00.440]   It's an alternative search tool because I I like the fact that it presents results in a very
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:06.600]   Much more much better organized fashion makes it much easier. I think to search but to sift between the things you want the things you don't want
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.440]   Uh, the related searches. It does a very very good job of it
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.560]   When I when I do a when I do it when I test a new search
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.680]   Search tool. Are you always one of the things always tested on is tiger t i g r a
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:23.560]   Because it's one of those really really odd ball words that happens to apply to every
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:28.520]   There's there's there's a comic book character in both dc and marvel comments called tiger
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:35.720]   There is a popular car performance car in europe called the tiger. It is also an an adult herbal supplement
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.680]   Uh, there is a musician by the name of tiger. They're like hotels and honduras. It's it pretty well on this
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.680]   I'm looking at this it looks like it did a good job
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:47.880]   And how do you do their related search? It's on the left related searches. Yeah
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.840]   All right, I'm not even seeing that
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.040]   Oh, well
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.040]   You're not seeing it bing bing
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.720]   Right
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.240]   I don't think you don't see a related searches on the left side left column
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.040]   I'm using camino. Maybe there's a difference
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.800]   Uh, I do notice when I search for myself and click local
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.040]   Um
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.960]   The the results are uninspiring their scott's lawn service
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.920]   Uh, which is an 800 number
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.920]   Uh, there's steven scott's bail bonds, which is an 800 number
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:23.320]   And then there's somebody in oklahoma city named scott prosthetics and research
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.880]   There you go. If you ever need a rubber leg, you're set
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.600]   So the local search thing you need to go back and work on that a little bit more microsoft
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.760]   You know, I didn't see where local is
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:37.800]   You know, I got a local and you got a related so maybe there's something going on here
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.560]   Yeah, see when I get related to me, I get only me, you know
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:46.840]   That's because you're so big although there's a lot of all the more at the bottom. You get you a patreon. Yeah
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.720]   But there's pictures across the top
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.680]   There's it's the same results as google gives me
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.440]   Yeah, that's the point if you're gonna do a new search engine at this point in time
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.960]   You're gonna have to
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.560]   Come up with something really wow to get people to switch from google
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:05.400]   I think it's commendable that they're trying and you know, it looks like in the last couple of
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:10.520]   Weeks or days we've heard a lot of cool stuff coming out of microsoft. I have to give them props
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:15.080]   I mean I looked at the specs on the hdzoon and I may have to actually like in that
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.000]   You may have to actually stop making fun of it. You would oh wow
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.880]   That's how serious that looks now. Here's something I learned about the hdzoon that was a little disappointing the screen is not hd
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.760]   How can you call it an hdzoon?
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.120]   Oh, that's a good question. Well, if you hook it up to a high-def tv
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:37.000]   It's it can store 720p video and play it back through its hookup
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.720]   But it's actually useful. Yeah, it's think of it as a like a portable apple tv basically, right?
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.640]   Well, it's sort of like what you'd expect out of microsoft when they start to come up with something cool
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.800]   There's still got to be a caveat, but anyway
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:52.120]   They're the controller that they showed for the xbox looked really wild
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:58.360]   You know, they're there you know, they've got they've got some very cool technology sitting around there
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:04.840]   And I think it's just a matter of time before they figure out how to market things and make it look something other than a spreadsheet
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.120]   but
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:10.840]   It's got a here's kind of interesting. It's got a pretty powerful processor. It's got a and then
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:15.880]   NVIDIA tegra in it not an arm chip. Hmm or maybe it
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:21.400]   Well, I'm pretty sure I'm right up there on top of microsoft's reviewers list for this
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.480]   So who knows if i'll ever see one but uh, it does it does sound like interesting
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.680]   Here buddies with rob greenley. That's right. I can get rod
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:35.720]   Get us an hd. I'm gonna buy one, but I think I think it does show that you know, we do make fun of them
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.760]   But you know, they do have some very smart people over there
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:44.360]   I know a lot of them because I live close and and I just I always wonder what's the difference?
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.520]   Why is it that the cool smart people and products at microsoft?
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:54.840]   Don't actually get the success that the ones from apple do is it some is a company culture thing
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.160]   Is there management style?
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.520]   It's it's very interesting to me to see that there are very
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:07.320]   Very talented people there who really do want to do some cool stuff and and why it doesn't ever quite just get there
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.560]   I think part of it is is that that I think apple is really good at waiting until the market is
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:18.440]   Pregnant and waiting for something, you know, like, you know, they don't they're not giving us the media pad for instance until we're practically begging for it
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.080]   You know, like we know that that's coming we know that we need it
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:25.880]   Um, they didn't then the apples tend to not be ahead. They just tend to be kind of on the crest of that wave
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.440]   um, you know and and
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.840]   Microsoft tends to be like a set behind
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:35.320]   You know, and so they they they create a great the zoom is a great player and it would do
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:41.080]   It would have been very successful if the iPod hadn't been out for a couple of years a search engine is a great thing to do
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:45.720]   Six years ago eight years ago, you know, I think that's the the problem is is that they go
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:50.840]   Yeah, we should get into this market, but they're just not moving fast enough to to get in when the market is soft
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.840]   They're getting in when the market is already hardened
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:41:01.480]   I agree and that's a this is this is I think this kind of hardening of the arteries in effect is what happens when tech companies get on in age
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.760]   It's very hard for them to be on top of what's going on now
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.360]   And when it's more committee driven, I think part of what apple's able to do is they're able to react
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:12.600]   But up until now they were able to react almost as old as Microsoft's older
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:17.640]   Older um the but I think that the difference was is that apple had the exact same problem
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:23.800]   Before Steve Jobs came back because it was a committee driven and there's a lot of people that had a visionary
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:28.600]   You have to have somebody saying do it do this do this don't do this someone making clear decisions
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.360]   You know, Google the other thing is like microsoft is committed to spend a hundred
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.640]   Million dollars promoting Bing
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:39.400]   That's Steve at that's nothing that's Bill Gates cigarette money. That's nothing
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.400]   I know but the point is is apple doesn't tend to spend those kinds of budgets
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.560]   Uh from what i've seen on on products and i'm thinking that you know
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:53.560]   It's a mindset that maybe if you spend another hundred million on development instead of on marketing
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:57.640]   You'd get something that wouldn't need marketing because the uptake would be so rapid
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:01.720]   I mean for instance if this game controller thing that they showed off yesterday actually works
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.760]   And it actually comes to market at a decent price
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:09.320]   My gosh, I mean that they're not going to need to spend a hundred million dollars marketing that
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.880]   Tell me about the game controller and see that oh
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.120]   And he's probably better to do this than me
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:20.120]   So so this was the thing that made me forget that they started off this e3 keynote by having all the beetles
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:23.000]   As much as they could on stage at one time. So they have a
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.880]   They're they're sort of they're sort of missing
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.120]   Messing up the message a little bit
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.080]   The whole point is that there there is a little tiny little
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:37.960]   Adaptive device like a camera device who put underneath your hd tv that will work with any xbox currently shipping or future shipping
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:45.720]   That turns it does live what they said during the keynote is it's doing live motion capture of multiple bodies in front of the camera
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:50.760]   So that uh when you're playing imagine playing we tennis only you don't have to have the we control it in your hand
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.840]   All you have to do is just basically
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.240]   Act like you're playing tennis and have that mind
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:58.840]   That that mind video connection and it will actually interpret it correctly
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.680]   Uh that you can interact with the screen you can interact with characters. It does
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.720]   a
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.520]   It then they demonstrated a certain form of voice input
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.840]   And this looks like the sort of thing where and and it looked very very
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:17.800]   Very very accurate very very interactive. It wasn't the sort of thing where you move your hand a little bit and then wait for the screen to catch up with you
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.800]   It looked like it was moving fast enough that you keep up. The second cool thing is that
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:30.120]   It's not as though they had when they were demonstrating this live on stage that they had people in front of a green screen or even in front of a neutral background
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:37.240]   They had one person who seemed to be in what looked like a little alcove that was set up to be as well lit and static as possible
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:41.640]   But they also did one where that they had the camera pointed at this person who was
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:47.320]   A midfield inside the stage. So it looks like the demonstration looks very very good
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.240]   But they're showing this off as it's just as a way of controlling games
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:44:00.120]   But if you were to think about this that you have a wonderful little computer that's cooked up to this big screen that is inside every single
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:06.280]   Almost every single house in america at this point at least a huge percentage of houses in america now have big HD TVs
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:12.360]   Not only that but this screen is inside the focal point of the houses in that room that everybody gathers at or everybody passes through
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:18.040]   Imagine having a computing system where just by virtue of being in the room and saying what's my schedule today or
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:23.560]   Record a video message for for bob as and delivered to him when he was when he sensed that he's gotten home
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:29.320]   All these it's it could become a really interesting platform just for home computing
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:32.600]   I'm not sure if microsoft has the sort of vision to really do that
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:37.720]   Uh, this is done at the e3 conference so that they're really only they're really only concerned about saying
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.600]   About showing off what this thing could do for games
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.600]   And once again, it seemed to be very very ambitious
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:47.640]   They had uh in the canned part of the demo like the the video that they shot at you know in a nice little set
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.800]   Uh, I was a miles away a month ago
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:53.640]   They had things like a skateboarding game where not only is this person just basically
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:57.960]   Pretending that he's like being on a skateboard and using that to interact with the with the game
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.120]   But also taking his own deck
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:04.280]   And just holding it up and saying scan this holding up his deck flipping it over
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.080]   Here's the backside and then not only does it capture that image
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:11.000]   But it also builds a virtual skateboard that has that artwork on it. Uh, so
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.320]   It's been wild
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:19.480]   It looks it looks really cool. I mean that the problem is that microsoft is really really great at demo not really great at follow-through
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.800]   Uh apple when they give a keynote
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:27.800]   They're essentially giving you a demonstration of something that in their minds has already happened that this is the way that all
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:32.680]   phones work and this is the world that this iPhone lives in and you can get we've been using this for a month
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:40.200]   But now you get to use it too. Microsoft's keynotes tend to be here's something that we're working on and unless we get distracted by a bright shani object
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.920]   We're gonna tell yourself your point to
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:46.360]   So i'm playing the video back by the way
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:51.960]   I went to the xbox project natal which is what this is called a page and the video can't be played on a mac
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:56.680]   It only good. Yeah, I guess xbox owners are only windows users. So uh
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:01.560]   But how is this different from the we I mean this looks a little bit like there's no control control
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.040]   It's a the no control. I mean it's a very very subtle difference
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:10.440]   There's a difference between walking into a room looking for a controller and picking it up and simply walking into a room and just
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:15.880]   Interact there's a lot more control because you're we've been able to do this before I mean the playstation 2 had a
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:20.040]   A little camera that you could do poxing and stuff. I mean, this is not really though
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:25.080]   I mean the level the level of the level of detail that you're seeing in that in the in the dude that's in the game is pretty
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:29.560]   It's pretty robust. It's way more than anything we've seen before now the thing is is that
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:34.200]   Um, there's a lot of ways to it's hard to tell exactly what's right behind him
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:41.480]   Because what it you know, there's a lot of ways to do this. I mean, it's probably a constrained humanoid that is looking at
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:48.040]   You know, making yeah demos. It's demos are always deceptive because you just you can't right so he's drawing with this
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.040]   He's drawing uh like with pain
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:55.800]   Using the other and the other by the way, this looks exhausting. Yeah in the demo video
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.200]   They think is actually good. I think it's good for a lot of kids to uh, be exhausted. Just give me a mouse
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:05.000]   I'm saying not I mean just no tedious in some ways they had in one in the canned part of the demo
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:11.400]   They had someone doing a racing game where not only is the person like having to stand like this and sort of mimic having a steering wheel in his hand
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:16.120]   In her hands and i'm thinking well, I would rather much rather have a real steering wheel in my hand with tactile feedback
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:20.920]   Not only that, but there's a section of the game where uh the the voice in this on the on the in the game says
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.040]   Oh, you're burning up the tires better pit out and so she goes into the pits
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:30.040]   Then someone has to like another person in the room has to rush up to the screen mimic an air gun and change the tires
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.280]   I'm like, oh god. I don't want to be the guy who's just
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:37.480]   You don't get to drive you're in the pit. That's the that's called the kid brother job
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.760]   Yeah, so I mean this this could be remarkably tedious
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:45.960]   Uh if it's if it's used the wrong way, but it's it's a really cool demo and microsoft
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.480]   Doesn't always do the cool demo. Sometimes they do the one that says that's nice, honey
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:54.200]   Yeah, you bake this we're putting this demo right on the fridge where everybody can see
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:58.360]   Great demo along with all of ringo stars songs
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:03.080]   And then all of this comes all of this comes the week that we see google wave
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:10.120]   Which could very much impact not only mac users, but pretty much everybody in the world if this thing gets adopted
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.120]   It's open source. I was gonna talk about that too
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:16.280]   But actually let's hold on a second so I can mention drobo and I know you scott do you have a drobo giveaway?
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:23.240]   You want to tell everybody about I did go to the courthouse last week and legally change my name to scott giveaway a drobo born
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:26.440]   As you should have
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.640]   I uh, I'm I'm helping to give away not one but two drobos
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:35.080]   Uh right now go to drobo.com/video contest. I'm one of the three judges
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:41.000]   We're going to ask people to create a 60 second video about either a why they deserve a drobo
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.520]   And in our entitlement culture that should be easy or be
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:49.800]   Why you'd like to have yet another one because you've already got one you need two and the first one's lonely
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.840]   So go to drobo.com/video contest
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.960]   We're going to give these things away in a couple of weeks follow me on twitter
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.760]   It's got born dot com or just got born for more information
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:05.480]   It's going to be fun. I love giving away drobo's leo because you know what the sob stories that I get whenever I do this are just legend
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:09.480]   You may know because why I need a drobo it's like queen. Oh, yeah
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:15.960]   Even when I do the random ones where I'm literally I often just give away a prizes based on random
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.240]   followers
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:21.880]   But even when I tell people it's random it doesn't stop them. They say well my my aunt
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:26.680]   I still want to tell you my story. She had this poodle and it had a lot of medicine
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:31.000]   We had to keep track of all the medicine. We needed a drobo for all the databases
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.080]   Have you played with a drobo pro?
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:36.120]   Of course I showed the first video online of a drobo pro
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:40.360]   So the so the idea that robo pro is instead of four slots it has eight
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:46.360]   Correct. You can replace force can you put can you put just four drives in it and then add drives as you need the capacity
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.600]   Two or more two or more
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:54.200]   Two or more and the big difference with the drobo pro is the drobo pro protects against
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:59.480]   redundant drive failure currently the current drobo if you have one drive fail
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.280]   You're you're still good to go your date is protected
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.720]   But if you have a second drive fail, which is highly unlikely, but it could happen
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:10.840]   Then you're not protected with the drobo pro if two or two simultaneously fail
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:15.160]   You're still cool and the other big deal is speed. It's a lot faster than ice
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.520]   I want right
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:23.880]   It's ice guzzi and when you connect it via ice guzzi you see about 50 percent speed boost over firewire 800
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.800]   That's wow
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:30.600]   Yeah, it's really fast. So do you use ice guzzi? Scott? I mean, uh, Alex
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:37.400]   Is it's it's it's like a hard like an external drive hard connection except it uses gigabit ethernet
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:41.000]   Yes, does it have to be directly connected or can it be on the LAN?
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.480]   It has to be connected. So it's essentially using an ethernet cable instead of a hard drive
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.320]   You have to use the net cable
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:51.080]   Yeah, you can connect it to a server and then have that distributed make you know made that available
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:56.600]   But yeah, you can't so the idea is you can have longer throws then you can put it farther away. Yeah, okay
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:01.960]   Yeah, ice cut everybody's talking about ice guzzi. This is by the way great for virtual server environments
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:06.600]   Like VMware virtual iron zen microsoft hyper v because you can hope host the machines
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.320]   Directly the virtual machines directly on the drobo
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:17.320]   Uh, or you can use it to add additional stores to additional to existing virtual servers use it with small business server for microsoft
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:21.400]   Microsoft tech ad named it the best product best breakthrough product
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:25.960]   Uh, grobo comm slash mac break is the place to go
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:31.320]   If you're interested in the drobo free shipping and instant rebate on two of their packages for a limited time
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:34.840]   But you've got to go there right now. That's dr. Oh b. Oh drobo
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:41.480]   Dot com slash mac break and by the way, you still you don't have to use ice guzzi you still have firewair 800
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.880]   Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's just it's just that they're gonna want another option right
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:54.520]   I'm very intrigued by ice guzzi. It's extremely fast leo and it's the first uh, it's the first real world use of ice guzzi
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:57.880]   I've seen I can't believe 50 percent faster than 800
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:01.000]   Yeah, it's that's about that's about 50 percent
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.720]   And if you get up to eight drives in there, it'll support up to 256 terabytes, but with the current drives
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:09.800]   That's 16 terabytes is the max. That's all that we only have to try about drive so far
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:15.480]   But that's the point is this you're you could you could upgrade down the road drobo comm slash a lot of storage
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.640]   Yeah
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:20.600]   Although 16 terabytes, you know in a few years we're gonna
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:24.280]   Know how we ever survived with 16. That's why you want to buy something like this, right?
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.720]   Because then when the new big house right now I got four drobo's stacked on
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:32.040]   You know on top of each other sitting next to my computer and I can eliminate
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.400]   Starting to as the drobo start to become more available
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:39.640]   They're they're kind the pro drobo pro is just now really starting to get in stock
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:45.400]   And as they become more available, I'll be able to switch out so for every two drobo's I have I'll go down to one
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:51.800]   I don't know how you'll survive but you won't let which will make more room for more drobo
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.000]   That's why i'm thinking
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.160]   DR. Oh, be oh drobo.com slash mac break. We thank them so much for their support. So
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:04.440]   What do you think of so you I if wave caught your attention scott then i'm thinking
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.560]   Google's got something because
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:11.240]   I don't know. Do you use google stuff now wait a minute. What is that supposed to mean?
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:16.280]   You're so mac centric that if you know, it just yeah, that means I use google products
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:19.080]   But I I mostly am interested in
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:24.600]   Looking at technologies that I see come around the corner that will be applied later
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:28.440]   I mean the reason I started net radio back in the 90s was a few years before that
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:33.160]   I had beta tested real audio and I was like, oh here are the implications of this
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:37.720]   Well, that's the kind of thing I see with google wave. There are a lot of implications for this
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:42.520]   It could obsolete a lot of the current technologies in the way we do things now
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:48.520]   Just looking at what they put together. I mean knowing that it's open source and people can go nuts with it
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:54.680]   I'm just imagining a whole bunch of people that are way smarter than me will come up with very very interesting things to work with it
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:57.800]   and I'm very excited to see how it just sort of
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:04.520]   Creates this whole new experience that I think because it's an open source that companies like apple and microsoft even
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:08.840]   We'll be able to work with it and incorporate it in what they do. I was very intrigued
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.840]   I mean, I thought boy this I want to use this now
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.080]   I want to in fact I did ask them for an account because I
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:18.360]   A beta, you know not even beta developers account because I think we could use this as our interface for the show
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:22.440]   We could use this to collaborate before the show. I mean there's all sorts of interesting uses for the thing
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:25.800]   Did you see the collaboration stuff in the video? Yeah
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:31.960]   Go ahead tell this guy there's a guy. There's a guy typing in chinese. There's another guy typing in Hebrew
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:34.520]   There's another guy typing in english. It's all happening in real time
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:38.200]   Multiple people are editing picture captions at the same time
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.840]   And you can keep you can keep track of it
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.640]   And real time translation
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:47.800]   Yeah, which was very impressive the spell checker very impressive
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:52.040]   So when Alex actually starts talking about hd video does that mean i'll understand him?
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:56.040]   No, they don't translate. They don't have Alex's yeah
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:00.280]   They're working on it. That's a tough one to solve
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:05.160]   No, it looks it looks like a great collaborative when you're working on projects when you're you know, it's it really
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:08.520]   We're excited about it at the office to kind of kind of went through the office
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.520]   Oh, I can't wait as a as a big tidal wave
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:16.520]   But this is an example by the way, I got a point out of an example of how I mean microsoft could and probably will do something like this
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:20.040]   They have share point and groove. They already have a lot of collaborative and environments
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.640]   And but they'll do it the wrong way
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:26.120]   They'll do it as a product as a closed system that you know comes from microsoft to you
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.520]   You know you use it because microsoft did it
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:32.840]   Uh, and google's just taking the exact opposite tack. It's completely open
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:37.480]   They're encouraging developers to participate. They're inviting you to participate. They're letting you look at the code
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:41.640]   Uh, they're letting you run wave servers on your own server, right?
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.960]   You know branded wave servers. They're giving it away
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:51.000]   And of course your business model is different than microsoft's microsoft hat can't do that but uh, but that's not the modern business model
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.520]   That's the issue. It's yeah, they're and that's exactly right. Yeah
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:58.200]   Snow leopard what we're gonna see in snow leopard at ww dc
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:01.480]   Anything anybody have any input any guesses any predictions?
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:06.440]   Any any uh, I don't think we're gonna see it released. We won't see it. It's not gonna be the fall
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.920]   That's my guess
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.760]   I think I think we'll see a final candidate
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:17.080]   Will like the public do you think they'll do public beta as microsoft's been doing with windows 7? No, but but I think that they'll say oh
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.960]   By the way, this is locked. We're gonna do bug fixes for the next month and a half
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.640]   But it's a month and a half two months before you ship i could take that i could take i think
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:27.320]   Announce consumer release date and they're gonna say this is this is feature lock. This is
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:33.000]   More or less bug lock you we think we know what all the show stoppers are and we're going with this
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.680]   Is there pressure on apple to make this be particularly robust or particularly?
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.960]   I mean they are in effect saying we're not gonna add features
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:44.760]   But they are they're they're they're gonna add some features
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:48.440]   But the onus is on them to make this be super solid
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:52.440]   Yeah, and fast because essentially that's what microsoft's doing with windows 7
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:56.120]   They're saying all right. You don't like vista. We're gonna fix it. We're gonna make it faster more reliable
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:59.880]   No, not not really a substantial new feature set, but just polish it
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:04.520]   I think where you're gonna see snow leopard make a difference is the apps
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:11.640]   You're you're not gonna see like a bunch of new o s features. There's not gonna be a bunch of new you're gonna replace calculator
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:18.280]   Because it's time now what I meant with apps is like the pro apps will be able to tap into
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:21.720]   Snow leopard and do cool new things for instance
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:28.760]   You know, you might find that iMovie could do something really cool that it couldn't do before because there'll be some new feature in snow leopard
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.880]   As opposed to we've got this new thing called the doc
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:37.320]   Well, and I think that when you look at the the combination of some of the GPU stuff along with open cl
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:41.320]   Which hopefully we're gonna see more of um, you know open cl is something i'm pretty excited about
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:45.000]   You know this ability to go back and forth use the gpu or cpu
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:50.520]   There's a lot of speed increases that are available. That's new in snow leopard. Um, yeah, that's new in snow leopard
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:56.440]   And I think significant and you know this is you don't see much of it it ripples close to the surface on goingly
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:03.720]   Um, but when you look at the focus of both intel and of uh, invidia and ati I mean, or especially in vidia
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.200]   I think we're gonna see a lot of um
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.760]   And when it's fully functional
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:13.320]   Uh, it could mean you're able to do an enormous amount of video processing
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.600]   Um
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:20.520]   Very very seamlessly do you do you think that this will mean a renaissance of gaming on the mac?
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:24.280]   Platform I don't think that I don't I just don't think that's ever gonna take take hold
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:27.960]   I mean, I think that the gaming the the gaming in the mac community is gonna live on the iphone
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:31.960]   In my opinion. I just don't think that I don't think that mac users are
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:35.800]   As game driven. I think that's another one of those things where the market is pretty hardened
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:40.520]   You know the market is kind of hardened on a uh, you know that it's like in high school
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:45.320]   They've decided that you're a stoner and there's no way that you can really prove to them that you're a jot
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.640]   A way to admit that was my life never
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.320]   But they believe that but the gaming gaming in general is moving away from the desktop and out of consoles
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:56.280]   Anyway, so that's right right i work chasing after an invisible rabbit
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:59:00.440]   I feel like a greyhound
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:02.920]   All right, so uh
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:05.320]   Too bad. No, that's why I find it
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:09.240]   I have to admit that I I just i'm not willing to I personally might when I look at it
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:11.320]   And I'm I don't think i'm a good cross section of gamers
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:16.120]   But I just don't want anything that's gonna that that does require huge amounts of time or resources
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:19.880]   I mean, I really like like plants and zombies is about as complicated as I need a game to be
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.520]   It's a pretty simple game. Why are these games are very successful and I think
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:25.800]   Why the question about that is that a flash is that an air app?
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:27.320]   Uh
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:30.120]   Uh, good question. I don't know. I mean it's got cross platform
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.840]   It just seems like an air app. It feels like an air app when you open it
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:34.760]   It does feel like flash doesn't it? Yeah, it feels like flash
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:39.240]   You know, I can find out I'll ask the folks at pogo because uh, I'm very curious about what that's built in
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:41.960]   I mean pop cap not pop cap. Okay. Um
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:45.080]   Did you see my plant?
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.960]   That's your plot
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:52.120]   What are you laughing at? Hey, sometimes I think that we're not with an AI
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:58.200]   We've all got to have a hobby. You see my plant. Let me go get my plant. He's got a plant
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:03.000]   He's going out to get a plant. How do you how do you feel when I say I'm assuming that it's a plant that can fire little
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.640]   Little things at zombies and he's got it out in the backyard
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:10.760]   Uh, that that's that's highly probable that that would keep us safe because here in petaluma
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.760]   We have a real problem with zombies
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.240]   Uh, you know, it's it's late at night. You don't let people out too late. Oh wow. That's not what I expected
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:24.360]   I was expecting something a little bit more substantial
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:27.160]   this
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:31.240]   What are you my plan for if you would have sent me a memo?
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:36.680]   I'd have brought my shriners. You know, I was expecting something that was going to protect you from zombies and what we got is
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.680]   Something that will protect you from my
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.120]   This is Andy's plant. All right. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:46.840]   But I like this plant. I have a soft spot. First of all, it's a plant versus zombies plant
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:53.560]   Wow does that come with the game? I didn't get one of those. No, they sent it to me. Oh, oh, we got some leaf damage here
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:58.360]   I think we've got mike knows the zombie attack, but look at the sizes thing this thing grew in a week
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.280]   To be it's like a beanstalk. Wow, I'm afraid it's kudzu
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:07.640]   But anyway, I'm gonna I'm gonna drape this and I'm gonna have it twine up my microphone stand
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:12.840]   But that they know that will like illegal pop cap game sent me a plant when they when they sent me the
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:16.840]   It's gonna start like a little plant like that even before you know it's gonna be like a fad me see more
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:22.120]   So you got a better plant than I do, Andy, but you spent all your time at home alone
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:29.240]   I've got shows to do what what encouraging this to grow you put it. You put it in sunlight. Yeah, you know, you water it
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:32.600]   I have a black thumb. I have never done what I was both
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:38.520]   I don't have to do a thing mine. Oh, look at yours. Wait a minute. That's uh, what kind of plant is that?
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:44.280]   That's that grass stuff that grows. That's exactly right. All you have to do is like sort of look at it and it grows
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.040]   It's like a drought resist there, you know, they plant this all over california now because
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:54.680]   You can't kill it. It's almost like having a cat, isn't it? You just ignore it. Let it do its thing occasionally you feed it
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:58.920]   Don't try to get any love from it. All right, so I notice you it doesn't care about you
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:02.120]   I have been completely we should start having theme weeks here at mac break week
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:06.520]   We got you know a wine shirt week last week plant and shiner hat week this week
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:13.240]   I got completely one up. I little scrawny plant. I feel like uh, Linus and his christmas tree
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:18.360]   I mean, that's just you guys I want to run up you but that's charlie brown and his christmas tree
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:24.040]   That's proving your point. I'm sorry. Hey, you are
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.600]   Hey, you are
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:31.960]   All right. Well, I just rebooted after downloading a new safari garage band quick time and itunes update
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:36.440]   So, uh, I have no idea what this show is what's going on with this show now
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.920]   Hey, we have some uh quasi
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:45.960]   Do you have something yes jerry jerry has some quasi apple news? I was talking to wozniak last night at dinner
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:52.920]   And I said I was coming up to see you and you guys I love watching leo and listening to him on xm radio
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:57.560]   I listened to him all the time. Well, uh, you know, I keep sending him emails saying congratulations
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.040]   Can you come on the show? You know because of dancing with the stars?
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.240]   I guess he's not getting my email, but I'll have to oh
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:08.360]   I mentioned that you watch him on dancing with the stars. I did yes, he was interesting
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:14.440]   He was representing for us for the you know the geek brother and sisterhood
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:18.120]   I thought he did all right. He'd be great when he jumped on the ground and did the worm I
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.760]   I feared for his life and
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:27.960]   The tiles but uh, you know, it was impressive that he lasted two rounds and everything was he a good spirits after uh, if he was yes
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.640]   Um, he didn't talk about it much. Uh, we were too busy playing games and
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:37.320]   What did you play? What did you play? Oh some silly game where you say a name of a place and
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:44.520]   That could be found on a map and then whatever the last letter is then that's the next place. Oh, I've played that game
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:47.640]   Yeah, that's hard. Yeah, that's hard. He's smart
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:51.080]   Yes, he always gives you like
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.480]   A's and then after uh
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.800]   You know the fifth time of having a's it starts. He knows what he's doing. He keeps going to laska
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:02.040]   Yeah, I know I know he's a he's a sneaky sneaky fellow
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.240]   Um
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.000]   Well, let's do our picks. What do you say?
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.840]   As soon as my computer comes back. I will know what my pick is but meanwhile before we get our picks to uh,
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:15.240]   Let's do our audible commercial
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:21.560]   Mention audible.com a udi bl it's my bookstore my online store of great literature
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.680]   uh, wonderful variety of stuff
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.720]   If you uh if you listen to podcasts
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:31.960]   I think it's just a natural to start listening to a to audible books
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:36.280]   60 000 titles now a huge variety including was his book
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.680]   I was
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:42.040]   I can't remember does he narrate? No, he doesn't narrate. I was he should
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:48.360]   You know when I read I was when I listen I was I hear his voice anyway because he has that distinctive
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:53.400]   You know presentation and it comes through in the writing my friend jina smith who was my co-author
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:56.120]   um of my first book
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.400]   Uh wrote it with him and I think she did a great job of capturing
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:05.080]   His uh his unique sound I was how I invented the personal computer
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:10.040]   And had fun along the way. Yeah, let me this is it's patrick lawler
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:15.320]   Who uh who reads it? Let me play a little bit of it though for you. I don't know what section this is of
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:18.920]   Design work
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:22.600]   And I remember sitting there and being so little and thinking wow
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:27.800]   What a great great world he's living in. I mean that's all I thought
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.040]   wow
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:36.520]   For people who know how to do this stuff how to take these little parts and make them work together to do something
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:40.120]   Well, these people must be the smartest people in the world
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:44.840]   It doesn't sound like steve but at the same time a little bit. Yeah, you can hear steve's voice in there. Yeah
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.200]   uh
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:50.680]   The the awe and um excitement that he still has after all his time

[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:45.720]   See while we don't play as many games on the mac we like to create on the mac and so this is a program that um
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.360]   Has just come to the mac so this was available
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:55.080]   On the pc side for quite some time and uh, and it was something that I really wanted I actually had at the office
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:07:02.600]   Had windows installed just so I could use it. Um, you know a while ago, you know, just just so that I you know, i'm that's a sacrifice
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:08.920]   So, um, so this is called mudbox and mudbox is is now owned by
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.160]   uh, autodesk
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.120]   and uh
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:18.680]   And so what mudbox does is um, this allows you to sculpt so it's very much I I've recommended an another
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:23.080]   Application called z brush in the past and so it's similar to z brush
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.520]   Um, it is uh, but it is a little bit more
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:30.920]   Z bus is very artist driven and it has a very peculiar interface
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:36.840]   Um that you really have to get your head around to start using it's not something I mean you literally just can't figure out where to start
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.160]   It's very powerful. It has
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:44.040]   And great new integration tools so it's still a great, you know, it it in itself is a whole different
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:49.320]   Um world but what mudbox does is really builds it's really built for the production pipeline
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:55.000]   This was built by guys that were at wetter so what production of what what uh, this was like create like models monsters
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.920]   Well, here's what you use it primarily for is that you build a 3d model and then you take it into mudbox and you
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:05.240]   Put all the fine detail all the wrinkles if you can look at if you think of like golem
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:12.360]   Got them as a good example that was a mixture from what I understand uh both z brush and of the precursor to mudbox
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:15.960]   Which is the idea is all the little wrinkles all the little
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:22.520]   Uh, very fine details that are very hard to build with um 3d modeling program. It's very hard to define all of that
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:28.360]   Um, you know without just sitting there and looking at and sculpting it and basically what you're creating is you're able to bring something in
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:33.560]   And sculpt it like clay so you're able to actually um push stuff out. It's very very fluid
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.560]   It's very easy to use especially if you have a uh a wacom tablet
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:43.560]   Uh, you can really just sit there and paint in detail paint in texture onto a 3d object
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:51.080]   Uh, and it's it's uh, it's very very powerful that way and so um, you know, it's it's in the same world that z brushes
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:55.320]   But I think it's a little bit more driven towards, um, you know a production pipeline
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:57.880]   As far as the interface goes
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:02.680]   Uh, one of the things we still have to test with it is is how well it works compared to z brush are very very high polygon counts
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.240]   But uh, which z brush does really well, um, but mud box is it's a very, you know
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:11.720]   Business like, you know, we're gonna get this kind of modeling done
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:16.440]   Um, now it's it still windows or do they have a mac version that just got released?
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:22.600]   So the mac version is now out, um, and I believe that they have a demo that you can download and and even if you're not interested
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:27.160]   Even if this is something that you're like, it's because it's 700 750 dollars. It's an Alex
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:31.800]   Basically, um, it is not you know, how they figured out what to charge
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:36.760]   Yeah, they just looked at it like well it there's that it's that ballpark, you know, it's a it's a pro out there
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.720]   And so it's also more expensive than something like z brush but, uh, even if you're not if you think this is out out of your
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.680]   Price range right now. It's definitely worth going up
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:49.480]   On a mac and downloading the demo and playing with it because it's just a lot of fun
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:54.600]   I mean dealing with any of these 3d sculpting programs is is just it's just a good time
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:58.280]   I mean you're really it's you're you're playing with clay digital clay and and
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:04.440]   You know, I I'm hoping that someday we'll see kind of a mixture of what we saw with what microsoft is doing, you know with the xbox
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:10.920]   Uh, you know where you don't have to touch anything. I could literally pull my hands out and start working with a virtual, you know
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.120]   I could see using that interface with something like that
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.960]   And this is that would be kind of very intuitive
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:19.400]   But you know and that's years away, but but you're gonna see these previews of this
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:23.560]   It is very intuitive when you have a wakam tablet and you're sitting there and even with a mouse
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:26.200]   Cool to be sitting and sculpting in space
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.600]   I think I think that's coming. I mean, it's that'd be amazing. Yeah, it's it's definitely
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:33.400]   That might be soon. I've given if they can get this in the project
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:37.400]   These two technologies mixed together and so but I think that your mudbox is just it's as I said
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:42.600]   It's worth the it's worth the time just to download it and play with the demo just to have some fun
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.880]   It's as good as playing a little game. Um, it is when it comes to creation
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:49.000]   You're really working with and they've got great videos up there on how to get started
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.680]   How to how to start using it how to play with it and even if you're not doing 3d
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:57.800]   Just download it and play with it. It's it's really really a cool cool application mudbox
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.120]   Yes, one Alex, but
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:05.800]   We don't want you to buy it. Just play with it. Well if you if this is your business, uh, you'll you'll buy it right
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:08.920]   Scott born what's your pick of the day?
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:15.800]   Well, you know, I'm surprised nobody picked this before me, but uh, by the way, my name is scott. Thank you
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:21.960]   I I fixed it. I fixed it. I'm a little slow. You know, I'm doing other things here. Just joking
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:27.480]   Things he's talking about is lower third for those of you who loo listen calm
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:34.280]   Oh the hulu desktop the hulu desktop for matt came out. Yeah, baby boy is it s l i c k hm
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:40.520]   It is very cool. Um, you you can you just it just comes up. No nonsense. It works
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.720]   And by the way, I think there's a new update today or it was last night
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:49.160]   Um, which is free and you can they fixed a couple of things, but man, it is really nice
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.400]   This is the app that I think
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:59.000]   You know, everybody was kind of waiting for to make watching television on a computer more like watching television on a television
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.400]   It's easy to use. It's easy to find new content. You can jump ahead
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.400]   The quality is amazing and oh, yeah, it's free
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.160]   Yeah, I really
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.960]   I guess I understand now why hulu
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:18.200]   Shut down people like boxy because they were maybe because they were really working on this
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:24.360]   Yeah, well, but this doesn't replace boxy, but someone told me that you can use your your controller that comes with your matt to control hulu
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:30.040]   But I haven't tested that yet. You mean the the little your little role. I think that's a hack that somebody's okay. Yeah
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:35.720]   Um, obviously that's coming or something like this wish I don't know yet. See that's
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:42.680]   Go ahead. I just say I wish all the other stuff I worked with was as elegant and easy as this right out of the box
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.760]   I mean this is this is one of the few
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:51.880]   Non-apple items that works like an apple item in that it's ready to go. Yeah, it's really slick
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.160]   I like it a lot who are free pick for me no money
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:58.120]   free, baby
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:01.880]   Free free free zero alexes and now mr
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:05.560]   Andy not cool
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.080]   It's so nice to be called mr
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.480]   mr. Senior Andy and I call
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.440]   Just put your hands on the hold of the car
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:16.760]   That's just over here
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:23.240]   There's actually been something that it's weird how like I've got a little like list of things that I've got lined up as picks
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:27.800]   And then there'll be a conversation during the show that makes like a certain other thing just absolutely the perfect thing
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:32.760]   And so there's this little thing that has been like lined up as as a pick for the past three weeks
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:35.960]   But other things got but it turns out that this is the perfect thing
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:39.880]   It is we've been talking about plants and so I've got my my easy bloom
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:48.120]   Now it's not it not only makes it makes your desktop look like a million bucks
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:50.040]   It is actually a plant sensor
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:53.480]   So it has a usb port on the bottom of it like that
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:57.560]   And what you do with it is that it's it's a triple threat
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.240]   It's a very complex sensor
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.440]   So that if let's say that you're in your office you think you know what would be great
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.840]   It'd be great if there were a plant right there next to that window what you do is you plug this into
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:10.760]   Plug this into a usb port. It'll open up the easy bloom.com website
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:15.480]   Everything you do to operate this operates through a website and you just simply click a button to say
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:17.800]   Please put this in what's called recommend mode
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:23.160]   And then you just set this where you want the plant to be and it will spend the next 24 hours taking in data about
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.840]   What kind of light it gets during the day?
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:30.440]   What kind of moisture what kind of humidity what the temperature fluctuates over the course of the day and then 24 hours later when you plug
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:33.080]   This back into the usb port it collects all that data
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:38.280]   Sends it to the easy bloom site and it comes back with well here's a list of plants that would work well in that location
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.960]   And so that takes a lot of desperate out if you already have a plant
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:48.920]   What you can do is it also has a soil sensor right here so that you just dock this into the soil sensor
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:53.160]   Just like that you stick this
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.480]   Inside the soil
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:15:01.560]   Once again, you you set this into a special mode, but then it will spend 24 hours taking information about what kind of light it's getting
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:07.320]   What kind of moisture is getting and then 24 hours later you redock it and it will tell you it will give you a you tell
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.560]   What kind of a plant that you you've got in there?
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:17.640]   This is a this is a lily of the valley hasn't budded yet, but it will tell you it will give you a report card plant has a lot of
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.520]   Mine doesn't
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.360]   It's good. It's getting there. See it's getting the bottom there
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:26.040]   And so it'll give you a regular report on it. Well, here's here. It's how it's doing
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:29.480]   I think you're overwatering a little bit. You need to move it during the middle of the day
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:32.840]   So it's getting to my mind by hand like a really question
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.800]   And Andy did you did you get did you get the plant?
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.840]   So that you could test the plant
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:44.040]   Sensor no I it was a friend of mine actually gave me this
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.000]   Okay, it's it's a it's a very cool plan for
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.760]   And I knew that it was one of those things where
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:55.480]   PR people don't know like gee they they send you something but then like they don't know
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.600]   I don't write about it for a while because I'm like, well, I don't have any plants
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:03.480]   I don't know anything about plants. It sounds really really cool. I'd like to try it and then oh, she sent me
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:06.840]   Oh great. I'll I now have a reason that I can actually write about the easy bloom now
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:14.120]   Uh, but yeah, it's it's it's fantastic because it does do that trick of taking something that you were you weren't necessarily interested in
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:17.400]   And making it something that you really like because there's
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:22.760]   Tools and there's numbers and there's charts and there's graphs and it also helps you prevent, you know, killing plants
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.040]   Which is also a nice thing. Does it have does it come with um
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:29.080]   A little label that says not to be taken internally
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:35.240]   Well, I don't know I mean I bet there's some sites that would use this in a different way
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:37.560]   I mean if the safe search turned off, but the other
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:43.320]   I don't want to go there, but uh, see the other advantage is that like if you are that bad at managing plants
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.320]   You can just basically keep this just yeah, that's it's very attractive. I think it'll
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:52.200]   And it'll trip people into thinking that look how look how healthy it's got a nice plastic plant in his ground
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.360]   That also it also comes in like iMac blue for if you want this. Oh, that's the bondy blue
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:02.440]   Yeah, also if you're such a bad housekeeper that like even these petals fall off and die. Well, that's okay. You can snap on
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.000]   You gotta you gotta you gotta back up
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.360]   So it's it's like it's it's 60 bucks
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:13.640]   You can use it on like a multitude of plants. It's not like it's only tied in you need one of these for every single plant that you get
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.680]   Um, it'll even do it'll even do boring things like just act as a simple like moisture sensor
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:22.920]   It'll just like beep every time though the plant needs water and it's twitter though. Can it twitter
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.640]   I bet if I hook up to an Arduino, I can get it to twitter
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:30.200]   Wow, wow, the sun sure is bright says
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:35.560]   Boy am I thirsty. I sure hope Andy what every waters me soon
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.200]   As long as it doesn't say anything about spy master. I'm cool with that
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:41.000]   The easy bloom easy bloom calm
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.960]   for more information
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:49.960]   And my pick is I wasn't going to tell anybody about this till after the cruise because it's because it's actually
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.960]   Um
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:57.080]   What i'm using to make my presentations if you ever played with prezi p re z i dot com
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:03.560]   Uh, you know, we've looked we've got the best presentation software in the world available on the mag platform keynote is awesome
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:07.320]   But the problem is you know people have seen them and uh, you kind of want to wow
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:12.600]   So i've been working on prezi now prezi has a couple of nice features. It is an adobe air application
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:17.000]   You can download you can work online or on the web it works on max
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.640]   Windows even works on linux uses flash and creates presentations
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:31.160]   That don't look like anything you've ever seen this is uh, this is i'm working right now on my uh, my 60 iphone apps in 60 minutes
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:35.320]   Uh, so the cool thing about it is, um, you kind of
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:43.000]   Draw these these these things in your presentation and it it can zoom out and move around through a space
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:50.920]   Uh, it's hard. Are you programming that? No, it's already programmed in it's very easy to tell it what order to go in
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:58.360]   It has limited presentation features. So i should and by the way, it's live so I can scroll out and on the uh on the full
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.880]   Size of the presentation if I can scroll out quite a ways or zoom in
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.040]   um
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:05.480]   so
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.960]   It allows you to do something. I think this kind of unique
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.840]   uh in that um
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:14.280]   It's a presentation, but it but it looks very different. So we zoom in
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:17.000]   To the numbers and I can show you
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.400]   It's possible for me to describe you've got it. You've got to take a look at that's really cool. P-r-e-z-i
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:27.240]   Now of course if everybody starts to use it it will lose all of its value
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:33.160]   Because then everybody go. Oh, there's another I can't take another prezi presentation, but that's why I wasn't gonna tell anybody
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.200]   So don't tell anybody
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.800]   But you're close enough to the trip
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.280]   I'm close enough to the trip now that I can I can show you this
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.200]   I mean it is a it's a very slick thing
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:47.240]   But also has the advantage that in the middle of the presentation you can zoom out you can start writing
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:51.800]   It's live. It's so it's always available to you at any time
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:55.080]   Um, you know, I can go back into it and I can add some text
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:20:00.680]   Oh, I just realized I can't really realize what your your presentation is all built around those numbers. Holy smokes
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:02.680]   That's cool. Well, I'm doing
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:08.120]   Also looks like the opening titles. It's like a solid bass opening credit sequence. Yes, there there's that's a good analogy
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:13.640]   These guys are the Hungarian programmers. It's a very interesting
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:19.400]   Company and I think that they have some some really neat technology in in this because it's all flash based
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:25.400]   It's all flash based, but you don't have to know anything about flash which which makes it I think a lot more interesting
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:30.360]   The controller the whole prezi thing is built around this kind of funny little controller
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:36.520]   Which allows you to scale anything up or down and then allows you to rotate it and place it
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:40.440]   So you have absolute control over what you're doing. This is absolutely free
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.000]   Although I paid for the pro account, which gives me
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:48.840]   Uh the chance to to have larger presentations and so forth and uh, so
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:53.560]   You can really zoom in or zoom out. How much is it? It's free
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:21:00.200]   But the pro account. Oh the pro account. I know it's like 30 bucks. It's not it's this is this is this is in that kind of freemium
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.880]   Space right, so I've just created a note on it
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:07.480]   But I go right back into my presentation when I press the next button and continue on
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:14.680]   Uh with it in order and you you order your presentation basically drawing a line from point to point it rotates automatically
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:18.920]   It's hard to describe. This is a very visual product for those of you listening
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:21.880]   You should just go to pr easy I dot com. They have some
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:25.960]   Excellent presentations on there to kind of explain how it works
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:30.440]   If you look in there learn tab and they also have the showcase
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:37.480]   Um, prezi is very very intriguing and uh, it doesn't work if you have java script and java turned off though
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:42.600]   Java, you don't need you probably do need java script. Although it is like I said it is flash
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:47.640]   So, um, you can download it and they have an adobe air application that will let you run
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:54.760]   The presentation in fact once if you pay for the pro account, you can even download a standalone version of the presentations
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.400]   So that you can um
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:01.640]   Uh send it to somebody and they don't need prezi it includes a player and everything that they need max
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:05.480]   That was gonna be my next question if these people went out of business and you were hosted on their side
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:12.120]   Yeah, you can download it. It has an air application that you can design in so once you have the air application you can do anything you want
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:15.480]   Um, but then it also has a um
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:21.480]   Uh kind of a standalone bundle app that you can save stuff as and I think that does require the pro account
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:25.880]   So it's another way to do a slideshow that is very different and uh, you know
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:30.440]   I'm playing with it and having a lot of fun. I'll put the prezi presentation you can embed it also
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.920]   So I'll embed the prezi presentation in my blog
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:36.760]   Uh after we come back from the cruise. I'm doing four speeches
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:42.200]   I'm running running out of time. I only have a month left. Andy are you done? Are you ready for the trip because
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:46.840]   Uh, I'm done with the i'm doing like a big
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:52.920]   It's like a 43 hour talk about networking and uh, that's the only big one that's not done yet
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:57.080]   I've got like half of it done and the only way to do it is to break it up into okay
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:03.320]   I'm gonna talk 10 minutes about printing sharing now. I'm gonna talk for 12 minutes on router. Oh god
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:09.400]   I mean, it's again assuming that the people's republic of China decides to let me into the right you journalist you
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:12.920]   So, uh, yeah, I'm doing 60 iPhones and 60 minutes
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:17.240]   That was the app the presentation I showed so I built it around a clock and it goes through the minutes of the clock
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.960]   I'm also doing 60 freeware apps in 60 minutes
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:23.480]   And then uh one on using social media twitter and so forth
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:27.560]   And uh one on home theater and i'm not even close to done with any of them
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.200]   But i've got a great presentation program
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:33.880]   So i'm ready for that. It looks nifty. It's really cool
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:41.400]   I I was gonna keep it a secret for a while because uh, this is another presentation I gave to my daughter's school about education
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:48.120]   Hg Wells said human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:56.840]   Uh, so it's really fun. You can really you can really have a lot of fun. Keep keep your keep your audience entertained
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:01.160]   It goes full screen. So, uh, you know, you know, you don't they don't have to know that you're using a web app
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:05.720]   This is really I mean i'm telling you the cloud apps are just really really taking off
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.400]   That's crazy
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:11.960]   Prezi pr easy I now i'm not going to put you on the spot jerry because you weren't even supposed to be on the show
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:15.080]   You just kind of came in to say hi. So unless you have a mac pic
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:20.280]   I won't make you say anything. Well, I have one mac in my place and it has one thing hooked to it
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:23.000]   So what's that a giant etch a sketch?
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.400]   That you can control. Okay, that's my pick. What tell us about that?
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:35.800]   And so a few weeks ago I put together a giant etch a sketch out of a 52 inch tv that I'd ripped the dlp projector module out of
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:43.320]   And now we're in the process of using the macintosh which normally in our chat room does text to speech
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:47.960]   We're also going to allow you to control the motors on this 52 inch
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:52.120]   And the why you use a mac just because that's what you had lying around or was there some
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:25:00.680]   Uh one of our uh contributors. He's a big mac guy and so he took on the task of doing the text to speech for our chat room
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:02.440]   And so
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:06.440]   The natural thing that's that's cool. So this is this you can find out about this
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:13.480]   If you watch the podcast we do you talk about this on the show or do I think it is one of the the newer videos that's up
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:20.520]   That's awesome. Yeah, jerry is the host of a podcast called the fat man and circuit girl
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:23.400]   And i'll give you one guess as to which of those two
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:26.200]   She is obviously the fat man
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:34.440]   And fat man and circuit girl dot com it's a really very cool very interesting a video podcast highly recommended
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.240]   I get so the chat so your chat
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:40.440]   So when i'm working in my lab
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:47.240]   I leave the chat and all the cameras going very much like you do you're always streaming. Oh, that's great. Do you use a tricaster?
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:50.600]   I do of course you do and but you probably don't have time to switch
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:54.520]   I have a control surface right next to my soldering iron you do
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:26:01.080]   So I have cameras pointed at various parts of my workbench and people will come on to the chat and go jerry
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:03.160]   What are you doing in the text to speech?
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:08.840]   Well, we'll say that and i'll flip the camera so they can see what my latest gadget i'm working on is
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:14.040]   That's so cool. Yeah, eventually the cameras are going to be all switched through the same Macintosh
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:16.440]   So we used one of the ftdi
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:20.200]   USB to serial controllers gives you eight output
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:24.040]   Controls from the Macintosh to digitally control
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:27.480]   To the link you designed is it through the link
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:30.840]   To the link are you are you controlling the cameras through the link?
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:37.000]   Eventually, okay that way. I don't have to touch the control surface at all. They can just follow me around as I
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.600]   That's cool. We just brought your site down. Everybody wants to go visit the video
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:46.760]   I can't get on the site. I was going to show people the site, but you'll just have to go there fatman in circuit girl.com
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.480]   How often does the show come out?
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:55.720]   Uh, we film once a week and we try to do two or three inventions each and we have contributors from all over the world that call in
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:59.240]   By skype very much like how you do here. That's awesome and
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:03.560]   Well, not it sounds a lot more intelligent than what we do here to be honest
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:07.320]   You think
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:11.080]   What was your first clue there leo, uh, you know
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:17.400]   Anyone that's listened to this show already knew that I had inventions their inventions involved
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:21.880]   I don't think we'll be involved we showed off our plants you showed off your your shriners hat
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:24.440]   See those were some of our big
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:29.160]   Sometimes our inventions are very lightweight because you know if you're busy doing other stuff every week
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:35.480]   You you get towards Friday. You're like, oh my god. What can I throw together? Well, give me an example of a recent invention. You're proud of
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:41.720]   Um, well the etch sketch was a lot of fun. That's very interesting. Yeah, that was it happened friday night
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:46.840]   I was looking at all the scraps sitting over in the corner. I'm like, well, I don't want to just throw it in the dumpster
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:52.200]   I mean it looks like a nice piece of plastic and someone in the chat room actually recommended this they said
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:56.840]   Why are you making it just sketch out of it? I'm like, oh, it's a brilliant idea. How do you shake it?
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:00.920]   We have to pick it up and it's giant takes two people
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:06.440]   Yeah, but our plan is to mount it from the ceiling and put a da sander on there so it'll vibrate
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:10.040]   And move the aluminum powder around via the web
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:16.440]   Wow, so you can so are people drawing on it now? I mean they do interesting things in the in the lab in the lab
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.360]   Yeah, eventually. Do you hope to have the yeah?
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.680]   Yeah, we'll have it up for a while. That's neat
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:27.080]   We had robots a few weeks ago with knives and you know every time I'd walk by them the people in chat room would turn the motors on the
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:33.080]   This little toy with a knife would swing out. Oh, that's a good idea. Give the chat room knives
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:37.720]   Don't get your hopes up chat room. It ain't happening here
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:42.920]   Fatman and circuit girl calm and uh, I guess uh
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:49.000]   Somebody's piping it through a coral so that you don't you don't get you're not down. That's great
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:56.040]   That is really great. Well, thank you for sitting through this, uh, or deal Jerry. I appreciate your being. Oh, it's wonderful. It was fun
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:04.200]   Scott bourn is of course the scott bourn available online at scott bourn calm what's what are besides giving away drobo's by the droves
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:11.400]   What's your latest? What are you doing these days? Well, we're we're running the aperture nature photography workshop contest
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:17.640]   I'm giving away four free trips to mount reneer workshop. That'll be uh, that contest is running this month and then i'm
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:24.440]   Speaking speaking at the smug mug event speaking at the smug mug event is hard to say in seanel
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:31.480]   June 22nd to lye 18th i'm leaving a photo walk in portland for scott kelby and his worldwide photo walk so i got stuff going on
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:32.920]   Wow, you're busy
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:34.840]   Can people come to that smug mug event?
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.440]   That's absolutely free
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:38.440]   That's at stupd tree in
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:44.280]   Seattle at the airport c-tack airport. So you just fly in go to the conference or information
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:51.080]   Uh, andy and aka we lost your video, but what are what are you up to these days besides the fantastic chicago suntimes
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.720]   And the celestial waste of bandwidth?
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:30:01.080]   Uh, well mostly cursing skype for co for killing my video and giving me absolutely no input to the application just because i open up the preferences
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:05.160]   Uh preferences. What are you doing with the preferences stay away from the references?
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:08.200]   I know just no human serviceable parts inside
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:13.400]   I'm i'm i'm like your basic geek i'm like your baby. I gotta mess with it
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.640]   I have to say no it's working right now
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.200]   So I bet there's a way that I can enhance it by causing it to fail and
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:20.760]   Well, what do you know skype always has that feature?
