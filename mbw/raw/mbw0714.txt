[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.000]   LastPass Studios.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.500]   Beautiful downtown Petaluma.
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.000]   I am quarantined in the studio.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   No one can come and go.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I am the only person here.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.500]   I wear my mask coming and going.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.800]   Although this mask is a little dangerous because I got a little
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.200]   over Zellis making this one.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.300]   It's cotton, silk, and then I put cotton batting in the middle
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.000]   of it.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.700]   And I almost passed out.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.500]   You cannot actually breathe in this mask.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.900]   But I feel safe and warm.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.500]   It's like a little quilt for your family.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.700]   That's one way of avoiding transmitting coronavirus.
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.500]   You can't get it that way.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.500]   That's Andy Ocov from WGBH Boston.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.500]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.000]   How are you?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.500]   We missed you last week.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.500]   Oh, I missed you guys too.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.500]   We're next getting a hank of me.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.000]   What we're doing is we have so many people now because Alex is
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.500]   back basically.
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.500]   So we have so many people with Lori, Alex, Renee, and you.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   And that's too many people to do a panel.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.500]   I have five people and nobody will get awarded an ed choice.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   So we're rotating the hosts through.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.500]   Andy had last week off.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.000]   Renee has this week off.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Next week, somebody else.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It's kind of like dancing with the stars.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   One of you will be gone.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   One will be eliminated.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   We'll be eliminated.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Alex is here.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Alex Lindsay from 090 Media.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And of course, those great office hours every morning, 6 AM Pacific.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.500]   Now, I just want to make it be fair.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.500]   6 AM is when we open the door.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.000]   But it really starts at 7 AM.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   For those of you who think that 6 AM is too early, 7 AM is okay.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   It's not that.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   It's not that.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I still got to do it.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.900]   I think the only way I want to get there is if I
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.900]   stay up all night.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.900]   I'm not going with that hour.
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.900]   Early mornings are fun.
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.900]   There's nobody bothering you.
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.900]   It's good time.
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.900]   Just the turkeys.
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.900]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.900]   Yeah.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.000]   And on my far left, the fabulous Lori Gill, managing editor at iMore, Apoholic on the
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Twitter.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Hi, Lori.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   That's me.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   How are you?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.240]   Did your hair color change since the last time we saw you?
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.240]   It fades.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.240]   It fades over time.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.900]   I've got the fades over time here.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.700]   So now what are you going to do?
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.700]   Because you noticed, by the way, I got a haircut.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.700]   How did that happen?
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.900]   I took my life in my hands.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.000]   We had my hairdresser came over.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.500]   She cut Michael's hair and my hair.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.100]   And she wore a mask.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.300]   I wore a mask, which wasn't, you know, you can't really wear a mask or you're getting
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.300]   your hair cut.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.140]   So it was mostly like me with my hands over my face like that.
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.900]   But it still felt kind of dangerous.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.620]   I don't know if I'll do that again.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.620]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.220]   Well, I can see why you needed it.
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.780]   But at the same time, it is hard, you know, because we don't know who's been where, for
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.980]   how long, who they got in touch with.
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.540]   Well, she's talking the whole time and she told me she started seeing clients and I thought,
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.620]   oh, I can't do this again.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.900]   But next time she just gives the manscaped clipper, just, right?
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.700]   I think you should have pulled her back into ponytail.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.700]   I think that would have been a good look for you.
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.100]   Oh, Lisa, we really know I've dead set against them.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.500]   I have no good with good reasons.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.580]   But there's I have owned like a pair of like barber style clippers, like for the cyburns
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.660]   for years.
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.500]   But because I only use them for the cyburns, the only the only gauge comb I have for it
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.500]   is like the number like the number three or the number four.
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.540]   So I had so I was able to give my give my hair a stay of execution.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.820]   Yeah, I say, well, gee, I can't I can't find any of the guide combs.
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.100]   I can't possibly give myself a haircut without the guide combs.
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.100]   And that but unfortunately now a replacement set of guide combs has arrived.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.660]   And so I'm confident enough to do it myself.
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.740]   Not so confident that I didn't decide to do it tomorrow after my last video podcast of
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.740]   the week.
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.540]   I'm threatening to shave my head.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.260]   You know, for a while I had my head shaved.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.580]   Well, I only want to do it because I want to put on a I want all these I'm trying to
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.100]   figure out what masks do I really want to wear.
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.180]   I have a I just wrap my face usually, but I was like, I really need a good mask.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.340]   And I and I was looking at it.
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.900]   I kind of want the Bane mask, you know, from Batman.
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.900]   Yes.
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.900]   And the big over the head.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.540]   And I felt like once I got the mask, I should shave my head.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.140]   And then I just want to walk into the, you know, I want to walk into like Whole Foods
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.700]   and just walk up to someone with the mat with that big old Bane mask and go, are you
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.700]   looking for the banana?
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.700]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.900]   We're not here.
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.700]   I think that would be a great, a great reaction, you know, it's just a matter of time.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.700]   Just a matter of time.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.700]   I'm sure you could three deep print and just put some straps on it.
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.700]   You'd be set.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.700]   Yeah.
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.200]   Candice, we share a hairdresser asked about you.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.500]   And I said, now that I know I was, you know, here's the funny thing is last night I was
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.180]   like, I should find out if Candice is she is some way I can guess.
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.780]   But I want to get her.
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.980]   Jeff Jarvis's barber wears a standing tent with armholes in it.
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.940]   I want to get that for.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.940]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.860]   He's in the tent.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.940]   You know, it's clear on the front and his armholes and he's standing there clipping
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.220]   the hair.
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.860]   I think that's not a bad idea.
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.420]   That would actually, I think a better idea is to wear one of those inflatable T-Rex costumes
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.420]   and make it more fun.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.820]   But their arms are so short, they couldn't really.
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.820]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.820]   There's a whole segment.
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.060]   There's a whole segment in Meet Not A Pro.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.060]   Come on.
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.300]   There's a whole segment.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.860]   There's a whole segment and Meet The Robinson's about the T-Rex and length of its arms.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.580]   I think that you have to watch that first.
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.820]   I don't know if they even make standing one man tense.
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.020]   I don't know where he got it, but I just think it's a it's something.
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.180]   I think it has met suit.
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.140]   You know, you get a hazmat suit on Amazon.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.380]   I just want to say that.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.380]   Okay.
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.380]   Okay.
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.380]   That's a good idea.
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.380]   That would work, right?
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.380]   Let me just tie decks.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.020]   You know, you just get a tie decks one, tape it all up.
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.260]   I think it'd be good.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.460]   Can you really get them on Amazon?
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.460]   Oh, you can't.
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.460]   Yeah.
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.460]   See?
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.960]   Well, maybe all you really need is the air respirator hood.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.500]   That's all you really need.
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.500]   Right?
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.900]   Because it's nothing else.
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.900]   It's not coming out of your chest.
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.380]   I was surprised that if you get really serious, how expensive those can get there.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.660]   Like four or $5,000 for like the real ones that the sit over, I was like, oh man.
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.660]   Like the bunny.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:05.660]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.660]   Yeah.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.660]   That's cheap.
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.740]   Now do I want to get one with a hose?
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.780]   Is that go to an air tank?
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.220]   What exactly?
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.980]   Or maybe just a beekeeping outfit would be good.
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.540]   Ah, there's so many choices.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.700]   You know, isn't it interesting what we have to learn?
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.860]   This is only $22.
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:32.300]   I mean, how, you know, it's Tyvek polyethylene front, right?
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.300]   You could wear a mask underneath it.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.620]   Except for this mask, I don't know.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.540]   I'm going to buy it and we'll see.
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.540]   Right?
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.740]   They say I can have it by Thursday.
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.740]   Look at that.
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.300]   Even has fashion.
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.300]   This is necessary.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.100]   Everything else is slow.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.260]   This is essential.
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.500]   This is essential, man.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.900]   I'm ordering it right now.
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.900]   There we go.
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.900]   Place your order.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.900]   $25 later.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.020]   I own my own hazmat hat.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.500]   I think you just figured out how to get a haircut during the coin.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.300]   I can't wear it though.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.300]   She has to wear it.
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.300]   Right.
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.300]   But there you go.
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.300]   When she comes in there, I reply.
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.300]   Anybody can come over.
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.300]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.300]   Plot, right on you.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.580]   Actually, I tell you what I should be saving my pennies for.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.240]   This is the story of the week.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.660]   We talked a lot about it earlier on iOS today.
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:23.900]   On Sunday, Brianna Wu and Dwight Silverman and I and Mike Elgin talked about it, Mike
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.320]   was very excited about this.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:34.160]   This is a tweet from John Prosser who is of late become like the guy, the go-to guy
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.840]   for he had the iPhone SE down.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.520]   I mean, he knew everything about it.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.280]   Even the day it was going to be released, he knew everything.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.280]   Same with the MacBook Air.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:51.120]   I don't know where this guy came from, but he says he's a tech analyst and apparently
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.520]   he's got great sources.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:58.240]   Anyway, last a couple of days ago, Ming Chi Kuo, who's also a supply chain guy, said
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:04.480]   Apple glasses will launch 2022 at the earliest.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.680]   Prosser responds, "I can't believe I'm going against Kuo on this one, but I believe he's
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.680]   wrong."
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.200]   Apple glasses aimed for March, June 2021.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.360]   In other words, about a year from right now.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.600]   Also, and here's the whoa, I've seen them.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.240]   Their sleek as hell.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.600]   We'll be showing you soon.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.200]   Lori, you know, you're a big fan.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.720]   You're a real journalist.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.680]   What did you do with this?
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.440]   You obviously had to go with it, right?
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.880]   In fact, we had John on the "I'm Worshow" podcast right after the iPhone SE launched
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:46.680]   and he gave us a little bit of information about his contacts and stuff.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.680]   He's got people.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.680]   He knows people.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.680]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.840]   I didn't ask him the details because I don't want to get that deeply involved.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.840]   He can do his thing.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.480]   I don't want to get in trouble.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.080]   You feel he's well sourced.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.720]   He's definitely well sourced.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:07.880]   So with the Apple Glass, which he also put out a video today from his YouTube channel
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:14.840]   that goes into the details a little bit more, it comes with it, has the price and an idea
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.840]   of what it looks like.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.920]   So I think when he says, "I've seen them, they look sleek."
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.640]   I'm under the impression that it's still a prototype unit, so it's not the final build,
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:30.880]   but it's probably pretty close to what the final build will be.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.040]   And so, yeah, so he's got all this information.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.040]   I think what we're looking at here now is the Apple Glass, apparently, based on all
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.640]   of the leaks, not just John's, it's coming.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.480]   The Apple Glass is coming or Apple Glass is.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.960]   It's just a matter of when and what it will look like.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:53.280]   It sounds like the details are that it's going to require an iPhone, so it's not going
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:58.720]   to be standalone, but it'll be very similar to Apple Watch in that it gives the notifications
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.760]   similar to Apple Watch.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.840]   It'll be in your eyesight.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:08.880]   Apparently, there's going to be LiDARs, so you'll have the 3D scanning detection, but
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.200]   it won't have a camera, so it's not going to be able to film what's in front of you.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.520]   I think that's a good thing for privacy and protection.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.600]   Yeah, people with a smart choice for that.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:23.200]   Google Glass, who had the cameras got beat up because they were around Google Glass.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.960]   Yeah, and it just, exactly in that, I think that was a really smart choice on Apple's
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:35.800]   part, which is nobody's going to buy a pair of glasses that they know will make other
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.800]   people uncomfortable.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.800]   There'll be some people who will buy it, and then everybody will be uncomfortable and
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.800]   make them take them off, so it's the point.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.560]   Leaving a camera out of it entirely is a really smart idea.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:53.000]   It allows for them to stand on their privacy and security stance.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.600]   They can continue that, and at the same time, they're going to sell more units because there
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.240]   isn't a camera on the front of that thing.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.680]   It's not going to freak people out.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.680]   Alex?
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.400]   Oh, you're muted.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.880]   I have no idea.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.600]   I don't know how it's going to turn out.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:17.280]   So I think that AR, obviously, Apple is going down the AR path.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.080]   So a lot of new equipment in the morning up.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:27.040]   Yeah, all the things that Laurie just mentioned, like Lidar, it's kind of an Apple Watch-like
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.200]   accessory to the phone.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.880]   All of this stuff are the pieces of the puzzle Apple's been putting together earlier on August
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.880]   today.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.880]   Actually, I think it was Mike Elgin who said this, you know that Apple News plus now is
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.560]   doing audio versions of news stories.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.920]   All of that seems tailored because I left speakers in it.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.640]   It feels like it's all converging.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.640]   In other words.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:55.520]   Well, I think that what you're seeing is really rather than the move fast and break-thing approach,
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.920]   you're seeing building an ecosystem.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:02.680]   They're carefully building an ecosystem with USDZ, slowly with AR, slowly with Lidar.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.680]   You're seeing all the little bits and pieces to make.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.160]   You can tell that what AR is a big deal to Apple regardless of what platform it's going
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:15.040]   to be on because they're spending an enormous amount of effort really making sure that everybody
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.680]   has what they need to be successful.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.440]   I think that what we're not doing is, you know, I think that the problem that Google
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.920]   had is it jumped out with a, here's a technology and go play with it.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.640]   And no one, you know, there wasn't enough ecosystem.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.840]   There wasn't enough, you know, people able to do something useful with it.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:34.440]   And so I think that what we're seeing is everything being, you know, kind of guided towards that
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:39.160]   when you look at things like next VR being purchased last week or at least announced last
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.560]   week, you know, I think that largely was.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.280]   They did virtual reality events like concerts and sporting events, right?
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.280]   Stereo, Stereo 180 is primarily what they did.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.400]   And I don't think that the services, you know, are particularly interesting.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.400]   My guess is that there was probably a patent acquisition.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.800]   They had a lot of patents.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.480]   And so I think that that's kind of a CYA of, you know, if you're moving down that path,
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.280]   I don't even know if Apple's going to use any of those patents, but they don't want anything
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.520]   to cross over it.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.360]   And so for that, $100 million was probably a reasonable investment on Apple's part just
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.800]   to kind of close that up.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:16.560]   So, so I think that that, but you can definitely see kind of this slow movement with an enormous
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.120]   amount of weight, you know, going down that direction.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.160]   And that's really how, I mean, if you have the money and you have the time to be that
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.800]   patient, you know, to spend four or five years building up for something whenever, you know,
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.520]   and the phones are already able to do some pretty impressive things with it.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:37.040]   So it's a pretty, a pretty great, you know, way to kind of move it, to make sure that
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:42.040]   it's ready, you know, and that's why I think I'm excited about things like the USDZ, you
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.560]   know, stuff I think that this is going to be interesting.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.400]   Yeah, as I was used, go ahead.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.400]   Sorry.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.360]   All I was going to say is the one thing I wanted to say is the note about the audio
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.160]   to, you know, the books or the magazines being read to audio.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.120]   I can't believe this hasn't been done before.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   Like the economist does this.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.120]   And it's just amazing.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.800]   Like you just listen to the whole magazine.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.440]   The home economist is read every week and it is an amazing service.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.600]   And I have suggested it to almost every matter.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.160]   Like I'm like, I don't want to read these anymore.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.640]   Like, and I think all Apple really needs to do.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.160]   And I don't think that the, to get more people to do this, all they really have to do is
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:22.480]   be able to identify what part of the text is the body of the, of the article and what
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.560]   parts are the titles and the descriptions and everything else.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.160]   If you just tag that, you could let it, you could do, you know, text to speech and it
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.160]   would be fine.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.600]   I'm not great, but fine.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.960]   You could, and then you could cover everything.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.520]   If everyone just tagged it without a lot of work, without a lot of voiceovers, you could,
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.320]   you could get all of it really, really fast and probably people would probably pick up
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.800]   on it much faster because I think a lot of us want to, while we're cleaning or doing
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.560]   something else, we want to be able to listen to whatever articles we want to pick up.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.400]   I mean, I love, I wish, you know, foreign affairs was all in audio.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.280]   Because it's a lot to read, but it's really easy to listen to or it would be.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.000]   So anyway, so I think that, I think that's genius.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.480]   I think that economist has been doing it for years.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.520]   I'm always amazed that magazines haven't got on board with that just because a lot of us
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.160]   don't want to monotask.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:13.200]   Yeah, I, as usual, my stance on any Apple rumor in a matter how well sourced is that I believe
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.400]   it when Tim Cook is on stage demonstrating it.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.440]   Even then, I'm actually, I'm actually only believing it when there's an actual ship date
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.440]   for it.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:26.280]   You had to modify it ever since ever since the AirPods charging station.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:35.480]   But if we assume that all the stuff that he's talking about is true, the $499 price tag
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:43.200]   and the possible provision for prescription lenses makes me scale down expectations for
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.320]   what this earlier version will do.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:52.040]   His version of the rumor basically has, there's going to be a $499 thing called Apple Glass,
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.360]   or at least that's the name he put onto it.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:59.800]   And there's going to be a year after that, more of a conventional virtual reality sort
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.760]   of setup.
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:08.560]   My expectations for the first version, the more affordable version is not so much an augmented
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:15.760]   reality device as a head wearable version of Siri and Apple Watch.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:24.200]   I'm limited by my current understanding of the capabilities of the device that he's describing,
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   but I don't know of their retinal projection technologies that work.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:34.520]   Intel was very, very hot on trying to get manufacturers interested in a platform they
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.520]   called Vaunt.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:42.520]   So much so that they were actually allowing, I think the verge to actually let their people
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.640]   try them out and actually get pictures taken with them.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:52.120]   The difference between being able to get a notification or interact with an app or get
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:57.320]   information from Siri without having to even look at your watch is one thing.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:03.840]   The ability to actually place an augmented reality object or even just a flat screen
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:09.720]   tacked onto the wall in your field of vision and have it update frequently enough that
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:15.960]   you don't want to vomit and also give yourself a wide enough field of view that it's actually
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.360]   useful.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.040]   That's a really, really big leap.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:25.280]   And right now, for the sort of, again, I'm limiting myself by saying to the sort of information,
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.760]   to the sort of data that is being provided in this rumor, I don't understand how they
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:35.240]   could make an immersive device or an augmented, what we would consider an augmented reality
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:39.760]   device that works within those frames, so to speak.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:44.760]   Yeah, I mean, who knows if that price is right, but you're right, that would be very limiting.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.240]   They don't mention battery life, he does say, Prosser does say that they would be wireless
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:54.160]   charging, you put them upside down on your bedside table and they charge for the next
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.760]   day.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.200]   This is from the YouTube video you were talking about, which only has 82,000 views, which
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.320]   surprises me at this point.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.720]   Front page tech on YouTube displays in both lenses.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:13.080]   The UI is called Starbird, which makes sense because Springboard is the name of the UI on
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.080]   the iOS devices, controlled via gestures on and in front of the device.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.480]   So yeah, Laurie, it doesn't have a camera you could take pictures with, but that lidar
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:26.160]   means it could look at your fingers and know what you're doing, could see your gestures.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.400]   He says it will scan proprietary Apple QR code.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.200]   So there's enough of a camera that it could read some sort of code.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.440]   And that makes sense because you could put that on objects in stores.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:43.400]   Apple probably could sell that to the gap and other stores and museums and so forth.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.760]   No sunglasses currently.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.080]   Displays won't work on tinted lenses.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.880]   I don't care about that so much prescription glasses though would be a big deal for me.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.400]   Three of the four people on the panel are wearing spectacles.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.160]   So having that capability.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.320]   I think that one of the big things with Google Glass that was really a problem when I had
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:04.800]   it was that it didn't come out immediately with an easy way to have prescription.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.760]   And it was trying to put it on top was really uncomfortable.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.400]   So if you didn't have it and I think that that's also been a problem for Oculus to be
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:17.640]   honest because the gear had a little diopter that you could move and bring everything into
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.120]   focus if you took your glasses off.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.160]   And for whatever reason Oculus didn't do that.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.880]   And I realized that's why I stopped using it.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.680]   I just got tired of bending my glasses in there.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.960]   And it was just literally, I loved, there was a whole bunch of stuff that Oculus that
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.960]   I love.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.520]   And I just literally got tired of trying to get my glasses at the right angle underneath
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.520]   the player.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.480]   And I didn't want to go, you know, then they'll, okay, we'll buy it.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.680]   Well, there's a whole family that doesn't need that already in there.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.120]   I don't want to buy lenses for it.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.000]   And I don't want to, you know, I want it to all I know.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.280]   And the problem is because I had a gear, I knew that all they had to do is put that
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.400]   little dial on the top.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.280]   So I think it just really frustrated me.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.840]   And I think that, you know, there's an awful lot of people who do what we do that wear
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.840]   glasses.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.680]   And I think that was a huge oversight for Oculus that probably cut, I think it cut it dramatically.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.680]   Here, of course, with glasses not wearing a plate.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:08.200]   Another rumor from Cesar Berardini, this is what the Apple QR codes will look like.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.440]   And I think that that, I mean, clearly, if you're using LIDAR to look at them and Alex,
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.000]   you'd know better than I am.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.880]   You know, you have a camera in LIDAR, but it's, but it's looking at infrared light, right?
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.520]   I don't, yeah, I don't know if the, yeah, the LIDAR isn't the, you know, I think that
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.080]   there's a couple different sensors there.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.280]   I think the LIDAR is time of flight.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.400]   So I don't, I don't think that that's saying able to read a QR.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.720]   I think it's looking at distances, but, but it could have other, there's apparently there's
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.720]   a lot of sensors.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.880]   So, you know, there's a lot of, there's a lot of options.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.840]   And I think it's smart not to have a camera.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.280]   I don't need a camera on my glasses.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.840]   I have my phone for that.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:50.120]   And remember when the Apple watch came out, I think I certainly felt, and I bet you a
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.160]   few of you guys also felt this is kind of like an add-on.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.560]   It's not a compelling device.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.520]   And as Micah pointed out earlier today, you know, five years later, I won't leave home
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.520]   without it.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.000]   I'll turn around and put it on.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.800]   And I think that we'd see the same thing I would expect with, with spectacles.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.320]   I think, I think Apple, go ahead.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.240]   You know, you get rid of, you get rid of a good?
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.680]   No, Alex, finish then, Andy.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.480]   So, so the, I think that you get away from the issues that you had that Google had with
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.440]   the Google Glass by having, by taking away the camera.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:28.240]   I think it's unfortunate because the Google Glass as a training tool was unbelievable.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.880]   You know, like it was, you know, and it's still unbelievable inside of enterprise, you know,
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.120]   but because you put something on, it's your point of view.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.520]   You have someone else with their point of view.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.240]   If you want to show them how to do something or if you want to just record how to do it,
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.800]   you can see what you're framing, you know, inside of it.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.000]   And it did it really, really well.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.480]   And I still haven't found another solution that does it as well as Google Glass did.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:54.040]   And so, so it's kind of a, it'll be a bummer not to have a camera in there, but, you know,
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.880]   I understand why they might.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:01.880]   It takes away that outer issue that Google exposed by, by having the camera there.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.560]   But it's really, and some of the shots that I shot with my kids, when I, you know, swinging
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:10.320]   them around or in the park or whatever from glass was pretty nifty, you know.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.920]   And so it's a different, it's a different point of view than your camera.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:23.320]   Yeah, well, it was, it's, it's a, it's a really good, really good point made for regarding
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.680]   comparing this to Apple Watch.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.920]   Because even Apple didn't know what they had or what people were going to be using it
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.920]   for.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.640]   They needed at least a year or two's worth of user data for users to guide them on disabled.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.640]   Here's the hard word.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.840]   Please tell us what the, what the hell this is good for.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:43.480]   And we will find, we will encourage developers to make it even better at that thing.
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:48.600]   And this is, this is, if again, assuming that all of these rumors are true, it's this would
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:57.800]   be an Apple device with very little precedent where Apple is breaking ground with a brand
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:03.240]   new product, the viability of which has not been established by a competitor yet.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.920]   They've, they, they're, they're, the iPhone was somewhat of it.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.120]   I mean, I understand what you're saying.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.840]   Usually Apple takes an existing category and makes it better.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.040]   You, there was nothing like the iPhone and the iPhone.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.080]   Well, you're talking, remember that the, one of the money quotes from all the interviews
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.720]   with the engineers before that was that one of the bases of, of our design for the iPhone
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.720]   was basically keep paying attention to everything that we hated about the smartphone that we
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.040]   already had in our pockets and what we do to make it even better.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.280]   How about the iPad?
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.240]   Was that Sui generous?
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:38.400]   I, I have always held, and this is just my opinion, that they were, Apple was a lot more
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:44.080]   affected by influenced by, by netbooks than anybody will, will admit.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.560]   This is what they say.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.640]   I think that netbooks really illustrated to people that God, there is anybody who is
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:55.760]   an engineer, anybody who has an Apple, anybody who has taste, let's say, let's say, my God,
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.960]   these are like cheaply built.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.120]   They're small.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.920]   The screens are not great.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.280]   They're so underpowered.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.120]   Their battery life is not great.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.360]   And yet we can't keep them on the shelves.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:11.520]   What is it about these really inexpensive computers that are making them compelling to people?
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.800]   I don't think, I don't think it's quite as direct.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.440]   But what I'm, what I'm getting at is that Apple is, Apple is now going to be burdened
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:23.560]   with trying to explain to people why these things on your face are going to be important.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.520]   Even when Google did Google Glass, they were very, very loudly saying we are not doing
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.080]   this as a real product.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.840]   We are doing this as an experiment.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.080]   We have, there is a waiting list for it, not because the demand is so high, but because
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:39.840]   we are not manufacturing them at the scale that would be required for a regular consumer
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.040]   for a consumer product.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.320]   And one of the things they learned, of course, is that the camera freaks people out.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.080]   This is one of the few things that I think everybody benefits from when they're trying
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.400]   to manufacture these things.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.520]   So it's the, what's most fascinating to me about the idea of Apple doing any kind of
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.440]   augmented reality glasses is that they're not, they're not like, they're not like Intel
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.520]   or IBM or Microsoft.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:07.320]   Microsoft does HoloLens, but they were never, I think, targeting that.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.920]   They're always looking at that as something they could sell to enterprise as opposed to
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.800]   something that you would walk in, walk down the street and see lots of people wearing
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.800]   these.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:20.280]   Just like right now, it's hard not to see people wearing an Apple watch down the street.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.000]   Apple makes that kind of product where if they're making glasses, their intention in
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.440]   their marketing and their design of this product is that a year or two after we release it,
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.520]   you're not going to be able to walk down the street without seeing at least one person
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.880]   wearing these things.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:40.080]   So that really limits what that really creates a lot of expectations that can't be placed
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.520]   upon HoloLens or the enterprise version of Google Glass.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:50.640]   Like Alex said, Google Glass sells really, really well in enterprise because there are
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.160]   a few better ways to train people on how to do something than let me see what you see.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.160]   It's the remote access.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.800]   Let me get control of your computer so I can actually see what's happening when you try
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.600]   to click that thing.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.280]   And if Apple is trying to sell these as an Apple Store sort of item, they're not going
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:10.200]   to, they're not trying to sell tens of hundreds or hundreds of thousands of these.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.080]   They're trying to sell millions of these.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:18.600]   They will have to have figured out how to create a compelling feature set, either a compelling
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:25.400]   feature set that is immediately desirable, such as not just an evolution of Apple watch
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:29.600]   saying that here's something that you don't even have to, you don't have to go like this.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.240]   It will just simply quietly inform you of something so that you can dismiss it and then
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.240]   go away.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:39.240]   Even if the gesture controls are just on the temples of the lenses, just like the way that
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.160]   Google Glass work, that will be very, very interesting.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.280]   But if it's more like, it's fascinating to me if it were more like Apple Watch in the
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:51.520]   sense that we've developed the hardware and a platform that we think is going to work
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.200]   for the next, for the first generation of this product.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:29:00.240]   We are willing to spend the first year listening to see who is buying these above and beyond
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.200]   the people who will buy anything with the Apple logo on it because it's a very, very
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.160]   important style brand.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.080]   Tell us how you're using this.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:12.640]   Show us, let's look at all the message boards on complaints from developers on God.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.320]   If only this had this sort of sensor on it, we could be able to write this app for it and
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.000]   see how that fits into everything else.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.720]   So I think I said before, that's going to be lower tech than the VR glasses that are being
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   rumored.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.200]   But to me, it's far, far more interesting.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:33.320]   It's easy to sell a really expensive thing in low quantities to people who have a very
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.640]   narrow need.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.800]   It's a really, really big accomplishment when you sell something like the Apple Watch to
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:44.360]   pretty much everybody because it's something that people not only want, but also can use
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.360]   even if they don't necessarily need it.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.120]   Well, and I think one of the problems that you end up with with a lot of these things
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:54.680]   is with Google Glass and with Oculus.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.680]   You get into this thing where every time you put it on, half the stress is trying to teach
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.680]   someone how to use it.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.240]   It's got to get over that.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.440]   You've got to get to a point where it's just it works.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.440]   And I think that's where I think that's where we have to do it.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.080]   Google S is really good for training people and stuff like that.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.240]   Laurie, go ahead.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.240]   Exactly.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:16.640]   I think of the way they're described, the kind of options that they have, the price
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.760]   range that they have, they remind me of Fokles by North.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:27.480]   It's just a pair of glasses that look like glasses on your head that has a little projection,
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:32.040]   a projector right inside the side arm.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.960]   And that projects notifications for you.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.800]   It projects directions for you.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:45.000]   It lets you know when your car has arrived from Uber or you can actually access your
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.720]   music information.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:52.400]   Now with the Fokles, there's a ring that you are in your finger that has a joystick
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:57.880]   and that's how you navigate your notifications, which I don't think Apple would do anything
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.520]   like that because that's not a good user experience.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.160]   Nobody wants to walk around with a ring with a joystick on their finger.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:08.560]   So this would be something that Apple would need to solve for, which is what I believe
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:17.760]   the idea of gesture-based movements and not need it using LIDAR to check on that.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.800]   So you don't have to wear a ring on your finger, but you could actually maybe just tap the
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:26.960]   air and that the LIDAR somehow recognizes that you're tapping on something or swiping,
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:27.960]   maybe.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:35.120]   But it doesn't seem unusual that Apple would make a $500 pair of notifications only, basically,
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.520]   type pair of glasses, which is very similar to what the Apple Watch was when it first
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.520]   launched.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:46.360]   The Apple Watch, it morphed into being this very health-centric device.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.680]   What will AR glasses by Apple morph into eventually?
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:56.040]   I just like what Andy is saying, AR is just not ubiquitous enough in our daily lives for
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.560]   us to know what we would use these glasses for.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:05.400]   It's going to happen when we have them on our faces and we start using them.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:12.200]   I think though when Apple first launched the Apple Watch, it was sort of a hot mess that
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.400]   nobody wanted because nobody really knew what it was for.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.640]   But it was all of the people that wore them on their wrists that help Apple determine
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:24.760]   five years later what it really is good for and what people want to use it for.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:32.080]   I think that could happen the same way with Apple glasses that the first iteration of
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.840]   it, it's just going to be a bunch of Apple fans that are going to wear them on their
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.640]   face because it's the newest thing.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.920]   Then five years later, we're really going to know not just what Apple glasses are good
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.760]   for, but what AR is good for.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.120]   At that point, it'll be ubiquitous enough not just because of what Apple does, but just
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.120]   the world.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.080]   They're trying to make AR right now.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.960]   They're trying to figure out how it fits into the world.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:58.520]   So five years from now, that will look like something and then by then we will all be
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:03.400]   really familiar with Apple glasses and it won't be a new thing for us to work on.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.440]   I would stipulate that there's no guarantee it's going to work.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.160]   I'm sure Apple knows that too.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.280]   There's no guarantee that this is going to take off, that it's going to be the next big
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.440]   thing.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:18.520]   But there's pressure on Apple to come up with an iPhone successor.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:22.760]   Everybody who wants an iPhone has an iPhone, that market has stopped growing.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.240]   They're going to grow services.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.480]   They need the next thing.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:31.240]   They also, I think, are uniquely positioned.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:36.520]   These north folkles, they had to use the ring because they didn't have LiDAR.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.920]   Apple has over the last 10 years.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.440]   By the way, Tim Cook has made no bones about it.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:49.720]   Apple has been slowly building up these skills, these technologies to make something like this.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:55.120]   To me, Prosser's post is completely credible in the sense that, of course, Apple's working
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.840]   on this.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.920]   It's not too hard for us to imagine what it might look like.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:05.200]   That price point seems surprisingly low, especially for an Apple product.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.360]   Then I get the iPad also was shockingly low when it was introduced.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.360]   That's right.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.360]   It could.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.360]   It could.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.360]   But I think people would pay more.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:16.120]   They pay a thousand dollars and more for the iPhone right now.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:20.440]   My prescription glasses cost five or six hundred bucks alone and they don't do nothing except
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:24.640]   make it possible for me to see.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.640]   There's other questions.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.640]   There's a lot of them.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.400]   It's a battery life going to be good enough that I could put them on in the morning as
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.800]   I do my glasses and wear them all day and then put them down at night.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.800]   Probably not.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.360]   I can't imagine it'll be that good, but who knows?
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.240]   There's, A, I feel like Apple's well positioned.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.680]   They have the means.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.960]   They have the motive for sure, right?
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.760]   They need the next big thing.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.600]   What is the third thing if you commit a murder?
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.240]   Means motive and opportunity.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.040]   Well, they got the opportunity too, right?
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.320]   There's one of the few companies in the world with the capabilities and the skills that Apple
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.480]   has to pull something like this off.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.560]   They have been acquiring all the people to do it.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:07.080]   So I find this very credible, very exciting, but as I said at the beginning, it's completely
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.080]   possible.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.080]   It'll be a flop.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.480]   Magic Leap to a lot of people looked like it was going to be amazing.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.600]   Enough people, they raised billions of dollars and at this point it looks like it isn't going
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.760]   to happen.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:24.360]   They've already pivoted to Enterprise and they fired I think half their staff.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:28.240]   And I think the hard thing too, but I think Apple's going to always aim high and they're
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.880]   going to, and you're right, Andy, this isn't like anything else they've done and there
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.040]   isn't really, there's hollow lens, there's focus.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.560]   There aren't very many examples of anybody doing anything like this magic leap, but I
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.840]   think this is the next thing for Apple.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:42.840]   I'm pretty sure it is.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.840]   Yes, go ahead.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.880]   And I think that a big part of the success is going to be content.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.920]   That you have things that drive people that, oh my goodness, I have to actually have.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.960]   Well, that's where the ears come in.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.760]   The AirPods and the AirPods Pro aren't an accident.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.200]   They are, as we've said many times, an intermediate step towards an augmented reality device.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:05.080]   That's why you record audio for Apple News Plus so people can wear their glasses and
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.960]   hear stuff, right?
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.840]   And I think also though, I mean, if you look at all the data gathering, I mean, the thing
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:17.120]   is that being able to, there are so many heads up things, whether it's a museum or a historical
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:22.360]   site or just the nature that you're out there, that there are so many things that you want
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.200]   to identify and look at.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:28.280]   And I think that that's going to be, and it's the only reason, yeah, so with your phone,
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.640]   I think if there aren't, if there isn't a camera with your phone, you'll actually be
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.680]   able to do more in some ways.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:42.120]   But I think that there is so many places where, what if I'm walking through a location, I
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:47.600]   pick up the phone, we'll just keep it with the phone for now and just get all this extra
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.840]   information and get all the other things that I could do there.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.880]   But you have to create that and that takes a lot of time and effort.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.880]   But they're doing it right now, aren't they?
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.760]   I mean, that's the kind of thing that's happening right now in Apple Maps.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.240]   Maybe, you know, but, oh, Apple Maps, sure, but I mean, I'm talking about real experiences
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.320]   that have people go, oh my goodness, I have this.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.320]   Google has.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:10.520]   But showed something like that at the last Google I/O where you'd hold up, you're on
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.000]   a street, you'd hold up and you'd be able to see each store and what it had to offer.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Right.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.160]   Non-examples, I'm talking about things that actually work.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:21.040]   You know, like, you know, they actually have to, you know, this is the mistake that Apple
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:27.080]   made with iBooks is that they created horrible examples, you know, like they worked with
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.040]   companies to create horrible examples of what the product was.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.160]   And so no one saw that that was going to be useful.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:38.680]   If Apple had shown that you could basically transcend the way we think of books by, you
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.480]   know, augmented media and all the other bits and pieces, when I opened up elements, I
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.920]   don't know if you've seen elements on the iPad, but when I opened up elements on the
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.560]   iPad, I felt like I was looking into the future of books.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.880]   But they had to build that all in code.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.760]   They couldn't build that in iBooks, you know, and so it was too heavy and too hard
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.160]   and everything else.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.480]   And so number one of the tools have to be there.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:03.000]   And I think that, you know, I think that USDZ is a big piece of that.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.200]   But I think that the, that they really have to, if they want this to take off, they're
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:11.640]   going to have to move, you know, help companies who are working on this accelerate.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:17.000]   I think what you're seeing, like, for instance, what Epic's doing for Unreal is, is the kind
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.360]   of thing that Apple needs to do.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:23.080]   Epic has a hundred million dollar fund where you could just apply and get money.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.080]   No investment.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.640]   Like, you know, and if you don't, and if you fail, you don't have it if you fail, they
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.640]   go, oh, that's too bad.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.640]   Apple could totally do that.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.640]   That's so bad.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.440]   It's not 200 billion dollars in the bank.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.440]   Exactly.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.800]   And the thing is, is that they should, they should take on something like what, what, what
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.520]   Epic's doing because Epic, it's genius because there's a whole bunch of us that were like,
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.640]   I don't know if I'm going to use Epic or Unity.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:47.000]   And as soon as Epic added the mega fund, we were like, and we're going to use Epic.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   You know, like, he's unreal.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.640]   Like, it was like, Unity dropped literally.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:54.680]   We were actually, Brianna walked us through the capabilities of Unreal 5 as they demoed
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   it.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.760]   Well, well, holy cow.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.040]   Does that look good?
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:04.960]   Well, in our, in our little office hour group, we're focusing pretty heavily on, on, on
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.960]   real after that.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.960]   You know, we were like, oh, it's really cool.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.720]   And now it's like, no, it's really, really cool.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.560]   And, and so, but Apple's going to have to do the same level of, of work that, that Epic's
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.000]   doing or more.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.400]   And create a fund that really gets people, you know, have it be applying and, because
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:23.160]   what it did is with, with Unreal, it gets you thinking about how you could use Unreal
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.160]   all the time.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.280]   Everybody thinks about it because I might be able to get $25,000 or $100,000 or $1,000
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.800]   million to go do something.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.000]   And so it's like the lottery.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.080]   Everyone, everyone starts playing in their head what's possible and you start percolating,
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:37.040]   not just a quiet, like, oh, we'll fund something, but really like a big fund that people know
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.040]   it's coming.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.280]   I think we'd make a big difference in, in making this work.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.440]   And if they had done that for books, I don't think we'd be, I don't think we'd be worried
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.280]   about whether we can just listen to the books because the books would be interactive and
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.280]   they'd be interesting.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:49.680]   And all those things, if Apple had done the same thing, you know, 10 years ago.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:56.600]   I've been going through some, some thought over the past couple of days over this.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.280]   One of the things that I was kind of, that I thought might limit what this thing does
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.560]   is if it really is relying on the iPhone to do a lot of processing, what will that do
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.160]   to the, to the battery life of the iPhone?
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:12.160]   And then I double check and realize that, okay, well, this gets at least 10 hours of
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.800]   battery life watching a movie over Wi-Fi.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.160]   So okay, maybe not quite so much.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:21.840]   But I really think that even if we set our sights a little bit low, this could be a really,
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.680]   really cool product.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:28.560]   I did get, I did, I do own Google Glass.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:33.000]   I liked it a lot within the context of what it was meant to do, meaning just let's put
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.840]   this out there and see what happens.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:40.960]   And by far, I was, by far, the most exciting thing about it was, when Evernote decided
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:46.520]   to create Google Glass integration because it meant that the times and the places where
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:51.640]   I have ideas or when I solve problems are really when I'm taking my like two or three
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:56.560]   mile daily constitutional and something just suddenly clicks and the ability to simply
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:02.400]   either say a hot word or just tap the temples and say, take a note, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.400]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.960]   And I see it being being being transcribed accurately out of the corner of my eye and
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.680]   then yes, save that and send me a copy via email.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.280]   That even is even if we go slightly, only slightly beyond notifications, that could
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.920]   be a very, very big deal.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:28.640]   And this is also a big opportunity for Apple to take Siri out of the corner and put baby
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:35.000]   up on the stage where she belongs because the ability to simply interact with a smart
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.960]   assistant but have that smart assistant be following along with you and interacting with
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:43.680]   you in a much more direct way than simply this disembodied voice.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:48.480]   To have it be able to show you actual information that you're asking for, again, not necessarily
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.480]   as, well, that's okay.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:56.320]   I've got the Fox Trickster clown who's walking ahead of you and it's going to pointing to
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.600]   where the ice cream places.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.680]   Just the ability to say here is where you are, here's where the map is, here's where
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.000]   you need to go.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.760]   It doesn't have to be augmented reality.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.080]   It can just simply be notifications.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:15.680]   If it's just the ability, my expectations are that essentially for the consumer version,
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.880]   the inexpensive version are low key but potentially very useful.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:27.840]   The idea of having a 24 inch screen that is sort of in the middle of your 24 inch display
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:31.760]   that's sort of in the middle of your field of view, mostly blank all the time.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:35.240]   So we're not talking about there's things that are going on in your peripheral vision.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:39.840]   I'm talking about just like on the Microsoft products, you can't have things your peripheral
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.840]   vision.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.920]   It's only a display that's sort of a virtual display that's sort of in front of you.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:48.880]   But the ability for it to cast information in there when you ask for it or give you a
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:54.400]   predictive notification when you've told it that you actually need that sort of stuff.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:43:02.360]   This is why a collaboration between, if this, I'm glad, I have to say that if I have to
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:07.920]   pick one collaboration between Google and Apple, okay, a tool for solving a pandemic
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.240]   crisis that could shut down the entire planet.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.080]   I'm glad they went with that.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:17.920]   However, number two or number three on the list could be Apple create the software, the
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:23.200]   hardware and the platform for a wearable, but have Google provide the services because
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:28.760]   the ability of Google to intelligently figure that the reason why I use Google Assistant
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.280]   above all others is because it is by far the most useful.
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.680]   Both on my phone and both in the air.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:39.840]   And so if Apple could find a way to get Apple Maps to give me more useful information, if
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:47.040]   a way for a Siri to glean more context out of my current circumstances and also the data
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:52.320]   that it's already aware of with me, that could make this a super compelling product.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:57.200]   The bottom line is it has to be good enough to convince someone who does not need glasses
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.480]   to put on glasses that they don't know that they don't need and to change the way that
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.480]   their face looks.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:07.220]   I mean, we, the people in this battle, we wear them because it's nice to be able to
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:12.320]   read a sign, like a traffic sign when we're driving from an extra five seconds away than
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.880]   no left turn.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:20.160]   It's quite another thing to convince someone to please make this addition to your face.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.720]   And you're sorry, last thing though to your to Alex, excuse me, to Leo's point.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.360]   Yeah, it's going to be a big deal.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.360]   How long will it is it something where I can put it on at the beginning of the day and
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:33.600]   take it off the end of the day like an Apple Watch, or will it be more like AirPods where
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:39.600]   there'll be a rechargeable glasses case and at some, I'm expected to be wearing them when
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.080]   I think I'm going to be out and about needing them.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.600]   But then when I'm back at my office, I'm going to probably be putting them away and
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.920]   putting them in my glasses case so that they're ready for my commute home.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:54.200]   My big question is going to be what color will they come in?
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.680]   Will they only come in white?
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:56.680]   Pink.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:57.680]   Will they come in rose gold?
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:58.680]   Just for you.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:44:59.680]   Just for you.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.680]   I don't know.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.560]   That's a good question.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:07.560]   If I have to wear them on my face, like just like Andy said, I don't wear glasses other
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.120]   than reading glasses.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:13.400]   And so wearing something on my face all day long, that is a big deal.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.400]   That's a big deal.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:20.160]   Do I really want to put these things on my face and walk around even for a few hours?
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.840]   You know, the way I would with AirPods is that something I want to do.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:29.080]   If it gives me the right kind of information and notifications and they're comfortable
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:34.080]   and they don't look big and bulky, I think I would be willing to do it for a few hours.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.880]   It will be like the watch.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.320]   A lot of us have been in the watch as soon as we got a smartphone.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:45.480]   And I predict the first few years of Apple Glass will be like the watch.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.320]   Well, yeah, maybe okay.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.840]   I could leave home with that and not miss it.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.000]   It'll take a while for it.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.080]   I bet you in five years, everybody will wear them even if they don't wear glasses because
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.080]   you'll get so much value out of it.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.080]   I mean, how many people does it?
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:03.040]   Does he walk down the street looking at their phone the whole freaking time?
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.040]   Right.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.040]   Right.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.040]   And also I think that...
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.040]   Exactly.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:08.040]   They could look at their glasses.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.320]   And it has to just be really good at a couple of things because, you know, with my watch,
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.800]   you know, it's not that I'm excited about my watch, but I would never go back to a mechanical
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:15.800]   one.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.080]   You know, like it's a different thing.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.560]   Like I don't have...
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.720]   You know, I'm not excited.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:24.480]   I think it's a utility, but if I can't give up the timer, that's the number one thing I
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.240]   use on my watch is the timer.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.680]   I've turned off all the notifications.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.200]   I don't like it buzzing.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.200]   I like the timer.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.240]   I like sometimes an alarm.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:37.160]   I like, you know, a handful of little things that are there and all the data that I can...
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:41.360]   And the fact that I can change the watch face, I wish I could design the watch face, not that
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.080]   I'm good at it.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:48.520]   But without short of that, the fact that I can actually customize it to what I need and
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.960]   have some simple things related to that, like the timer, whether I'm working out or I'm
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:56.760]   cooking or I'm making tea or doing whatever, I use it a lot.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:00.760]   And doing it with a regular watch is a kind of a non-starter.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.240]   I think it gets back to the Apple...
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.240]   The...
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:06.240]   The...
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.240]   The...
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:11.040]   The Apple watch kind of might inform these wearables that I think one of the most critical and
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:15.160]   most brilliant things that Apple did and designed the watch was they started off by saying,
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:19.200]   "Let's design a really cool watch that if this were a mechanical watch that simply had
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:24.080]   a movement inside it, it would still be cool enough that people would want to have it."
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:29.600]   And plus the system of replaceable bands, this would be a cool watch.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.760]   And people are willing to wear it just simply as a watch.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.680]   I think that it's going to be interesting to see if they come up with a pair of glasses.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.520]   Glasses are really, really weird.
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.520]   If you...
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.400]   There are very few of us are out in John.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:47.160]   We want the glasses to sort of like complement our features, complement it.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:51.200]   But otherwise, like be something where you will note that I have glasses, but you don't
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.440]   really know, "Well, are these tortoise shell?
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.440]   Are they brown?
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.320]   Are they black?"
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   They have to...
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:59.520]   The first step is to make a cool pair of glasses.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:05.600]   And for whatever reason, it's kind of interesting that if Apple...
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:10.360]   If part of the rumor is that there's going to be an option for prescription lenses, I
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.880]   wouldn't be surprised if part of the argument inside Apple was, "No, no, we have to make
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:18.280]   absolutely sure that on day one, these are just standard frames that any optician can
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.880]   fill with lenses because the first people on board, after the people who will buy anything
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:27.280]   with our logo on it, are people who wear glasses all the time anyway.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.920]   If we can do what we did with the watch, where people are wearing a watch, wear this watch,
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.480]   it will do the exact same thing as it did before, but as time goes by, it will do even
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.480]   more.
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:40.040]   If we can say, "We have these cool Apple-designed designer frames that will take your prescription
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:44.800]   and if you do nothing with them and when they're not even charged, they will still be really,
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.640]   really cool Apple-designed eyeglasses."
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:52.240]   However, on day one, it will show you the time in the upper corner and a year from now,
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:56.440]   it will let you get your email read to you by a bouncing dinosaur.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.880]   Well, we'll see.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:03.000]   I mean, look, it's just a rumor, although well-founded.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.720]   As you say, Laurie, John seems to have good sources, at least recently.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.280]   He's sticking his neck out way out.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.960]   He is sticking it as far out as I've ever seen it.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:16.840]   By the way, his most recent tweets say that Apple is not too happy with him.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.640]   Well, yeah.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:23.280]   More likely, not too happy with the person that showed it to him who was not supposed
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.280]   to show it to him.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.680]   Yeah, this could be a self-serving tweet too.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:30.520]   I mean, if I'm a tipster, I would tweet that anyway.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:31.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.520]   But he says that a lot.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:39.280]   Okay, guys, worked on that for the last couple of months, going to go crawling a hole for
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.280]   now too much anxiety.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.280]   I mean, it is the case.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:46.760]   I mean, I don't do tips, but if you take tips, I would imagine you feel a certain amount
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:49.880]   of responsibility for the person who gave you the leak.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:54.840]   And knowing Apple, that person's job is at risk very much so.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:02.120]   In fact, John had mentioned when he shared that picture of the air power that's not
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.120]   air power anymore.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:07.280]   A lot of people were complaining about the quality of the image was really bad.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.320]   Like, I think Renee might have even mentioned that it looks like it was taken through a
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.320]   potato.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:17.280]   He does that stuff on purpose, which he tries really hard to make sure he protects his
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.280]   sources.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.640]   So he does things like completely degrades an image and it doesn't matter to him if you
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:25.960]   don't believe him because the image is degraded.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.280]   It's more important him to protect the source, you know?
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.480]   So he's got that balance there.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.400]   Did he say he never lost anybody?
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.640]   Has he ever lost a source?
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.640]   Like to the image?
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.640]   He didn't mention.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.640]   No.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.640]   Okay.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:41.480]   Suddenly, somebody's just not there anymore.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.600]   It's a tough dance.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:48.880]   I have been entrusted with certain information from time to time that I've chosen not to
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:56.520]   disclose chiefly because the stream of information is a lot better than any one time possible
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:00.480]   scoop about something that Apple is planning to do two years from now that they might decide
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:05.080]   not to do or that they might or the information I'm getting right now is not going to be
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.720]   even valid a year from now, let alone two years from now.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.800]   So it's a really, really difficult dance.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:16.160]   This is why this is my ears perk up when I see a rumor like this or a scoop like this
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:20.920]   as opposed to when I see that the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal has it because
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:27.400]   at that point, I have to start wondering is this there is such a thing as a controlled
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:33.160]   leak or as an authorized leak where we want to we need to get some information out, but
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.760]   we can't acknowledge it.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:40.120]   So we are going to swear some some people to secrecy, let them inform some people and
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:44.720]   let them publish it without any recommendations because this is part of our either our marketing
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:49.360]   effort or PR effort or just our standard way of doing business effort.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:54.280]   So that doesn't mean that like the Apple Car rumors when they first hit weren't true, but
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:58.000]   you feel a little bit dirty for even like entertaining them.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:06.120]   I think that if you go back into the archives, when they I was in a very, very like, uh,
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:12.280]   miffed mood at the just just in general at the time about how like marketing is trying
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:16.280]   to co-opt or has to certainly send co-op journalism.
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:21.400]   And this had so many stink stinking fingerprints of this was an authorized I don't know for
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:27.520]   fact, but to me to my nose it smelled like Apple is using these newspapers as a source
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:32.640]   of PR as a source of unofficial information that that I think when we were talking about
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:38.400]   on Tuesday, I said I declined to discuss this and perhaps a more a more snippy and offended
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.640]   tone that everything at Leo, I think that you thought that, oh my God, Andy actually
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:42.640]   has information.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:43.640]   He's that's what I thought.
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.240]   But I was like, no, I'm not going to be party to this.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.240]   You're still right.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:55.520]   Both the Apple television set and the self-driving car both seem to be on the back burner now.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.520]   It's all about the augmented reality.
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:01.160]   But yeah, but but but they think about all the all the knowledge that they got from
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.640]   developing that car.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:06.680]   Again, sending cameras out and sensors to make sense of the environment.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:12.320]   Even if the even if the sensors that are on these glasses are not good more are not are
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:17.880]   only good enough to basically map out in very, very rough dimensions and area 10 feet ahead
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:18.880]   of you.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.440]   Even that will be very, very interesting.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:25.600]   Imagine how if these sensors are really, really good, imagine this as as an assistive
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:28.840]   devices for people who have very, very poor eyesight.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.040]   That could be super interesting.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:35.360]   And because Apple is all in on assistive technology, this could be one of the breakthrough features
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:36.360]   of this product.
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:40.160]   I think one of the reasons people are excited about this is we can all imagine some very
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:46.440]   useful applications, maps that show you which way to go without looking down, you know,
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.680]   phone, you know, just know.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.280]   There's applications without looking at your phone or watch.
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:53.920]   There's a lot of things we can, you know, what's the weather, you know, as I'm heading
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.400]   to the door, bring an umbrella.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.760]   I just keep thinking about tourism.
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.720]   I'm just being able to know where to go.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:04.520]   Know why that know why that that building is there and historically going to any location
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:06.240]   at not as the one thing you use.
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:08.960]   It's just a it's just heads up display.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.800]   It's that audio piece too.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.120]   And I think that that's really important.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:17.160]   I don't think we should forget this is going to put headphones in your ears all day long
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:20.480]   and Siri can call all day long.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.960]   I wish Siri were a little smarter, but you can't.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.600]   One question we haven't we haven't discussed yet.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:35.000]   Who is who besides me is a little bit concerned about these QR codes because if it's it'd
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.960]   be great if like like Alex says, where I'm at the National Gallery and I want more information
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:46.840]   about something and I intention with intent and with by tapping my my the side of my glasses
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:50.920]   or whatever, I look at this QR code and I'm getting more information about this artist
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.720]   as I'm looking at the at the work.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:58.480]   It would be really, really horrible if this were a way for Apple to track every.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:54:59.480]   Oh, wow.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:03.520]   Not only not only was he in this store at this time, we got that from location and from
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:07.760]   Beacons, but also we know that he actually looked at and paid attention to this product
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.760]   right here.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:09.760]   Well, this is why you want Apple.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:12.040]   This is why you want Apple to make this product.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.320]   This is why you don't want Google to be making it.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.760]   You don't want Facebook to me making it.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:19.920]   And again, means mode of opportunity.
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:26.520]   The means Apple has the means to do this and keep consumers comfortable with it.
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.120]   And I think they're one of the few companies that really could.
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:30.120]   Yes.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:36.000]   I can imagine that they're putting at least 10% as much money into the education about
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   this.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.840]   Okay, look, that doesn't mean that we can record everything you say.
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:43.240]   It doesn't mean that we're taking pictures without see it doesn't even have a camera.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.440]   No, no, no, doesn't even have a camera.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:45.440]   It doesn't have a camera.
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.440]   Absolutely.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:47.440]   Yeah, that's just the smallest.
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:54.320]   Yeah, there's probably a lot of, you know, everything on device, you know, maybe it pings
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.280]   to your phone, but there's no other additional.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:00.200]   Do you think they'll talk at all about this next month at WWDC?
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.400]   The streaming version?
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.240]   No, I don't think so.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:06.440]   We had about earlier today, we were covering one of the reasons the show started a little
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.760]   bit late is we were covering the build keynotes.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:13.120]   Microsoft's developer conference, their first one all online Google canceled theirs last
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.120]   week.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.960]   Apple's going to do a streaming one next week.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:20.080]   And I have to say, the Satya Nadella speech was the usual.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:24.400]   I don't understand what the hell he's talking about because it's just high level vision
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.400]   stuff.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:30.320]   But when they got Scott Hanselman on demoing actual tools for developers to use, it was
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.160]   10 times better because he was at home.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.000]   He was using teams.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   It was comfortable.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.800]   It was fun.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:42.280]   I really look forward to seeing what Apple does with WWDC and I hope that they treat this
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.040]   as an opportunity.
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:48.800]   Not to do more stiff stand up presentations in front of your bookshelf.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:52.000]   And instead, it's making something really fun.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.280]   It's an opportunity, Apple.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.880]   And I'm sure that the reason that Alex Lindsay's not saying anything is because he doesn't
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:00.120]   know anything about it.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:06.920]   I'll just take one final thing when we're going to commercial.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:13.280]   I'll take Alex off the hook by saying Steve Jobs was really, really famous for being like
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.600]   the beta tester and the alpha tester for the keynote app.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:21.000]   Whenever he was giving one of those big keynotes, he was giving it using a version that was
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:26.840]   so hot out of the oven that there were developers in the audience saying, okay, either I'm going
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:30.240]   to still have a job at an hour or I'm not.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:35.360]   I want to point out that Tim Cook is an eyeglass wear.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:40.200]   So if we see him change from these little minimalist lenses to something a little bit
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:44.720]   more like Ray Banish without any explanation, I'm just going to start assuming that he's
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:47.280]   dog fooding the new apple glasses.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:50.240]   Oh, a good point.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:54.480]   If he seems a little distracted, one of the patents Apple had is that the glass is dark
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:59.440]   and when you're looking at something to let people know you're not looking at them.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:01.400]   Two Johnson Peril sensitive sunglasses.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:06.360]   First they gave us the hijackers guidebook in the form of the iPad.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.360]   Oh my God.
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:09.560]   We have it all.
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:10.560]   Let's take a break.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:11.560]   There's lots more to talk about.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:14.640]   Laurie Gill is here from imore.com.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.120]   Managing editor over there.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:21.360]   Great to have you Laurie from zero nine zero dot media, Alex Lindsay.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:28.360]   Still not saying anything and from Boston public radio, WGBH and D and not co Renee has
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:29.360]   the week off.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:33.800]   He'll be back next week or show today brought to you by LinkedIn learning.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:38.320]   I think all of us know people who have taught courses for LinkedIn learning and it's predecessor
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:46.520]   as you as we all know we loved Linda.com and all the Linda courses were purchased by
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:51.560]   LinkedIn now part of LinkedIn learning and they've made new courses the best instructors
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:52.560]   in the world.
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:55.680]   I mean, Bert Montenroy teaching you Photoshop.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.160]   You know, mind blown.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.480]   But and they do not just technical subjects.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.440]   They do everything.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:10.240]   They have more now than 16,000 courses and and a lot of variety of things skills like
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:15.880]   how to master working from home very timely or entrepreneurship foundations.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:18.080]   This is an opportunity that somebody was just saying this.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:22.800]   I can't remember who Alex S. O'Hanean or somebody that this is this is when people should get
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:27.960]   into start us business right now or how to be a resilient leader.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:32.160]   You can take courses on that and so much more at LinkedIn learning.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:36.040]   And yes, Excel tips and yes and yes learning the program.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:38.640]   I mean, just everything here.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:42.400]   Here's a few of the classes I'm looking forward to taking 10 ways.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.840]   Actually, I'm going to send this one to my daughter Abby 10 ways to stay motivated while
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:46.840]   job hunting.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:49.280]   I mean, she picked the worst time to graduate from college, right?
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:52.480]   She's out there looking for work 10 ways to stay motivated.
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:53.760]   That'll be great.
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:58.760]   Digital network strategies marketing on LinkedIn managing in difficult times.
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.520]   I might be taking that one.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.520]   Productivity tips.
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.720]   Here's a great one.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.720]   Grit.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:09.880]   It's called grit how teams persevere to accomplish great goals.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:12.040]   I mean, this is amazing.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:17.960]   I really would love for you to go to linkedinlearning.com/macbreak right now and take a look at some
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:22.800]   of the incredible, incredible courses available.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:26.040]   You'll get custom tailored course recommendations.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.480]   And the nice thing is these aren't just like YouTube videos.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.600]   So each lesson has project files, quizzes.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.120]   They are really learning opportunities.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.120]   There's learning Python.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.960]   What a great language to learn right now.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.160]   You could practice while you learn.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.600]   You'll come away with a certificate suitable for framing or you put it up on your linkedin
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.840]   profile that people know.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.180]   You've got that skill.
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:50.120]   You could take the classes on your computer, on your phone anywhere you are at your own
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.360]   pace.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.120]   And if you've got a team, in fact, we offer this to our team, always have.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:59.440]   Get linkedinlearning for your team because don't you want them to develop to the better
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.760]   they are at their job, the more skills they are, they have the better they are, more useful
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.960]   they are to you and the happier they are.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:11.240]   Linkedin learning is a faster way to learn and apply new skills to grow your business.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.040]   Learn from expert instructors.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.200]   Connect with a global network of experience all in your own time.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.600]   I love it.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.320]   Linkedinlearning.com/macbreak.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:27.920]   Because a smart thing to do, take it from me, I've been around the block a few times, keep
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:33.600]   learning the skills you need to rise to any moment because when opportunity happens, you
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.480]   only have a split second to grab it.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.200]   Be ready for it.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.280]   I've been a subscriber since almost the beginning of Linda.com of this content.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:45.440]   And it's 25 bucks a month and the thing is I keep it around because one of the things
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.480]   is it's really indexed well.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:53.400]   I don't know if I've ever watched a whole Linkedin learning course, but it's really
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.160]   easy for me to go in there and scan like, "Oh, I need to figure this out."
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:00.680]   And I scan, "Oh, I see it right there and I watched the five minutes that I needed."
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:04.920]   And the thing you can be counted on is that they worked on it, they planned it, they
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:05.920]   QC'd it.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:08.040]   It's like a clean video.
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:13.280]   It's so much different than going to YouTube and inviting something.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:17.000]   If you're going to go into that vertical, anything that's being covered by Linkedin,
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.280]   in that vertical, you're going to be able to find things that are concise and well thought
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.840]   out and saves you a lot of time.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.200]   That's why it's been worth it for me.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:32.040]   And speaking as a parent of older kids, when they were in high school and still beyond,
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:38.080]   it's really nice to have a variety of tools now, especially as kids are at home, learning
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:43.160]   at home, to have a variety of tools so that when they get in, "Hey, I want to learn more
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:49.400]   about gardening or whatever," you can say, "Well, let's go to the library."
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.960]   You can say, "Great, we got that.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.520]   It's right here and you can learn it from the best.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.520]   I love it.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.520]   We've got a free month for you."
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.280]   So you should at least try this.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.840]   This is a good time to do it too.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.400]   Linkedinlearning.com/MacBreak.
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.400]   Thank you, Linkedin, for supporting MacBreak Weekly.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:11.720]   I think a great many of the people we all know are teaching classes at Linkedin Learning.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.720]   It's a great place.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:17.720]   Linkedinlearning.com/MacBreak.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.880]   There are a lot of interesting stories.
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.160]   They're not completely Apple stories.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:27.680]   Let me do a few more Apple stories and we could talk about some other things.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.640]   Apple is going to bring employees back sooner than their rivals.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:35.720]   Twitter announced, "You don't have to ever come back."
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.520]   Google said, "Not till 2021."
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.640]   Facebook said, "Not till 2021."
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:49.640]   According to Mark German in Bloomberg, Apple plans to return more staff to offices sooner.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.640]   If they've got a way to do it safely, I don't have any problem with that.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.640]   I'm sure Apple's not going to risk their staff.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.640]   Absolutely.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.160]   They're not Amazon.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.160]   They have an okay reputation for taking good care of their employees.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:08.800]   Also, they're in a position that Google and Twitter and these other service companies
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.800]   are in.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.800]   They're making hardware.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.320]   It's really hard to build stuff remotely.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:18.320]   Thirdly, I don't think any other company is as concerned about internal security as
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.520]   Apple is.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:27.680]   I think that they are more motivated to get the offices opened up than most others.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:31.400]   For just simply for the reason of how are we going to be able to get these super, super
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:36.680]   secret projects going, is it easier for and keeping them running without anything leaking
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:37.680]   out?
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:45.040]   Remember that this is a time of human history where nations are as part of their defense
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:48.960]   budget pretty much and their spying budget are looking for as much as details they can
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:54.720]   get about commercial competitors and not just geopolitical competitors.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.240]   They probably just did the math and saying, "How difficult is it going to be for us to
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:04.360]   create a brand new infrastructure for super, double secret, top secret communications and
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.400]   collaboration between our groups?
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:10.440]   And how difficult is it going to be to make sure that we're going to get testing for everybody?
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:14.640]   We're going to make sure that we get our household, our cleaning of offices is stepped
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.640]   up."
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:20.680]   Really, I think that if every time that I look into this and the ways that different companies
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:25.880]   are trying to get back to business without killing their employees or their customers,
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:31.760]   the more I think that this is something that is going to be benefiting coronavirus response
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:36.840]   in a way because when Apple decides that we really, really need to open our offices very,
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:41.360]   very quickly and because they're not long heads, they are probably listening to guidance
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:47.240]   from the CDC and from the WHO and all of the guidance from all medical science right now
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:52.320]   is telling us that testing, testing, testing, testing is absolutely part of what's necessary
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.320]   to get people back.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:06:00.480]   So, if there is one force that is going to make sure that more tests for more test kits
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:05.760]   are being produced and better tests are being developed, it's going to be Apple and Microsoft
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:10.160]   and all these other companies that are saying we will buy, in addition to the ones that you
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:15.840]   will sell to, Mielemouth, governments that maybe don't even care that much, we will definitely
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:20.840]   be buying so many that if the market crashes, we will still be able to test our employees
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.760]   worldwide for three years.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.480]   That could be an interesting development as well.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.480]   Apple is...
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.640]   Go ahead.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.720]   I think one of the big challenges that a lot of these companies, including Apple, have
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.800]   is the open office which has turned out to be a big dumpster.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.160]   You know, because in COVID, it makes it...
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.160]   It was already a bad idea.
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.160]   It's been a bad idea.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.440]   No, it's just a diseased bad idea.
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.080]   Well, now you have to separate it.
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.240]   I think part of the reason that you have to let people just stay at home is because you
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:50.840]   got to figure out how to rebuild the entire office.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.840]   And so I think that that's going to be...
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.720]   But I do think that we're...
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.520]   Apple's probably at the end.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.200]   They'll be able to probably keep their culture of coming into the offices.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:03.400]   But competitively, I think what we're going to see over the next five to ten years is
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:06.760]   moving to people really moving home.
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.640]   And I think that this is the shock as a lot of companies have suddenly realized that it's
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:12.440]   not nearly as hard as they thought it was going to be.
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.280]   And there are some efficiencies that have been gained.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.920]   There's not all employees, but there's a group of employees that would like to not
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:19.920]   have to...
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:23.600]   I think it's less about working at home and more about not having to drive.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:27.520]   That is the thing because you have a culture that doesn't really care about cars anymore.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:31.960]   So the younger generation cars are not considered a part of their social...
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:36.720]   Also, housing costs are so high in Silicon Valley that if you can live in Idaho and
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:40.400]   telecommute, a lot of people will say, "Well, they're going to pay people less if you move.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.400]   They're not going to pay you less."
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.400]   No.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.400]   No.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.400]   No.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.400]   They're not going to cut your pay if you move.
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:46.400]   No, you may.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.360]   And I think that the big thing is that what I thought was really interesting is that the
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.920]   head of people or whatever at Slack said, "It's easier to have everybody not here than
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.400]   some here and some gone."
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.400]   And so I think that companies are going to start to see that putting everybody on this
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:03.400]   kind of playing field is going to be something that we've all gotten good at it.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:08.720]   The four of us, because of Leo's been a little ahead in that area.
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:14.600]   And so once you start to get good at that, it's more comfortable to...
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:17.360]   For instance, again, for me, I just taught a class for...
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:23.160]   There is the post-production world, which was supposed to be at NAB, but now is virtual.
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.800]   It's been happening for the last three days, today's the last day.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:31.480]   But I spoke yesterday about motion and using it for graphics.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.320]   I did things at home that I could never do if I went to NAB.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:37.400]   I have a tool set that lets me do that.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:41.560]   I can draw on things and I can jump from one thing to the next and I can jump to a PowerPoint
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.160]   or a keynote.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:46.720]   And I can do all those little things that I can bounce around and do it in a way that
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.000]   I could never do there.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.640]   So there are a lot of tools that we can use that will make it better.
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:56.240]   These companies are spending billions of dollars on making sure people can work at home well.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.640]   Once they get good at it, I don't see that going back.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:02.160]   The money that they say, I think they're going to see efficiency gains, they're going
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.160]   to lower their rent.
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.720]   They're not going to get rid of their main offices, like the Google campus is not going
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.720]   anywhere.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:11.760]   But you have to remember that the Google campus includes hundreds of buildings around
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:15.200]   the Google campus that are all there, that are being utilized.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:17.320]   I can see that constricting.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:22.000]   I can see lowering the density because of COVID-19 inside the campuses, lowering the number
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.880]   of leases that they have in Menlo Park and in Mountain View and so on and so forth, and
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:29.040]   letting people go.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.760]   And I think a lot of them are going to move out of the Bay Area.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.920]   I think I wouldn't want to be a commercial.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:36.840]   The rumors I'm hearing right now from some relatively good folks is they think that by
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:41.120]   2022, there could be 20 to 30 million square feet in San Francisco that are unutilized.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.080]   I mean, that's a big number.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.120]   I also start opening its stores.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:51.960]   In fact, supposedly, although this is a little confusion, the stores in Italy open today.
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:58.400]   Our friend Gary picked up his keyboard for his iPad at the Apple Store yesterday.
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.560]   And this is what it looked like.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.640]   You can't go into the store.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:06.240]   You can go to a place where it says purchase pickup.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:11.440]   An employee with a mask will roll your product out, not touching the bag.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.520]   There's hand sanitizer right there.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.880]   It's a no touch delivery.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.400]   And this is how Apple's doing it right now at the Apple Store.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:24.320]   It's for a limited time in the day.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.800]   I suspect they're going to be slow to open the stores worldwide, but supposedly Italy
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:30.800]   opens today.
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:34.800]   They'll probably do what they did in China, which is limit the number of people in store,
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.560]   check temperatures as you come in.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:38.960]   And I would hope require people wear masks.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.600]   Everybody should be wearing a mask.
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:45.040]   That's kind of the interesting thing about these Apple stores.
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.760]   Going to an Apple Store, it's an experience, right?
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:51.840]   You go in there, you play around with things, you touch things, you hold things, you wear
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:52.920]   things.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:11:02.440]   And it's odd to think that you can go into an Apple Store, but all of the experience that
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.920]   comes along with going to an Apple Store is missing.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.800]   So presumably, they're not going to just let people handle things while they're in
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.080]   the store, or they would just have to have somebody constantly walk behind everybody
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.800]   into some facting everything.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.160]   So it's probably a hands-off store right now.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:23.880]   And that completely changes the concept of the Apple Store experience.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:29.040]   So how long will it be a no touch experience?
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.160]   And will they try to do something to change it?
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:36.200]   Will they give everybody a pair of Apple glasses that they can wear and see everything
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.200]   virtually?
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.200]   Well, this is the...
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.200]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.920]   Where is the Apple Store just going to be a completely different experience now?
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:44.520]   Not like what we've been...
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:46.360]   We got used to over the last decade.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:50.360]   This is the picture Apple put out in the press release.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.840]   I guess you could touch something as long as an employee rushes over immediately afterwards
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.640]   to sanitize it.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.760]   They could do that.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.680]   Everything that Lori said is absolutely on the nose.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:10.480]   It is a store that encourages groups of people to gather.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:15.240]   It also encourages you to please absolutely handle our touch-based equipment.
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:21.720]   But the other factor of this is that Apple has probably led the way in saying we're going
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:25.560]   to build everything that we're going to build our own vision of a store.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:32.040]   And that's going to include building everything that we think that a futuristic store needs.
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:37.840]   And given that coronavirus is going to be a long haul sort of situation, it's not going
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.360]   to be done by the end of the summer.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.280]   It's going to be done if it's ever done in a couple of years.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:50.680]   And not only that, but even when it's relatively safe to sort of go back to normal life, the
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.200]   effect of coronavirus is going to stick in people's heads.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:05.280]   And what if Apple is the first large retailer to roll out new technology that accommodates
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:10.400]   things like when you enter, there isn't just somebody in gloves and a mask holding like
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:16.640]   an Amazon.com branded temperature taker and being at your head.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:21.320]   What if there is sort of like a pre-boarding sort of experience where there's-
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.760]   >> There's Apple letter, that's what they're going to do.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.000]   There is actually a questionnaire.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.120]   Face coverings will be required for all of our teams and customers.
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:31.560]   We'll provide them to customers who don't bring their own.
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.160]   In other words, don't come in if you don't have one.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:38.560]   Temperature checks will be conducted at the door and posted health questions will screen
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.080]   for those with symptoms like cough or fever or who have had recent exposure to someone
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:47.280]   infected and then throughout the day we're conducting the enhanced deep clean.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:51.080]   So it's exactly as you said, this is going to be in process.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:56.080]   >> Not necessarily like the opposite of airport security, the sort of thing where it makes
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:03.280]   you feel good to know that, look, there is this beautiful green illuminated archway that
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:09.600]   I'm passing through and that I don't have to interact with somebody if I don't attend
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.760]   if I don't want to.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:17.120]   All I have to do is take two seconds to stand, look into this electronic mirror and it will
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.960]   tell me, okay, you seem to be running a fever.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.960]   We're going to talk to you to see if it's okay for you to enter or not.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:27.200]   And wouldn't it be great if, A, they would do, they did something like that in a way that
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:31.720]   it actually seemed like something that encouraged people to come into the store as opposed to
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.480]   encouraging people to stay away.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:39.800]   And wouldn't it be great if that became sort of a template for other stores to follow that
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:49.920]   there are some idiot business people that are waving the patriotism flag in so far as
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:54.800]   pretending to be patriots and flouting regulations and laws allows them to get back into business
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:57.040]   and start making money again.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:03.640]   But wouldn't it be great if the time that you don't see, you have two stores in the mall,
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:08.360]   one has these Apple style gates at the beginning, the other does not, where are you going to
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.840]   buy your Levi's from?
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.560]   I'm probably going to go through the one that's obviously is taking health precautions to
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:20.080]   make sure that as an ongoing thing, only the people who might be infecting other people,
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:26.880]   and I'm not just talking about coronavirus, I'm talking about, I still really, really,
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:32.400]   there's maybe a dozen life experiences that still makes me furious to think about it.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:39.760]   And one of them was a red-eye flight from San Francisco to Boston, and the person sitting
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:47.760]   next to me had a violent cough that started at pre-boarding, did not end until they got
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.760]   to their car.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:55.040]   Like for six hours, so not only could I not sleep, but also I'm like, I know that I'm
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:59.240]   going to be really, really sick with a cough, and it's probably bad, it's going to be,
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:02.440]   and of course, like two days later it got sick and it took me like a month to get rid
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:03.440]   of this cough.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:07.040]   And I still, if I could banish any one random person to hell that I don't know, it would
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:11.120]   be this person, I would find them and figure out how to make them hurt.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:15.480]   I would love to, one of the things that maybe we are going to learn about this is that here
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:21.320]   is how to sense that people are, give people better options than flying when they're sick
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:27.440]   or shopping when they're deeply, deeply, desperately communicable, or God forbid getting people
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:32.840]   medical help at a point where a month-long disease could be cut down to two or three
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:37.600]   days at home.
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.640]   Let's see, what else is there?
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:44.960]   Lori, do you know I'm looking for 13.5?
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.360]   It is not available yet.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:55.440]   The watch OS public update came out, 6.2.5, watch OS 13.5 is not yet available, but it
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.920]   will probably be available very soon.
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:01.040]   You think it will usually come outside by side?
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:06.800]   The gold master has been seated to developers according to 9-5 Mac.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:09.000]   What are we going to see in 13.5?
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.400]   And will we see it today?
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.480]   Because this is a Tuesday.
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:19.040]   The only thing I know that we're expecting, but it's not, it's not for sure.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:24.080]   It's funny, I haven't been paying much attention to the .5 beta update, but I think we're supposed
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:30.760]   to be getting additional watch faces on top of the pride watch face.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:39.160]   Or in 13.5 beta right now, there's not pride watch faces, but rainbow themed customizations
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.280]   for existing watch faces like the gradient watch face.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:46.640]   So that's the only thing that I know for sure that we should be expecting in 13.5.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.320]   I'll tell you a few things.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:49.320]   Thank you.
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:51.160]   One of the issues, of course.
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:56.600]   And by the way, I've been using my iPhone 11 Pro Max is broken.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.600]   So I've shipped it to Apple.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.840]   I'm not going to bring it in.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.800]   I've been using an iPhone SE.
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:05.480]   And one of the things I really appreciate as I wear masks is that it has touch ID.
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:11.800]   So one of the things I'm going to fix in 13.5 is you'll be easier to skip face ID if you're
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:12.800]   wearing a mask.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:16.440]   There'll be a button right away that says, just let me know the number.
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:20.520]   But it does make me wish we'd stuck with the touch ID a little bit longer.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:28.200]   There also, this will be the official API for their Apple Google COVID-19 exposure notification.
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.240]   That will be built in now.
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.080]   You'll have to have an app that takes advantage of it.
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:36.320]   And to my knowledge, there is nothing right now in the US.
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:41.600]   And to me, the number one feature in group FaceTime calls is you can turn off that silly
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:44.360]   face zooming where you're going.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.360]   Yay.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:51.320]   Where the person talking zooms in and then everybody zooms back and oh, no, I have to
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.920]   say I have to fix this.
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:57.720]   The one thing I I'm on a lot of calls and the one thing I don't want to do is be on FaceTime
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:58.720]   on a call.
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:02.120]   Other than like someone calling me really quickly and having a one to one, as soon as
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:05.680]   you start adding two or three, you're like, no, no, thank you.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:06.680]   I don't want to play.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.800]   Like it's just, it's just so, I'm glad that they've taken that away because it was just,
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.240]   it is a dumpster fire of an idea.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:13.760]   I use FaceTime with my mom.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.040]   I was on a lot, but I never want one.
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.040]   No, what's your person?
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:19.120]   One person, one person is still works the way it used to.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.120]   And that's fine.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.120]   And that works.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:22.120]   That works.
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:23.120]   That part works.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.920]   The I'm going to have a whole bunch of little windows and I'm going to do all those things.
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.120]   It just doesn't work at all.
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.120]   Like it's just annoying.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.560]   I don't know how that got.
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.640]   You could turn that off now.
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.640]   They call it automatic prominence.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.400]   Oh my goodness.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:39.120]   They can disable automatic prominence.
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:44.040]   There'll be an option to automatically share health and other essential information from
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:49.680]   your medical ID with emergency services when you place an emergency call that'll probably
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.320]   be dependent on the 911 center you're calling.
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.400]   And of course there's bug fixes and security fixes.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:20:03.840]   My guess is the ability to turn it off is the five year plan to having it not there anymore.
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:04.840]   Like it was a bad idea.
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.760]   If you understand it's a bad idea.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.760]   Google just says Google will just go, no, we're not going to do anymore.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:10.760]   Google wouldn't just quit.
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.760]   Like, that was a bad idea.
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:13.960]   Yeah, we decided that was a bad idea.
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:14.960]   We're just going to go something.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:15.960]   People won't do that.
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:19.360]   It'll just like slowly just disappear.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.200]   And then you'll have to turn it on as an option.
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.600]   And then it'll slowly just draw out.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:28.320]   And then five years from now I was like, hey, by the way, no one was really using it because
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.640]   mighty fall it was off.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:36.600]   You forgot about the signature move of Apple saying that we've taken this feature of FaceTime
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.600]   and made it even better.
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:42.400]   It doesn't move anymore.
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.800]   You won't want to throw up.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:45.800]   You're welcome.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.440]   I have a weird problem and maybe it's just me.
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:49.440]   I do.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.560]   I have a personal trainer who does FaceTime with me twice a week.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:21:01.080]   She is on a MacBook Air and I put this on the iPad in FaceTime and I make the FaceTime
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:04.120]   come out of the camera so she can see me working out.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.000]   It's a very strange thing.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.360]   But it pumps a little bit.
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.840]   Have you noticed this?
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.440]   Alex would notice it for sure.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:15.680]   The camera goes in and out just the slightest little bit.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:19.080]   It's searching focus because you're not in the center.
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:20.920]   Because when you're working out.
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:22.680]   Yeah, it's at her point.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.440]   Can you turn that off?
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:25.920]   No, I don't think it's FaceTime.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:26.920]   I don't think you can see it.
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:30.400]   I don't think you have manual controls over it because you can't just use any camera app.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:33.560]   There's plenty of camera apps that will let you fix focus.
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.400]   But I don't know of anything in FaceTime that would.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.400]   It's pretty automatic.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.840]   So you're moving.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:40.840]   It sees the wall.
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:41.840]   I'm breathing.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:42.840]   It sees the wall.
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:43.840]   It sees you.
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:44.840]   That's what you're seeing.
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:48.200]   I thought it was breathing with me.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:54.800]   Well, if you're running like this, it probably would feel like it was breathing with you because
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:56.640]   it would see you in order.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:57.640]   It would go, "I see you.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:58.640]   I don't see you.
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:21:59.640]   I see you.
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:00.640]   I don't see you."
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:07.720]   Apple TV, some interesting news just came out today.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:13.040]   There's a Tom Hanks film that he wrote and is starring in called Greyhound.
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:16.840]   It's about a World War II battleship.
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:24.120]   It was made a $70 million deal to guarantee its premiere on Apple TV Plus.
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:27.400]   Like most movies, there's no theaters to open in.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:30.560]   Most movies, what they're doing is charging $20 for the rental.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:35.440]   I've watched a number of movies that were supposed to open in theaters that way.
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:36.440]   Some good ones.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.440]   The hunt was good.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.320]   Invisible Man was good.
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:44.440]   Look for the movie was supposed to release in theaters May 7th by Sony.
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:50.200]   It was then moved to June 19th, but because theaters aren't going to be opened, Apple
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:56.760]   and other streaming, unnamed streaming platforms got into the auction headed by CAA and Film
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.760]   Nation.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:04.000]   Apparently, Apple spent about $70 million, not to make the movie, not to buy the movie,
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.840]   just for the rights to stream it exclusively.
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:10.680]   That tells you something about Apple's willingness to...
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:14.320]   I haven't said one that will be available on Apple TV Plus.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:23.240]   It also tells you a little something about how important it is for movie distributors
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:29.280]   to find new ways to break away from the tradition of going to the theaters.
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:35.360]   I know there's a lot of contractual issues involved in first run and where it's being
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:36.920]   shown.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:42.640]   Because of the shutdown of the country, the status quo has been disrupted and we're seeing
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:51.000]   these TV and movie, not TV, but these movie producers and distributors, they want to get
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.400]   people watching their movies and they don't care whether it's going to be in a movie theater
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.680]   or not.
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:01.320]   This is evidence that they're trying to figure out ways to continue to do something like that.
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:08.200]   I think we heard a little cruffle about... I can't remember the name of the movie that
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.320]   launched real big and made a lot of money.
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:18.080]   And then I think it was AMC said that they were no longer going to be carrying the films
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:22.080]   from this distribution company because of the things that they said.
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.080]   Wow.
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:24.080]   Wow.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:25.080]   I mean...
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:26.080]   It's an example.
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:28.080]   Go ahead.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:33.280]   I think it's an example of how movie makers, the production companies, they want to get
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:35.440]   out from underfoot of theaters.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:41.640]   Now I don't want the big changes because I love going to a theater and I don't want
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:47.000]   to lose that opportunity just because production companies want to cut costs.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.360]   But I can see that there's...
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.120]   People want change.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:54.760]   In the movie industry, there are people out there that want change.
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:25:02.200]   I don't think... The theater owners would argue that they're under the thumb of Hollywood.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:04.440]   And they both complain about each other.
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:08.320]   But I think that one of the things... Because the issue is that most of the profits for
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:13.120]   the first couple of weeks, it's two or three weeks, the vast majority, 70% of the profits
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.440]   go back to the theaters.
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:20.840]   So go back to the publishers, so the Universal or Sony or whoever's making the movie.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:22.280]   So AMC doesn't really start making.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:25.520]   They want to have a longer run because they don't start making money really except for
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:26.520]   popcorn.
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:29.320]   That's why your popcorn is so expensive is because they're not making any money on those
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.320]   premieres.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:39.520]   But the idea of it, if it doesn't premiere in their theaters, they'll never make money
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.280]   on it because there'll be enough people that aren't there.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:47.200]   At the same time, Hollywood's in a situation where they just don't know... It's one of
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:50.440]   those things like you have a model that's working for the most part.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:53.080]   And remember that a lot of Hollywood are bankers.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:56.400]   They want to put an investment in and they want to get money back out, preferably more
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.280]   money than they put in.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:03.200]   And so the issue that they have is you have a model that's working and going to online
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.960]   seems scary.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.880]   Going to streaming for audio, for music was scary.
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:12.520]   And now it's starting to get to a point where it's bigger than it was before.
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:17.080]   But that was a very scary 20 years for the music industry.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:21.720]   And I think that... And it still is, to some degree, because they're now in a situation
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:26.360]   because they made so many enemies and because they made it so hard for people to distribute,
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:31.280]   the music industry is now beholden to two or three companies that at any moment could squash
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.280]   them.
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:35.800]   Like if Apple decided we just want to go directly to the artists, they're probably
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:37.640]   contractually kept away from doing that.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.600]   But if they decided that they would end those contracts and start moving directly to the
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.160]   artists, they could take out everybody if they wanted to.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:49.640]   They'd be antitrust issues, but the music industry is now playing with a company that's
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:51.320]   much larger than they are.
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:55.960]   Anyway, so the issue is with these movies, you end up in a situation where there's a
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:59.880]   whole bunch of negotiations that's going to have to happen because by the time we get...
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:02.000]   How do you release any movies in the next year and a half?
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.680]   And so the theaters are in a situation where what they need to do, they need to make more
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.720]   money from the release date.
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:10.000]   So that's part of what they're pushing for.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.560]   They need to get it to the point where they're paying 30% or 50% of the income from the day
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:19.400]   it hits the theater so that they can make more money on the outset.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:25.800]   And that's what they need to get from the producers if the producers are going to do
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:26.800]   day and date release.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:30.200]   Day and date release is releasing it online at the same time that you release it in the
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.200]   theaters.
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:32.200]   And so if they get day and date...
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:33.200]   Of course, it's left the barn though, right?
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.200]   I mean, thanks to COVID.
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.640]   Well, when they start saying...
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:42.200]   So what scares the theaters is when they start saying, "Hey, this went really well."
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:43.200]   It's looking pretty well.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.200]   We made a lot of money.
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:45.200]   So that's what we need those theaters.
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.200]   And AMC...
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:48.960]   Is AMC already hanging by a thread anyway?
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:53.480]   Well, and the issue is in what we're seeing with COVID all over the place is...
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:57.080]   When I grew up on a farm and we used to have electric fences and we had one horse that
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:00.400]   pushed up against that electric fence and if the electric fence was grounded, he just
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.400]   run through the fence.
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.320]   The other horses, if the fence could go down for a long time and the other horses wouldn't
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:06.320]   ever get near the...
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.320]   They were like...
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.320]   So the theater...
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:09.320]   There's so many things.
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:14.960]   Working at home, dealing with all the things we deal with, but the theaters are a whole
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:17.960]   piece of where there's a fence that hasn't been on for a long time.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:22.480]   And so suddenly they're afraid that if that horse goes across that fence, they're all
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:25.120]   going to go across the fence and then it's going to be over.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:26.120]   And it very well could.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:32.440]   And the reality is that the next reality is probably not going to be 15,000 screens.
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:36.160]   The proper reality is probably 3,000 screens that are amazing.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.040]   That is one thing Anne-Marie has.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:41.720]   They have some very good Dolby cinemas.
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:44.120]   Yeah, they have one per theater and that's the one that...
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.120]   The only one I'll go to.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.120]   Right.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:47.120]   You know, seats...
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:50.520]   I think it seats E, it's E, 10 and E, 11.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:51.520]   Even the losses.
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:52.520]   You know, those are the two...
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:56.320]   And that's for a while I thought that the experience theaters like Alamo Draft House
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:03.960]   would be the future, but according to ABC15, the three Alamo Draft House theaters in Arizona
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:10.600]   have all filed for bankruptcy because nobody's going to them and they can't hold out.
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:17.480]   By the way, the story, just to fill the story in for you, Lori, comes from the Hollywood
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:18.480]   reporter.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:23.880]   Universal Pictures was pissed off after they...
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:29.360]   AMC says they'll no longer play universal films effective immediately.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.560]   Well, that's not that meaningful.
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:37.400]   Your unacceptable comments were made from NBC Universal CEO Jeff Shell on his decision
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:40.920]   to bypass theatrical release for Get This.
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:45.080]   It was all over Trolls World Tour.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:51.200]   And now, of course, NBC Universal is releasing the all new Trolls World Tour dance party edition
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:53.360]   exclusively on digital.
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:57.400]   They end on HD and Blu-ray and UHD and Blu-ray.
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:00.200]   And so they've realized, yeah, just as you said, Alex.
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:02.640]   We don't really need the theaters all that much.
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:05.080]   So scream all you want.
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:12.520]   By the way, Trolls World Tour wasn't even the most successful VOD.
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.520]   It was Scoob.
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:18.520]   That just came out.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:21.720]   Yeah, the new animated movie Scoob.
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:23.280]   How do you say that?
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:28.040]   Scoob rises to the top of Amazon Prime and iTunes charts faster than Trolls World Tour
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:30.240]   did when it was first released.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.240]   Is...
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:32.680]   Are they still charged at 20 bucks to watch these?
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:33.680]   I think they are.
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:34.680]   It's rentals.
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:35.680]   It's a rental.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.680]   It's a rental.
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:37.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:42.560]   I think I like this future that we're going to have now.
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:47.520]   Again, I absolutely love going to the movie theater to see movies.
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:52.560]   But number one, there's many, many people who just don't have that ability.
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:57.440]   They've got kids so they can't see, they can't make a movie night as easily happen unless
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:00.040]   they're going to go see a kids movie.
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:05.080]   There's people who just don't like to go to the theaters and want an option to see a
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:07.080]   movie at home right when it comes out.
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:11.680]   I think this is also going to push theaters to work a little harder to make sure that
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:17.680]   the experience is really good because for me, the reason I love going to the movies is the
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:19.200]   experience of being there.
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.480]   It's seeing it on a big screen.
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:21.920]   It's getting good audio.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:23.120]   It's eating the snacks.
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:27.800]   It's being in an environment that looks really attractive to watch a movie.
[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:32.280]   Instead of the theaters, it's playing.
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:35.440]   Who cares if there's a hole in the screen or who cares if the audio is bad?
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:40.400]   They're going to have to work harder to provide a really good experience for me to decide.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:47.040]   I'd rather go to the theater and spend my $20 plus the $20 on snacks than to watch it at
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:48.040]   home for $20.
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:50.040]   I like this future.
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:54.560]   Part of what they're competing with is the fact that we all have not all, but a lot of
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:57.720]   us have really good TVs.
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:59.520]   We've got really good sound systems at home.
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:02.560]   They're competing against something that now at home for a fraction of the price, we can
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:03.720]   have all of that stuff there.
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:08.400]   We can make our own Amish popcorn with all the old popcorn.
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:09.400]   What's that?
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:12.640]   Amish organic popcorn is the only way to go.
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.600]   Anyway, don't stop.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:15.600]   Don't stop.
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.600]   Don't stop.
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:17.600]   What is it?
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:21.360]   It's just organic popcorn that you can buy in the bag and it's really good.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:22.760]   Is it already popped?
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:23.920]   No.
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:25.960]   You buy it on Amazon.
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:28.960]   You just buy a bag of it on Amazon.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:32.960]   I buy it for a coffee on it.
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:33.960]   Probably.
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:35.960]   Yeah, that is.
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:38.920]   I don't get their coconut oil.
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.400]   I just cook it in whatever I want.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.720]   I'll kill you real fast.
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:44.760]   But there's the bag down there.
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:46.080]   You see that one that says white popcorn?
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.680]   I mean, they have a lot of different ones.
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:48.680]   I never heard of it.
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:49.680]   But they have lots of different ones.
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:51.680]   And so you.
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:52.680]   So anyway, you can get it on Amazon.
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:53.680]   Do you like the lady finger?
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:55.480]   What's your favorite?
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:57.280]   I like the lady fingers.
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:58.280]   Pretty good.
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.880]   So the big thing is the big thing is the big thing.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.280]   This is pick is the lady finger popcorn.
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:06.080]   It was supposed to be until Leo went down this path.
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:10.880]   Well, you can't just say you pop up your Amish popcorn and leave it at that.
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:11.880]   I know.
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:13.280]   Is that rare?
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:18.880]   I thought Amish popcorn was like chocolate popcorn or caramel popcorn.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.680]   I thought it was a thing.
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:26.320]   You can say you hand sewn back a carton of plain poppner say, how much that up for me,
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:27.320]   will you?
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:33.360]   I mean, the thing is that like in our family, we have like little plastic things that look
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.760]   like the paper ones that you put the stuff in.
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:38.320]   So then everybody's got their own popcorn.
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:39.760]   And then it's Amish popcorn.
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:46.440]   And then the kids choose between nutritional yeast or furikaki or Parmesan cheese.
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:47.440]   There's all these different options.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:48.440]   Butter and salt on it.
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:50.360]   That's the only thing should be put.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:52.880]   No, I'm not going to buy lady finger popcorn.
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:56.120]   If you think Amish yeast, it's a good one.
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:57.120]   No, no, no.
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:58.120]   It's nutritional.
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:33:59.120]   Eustian.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:00.120]   It's delicious.
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.120]   It's delicious with popcorn.
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:06.040]   But I will say the big winner in our family is wasabi furikaki, which you can also order
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.040]   on Amazon.
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:08.040]   That's hot.
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:09.040]   Wasabi furikaki.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:10.040]   It actually isn't.
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:13.080]   It just tastes, it just got a little, a lot of little juice, but it's not really not
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:14.080]   that.
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.080]   I mean, even my daughter hates space.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:16.080]   I really want to up my popcorn game.
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:21.920]   And as usual, Alex Lindsay, you've introduced me to a whole new.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:23.920]   I'm a whole world.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:24.920]   There's nothing.
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:32.920]   Now I could get a two-pound bag of lady finger popcorn for $4.39 or for $10.96, a six-pound
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:33.920]   bag.
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:36.120]   Save your trouble and just get the six-pound bag.
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:37.120]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:42.400]   It's just, don't even, and it's because you got to understand Leo, there's nothing in
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.720]   life that can't be turned to 11.
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:45.720]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:46.720]   It's not the answer.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:47.720]   It's true.
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:52.000]   You don't have to turn all to 11 at one time, but if you make popcorn regularly, anyway,
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.480]   the point is to go back to my regularly scheduled program.
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:56.800]   I have great popcorn.
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:01.080]   I can have a glass of wine that I picked out.
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:06.360]   And my kids can have their Shirley temples and drink and have the popcorn and we can
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:08.240]   watch on a great with surround sound.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:10.080]   And so that's what they're competing with.
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:12.360]   And it's not just big chairs that recline is not enough.
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:13.960]   I mean, they have to have.
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:16.840]   And again, I didn't really feel like I saw the light until I went.
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:21.680]   I didn't even know that Dolby had theaters in AMC until the Matrix thing that happened
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:23.080]   last fall.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:26.400]   And that's when I became like the true believer.
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:31.360]   Just like this is the best experience I've had, even better than IMAX ever.
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:35.160]   Oh, ever in a publicly available theater.
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:41.600]   There's some theaters I've been in that aren't publicly available there better, but it's rare.
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:44.280]   And they have a bunch of Dolby tech in them.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:50.640]   So anyway, so I think that I just feel like that's where we want to go if we're going
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:51.640]   to go out to a theater.
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:54.760]   If I'm going to spend all that money on popcorn and driving in with the parking, the popcorn
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:36:01.840]   for four people, I'm like $100 in to watch a movie.
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:07.680]   And so or I can just wait for it to show up eventually on Netflix or on something.
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.680]   And there's a lot of content out there now.
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:10.680]   I'm pretty patient.
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:14.480]   I think that's the problem that they have is that we're all getting pretty patient about
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:16.960]   it because why spend a bunch of money upfront?
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:24.160]   I buy a lot of films on Apple TV just so I don't because the quality is often better
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.160]   than the streaming service.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.600]   Like Netflix streaming services.
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:29.440]   Ladyfinger Amish popcorn with Y is a sub.
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:30.440]   What is it with Sabi?
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:31.440]   I'm a cocky.
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:32.440]   Wasabi kara cocky.
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:33.440]   Fara cocky.
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:36.000]   It's just good on everything, by the way.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.960]   Like, you know, you can, I think you could put it on ice cream if you were, if you really
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:39.960]   wanted to.
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:42.600]   When I get down to one, I wear a form.
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.720]   Which brand do you like the command?
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:44.720]   The JFC?
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:45.720]   The Naga Tanian?
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:48.240]   Oh, I guess the green one.
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:49.880]   See that green one in the center?
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:51.880]   That's the one you get.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:52.880]   That's the one I get.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:53.880]   They come in packs of two.
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:54.880]   It's $87.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.880]   Oh, it's a pack of 30 of them.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:59.520]   There's a version that comes in a pack of two.
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:00.520]   That's all there.
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:05.000]   I will say, looking at it, I feel like I could save money just by buying 30 of them because
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.880]   I go, we use them in breakfast.
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:09.880]   We use them in lunch.
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:10.880]   We use it in.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:11.880]   What is it?
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:12.880]   Salty?
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:13.880]   What is it?
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:14.880]   It's just, they're all different.
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:17.440]   There's a lot of fur cockies, but it's a, it's got some seaweed in it and it's got, you
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.440]   know, all com seaweed.
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.440]   What are you sure a cocky is something different?
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:23.040]   And it's a, yeah, there's a, see, there's the set.
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:24.200]   Get that mixed flavor one.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:25.200]   Right there.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.200]   Get the Zebra.
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:27.200]   The eight can set.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:28.200]   Start with that one.
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:30.440]   You can decide if you like the wasabi best.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.440]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:33.280]   It is so good.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:35.080]   Oh, God.
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:39.880]   I've, after having these, I've all decided that I like the wasabi fur cocky the best,
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:42.720]   but I started with this and you might find that there's something else that you like.
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:44.840]   My other flavor you prefer.
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:48.640]   And I, you know, I didn't, I have to admit, I didn't get, I got this where most of us
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:50.680]   get our, our good ideas about food.
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:51.680]   Alton Brown.
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:52.680]   Alton Brown.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:56.600]   So apparently you talk about fur cocky on, I had to figure out what fur cocky was.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:59.640]   Alton is the guy with his popcorn recipe.
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:04.320]   Apparently is the, is the king of, he has a whole YouTube series on how to make popcorn.
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:07.000]   I don't, I don't like his.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.080]   He's just nutritionally.
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:09.080]   East.
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:10.080]   Okay.
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:11.080]   So I'll, okay.
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:15.840]   And for a hockey and, and, and it, and it, but he had an episode, of course, on Food Network,
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:20.040]   like a decade ago, which is what a lot of us who make popcorn the way we make it is based
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:21.440]   on that one episode.
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:22.440]   Really?
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:23.440]   Yeah.
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:26.880]   So you just put it a pot with oil and you pop it and then eat it?
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.200]   Well, it's not just put a pop.
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:31.680]   You, you put the oil and you add the salt to the oil so it gets properly distributed,
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:33.280]   you know, so that you have the hot oil.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:35.080]   You, I use a, he uses a pan.
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:39.200]   I, I have the little kettle thing, the kettle popper with the crank on it, which I like.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:40.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:41.200]   Those are good.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:42.200]   Those are good.
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.200]   Those are all.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.200]   I like it.
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:47.600]   I believe the, the, the wizzy, the, the, the whirly gig with a Kevin name.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.960]   So the whirly gig one really, really, really, really, not the best one.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:50.960]   Yeah.
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:51.960]   No, it's all apart.
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:52.960]   Not the best one.
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:53.960]   Metal is too thin.
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:54.960]   Yeah.
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:55.960]   There's a, there's a thicker one.
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:59.280]   There's one with a thicker bottom that, that is much heavier that I use.
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:02.720]   And I don't, I don't remember what the name of it is, but I'll find it.
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:03.720]   Okay.
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:05.200]   Well, all of you go to hell.
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:07.200]   I just bought the popcorn and the wassup.
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:08.200]   Screw you.
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:09.200]   Me too.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:10.200]   It's already Andy.
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:11.200]   I did too.
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:12.200]   It's all right.
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:17.840]   Actually, actually, see, interesting coincidence because my stir crazy popcorn popper, like the,
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:20.440]   the side of it like broke last week.
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:23.680]   And so I got a brand new one just arrived like yesterday.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:27.760]   So okay, this is, this is, this is a sign of from God that yes, I need to up my popcorn
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:28.760]   game.
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:30.760]   Me.
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:34.680]   That's why, that's why if Alton Brown ever used a stir crazy or if he could ever get above
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:39.160]   his fetish for never having something that's only good for one thing, he would change what
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:43.600]   I'm so I'm going to like, I'm going to take this big, big steel bowl and I'm going to
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:48.640]   cry, I'm going to cover it with, with aluminum foil and I'm going to shake it, stain here
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:51.800]   and do like an upper body workout for five minutes.
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:53.800]   And then I got to, I got to wash out the stupid thing.
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:58.920]   I got through the damn, no, no, if he, if he ever used a stir crazy, he would never go
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:39:59.920]   back.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:04.520]   And if he does, if he did, and if he has anything bad to say about the stir crazy, my, my estimation
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:06.160]   of this man goes down just a little bit.
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:11.280]   As far as I can tell, the only thing that Alton Brown does differently from every other
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:16.880]   person who makes popcorn is instead of using a lid, he puts tin foil over the pot and
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:20.200]   it pokes it, pokes slits in the top of the knife.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.200]   That's it.
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.280]   That's, but you have to do that because you have to let the steam escape server.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.840]   Otherwise you get tough popcorn.
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:29.240]   Well, yeah, but he's recommending a device that has no handles to it.
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:34.840]   Yes, he says, use a pair of tongs and acts as though that's an easy thing to do to use
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:38.920]   tongs and not send it like, because I can't just use a pot.
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:39.920]   Why don't you use a pot?
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:42.520]   I don't understand.
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:43.520]   I love Alton.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:44.520]   I love you.
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:48.480]   I'm just saying that that's the one time I said, oh, I should try that Alton Brown says
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:50.560]   it works great and it worked terribly.
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:54.440]   I am never going to blindly take cooking advice ever again.
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:56.720]   What I got was it, what I got from it was the Faro cocky.
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:00.280]   I just want to say that's what I really love with and mixing the salt in early, but yeah,
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:01.280]   I don't use the pot.
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:03.400]   I mean, I don't use the thing of that's crazy.
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:04.400]   That's crazy.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:05.400]   That's crazy.
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:09.760]   He's saying it because he's thin bottom or something.
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:13.720]   I think he does it because it keeps it small so that they, they, when they pop, they kind
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:14.720]   of basically making, right?
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:19.880]   But if home a jiffy pop something, something that the idea is that because the base is
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:25.120]   so small, the kernels and the oil, when they pop, they basically leave the area of most
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:30.200]   heat, which is a problem solved by the stir crazy because keeping the bottom continuously
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:31.200]   turning at all times.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:35.120]   Well, that's why you want a whirly pop, but apparently you don't want a whirly pop because
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:36.120]   those are cheap.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:37.120]   I went look thin, tindy.
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:40.280]   So where do I get a thick?
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:43.760]   This is the worst Lindy pop, but the Lindy pop evidently is not available.
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:45.000]   It is not available on Amazon.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000]   So I don't know what happened.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.640]   There's a Lindy pop is the one that I, you want a Lindy pop.
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:51.280]   It was that ended.
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:52.280]   I don't know.
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:53.280]   After the dance.
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:56.080]   Dan Bipard hit dance from 1920s.
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:57.080]   Okay.
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:59.000]   That's the typical popcorn technology.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:41:59.840]   I'm sure.
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:03.800]   So yeah, so I don't know what happened to the Lindy.
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:04.800]   It's currently unavailable.
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:05.800]   They don't know anything back in stock.
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:08.600]   I don't know when it went unavailable, but that's the one that I that I use.
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:10.120]   Well, take good care of that Lindy pop, man.
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:12.520]   You could probably recurve it and sell it out of the he-bay.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:15.920]   Well, the big thing is is the worldly pop, the worldly pop was cheap.
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:17.360]   It fell apart pretty quickly.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:19.640]   It was very unimpressed.
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:25.480]   So yeah, that's all I got to say about popcorn, I think.
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:26.480]   You all going to run out?
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:28.320]   This is when I'm a tangent here.
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:29.320]   No, but it's a little time.
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:31.560]   I will say the other, the other campaign we had with Alton Brown.
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:34.760]   While we're talking about Alton Brown, I'm continuing my campaign.
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:36.400]   I was talking about connections.
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:40.160]   We talk about connections on the show, the best TV show ever made.
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:41.160]   It really is good.
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:42.160]   The best.
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:44.840]   I think it's a little phony though.
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:45.840]   It's phony?
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:46.840]   Yeah, I mean...
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:47.840]   Oh boy.
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:52.600]   There's something in the tone of that voice that said.
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:56.760]   When your child says, "I mean, you're fortunately going to clean your room."
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:59.920]   No, it's a wonderful show.
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:00.920]   It's history, right?
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:05.600]   It says, "The cannonball goes back and then they do the chain of things."
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:08.520]   But it's a little contrived that because...
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:11.520]   Well, it's all contrived because all those things, there's a lot.
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:12.680]   There's a million variables.
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:13.680]   He picked one thread.
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:14.680]   Yeah.
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:16.680]   So as long as you accept that.
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:19.200]   It's a great show.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:20.200]   It's available by the way.
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:23.240]   It's hidden and I'll probably ruin it by saying this, but somebody uploaded it to Internet
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:27.360]   Archive and so you can download all the videos.
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:28.360]   So I watched them again.
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:31.600]   I was like, I wonder 40 years later if it's as good as I remember it.
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.680]   Well, we got about halfway through it.
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:34.800]   My kids would rather watch connections than a movie.
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:37.200]   I was like, I'll buy you a new movie on Apple TV.
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:38.200]   No.
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:43.120]   What's interesting about it is that no one's allowed to talk in the house when we're watching
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:45.000]   connections because it's so hard to keep up with.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000]   You have so many details that are coming at you at one time.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.840]   Anyway, I was talking about how great it was and I was like, it would be really great
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:51.840]   to...
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:56.480]   It would be really great if we get Alton Brown to team up with Industrial Light and Magic
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.040]   to do a new version.
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:00.440]   Have Alton Brown hosted it.
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:04.760]   And Alton Brown actually responded and said, "I could never do anything as good as Jamie
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:05.760]   Zburg."
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:12.200]   He said, when I was designing good eats, I was binging on connections.
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:15.040]   And so that gives you a sense of some of the things.
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:17.040]   But it is...
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:20.240]   I will say if you watch episode one, you have to watch it to get started, but it is the
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:22.000]   most boring of the bunch.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000]   Oh, really?
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000]   So it's just...
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000]   Yeah, it's a...
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.400]   I just like how James Kirk talks.
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:28.480]   He's so good at it.
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:31.040]   I saw something on Facebook of him doing something like two years ago.
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:32.040]   I was like...
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:33.040]   He's still over.
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:34.040]   It's just as good.
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:35.040]   He's around.
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:36.840]   And I was like, he's just as good as he was back then.
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:38.760]   So he's in his 80s, but he's still around.
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:39.760]   Oh, man.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:40.760]   And Alton Brown.
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:41.760]   You should do an interview with him.
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:42.760]   You got to get James Kirk.
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:46.120]   I think we did on the screensavers some time ago.
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.120]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:48.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:50.240]   But this is the best...
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:54.200]   Not very Mac-like, but we've kind of gone into a serious round hole.
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:55.200]   But...
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:58.680]   Well, as long as we're here, what about HBO Max?
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:44:59.680]   It comes out in 10 days.
[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:01.840]   You guys going to run out and buy it?
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:02.840]   Nah.
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:03.840]   HBO play?
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:04.840]   Max.
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:07.080]   I'd like to stop talking for a minute.
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:08.080]   Not interesting.
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:10.640]   And when I do, take a look at the room you're in.
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:14.680]   And above all, at the man-made objects in that room that surround you.
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:17.240]   Don't you wish you would talk like that all time ago?
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:22.320]   I've basically always wished I could be James Burke.
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:26.280]   I'm thrilled to know it's on archive.org.
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:28.840]   I've been looking all over for it.
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:31.200]   Everyone should download it.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:33.680]   Everyone should download today because now that I've said it, someone's going to be
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:35.680]   like, "Mmm, I shouldn't have...
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:36.680]   That shouldn't be there."
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:39.680]   I think they get away with a lot of stuff like that.
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:41.960]   Well, every time I...
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:46.040]   Every time something comes up with my YouTube recommendations, I think, "Oh, interesting.
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:50.160]   A BBC reality series there last week is in the public domain.
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:57.000]   I should get that before it lapses from public domain, shouldn't I?"
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.200]   The only reason I mention HBO Max is in the news because they have purchased Warner
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:05.280]   Brothers' classics, Criterion Collection.
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:07.480]   They've licensed Studio Ghibli.
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:11.120]   They are going to have a lot of classic old movies.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:12.680]   I didn't know that.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:20.160]   I signed up for Disney Plus when there was an announcement that the film stage version
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:24.000]   of Hamilton with the original cast was going to be Disney Plus on July 3rd.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.040]   Because I figured that because I can get the...
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:31.160]   There's no way I'm getting rid of Hulu Plus and I can get it out as a whole.
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:32.680]   I'm going to bundle with ESPN.
[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:38.120]   And also, I figured that if Disney Plus doesn't have a whole lot of good stuff, it will only
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:42.400]   take me two months to get through everything that I'm ever interested in seeing before
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.680]   seeing Hamilton and then canceling it.
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:49.400]   But yeah, I went up because one of the things that's sort of disappointing about these services
[01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:51.920]   is that it is possible...
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:56.240]   I actually went through the entire Disney Plus movie library and bookmarked everything
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:59.880]   that I had even the slightest interest in seeing.
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.800]   It was not a super long list.
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:04.280]   I could really get through it in a couple of months.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:07.000]   And for the most part, it was, "Ooh, Mary Poppins.
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.760]   Wow, I should really buy that on Blu-ray."
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:10.760]   And now I've got like a...
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:14.440]   I used a secondhand version of it on Blu-ray heading my way.
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:20.160]   I'm more interested in something like HBO Plus where we have not just...
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:25.280]   We're not just commissioning new shows, but we bought this catalog of amazing films.
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.280]   I was just...
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:29.720]   When I was looking through Disney Plus, I was also thinking,
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:33.160]   "Gee, isn't it terrible that there is no...
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:37.080]   I don't know where you can find the classic Warner Brothers cartoons."
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:41.640]   Like the reason why it became such a fan of Warner Brothers is that...
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:43.480]   Well, maybe it'll be on HBO Max.
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:44.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:45.880]   It had a lot.
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:52.080]   If it became HBO Max or HBO Plus, whatever, and not only did they have the entire collection,
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:58.880]   but also they decided to curate collections every single month saying, "Here is a collection
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:47:59.880]   of the criteria in the Smart Roadrunner."
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:04.080]   That's what the criterion channel does, and I love watching them.
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:07.400]   And you're going to like this, Laurie Gill, erasing it.
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:08.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:09.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:10.400]   Great film.
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:11.400]   Great film.
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:12.400]   I knew you'd like it.
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:13.400]   I knew you would.
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:16.360]   All right.
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:22.240]   One last thing this came from iMore via Jonathan Morrison, YouTuber.
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:23.920]   Wow.
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:28.520]   So we talked last week about Logic Pro X, the new update.
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:36.480]   Jonathan or somebody figured out that if you go to the file new from template demo projects,
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:41.200]   the entire "Ocean Eyes," Billie Eilish, "Ocean Eyes" project is there.
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:43.680]   You can see what her brother Finneas did.
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:46.080]   The whole freaking mix is there.
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.440]   I can't play the music.
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:48.440]   I'll just...
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.440]   I'll let you look at it.
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.440]   I almost played this as well.
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:51.440]   I think that...
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:49:02.560]   Well, this doesn't surprise me because Apple has their store in store today at Apple classes,
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:05.880]   where they teach you how to use these programs.
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:11.760]   And one of the things you're able to do is fiddle with a famous artist's song, and Billie
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:18.400]   Eilish was one of the artists who was part of the stay at home.
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:22.280]   Apple classes that you can do.
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:28.560]   So this might have been a gift that Apple was giving to everyone who updated or purchased
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:31.280]   Logic X, Logic Pro.
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:33.880]   I am going to immediately do this when I get home.
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:34.880]   Look at just...
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:39.920]   There are one, two, three, four, five, six vocal tracks alone.
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:46.280]   First vocals, verse harmony, vocal stack, vocal response, ghostly vocals, vocal textures.
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:47.280]   And that's just the...
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:53.040]   When we talk about content, this is the game that Apple can play that Apple cannot play,
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:54.800]   is that they can just throw money at this.
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:57.680]   And they could have different songs popping up from artists.
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:49:59.760]   And it doesn't have to be their biggest hits.
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:02.800]   It could be something because every one of these songs is like a master course on how
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.880]   to put together a song.
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:06.920]   And they should be doing this, I think, every week.
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:10.720]   You can really see different songs where you can play it and remix it.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:12.040]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:18.480]   And in my opinion, if Apple pays for a movie, we should see things like this from Final
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:19.480]   Cut.
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:20.480]   I agree.
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.480]   You know, where it's...
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:25.120]   And they should just say, there's one scene, every movie, we'll agree on what it is that's
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:26.240]   all going to be on Final Cut.
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:30.200]   You can do the rest of it in Abbott if you want, or premiere or whatever you want.
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:32.120]   But one scene has to be done and we're going to release it.
[01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:37.680]   I have to say, I have been lately buying movies from iTunes because I used...
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:44.240]   I really was sad when DVDs went away because of the additional materials, including the
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:45.880]   commentary tracks.
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:48.840]   They got commentary tracks, often multiple commentary tracks.
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:51.480]   I was watching 1917.
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:53.560]   That was fascinating.
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.160]   Lots of behind the scenes stuff.
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:59.080]   It's the commentary is the primary reason I buy movies from...
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:00.080]   If I get...
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:05.080]   If I get by a movie on Apple, TV on iTunes or whatever, and I don't get commentary, I'm
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:06.480]   not happy.
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:08.360]   And I usually look for it.
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:11.360]   That's the primary reason I buy it, is for all the extra content.
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:16.880]   That's one of the reasons why I buy physical DVDs and physical Blu-rays, because particularly
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:21.040]   from the heyday of DVDs, because you'd have a movie like Spinal Tap.
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:25.400]   And it's good enough that Christopher Guest and the rest of the actors and the director
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:26.760]   are doing commentary.
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:30.760]   But there's another commentary track in which they do the commentary track in character.
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:33.200]   Oh, I love that.
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:40.320]   And I'll give this gift to fellow fans of Bob and Doug McKenzie from Se TV.
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:48.640]   If the Disney movie Brother Bear, they cast Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas as two brother
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:51.440]   like Moose, who like our comic relief.
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:53.840]   And it's fun enough because they do it basically.
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:57.480]   They're basically doing Bob and Doug as these two characters.
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:59.280]   But here's the thing that you know.
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:00.280]   A mose head.
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:01.280]   Exactly.
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:05.280]   And here's the here's the bonus thing.
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:09.880]   If you buy the DVD with a commentary track, it's the Disney label since, oh, and now the
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:13.400]   Tukin, Tukin, whatever the two characters are.
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:16.720]   And we have a special commentary track by the two characters, the two moos.
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:21.960]   And you can tell they are totally getting rid of any idea that they're doing the characters.
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:25.440]   They are doing Bob and Doug McKenzie watching a movie for two hours.
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:27.760]   Hey, where did you get the popcorn from?
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:28.760]   I brought it.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:29.760]   Oh, you did.
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:31.880]   Where did you bring it from in your hat?
[01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:33.880]   It's like, oh my god.
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:34.880]   That would be worth it.
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:39.920]   See, I would know from Brother Bear, but that would be well worth it.
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:46.160]   It's a fine movie, traditional animation, but I have to admit that it is stuck in the recently
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:50.720]   played deck of my Plex server because of Bob and Doug McKenzie.
[01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:51.720]   That's great.
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:53.880]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:59.080]   And if you would prepare your picks of the week, I would be very grateful.
[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:03.920]   I do have some very good news for people who need a good night's sleep.
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:08.560]   As you probably know, I love our Casper's.
[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:13.920]   We have Casper mattresses in many parts at the house and many relatives have Casper mattresses
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:14.920]   too.
[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:20.480]   Casper is the award winning mattress designed with obsessive engineering.
[01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:23.120]   And just because you're stuck at home doesn't mean you shouldn't be getting a good night's
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:24.120]   sleep.
[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:28.720]   In fact, more than ever, I find myself napping sometime, middle of the day.
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:33.280]   I'll just say, let me just visit my Casper for half an hour.
[01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:34.480]   I love my Casper.
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:35.680]   And it's not just the mattress.
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:36.680]   They make great mattresses.
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:38.480]   They make great pillows.
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:43.440]   Here's this is the new Casper, the Wave Hybrid.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:45.200]   It's just fantastic.
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:47.240]   They come in a surprisingly small box.
[01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:50.880]   That is a king size mattress.
[01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:54.600]   I did make a mistake by opening it in the foyer.
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:57.600]   Probably would have been smarter to open it in the bedroom.
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:58.600]   But what the heck?
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:00.640]   At least I can take a nap in the foyer.
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:04.200]   If you're waking up with back pain, you'll be really pleased to know that Casper is introducing
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:06.840]   something they call zoned support.
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:11.920]   Casper's unique ergonomic system designed to keep your spine aligned while you sleep.
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:12.920]   There's also a thing brand new.
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:15.000]   I'm going to have to get another one.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:20.240]   It's called the airscape, engineer A.I.R.S.C.A.P.E.
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:21.240]   airscape.
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:26.560]   Engineered foam layers with perforations to increase airflow.
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:29.320]   It pushes hot air and body heat out.
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:32.080]   As you probably know, it's important to sleep cool.
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:34.680]   It helps you regulate your sleep temperature.
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:38.640]   They've got everything, bedding, even bed frames, even a dog bed.
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:39.680]   Casper is everything for you.
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:42.840]   No, our cat will not sleep on a Casper dog bed.
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:45.160]   She sleeps on our bed, of course.
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:48.560]   Casper is everything for you to build a dream bedroom for every kind of sleeper.
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:52.640]   The original Casper mattress, the first one I got, gives you three zones of support for
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:56.680]   all-night comfort with a breathable design that helps regulate your body temperatures
[01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:57.680]   throughout the night.
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:03.560]   Available in all foam or hybrid, and it's made with up to 57 recycled bottles.
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:07.400]   You know you're helping the environment by buying a Casper.
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:08.400]   We have the hybrid.
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:09.400]   That's the one we have.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:13.320]   The Wave Hybrid mattress, that's great for people who have aches and pains and want maximum
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:15.440]   support with cooling features.
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:17.840]   There's the Nova Hybrid mattress.
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:19.600]   These guys, they're obsessive engineers.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:26.320]   They keep coming up with new ideas, plush support without sacrificing, cooling for the
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:28.520]   koozy, koozy-est sleep.
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:32.960]   It's a great premium mattress at a fraction of the cost.
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:39.520]   Casper's products are cleverly designed to mimic the human curve.
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:45.880]   Right now, with their Memorial Day sale, you can save big.
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:50.600]   Of course, I shouldn't have to say it, but Casper invented the 100-night risk-free sleep
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:51.880]   on a trial.
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:56.600]   You have 100 nights, if at any time, in that first 100 nights, you don't like your mattress.
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:58.600]   You call them up, they come and get it.
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:02.560]   They'll take it away, they'll refund every penny.
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:08.160]   Free contactless delivery and, as always, free returns anywhere in the US or Canada.

[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:50.560]   Lori Gillo, your pick of the week.
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:54.240]   My pick of the week this week is Bomba's socks.
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:56.440]   Oh, I'm wearing them right now.
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:57.440]   So am I.
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:56:59.080]   I love my Bomba's.
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:05.960]   Yes, specifically, the socks I think everybody should go in for right now is the Pride edition
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:08.120]   Bomba socks.
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:09.680]   Of course, they're one-to-one.
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:11.200]   You buy a pair of socks.
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:12.520]   They donate a pair of socks.
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:20.800]   In this case, the socks that are donated are the, to someone in need of the LGBTQ+ community
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.920]   through the Ali coalition.
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:24.240]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:27.360]   You're getting yourself some, you know, some Pride socks.
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:33.280]   You're celebrating diversity, but you're also helping to support the LGBTQ+ community
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:37.520]   by getting some socks into the hands of people who don't, who are less fortunate, who can't
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:38.520]   afford socks.
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:39.520]   Bomba's is a great show.
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:43.680]   They donate a pair for every pair you buy, but I love it that they're donating them through
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:45.320]   the Ali coalition.
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:48.440]   And it can go with your Pride watch band on your Apple watch.
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:49.440]   So you'll be.
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:50.440]   And your Pride watch face.
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:52.280]   I am decked out in rainbows right now, by the way.
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:54.240]   You'll be prideful all the way around.
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:55.240]   It's great.
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:58.040]   I really love these rainbow tie-dice.
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:00.040]   That is so good.
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:02.400]   That's the pair I'm wearing right now is the rainbow tie-dice.
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:03.800]   Oh, oh, oh, I'm going to wear some right now.
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:06.000]   I'm not going to try to stick my leg up in the air to show you.
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.000]   Oh, it's okay.
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000]   I'll leave you.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000]   I believe you.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.200]   That's a great pick.
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:13.920]   B-O-M-B-A-S dot com.
[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:15.320]   The Pride collection.
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:20.480]   Alex Lindsey, how much money am I going to have to spend this week?
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:22.480]   You're muted.
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:25.360]   Two things to talk about.
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:28.800]   One is free and the other one costs a little money, almost an Alex.
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:34.280]   So the first one, we were doing a show last week and someone sent us a video that I just
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:38.160]   feel like everyone should watch if you're in training or education or thinking about
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:39.160]   it.
[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:41.160]   It's how to make a pin cushion.
[01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:42.160]   What?
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:50.920]   Now, this is done by a Ukrainian crafter and it is possibly one of the best training videos
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:55.040]   I have ever seen, including the ones that I worked on.
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:57.120]   What makes this so good, Alex?
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:58:58.800]   So here's what makes this so good.
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:06.280]   And again, I'm not, is that she mixes the ability to, she mixes both fast and detailed.
[01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:08.080]   So you'll see her speed things up.
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:10.040]   And she just gets it just right.
[01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:14.880]   So you're not, what you don't feel like is it's kind of like a Julia Child's where we
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:16.560]   jumped, you would jump somewhere.
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:18.280]   She doesn't jump anything.
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:22.160]   She just speeds it up and she slows down where it makes sense for you to see it and then
[01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:25.160]   she speeds back up again so that she gets you to the next thing.
[01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:28.240]   And if she cuts something, it's because she really was just doing exactly the same thing
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:29.960]   over and over again.
[01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:32.040]   And so it's very precise.
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:35.280]   It is very precise and detailed.
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:40.400]   And what I was amazed at is that not only after watching the video, I had to use it as
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:41.760]   a playback for something last week.
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:44.600]   So I had to watch the video.
[01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:50.920]   And not only was it, was I left with a feeling that I could embroider, but I was kind of
[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:51.920]   interested in trying.
[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:57.040]   I was like, I kind of want to see if I can pull this off after seeing it.
[01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:58.200]   I feel like I know it well enough.
[01:59:58.200 --> 01:59:59.720]   Hey, I'll make it to you.
[01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:00.880]   I'll make some mess.
[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:01.880]   You can embroider them.
[02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:04.280]   Oh, you should make it embroidery.
[02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:07.640]   I just want to make it so awesome.
[02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:13.960]   I'm making black masks and I'm thinking that I really, this really needs a Rebel Alliance
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:15.960]   logo in the upper corner.
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:19.280]   And like, but I couldn't find any patches that were small enough that you can't get
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:20.280]   that thing.
[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:21.280]   You're going to be watching this.
[02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:22.280]   You can hand embroider it.
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:23.840]   Oh, there we go.
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:26.440]   And so much is all the little details that you need.
[02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:29.440]   And here's how to, you know, if you can't do it, you can, I didn't even know that little
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:30.440]   tool existed.
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:32.920]   I mean, I'm not a, I'm not the person who does this, you know?
[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:38.960]   And so, so, but what I was really amazed at is exactly like there's little moves that
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:43.320]   you see that, you know, as she starts to do them, see this turn and to do that in one,
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:47.360]   in one piece and then get it just right did not happen the first time.
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:48.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:52.480]   Like, you know, and then, and then to come back around, you know, and so it's just really,
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:54.440]   really well thought out.
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:57.760]   And, and so I just feel like it's a great reference for people to when they think about
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:00:58.760]   it.
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:02.240]   I was talking to somebody on LinkedIn, I think, and I was just like, I wish everything in
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:05.960]   the world that I need to learn was documented this well.
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:10.120]   You know, like this is exactly what I, what, what we, I don't know, I feel like it's the,
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:14.840]   it's a big piece of the future, especially now is figuring out how we do training in
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:16.400]   a way that's super clear.
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:19.560]   And she'll show it just often enough, you know, for you to kind of, she's using it up
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:23.640]   at this time to tell you about what you're doing to, you know, to make that work.
[02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:25.960]   And so anyway, that's, that's one.
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:28.360]   And I just feel like everybody should just go watch it.
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:29.920]   I tweeted it out a couple days ago.
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:34.280]   I've been watching a ton of sewing videos recently for mask making.
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:35.280]   And I agree with you.
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:39.000]   Although a lot of them have that technique where you slow down speed up, but man, I've
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.000]   seen some terrible.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.560]   No, the thing is, is that lighting is good.
[02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:43.560]   The audio is good.
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:44.560]   Everything's perfect timing is right.
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:46.640]   It's just, it's just that you hit it just right.
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:47.640]   Yeah.
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:49.960]   Now the one that costs a little bit more money that I will recommend if you can.
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:52.320]   No, this one, I wanted to show something more general.
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:53.320]   That's very general.
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:57.880]   This is a little bit more specific, but it's so cool that I had to show you.
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:05.160]   So, so this is, this is an update for the, for the eight series that Sound devices does.
[02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:10.160]   So Sound devices makes the recorders that I use in the eight series is kind of their
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:11.160]   big ones.
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:12.960]   And what they've done is they've added a noise assist.
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:16.720]   And I don't know if you'll hear it over Skype because Skype has its own thing, but I'm
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:17.720]   using it right now.
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:19.720]   I've been using it for a little while.
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:20.720]   Oh.
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:23.400]   And, and so if you look down, if you look at my, let me cut my camera.
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:31.760]   Echo and other environmental noises.
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:36.600]   I'm using this AT 40 40 routed into channel one on my three, three.
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:37.600]   In her kitchen.
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:38.600]   I'm right.
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:39.600]   So let's clean up my audio.
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:40.600]   You can always assist.
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:41.600]   There's only one adjustment.
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:42.600]   Skip ahead.
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:43.600]   Which is the amount of noise.
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:44.600]   Let's see.
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:45.600]   Yeah.
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:46.600]   I just, we're, show some places where she doesn't AB.
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:47.600]   Yeah.
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:48.600]   There we go.
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:49.600]   Here's the air conditioning.
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:50.600]   Yeah.
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:51.600]   That was planned to show that the fan is indeed on.
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:52.600]   I'm going to attenuate the noise by text.
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:53.600]   Oh.
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:54.600]   Yeah.
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:55.600]   Oh.
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:56.600]   Oh.
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:03:04.760]   We usually do that post and it's complicated using audition and it doesn't do it as well.
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:05.920]   That's very impressive.
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:06.920]   That's in real time.
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:07.920]   Yeah.
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:12.880]   And so, and so this is, if you look at it here, my, uh, I think I just.
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:16.040]   And normally I could tell when there's noise reduction going on because you'll get some
[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:18.800]   weird gating and some strange effects, but I did not know.
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:19.800]   Yeah.
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:21.640]   It's this whole show that it running.
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:22.640]   It's not a gate.
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:23.640]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:25.000]   It's the whole show that I've, I've had it on.
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.320]   And so if we look at, if we look at this, let me cut to it here.
[02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:31.440]   So, uh, let's see here.
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:38.560]   So if I go in here is the device used on most Hollywood sound stages to record.
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:39.560]   Yeah.
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:40.560]   The audio.
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:42.800]   And I'm sure it's priced to match.
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:43.800]   Uh, yeah.
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:45.960]   It's more than a tub of popcorn.
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:48.320]   So anyway, so here's the, let's see if you can hear it.
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:50.840]   So this is, this is with noise assist on.
[02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:51.840]   Yeah.
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:53.440]   Oops, I hit the wrong button.
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:54.440]   Sorry.
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:59.120]   See, I probably have a lot of these, my sound devices, man, that those menus.
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:00.120]   Go ahead.
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:01.960]   So, uh, there it is with it off.
[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:03.560]   I don't know if you can hear it or not.
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:04.560]   No, it's pretty.
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:05.560]   I have a little bit of noise.
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:06.560]   Yeah.
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:07.560]   Yeah.
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:08.560]   I have pretty, the thing is the high.
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:10.560]   When you have an omni, it makes a huge difference.
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:11.560]   Right.
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:12.560]   You know, that's why we use the high.
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:17.360]   We just use a Brad Mike and then that way we don't have to worry about noise reduction.
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:18.360]   Yeah.
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:21.320]   The high wasn't probably the best example, but what I will say is-
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:23.360]   Yeah, you want to use a condenser to really know.
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:24.360]   It is.
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:26.360]   It is stunningly good.
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:27.520]   You know, like I keep on going.
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:29.360]   I just can't believe that it's working.
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:33.400]   Um, and it's a, it's a plugin that you can, you know, normally we have tools that do this.
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:36.400]   We have a cedar makes the company called Cedar.
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:40.920]   I think it's a cedar audio and they make versions of it that we, that we used to buy that were
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:45.840]   like $4,000 for a box that does two channels, you know, and this is a, this is a $600 upgrade
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:48.840]   for, you know, for the, for the eight series.
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:53.160]   So it's not a, it's not a cheap thing, but the fact that anybody has done it, although
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:58.400]   the, you know, it's quite a thing, you know, and for the people who need it, be able to
[02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:03.320]   clean up that audio on a live solution is, is, is pretty nifty.
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:08.800]   And so anyway, I've been testing it for a little while and it's awesome, you know, because
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:12.800]   I mostly, the only time I use the high all right now, I mean, for my day to day stuff is
[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:15.720]   for shows like pot, you know, straight podcast.
[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:19.720]   Most of my stuff is all done with, with a DPA, you know, so it's got a, there's a lot
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:22.720]   more fan noise around here that you pick up and, and everything else.
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:24.880]   And so having it in there has been key.
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:28.160]   So if you're, if you're a sound recordist and you're listening to Mac break, I know that
[02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:31.600]   there's some of you out there, you should check it out because it's, why don't you
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:33.000]   just allow for everything?
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.120]   Is it too distinctive a sound or?
[02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:36.200]   No, I love it.
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:38.080]   I love the sound of the Hyle.
[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:41.280]   I don't like the, I have a, you're, I got to show you.
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:44.800]   This is why I don't hold on.
[02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:48.360]   It has nothing to do with the fact that it's just that I've had this big arm.
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:49.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:50.920]   And I have a mixer over here.
[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:54.320]   I have a structure over here and I have things over here and I can't figure out, you know,
[02:05:54.320 --> 02:05:57.560]   where to like, hang it from above and right, and everything else.
[02:05:57.560 --> 02:06:01.560]   And so, so it just becomes this, this logistical, you know, problem for me.
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:03.720]   And so, and I also like to move my head a lot.
[02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:04.720]   Right.
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:05.720]   You know, so.
[02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:06.720]   Hyle, you need to address the mic directly.
[02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:07.720]   It's terrible if you get off the.
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:10.280]   Cause I, cause I want to, and it, what, that's what's good about it.
[02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:11.280]   Right.
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:12.280]   Yeah, I was sure to love it.
[02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:13.440]   And I said a bad mic.
[02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:14.920]   It's a fantastic mic.
[02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:17.920]   But it's difficult to use for a lot of people.
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:18.920]   Yeah.
[02:06:18.920 --> 02:06:21.680]   If you know what you're doing and you, and you put it in the right place, it's just,
[02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:22.680]   I just love it.
[02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:25.480]   And so it's just that when I'm doing training or I'm talking to people and I'm reaching
[02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:28.800]   over, like when I go over here, you know, you can hear a lot, you can, you know, I drop
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:29.800]   off.
[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:30.800]   Oh, yeah.
[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:31.800]   That's why we use it.
[02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:33.600]   So that's exactly why we use it.
[02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:34.600]   Exactly.
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:36.560]   So, so that's the, you know, that's, that's the reason that I use it.
[02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:40.960]   I use typically, I use a, this, uh, DPA, you know,
[02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:41.960]   so you're wearing that.
[02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:43.240]   That's a head-mounted microphone.
[02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:46.080]   One of those little tiny ones you see on TED Talks and stuff.
[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:48.040]   And they do pick up all sorts of noise.
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:49.040]   Yeah.
[02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:51.360]   And it's, it's a good note, but it's a really good sounding mic.
[02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:53.600]   It's better than a lav, you know, or a shock.
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:54.600]   Much better.
[02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:55.600]   Yeah.
[02:06:55.600 --> 02:06:58.200]   So, so it's, so it's, and it, it really does sound, sound pretty good.
[02:06:58.200 --> 02:06:59.640]   It's what they use on Broadway.
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:01.480]   It's what they use in a lot of performing arts.
[02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:02.480]   A lot of corporate.
[02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:05.360]   That's why I have a lot of corporate, you know, so, but, but the, so anyway, but, but
[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:10.400]   it does, I have the omniversion so that it will sound the best, but I have, then I
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:12.160]   have all this fan noise and stuff like that.
[02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:16.760]   And this, uh, this noise reduction that, that, uh, that I have here is, um, we bought a
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:19.680]   lot of those little condenser mics when we first started.
[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:20.680]   Twit.
[02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:25.400]   Uh, we tried all sorts of stuff and then, and then I won a high-end mic at the podcast,
[02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:28.600]   at the podcast because of a convention and we, and that was it.
[02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:29.600]   Everybody gets a high-end.
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:30.600]   That's it.
[02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:33.280]   Well, I think that, I think that what's funny is that it's, it's progressed because,
[02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:36.360]   you know, you won that high-end mic and then you standardize on it.
[02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:37.440]   Then we all standardize on it.
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:38.440]   I don't know how many, how many.
[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:39.440]   Pop knows what he's doing.
[02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:40.440]   Yeah, believe me.
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:41.440]   Yeah.
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:44.360]   And now I, I went to a, I was in a, I was walking past, when we were at WWT, there's
[02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:48.160]   a radio station like in that little hallway between the between the, the, the, the,
[02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:49.160]   Yes.
[02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:50.160]   They were using a hails.
[02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:51.160]   Yes.
[02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:52.160]   I looked over it.
[02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:53.800]   And because there's distinct looking, you can always look over and you're like, Hey,
[02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:54.800]   those aren't RE20s.
[02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:55.800]   Those are, those are hails.
[02:07:55.800 --> 02:08:00.640]   Almost every radio station in the world uses the electro voice RE20, which is get basically
[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:01.640]   kind of a poor man.
[02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:05.200]   It's actually much more expensive, but it's not as good as a hail.
[02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:10.200]   And yeah, I saw that too.
[02:08:10.200 --> 02:08:10.960]   In fact, Bob was going over there after our meetup.
[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:13.960]   He was going over there to say hi to the people at the radio station because, because
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:14.960]   they bought so many hailmics.
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:15.960]   Yup.
[02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:21.360]   And if you don't, and I, and I will say that if you don't, if you, after you have the hailm,
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:23.920]   like part of what, what makes it worth it is just getting them.
[02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:25.920]   If you ever meet Bob, he's just like Bob.
[02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:26.920]   Oh, I love Bob.
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:28.720]   Great as a host of our hand show, Ham Nation.
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:31.160]   A great guy dresses in purple.
[02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:33.840]   He's, I'm wearing purple and honor of Bob today.
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:39.240]   Yeah, a friend, a friend of mine, Danielle Cressado is a really, really brilliant cartoonist.
[02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:41.200]   She does a strip called, she did a strip.
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:44.800]   She retired called a girls with string girls with slingshots.
[02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:47.200]   She's a, a new one called elephant town.
[02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:52.200]   But while she's doing the old strip, she said, Hey, I got a character that is a podcaster.
[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:54.440]   Like what do I know that you do a lot of podcasts?
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:57.240]   Like what kind of microphone like do you think he would use?
[02:08:57.240 --> 02:09:00.360]   And so I sent a pictures and so there's pictures of this beautiful pile.
[02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:05.480]   It's like, yeah, it's, it's, it's advertising you buy.
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:08.760]   And then there is, you just make someone into a fan of this thing and then you never know
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:10.720]   where, where that set.
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:12.280]   That's the best way to do it.
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:13.280]   That's the best way to do it.
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:14.280]   Word of mouth.
[02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:15.920]   Andy, you're pick of the week.
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:21.520]   A really, really cool app for iOS that adds charting functions to shortcuts.
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:23.000]   It's called a charty.
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:28.680]   If you can find out about a charty iOS dot app and it does, it really is no further
[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:30.880]   explanation is necessary.
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:34.920]   It allows you to take any data from any data, excuse me, data from any data source that
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:36.400]   shortcuts can handle.
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:41.680]   You basically hand it off to charty through shortcuts and it will generate whatever sort
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:46.680]   of chart you want five or six different types of charts that you can then either just simply
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:48.440]   have displayed on screen.
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:49.720]   You can have a copy to the clipboard.
[02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:53.440]   You can have it saved to save to your camera roll.
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:56.760]   And the amount of things you can do with this, there's, I mean, there are a lot of shortcuts
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:02.080]   that as I've been playing with it are just simply give me an answer to this, the question
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:06.400]   that would normally cause me to have to go do a lot of different tippy tippy things.
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:11.840]   And the ability to do things like it will access like it can access your health data.
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:15.560]   So if you want to say, well, how many days per week did that last week?
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:20.720]   Did I walk versus how many days per week did I cycle and and also chart how many days during
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:23.240]   that week that I actually hit my goals for the week?
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:26.800]   Or you can actually it will import CSV files.
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:31.000]   It will actually be able to suck in a CSV file from a URL.
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:37.280]   If you know how to handle do how to deal with API URL information, then you can do things
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:42.920]   like take in data from from weather apps, excuse me, from weather services, from health
[02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:43.920]   services.
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:50.600]   There's a, of course, every single app that can do a chart, interactive chart of COVID
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:53.480]   data has to use that as a as a demonstration.
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:57.400]   And of course, as that's part of the of the demo package in charity.
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:58.480]   And it's really, really cheap.
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:02.760]   It's just got released a couple of weeks ago after a long period of beta testing.
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:05.400]   So it's really, really has a lot of integrity to it.
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:09.400]   Three bucks for now, I think the price is going up to five bucks in a couple of weeks.
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:15.360]   It really it's I haven't, I'm not the shortcuts wizard that a lot of people are.
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:21.320]   I have fun with it and sometimes on my, on my iPad, I use it to again, streamline processes.
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:26.160]   And I didn't realize how much use I had for a charting for charting within shortcuts until
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:30.360]   I had the ability to say, instead of giving me stuff I have to read, why don't just give
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:35.240]   me a pretty picture I can look at instead of AKA the Jason Snell effect.
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:37.080]   So it's really interesting.
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:38.080]   You're right.
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:41.120]   I would never thought I would need something like this, but how interesting.
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:42.120]   Yeah.
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:44.280]   It's a nice thing just to have installed.
[02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:47.560]   And so when you're over the next weeks and months when you're developing shortcuts, it
[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:48.560]   might occur to you.
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:53.640]   Oh, actually, it might make more sense to share to create this as a chart or if you're doing
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:56.840]   actually productivity on your iPad and you want to be.
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:12:02.200]   And one of the things you do on every Tuesday, you generate a report for members of your team.
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:08.040]   As imagine how cool it would be to simply have to tap one button to hit a shortcut,
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:11.840]   collect the data off of you that's being stored on your servers, whatever, and then just simply
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:14.000]   do a paste operation to the document in front of you.
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:17.480]   And suddenly you've got the chart that you used to have to do a whole lot of singing
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:19.280]   dancing to get done.
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:21.200]   Well, worth $3 to $5.
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:23.320]   I feel like shortcuts is such a great tool.
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:27.920]   And I really, I want to see more stuff like this to make it more useful because it's just
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:28.920]   fantastic.
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:29.920]   Yeah.
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:30.920]   It's out there.
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:36.640]   It's it really is built on the legacy of AppleScript in a lot of ways in that it is
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:41.840]   the most brilliant thing that is built into your Apple device that you have no idea that
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:45.920]   it's there until someone who uses it all the time does something with it.
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:49.480]   And then you have to say, how did you do that?
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:52.120]   And so there are a lot of resources like I'm right at in forums for.
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:53.120]   Yeah.
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:13:00.400]   That's how I did it with charty charty iOS.app is the URL I just searched for it in the app
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:01.400]   store.
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:06.760]   And I mentioned I've been at Samsung TV series hard drive fan for a long time.
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:10.840]   I had the T3, T5, the T7 came out today.
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:15.880]   These are USB 3.2 external hard drives.
[02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:21.040]   They now come in a variety of colors and they have, as you can see here, a fingerprint
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:22.720]   reader on them.
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:25.720]   They've always had encryption built into these drives.
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:28.960]   But now with fingerprint reader, I think that's a very interesting idea.
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:29.960]   They're small.
[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:34.680]   They're pretty, how tiny they are from, well, there's a picture next to a sneaker.
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:39.040]   They're pocketable and they come in sizes from 500 gigs to two terabytes.
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:42.160]   Not cheap, $219 for a terabyte.
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:46.320]   That's about three times the cost of a full size external drive.
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:54.280]   I actually use their big brother drive, the Samsung Thunderbolt drive to back up my portables.
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:56.240]   And I really love it because it's so fast.
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:13:58.680]   It's Thunderbolt 3, but that's even more expensive.
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:02.760]   But the T7 will certainly drop in price as all of the other T drives have.
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:03.760]   It is out now.
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:06.840]   And I like the idea that it's got a fingerprint to unlock it.
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:08.440]   That's a really interesting idea.
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:09.440]   I love those.
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:11.440]   Especially if you're delivering drives.
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:12.440]   I'm delivering drives.
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:13.440]   Go ahead.
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:14.440]   Go ahead.
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:22.000]   Yeah, I can tell my love affair with these drives can be explained in the range of cables
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:23.000]   that I have.
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:27.720]   I think I bought one of the first ones that had that joint micro USB plus power cable that
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:29.920]   I bought ones with USB 3.
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:33.480]   And now looks like the next ones I buy will have a fingerprint scanner.
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:40.960]   There's such a great intersection between super super fast so you can do real work on
[02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:42.360]   these things.
[02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:45.400]   Having the capacity you need so that you can actually do all the work that you need to
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:46.400]   get done.
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:52.160]   But also they're not so crazy expensive that you have to be you have to be able to mentally
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:57.520]   calculate by the minute how much money you're making by editing this video or dealing with
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:15:04.480]   this data set to justify like a thousand dollars for a super 512 gigabyte, you know,
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:06.280]   the Thunderbolt driver, whatever.
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:08.160]   This is actually within the realm of affordable.
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:12.200]   And once you have this thing that can you see that you can conceivably plug into any device
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:16.840]   that you have that can contain not just all the data you need, not only not just offloading
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:20.760]   all the files off of your memory card when you're taking pictures, but also why don't
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:23.040]   I just have my entire music library in there too.
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:24.040]   Yeah.
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:25.040]   And how about 10 different movies?
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:26.040]   Great.
[02:15:26.040 --> 02:15:27.040]   It's left great.
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:28.040]   Yeah, they're really fantastic.
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:30.240]   Alex, you use those?
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:34.240]   I use a ton of the T5s, I'm a really big fan of the T5.
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:36.560]   I use it from my camera from my black magic camera.
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:37.560]   Yep.
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:42.120]   I have, you know, it just it mounts literally to my camera and I record straight to it,
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:43.760]   which is amazing.
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:46.720]   And I've used them pretty much since they were released.
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:49.560]   I think the very first one had a lot of security that I somehow.
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:51.560]   Oh, I took the crypto off of me.
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:52.560]   I can't do it.
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:53.560]   Yeah, I took the.
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:54.560]   I was like, Oh, let's try that.
[02:15:54.560 --> 02:15:58.200]   I'm excited about having something that's a little bit more like my fingerprint than the
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:15:59.200]   first one.
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:03.160]   But I think that a lot of times keeping things that are important to you on a drive like
[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:06.640]   that when you're traveling, that's going to have a little bit more security, I think
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:08.280]   makes a lot of sense.
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:12.240]   And I can see it definitely as a, I mean, it would take a little bit of work, but as
[02:16:12.240 --> 02:16:17.120]   a setting up the fingerprint as your client, you could send it to them and only they can
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:18.120]   open it.
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:20.880]   So, you know, like, you know, set it, you know, match it to their fingerprint.
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:22.720]   You know, if it handles more than one fingerprint.
[02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:23.720]   I do not.
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:26.400]   I haven't, I haven't ordered one yet.
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:29.560]   And by the way, the T5s, which are still great, should probably drop in prices.
[02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:31.680]   These come out and these are still there.
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:34.840]   It looks like you're basically paying $40 for the security.
[02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:38.000]   Like, well, no, no, no, no, these drive, the new ones are twice as fast.
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.040]   They're a gigabyte a second as opposed to half.
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:41.760]   Oh, so they're twice as fast.
[02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:42.760]   So that's what you're paying for.
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:43.760]   I don't know.
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:44.760]   You as a great to.
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:45.760]   Yeah, they're a lot.
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:46.760]   That's amazing.
[02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:50.560]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, so I managed to snag a couple of extra T5s the other day because they were
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:53.720]   on, they were on super discount on Amazon and other sources.
[02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:56.480]   I'm sorry, I think it's our best buy than everybody price match.
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:16:57.920]   So I picked up a couple of extras.
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:02.840]   They are this, they are a good example of the things that when the price dips for a certain
[02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:06.640]   value, I open my utility closet.
[02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:08.440]   See, do I have any new inbox left?
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:09.440]   No.
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:13.960]   Okay, we need to have a couple more new inbox standing by for that situation where they
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:15.960]   I'm out of, I'm out of the soup.
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:19.800]   If I can lay my hands on 500 gigabytes of portable storage right now.
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:24.040]   Yeah, no, it's very handy for backup too.
[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:27.400]   It doesn't say whether it allows multiple fingerprints, however.
[02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:30.080]   So that's an interesting question.
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:36.000]   And I do, and I have to say, when every time I get a T5 or it's a predecessor to the T3
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:39.400]   immediately wipe the encryption off because I don't want to mess with you have to install
[02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:42.320]   a kernel level drivers on a Mac to use it.
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:43.640]   It's very annoying.
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:46.560]   So I just take it off.
[02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:51.480]   Oh, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this edition of back break.
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:52.480]   Wiggly.
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:53.760]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:54.760]   Andy and not co.
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:56.640]   When are you going to be in WGBH next?
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:58.760]   Looks like we're back to a good solid Fridays.
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:01.400]   I think it's going to be 1130 this Friday.
[02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:04.240]   But if there's a change, I'll be posting it on Twitter as usual.
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:05.720]   I just got my account as always.
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:10.800]   You got to spell my last name, which kind of limits accessibility, but I H and a TKO.
[02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:14.480]   I have no I H and I spell it.
[02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:18.560]   I H and a TK once you told me that I've never misspelled.
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:23.800]   That was the this is what this is a leftover from the last like video rental place that
[02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:28.960]   I used to frequent before blockbuster came in and wiped them out because the clerk there
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:32.680]   like was going away and so by the way, this is going to be the last day.
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:33.680]   So I'm sorry.
[02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:34.680]   It's too bad.
[02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:39.200]   You're the only person that like ever like who works here who like the account name was
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:41.280]   the count number was going to be like your name plus whatever.
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:44.040]   I don't know what I'm going to spell him on name for is.
[02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:45.160]   Oh, yeah, I just always remember this.
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:47.800]   I have no idea how to spell this person's name.
[02:18:47.800 --> 02:18:52.320]   So to that to that woman who's probably now a doctor or an engineer somewhere after after
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:54.440]   graduating college and post dog.
[02:18:54.440 --> 02:18:55.440]   Thank you very much.
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:59.280]   You have improved the lives of people who have to interact with me on a regular basis.
[02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:04.280]   Oh, by the way, if you don't go to WGBH news.org, you can listen to it live or later because
[02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:08.280]   it's up on they posted up about a day later and you can actually just do a search for my
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:13.200]   last name again, spell it to find the ones that I'm in.
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:19.240]   Thank you, Alex Lindsey 090 media, the company he works for, but you can also catch him office
[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:20.600]   hours.
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:25.040]   If you go to youtube.com/AlexLindsay, L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:27.200]   There's a link there to the zoom conference.
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:32.000]   It starts up around 5 55 a.m. Pacific time and goes.
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:35.000]   But really the content is really at seven.
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.000]   Seven.
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.000]   So six o'clock.
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.720]   We're just coming in, having coffee and talking to each other.
[02:19:39.720 --> 02:19:42.720]   If you like that kind of thing, six o'clock is great.
[02:19:42.720 --> 02:19:46.960]   But once we get, we start at seven to the second, almost to the second within 15 seconds
[02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:48.760]   of seven o'clock.
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:52.400]   And we will go for exactly an hour before we go on to another subject for another hour.
[02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:58.360]   So six o'clock is pretty, it's pretty loose, but the seven o'clock is just question and
[02:19:58.360 --> 02:19:59.360]   answer.
[02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:03.800]   So if you've got a question about media that you want to ask, basically you go in there,
[02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:05.280]   you throw your question in before seven.
[02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:08.560]   We just start going down, we just start cutting through all the questions that come in.
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:11.000]   So it's a good place for you to go.
[02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.840]   It's not just me, it's 40 of us in the panel.
[02:20:13.840 --> 02:20:17.480]   So there's a lot of people with a lot of different backgrounds that are in audio and video and
[02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:22.000]   film and all kinds of other things that are, so I answer the questions that I can.
[02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.200]   But a lot of times I'm throwing questions to other panelists.
[02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:29.160]   So there's literally 40 people there to come up with solutions for you.
[02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:31.520]   Yeah, I just want to sit and watch.
[02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:32.720]   I really do.
[02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:33.720]   I'll give up some.
[02:20:33.720 --> 02:20:35.800]   There's 40 people in the panel.
[02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:38.920]   There's usually about almost 200 that are just watching.
[02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:39.920]   Nice.
[02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:40.920]   So yeah, every every morning.
[02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:41.920]   Thank you Alex.
[02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:42.920]   Seven days a week.
[02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:45.080]   Lori Gil, seven days a week.
[02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:49.320]   Lori Gil, managing editor, imore.com.
[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:51.440]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:52.440]   Thank you.
[02:20:52.440 --> 02:20:53.440]   Thank you for having me.
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:20:54.440]   Yes.
[02:20:54.440 --> 02:20:56.200]   And we will see you next week.
[02:20:56.200 --> 02:20:58.760]   Renee, I'll be back next week because one of you will rotate out.
[02:20:58.760 --> 02:21:03.560]   I'm not sure whose turn it is, but we'll be back next Tuesday and every Tuesday.
[02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:04.560]   11 a.m.
[02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:05.560]   Pacific 2 p.m.
[02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:07.840]   Eastern time.
[02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:11.520]   That would be 1700 UTC.
[02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:15.840]   If you want to watch live or listen live, there's a stream at Twitter TV slash live.
[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:17.200]   There are many streams.
[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:20.760]   There's also a great chat room where everybody else is watching and listening live.
[02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:24.480]   That's at IRC dot twit dot TV.

[02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:32.160]   You can ask your voice assistant to play it.
[02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:34.960]   Or you could just subscribe in your favorite podcast application.
[02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:38.160]   Yes, still an RSS feed.
[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:39.160]   How does it happen?
[02:21:39.160 --> 02:21:40.360]   I don't know.
[02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:43.840]   But if you find a podcast application and subscribe, you'll get it automatically the
[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:46.800]   minute it's available every Tuesday afternoon.
