[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.360]   goodness and light and sweetness from Apple
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.000]   with a few little sour tangerines thrown in for good luck.

[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.120]   Not that we're bitter or anything.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.560]   Alex Lindsey is here from the Pixel Core.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.080]   Thanks for filling in for me last week.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.280]   No, last week, you weren't here.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.640]   I was having a baby.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.760]   I was mostly holding the baby at that point now.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.200]   So congratulations.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.920]   Isabella.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.440]   Isabella Amman.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.960]   And how-- for some reasons, I don't understand.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.240]   You always say how big the baby was.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.360]   8 pounds, 8 ounces.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.040]   That's a big baby.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.840]   It was a--
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.120]   That's a big baby.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.880]   She ran off the bat.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.640]   I want to tell you how worthless that data is,
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.360]   because it was only 6 pounds.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.320]   Well, exactly.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.160]   And they don't stay that way for more than a minute.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.600]   So she gained all her weight back in five days.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.480]   So she's a good eater.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.440]   So I don't know why you just say that, but you do.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.280]   And more importantly, has Carlita.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.560]   She is doing well.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.480]   She's recovering well.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.400]   And at home with the kids and her moms here,
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.480]   so she's got lots of support.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.320]   Good.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.840]   Good.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.720]   And I sure will see Isabelle at some point.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.560]   We saw Malachi fairly early on.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.000]   Absolutely.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.680]   How's Malachi doing?
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.600]   Is he happy to have his sister?
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.640]   You know, that boy, every time you think he can't get
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.880]   in the sweeter, he gets a little sweeter.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.440]   He's the sweetest little boy.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.160]   And so when we took him to the hospital,
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.840]   and when he got to the hospital, he was a little reserved.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.600]   So I was a little afraid this is not going to go well.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.240]   And then-- but then when we get-- but he was also tired.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.200]   And when we got to the house, when we brought her in,
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.120]   I knelt down so he could see her.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.840]   And he came over and just gave her a little hug
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.920]   and put his forehead on her forehead.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.280]   Well, he's 19 months old.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.280]   You know, it was a--
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.880]   And all he does is comes over about once an hour
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.040]   and gives her a little hug and pats her on the back.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.480]   So he keeps getting attention.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.960]   He'll be all right.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.360]   But you got grandma there for that.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.080]   And he and I still have to get a certain amount
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.280]   of wrestling in every day.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.400]   So the boys need their dads as I learned in China.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.480]   We had such a great time, Henry and I.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.000]   Just bonding in China.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It was so much fun.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.400]   Scott Borne is also here, this weighing in at six pounds
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.680]   and a few ounces, like 80 million.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.400]   Hey, Scotty.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.880]   I'm glad you didn't have to launch a rescue,
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.320]   an airborne rescue for any of that.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.840]   Could you--
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.600]   I do need to ask your indulgence because I wanted to wait
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.400]   till I heard your voice to make sure this is accurate.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.200]   So hold on a second.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.040]   Sentcom.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.440]   Sentcom.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.720]   Yeah, this is born.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.040]   We need to cancel eagles.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.840]   The package one.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.000]   You can stand down soldiers.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.160]   Both packages are in the green.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.720]   I say in both packages are in the green on the--
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.160]   Just cancel that.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.120]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.280]   Yeah, the-- now--
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.080]   No, no, no, no.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.240]   The special wing gun was created to shoot
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.840]   one million iPhones per second.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.080]   You guys send that back to me.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.080]   Thank you.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.080]   The iPhone gun.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.200]   I think they cleared up for you.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.600]   You know what's funny going to China is you're really
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.880]   bringing all these gadgets back to their home.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.160]   They're all like, yeah.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.440]   I recognize this.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.840]   When I bought the iPhone 3GS, it was shipped to me
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.080]   from Shenzhen, China.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.400]   That's where it was made.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.480]   Apple never saw it.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.200]   Just went right straight to me from China.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.160]   So I felt like I was repatriating all of these devices.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.280]   Now Scott has just disappeared.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.480]   I just wanted to point out Scott has just disappeared
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.000]   from his seat.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.240]   And there's a good reason for that.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.720]   He's expecting delivery of how many
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.600]   drobos do he say?
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.080]   See, I was expecting delivery of a baby.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.160]   And Scott's version of that is I have nine drobos.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.600]   It's like a little litter.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.320]   He's got a little litter of drobos coming.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.920]   Does a big drobo go under the porch
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.080]   to have these nine drobos?
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.360]   And what exactly is the--
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.640]   the drobo pros give birth to these little drobos.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.920]   Some of them, when they start off, they only hold one disc.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.680]   But as they grow, you give them a couple months.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.960]   And they'll get up to four discs.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.160]   And if they get really old, they might get up to eight.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.120]   But it takes a lot of work.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.520]   Some only ever get to six.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.240]   I mean, that's just what happens.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.960]   Well, let's play the little Drobo song for Scott.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.840]   And we'll have to say hello to his new Drobo's.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.320]   Meanwhile, actually, might as well take a break
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.800]   before we even get started and mention Drobo
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.120]   because they are our fine sponsor.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.040]   In fact, here he comes with his Drobo's.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.440]   DROBO, why does Scott love his Drobo so darn much?
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.760]   I'll tell you why.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.600]   Is that-- was that your Drobo delivery?
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.200]   That was all nine of them.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.400]   All nine Drobo's.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.880]   Ladies and gentlemen, we love the Drobo.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.960]   Tell us why you have so many of those, Scott,
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.040]   because a Drobo holds huge amounts of data.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.040]   I understand why you need nine of them.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.160]   Well, actually, I have way more than nine.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.960]   These particular nine, they showed up.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.920]   So I'm going to give them away.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   But--
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.920]   Oh.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.760]   Oh.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.680]   We're talking giveaway Drobo's.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.880]   Nice.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.840]   These are going-- at least eight of these
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.960]   are going to the winners of the last.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.080]   We just ran the fourth and final opportunity
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.560]   for the coffee workshop contest.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.960]   And these are going to them.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.640]   But there's one extra one.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.120]   I'm not sure what to do with it.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.800]   Somebody might give me a suggestion.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.760]   But anyway, I like having lots of Drobo's
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.760]   because I use one Drobo as my primary drive
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.560]   and then another Drobo as my back.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.280]   So you boot off a Drobo.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.760]   I boot off a Drobo's.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.920]   Is it pretty fast for booting?
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.360]   No.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.400]   But it's fast enough.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.040]   You're using the Firewire Drobo for booting?
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.680]   Now, the main thing is that people often
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.480]   get confused about the difference
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.480]   between backup and redundancy.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.480]   And that's why I have so many Drobo's.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.960]   Because even though you've got a redundant drive array,
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.840]   then you still have to have backed up.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.200]   So you still have to have extra cops to the data.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.720]   And you even need offsite backup.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.040]   I mean, you--
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.520]   Exactly.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.560]   So what you're envisioning is really worst case scenarios.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.360]   What's-- if the Drobo explodes into flame,
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.400]   well, then you have another Drobo.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.320]   But if the entire house person to flame,
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.160]   you got to have something outside the house.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.160]   Awkward.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.480]   Well, that's why we also switch them in and out.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.040]   I keep four at a time on my local desktop here in my office.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.640]   And then when they fill up, which they do,
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.520]   because we produce a lot of data,
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.320]   then we ship them back to the warehouse
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.760]   and bring in another four.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.280]   And so I'm always having four brought in and duplicating
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:21.840]   another four.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.480]   So I don't know.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.000]   I think we're up to 72 now.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.240]   Now, folks, I'm not recommending advocating
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.520]   or anyway saying this is normal behavior.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.360]   However, if you would like to purchase 72 Drobo's or just one,
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.520]   I invite you to go to dropo.com and use the promo code MAC
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.040]   break.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.160]   We've got actually some new deals.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.800]   So let's see.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.680]   Here's-- there's Drobo.com.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.320]   You can actually even go to drobo.com/macbreak.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.240]   Two instant rebates.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.560]   This is for a limited time.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.160]   $50 off the Drobo 2 terabyte or 4 terabyte bundle.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.480]   So you understand, you could buy the Drobo without drives in it.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.960]   That's for people like me who a lot of have a lot of drives
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.360]   lying around.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.200]   And I think about the Drobo's.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.160]   You can put any kind of SATA drive in there.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.880]   They don't have to match in size.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.400]   And then if you want more space in the Drobo,
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.680]   you pull the smallest drive and put in a bigger one.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.760]   So that's how I got started with Drobo.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.080]   But now you can also buy it populated with two or four terabytes.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.960]   $50 off those bundles.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.080]   $75 off a Drobo Pro bundle.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.760]   These instant rebates through August 31st,
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:30.120]   through August 31st when you use Drobo.com/macbreak.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.160]   So you have a choice.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.720]   You have the original Drobo, which has-- it's actually
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.920]   the second generation Drobo.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.440]   Do they still sales, Scott?
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.000]   The USB Drobo is not sale anymore.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.280]   Yeah, I mean, that makes sense.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.840]   Because the second generation Drobo has USB 2,
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.760]   has Firewire 4, and 800, right?
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.080]   All of the Drobo's have backwards compatibility.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.040]   But the current model, it tops and moles the Drobo Pro,
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.080]   which will allow you to put eight drives into the box,
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.960]   which allows for two simultaneous drive failures.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.080]   And the standard Firewire Drobo will allow you to use four.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.960]   And I just have to point out we had a new intern in who
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.440]   knocked one of the Drobo's off the desk.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.920]   And everything was fine, except one of the drives
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.000]   inside the Drobo was in the middle of a right.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.200]   And of course, we know what happens
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.520]   to the heads of the drive.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.920]   So the drive failed.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.360]   It took 14 hours, but the Drobo self-healed.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.840]   We simply dropped in a new drive.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.360]   Because every time we buy a Drobo,
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.280]   we buy five Western digital 1 terabyte green drives,
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.640]   the fifth one being the extra that sits there in case
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.600]   we have a failure.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.520]   And this is actually only the second time in more than a year
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.800]   that that's happened.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.600]   But we fixed it, no day loss.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.920]   It was very cool to watch.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.440]   - No, I gotta do the math here.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.160]   If you've got eight Drobo Pros.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.040]   - Why don't have eight Drobo Pros?
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.920]   - You just use the regular Drobo for the massive number.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.080]   - How many Drobo Pros do you have?
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.800]   - I actually do not own a Drobo Pro
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.880]   because they've been such a smart supply.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.640]   I was able to use one for a while to test and all,
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.800]   but I don't own one yet.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.080]   - At least I figured, I just thought of a new contest
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.080]   that I could do.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.760]   How many, how many terabytes does Scott have?
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.440]   And we'll give you, you'll have to,
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.200]   it's a little bit of math involved.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.040]   - It's like M&Ms.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.200]   - It's like it's like trying to guess the M&Ms.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.600]   - Yeah, it's exactly what it is.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.440]   - Keep in mind, I mean,
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.960]   we're using sting gigabyte compact flash barge times two
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.840]   and every Nikon D3.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.680]   And then every photo we take basically has to be
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.840]   in three places 'cause you know, like Alex says,
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.680]   if it isn't in three places, it isn't real.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.720]   - Is that you six three now?
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.200]   - I thought it was just two.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.880]   - Well, we usually say if it's not in two places,
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.840]   it doesn't exist.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.000]   And if it's not, we three places.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.200]   - We generally keep it in three.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.040]   - Yeah, I do two.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.960]   - And important stuff.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.800]   - 'Cause I have a copy at home,
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.960]   a copy at my office and a copy at the warehouse.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.240]   - Now, are you are sinking between the home version
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.160]   and the office?
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.000]   - I am indeed.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.840]   - Yeah.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.680]   - Wow, amazing.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.880]   - And then I've been looking at using,
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.720]   as the third one, I've been using something like backblaze
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.040]   or something like that to just have one in the,
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.560]   you know, data in the cloud.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.080]   Not my, I'm still a little freaky about putting
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.240]   like real secure data up there, but like,
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.840]   you know, a lot of my, a lot of my,
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.480]   - I didn't work out the well for Twitter.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.600]   - Twitter used S3 or something and lost data.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.520]   - I don't know how they lost it.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.960]   - You didn't hear about this, Leo?
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.120]   - Oh, well, let's talk about it in a second.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.080]   First, let's play the Drobo jingle.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.360]   - Eh, which nobody's hearing,
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.760]   but if you were, it would sound like this.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.680]   D-R-O-B of Drobo.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.680]   - Drobo.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.080]   - I don't understand why I'm not getting any audio of this,
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.400]   but we'll work on that.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.600]   Well, we go back to our regular conversation,
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.920]   which hasn't even gotten started practically yet.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.760]   - You know, it was very good.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.680]   - You warned us so we began.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.160]   - Well, Scott warned us that he might be taking the delivery
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160]   of a litter of Drobo.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.080]   Say that, litter of Drobo's.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.480]   And so we were, we were put in the first one.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.360]   - I was gonna name the first one Isabella,
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.360]   but then Alex already used that.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.200]   - Izzy.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.120]   - Izzy and Malakai are taken as our Henry and Abby.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.600]   I just saw the picture of my wife with Isabella.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.720]   Oh, what a cute picture.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.560]   That's so sweet.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.800]   And Malakai.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.200]   All right, so let's get to the stories of the day.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.200]   You know, the biggest story of the day
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.480]   is actually gonna happen as usual
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.560]   after we get off the air.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.920]   Apple will announce it's quarterly results.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.600]   And analysts are saying one thing,
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.520]   but nobody really knows what Apple's gonna say.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.760]   Have you read the analyst reports?
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.920]   Of course you have, Scott.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.920]   - Yes, I have.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.120]   And, you know, they're reacting basically the way
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.120]   that you'd expect with the entire economy in a test bin,
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.160]   but I have a seeking suspicion that Apple's gonna pull a cat
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.640]   out of the hat and surprise them a little bit.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.640]   - I got fooled on Twitter.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.680]   I started reading these stories.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.320]   I said, "Apple's sales way down for the court."
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.120]   And then somebody said, "You know, that's made up.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.160]   "Nobody knows yet 'cause Apple isn't announced till Tuesday."
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.040]   - I don't think they're gonna see record quarter results
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.080]   like we did previously, but I think that you'll see
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.520]   comparing them to similar-extributed businesses
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.440]   that they're going to do probably pretty well.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.640]   - Well, don't we think overall though?
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.800]   I mean, they're gonna sell a lot of iPhones, aren't they?
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.640]   - Yep, they are.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.840]   - They're gonna be the thing that saves them right there.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.360]   - Last quarter, that's what saved them.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.200]   - Yeah.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.040]   - Their iPhone.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.640]   - The next quarter is people buying laptops for school?
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.920]   - I think Apple's, you know, well, first of all,
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.920]   is the recession over?
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.720]   I mean, are we gonna, the PC industry had a rocky quarter
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.920]   down across the board.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.160]   Is that gonna stay, is it a lagging indicator?
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.720]   We're gonna see a tough market through the summer
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.960]   and into falling, my opinion.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.840]   - At least.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.680]   - And then Windows 7 comes out in October.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.800]   That should help PC sales.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.160]   - That'll solve everything.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.880]   (laughing)
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.760]   - I love this story.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.400]   So I'm reading this story.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.920]   This is ZDNet, Dell HP, neck and neck and second quarter,
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.680]   US PC shipment race, Apple slips.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.040]   So I'm reading that along, I think though,
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.800]   that must be Apple must have slipped.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.760]   No, that's not, no, they're just making it up.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.280]   - Well, when it comes to reporting on Apple,
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.720]   doesn't PC magazine kind of just do that anything?
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.360]   - Well, you know, sometimes I think they're very fair,
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.520]   but really Larry Dignon who wrote this,
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.560]   Oda have said something like,
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.920]   according to analysts who are making the numbers up,
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.520]   Apple's second quarter shipped 7.6%,
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.640]   but he didn't, he just kind of unqualifiedly
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.400]   said this number.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.120]   Apple gives advisories to these analysts though, right?
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.960]   - Wow, they, there's, I think they have to, don't they?
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.440]   - So the analysts are working off something.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.840]   - Oh, they, you know, the analysts can come in
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.120]   and ask questions and, you know,
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.800]   I think the thing is if you look at the traditional
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.320]   analysts that cover Apple and you take a look
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.400]   at what their track records are, you know,
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.440]   it's not that great.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.280]   - Yeah.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:41.280]   - Well, anyway, we'll find out to five o'clock Eastern
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.000]   tonight Apple makes its announcements,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.240]   which is of course right after the show ends.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.720]   So, there's always that.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.680]   - Yeah, they time it, you know, because that,
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.840]   they make sure that they know when the show's ending.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.840]   If we move the show out in another hour,
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.000]   they would announce it since.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.240]   - Well, that's the thing, I was thinking of moving
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.920]   to Wednesday, but they probably just moved
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.760]   the announcements to Wednesday.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.040]   They're all out to get us.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.520]   - Apple stock has been tithing as, you know,
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.720]   kind of in preparation for this.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.440]   Again, not in response to any news,
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.240]   but in response to what the analysts say,
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.600]   which I think is kind of unfair.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.760]   - But, you know, the worst time to buy your sell stock
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.440]   is right around the quarterly results.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.280]   - Sure.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.960]   - Because everything is always so, you know,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.200]   "Opsi-turvy, you know, give it a few days
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.360]   is what I always used to do."
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.600]   I want to go for the record for all of the simple haters.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.600]   No, I don't have any Apple stocks to stop that.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.560]   No, he got rid of it and he's now ethically and morally pure.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.320]   - I was always ethically and morally pure,
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.480]   but it didn't matter.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.800]   At $200 a share, I decided I'd had enough.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.040]   Now, we're climbing back that way
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.640]   and I kind of wish I had some Apple stock
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.760]   'cause I think they're going back there.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.080]   But, you know, listen, Apple's like every other company.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.720]   They make mistakes, they get things right,
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.840]   they get things wrong.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.800]   But looking at the trends, and I mean long term,
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.280]   not the 15 minutes that people like to live in,
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.880]   they've made more right decisions than wrong ones,
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.880]   which is why they're a successful company,
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.920]   which is why their stock continues to trend upward,
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.400]   which is why their last quarter
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.960]   was their best quarter in history.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.920]   And call me an Apple fanboy if it makes you feel good,
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.880]   but those are just facts, you can't refute them
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.600]   and that's the way it is.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.600]   - Do you think Steve Jobs being back is gonna,
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.920]   are we gonna, have we seen,
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.920]   and will we see any evidence of that?
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.240]   - I mean, it seems like business is usual.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.840]   - I get the impression that, I mean,
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.000]   there was probably some windows where he wasn't available,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.920]   but I think that Apple works on such long curves
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.760]   that I doubt that him being gone six months
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.000]   really affected the production of anything.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.200]   - You didn't really see any change, any shift, anything.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.480]   - No, and I, now the rumors of the tablet
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.880]   are coming back up again.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.720]   - Tell us about that.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.320]   - Well, the rumors are starting to come up
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.320]   that possibly October is now when we might see
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.800]   this illustrious tablet.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.480]   So that's anyway, so that,
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.520]   we'll see if that, I mean, it seems like it's an almost,
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.880]   you know, we got these rumors for six months or a year
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.240]   before the phone, the phone came out.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.640]   There gets to be a point where, you know,
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.960]   there's enough of them.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.480]   - I'm kind of giving up on the tablet, to be honest with you.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.960]   - Oh, I just don't see it.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.600]   When you got 299 netbooks everywhere,
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.120]   299 netbooks everywhere, Apple coming up with a tablet,
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.640]   you know what's gonna happen everywhere.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.800]   - Yeah, well it's too expensive and, you know.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.320]   - You know what some people are saying,
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.120]   and some analysts, I think this was in CNET.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.240]   And I kind of agree with this, that forget the tablet,
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.880]   the market is for ultra thin PCs at a higher price point
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.240]   at the eight or $900 price point.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.200]   And a refurbed air, which you can get for under a thousand now,
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.760]   is pretty darn close.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.680]   This is what Intel wants people to buy, by the way,
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.320]   'cause Intel doesn't like selling these atoms,
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.200]   there's no margin.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.720]   - Well, I think that, I think that there's a market
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.520]   for the tablet, and I think that the tablet is going to,
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.600]   you know, there was a lot of phones out there
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.720]   when they released. - I don't want a keyboard.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.600]   - Well, but I think that if you have a Bluetooth,
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.720]   if you're able to hook a Bluetooth keyboard to the tablet,
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.280]   if you're able to sync a Bluetooth keyboard to the tablet,
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.160]   I would carry that around probably half the time
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.280]   instead of my laptop.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.720]   - I do notice that traveling in China,
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.840]   I use the iPhone basically like a computer.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:07.680]   - Right.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.880]   - And I was able to do all sorts of things.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.040]   That audio booth that we talked about a couple of weeks ago,
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.720]   I used that, I did about 14 of those,
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.040]   and that went over way well.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.000]   By the way, that was really quite good, Leo.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.640]   I really enjoyed those.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.560]   - Thank you.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.440]   I tried to make them, so there was some audio interest
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.080]   as well as just what I was talking about.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.160]   And it was really fun.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.080]   I was able to post pictures, the camera,
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.520]   that's so much better on the iPhone,
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.360]   I was able to post a video.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.600]   - And the panorama's looked great.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.680]   - Panorama's thanks to you for Autostitch,
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.680]   I loved Autostitch, and I did a bunch of panorama's.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.640]   - That's a great little app.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.800]   - Well, I shot them in my Mark II too,
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.640]   but I haven't gotten it, you know,
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.840]   'cause they gotta get back to fix them.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.320]   - Yeah, this, you shoot 'em,
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.840]   you Autostitch 'em in the field,
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.040]   and you're uploading 'em.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.440]   One trick I learned, 'cause when I first, you know,
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.960]   emailed 'em to Postress, of course,
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.560]   Apple lowers the resolution on photos that you email,
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.880]   you can't choose not to do that.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.720]   - To syncing it.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.200]   - No, well, syncing it, of course,
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.360]   but you can still do it from the field.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.240]   Somebody sent me a note, 'cause I put it on my blog,
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.240]   and I said, I'm sorry, this is so low,
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.240]   res off the way I get back to the hotel,
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.000]   they said, full copy, he said, no, no.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.920]   Just you press and hold the image,
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.240]   and you'll get the copy button,
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.000]   you copy it, then paste it in your email,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.240]   sends it full copy, don't change that Apple.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.240]   (laughs)
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.560]   No change.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.400]   - You're pointing to me, Leo.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.160]   - No 3.01, I don't want any changes.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.960]   But that's nice, so you can send the full copy.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.240]   This one thing that irked me a little bit,
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.640]   is Apple's a little big brother, I make videos,
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.240]   and he says, sorry, that's too big to me.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.960]   - I saw that too, I had a big plan of uploading videos
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:36.240]   to my parents' frame, and I was kinda frustrated
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.080]   that I couldn't upload the video.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:37.920]   - It's too enough.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.000]   - So I found there is a service that started,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.720]   well, like two weeks into my trip, called TweetReal,
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.040]   it's an iPhone app called TweetReal,
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.600]   and it seems to accept any video of any arbitrary length.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.720]   So you record it, you open TweetReal,
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.760]   and say, send this video, and then what it does,
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.760]   it uploads it, like Audible, uploads it to its servers,
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.480]   and then sends a tweet saying Leo's posted a new video.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.120]   The negative is, of course, that that video
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.360]   is stored on TweetReal servers, but it worked,
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.040]   and I was able to get, you know, Twitter was blocked
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.440]   in China in my last few days.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.040]   Twitter, Facebook, Friend Feed.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.040]   - But you get to that.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.920]   - They were all blocked, but I could still use TweetReal,
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.920]   'cause I guess it was new,
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.280]   the Chinese authorities hadn't figured out,
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.440]   so I'm sending out videos, which is more--
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.880]   - I can't get out, I can't get out, it was great!
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.360]   - Which is, TweetReal would be the one
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.880]   that you think China would want to block,
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.840]   because of course that's the one that's gonna get video
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.960]   and everything else up of--
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.760]   - I'm sure they will once they figure it out.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.440]   - I was surprised that when I got there,
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.160]   YouTube was blocked, and by the time I left YouTube,
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.480]   Facebook, Friend Feed, and--
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.400]   - Well, they realized you were coming,
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.400]   and they were like, well--
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.520]   - I was wondering, you know, is it,
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.800]   'cause I'm sending so much stuff?
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.800]   (laughs)
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.000]   I didn't say anything nasty.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.560]   I had a great time at a wonderful time, but--
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.320]   - I thought you were very respectful of China
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.480]   and its current situation, and I got a real good feel
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.400]   for what was happening, based on what all of you
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.600]   are sending back, I followed the whole thing vicariously.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.440]   - Yeah, Don, the counter--
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.280]   - And Alistair was booing, and he did a lot of stuff, yeah.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.360]   - Well, and the boo thing, I become completely outdated.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.200]   The boo thing, my audience likes the boo thing.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.400]   - Are you booing toing?
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.760]   - I'm booing toing.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.680]   - Yeah, I'm right up there, and I don't get the juice
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.800]   from boo that you do, but every once in a while,
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.840]   I show up on the favorites page, and it's a great way
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.840]   to share, and Andy yesterday, and I had a conversation
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.280]   for managing your digital life, and he said,
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.320]   without a doubt, the iPhone was the single most important
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.200]   piece of technology he brought on the trip.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.440]   - Well, and to get to go full circle, that's why I think
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.120]   you're right, that the tablet might be a good product,
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.160]   'cause I do notice that I use the iPhone
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.440]   like a full-fledged computer when I'm out there.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.280]   I mean, that feels a little strange.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.640]   - And I have to say that, the more I thought about it,
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.520]   I don't really want a keyboard and everything else
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.360]   all the time.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.960]   There's a lot of times when I'm quite happy
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.080]   with just surfing things and moving around with my iPhone,
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.840]   that if I just had a bigger screen, I'd be quite happy.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.000]   Now, there are times when I'd like to write something
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.080]   longer, and then I'd want a keyboard, but I've actually got,
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.120]   you know, I sit in classes now, or I've sat in a couple
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.120]   seminars, and I'm taking notes, and I'm taking notes
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.920]   in my iPhone, and especially as soon as I can turn
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.360]   that iPhone sideways and get a larger keyboard,
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.040]   I literally increased my typing speed by 30 or 40%.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.960]   I mean, it was amazing.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.200]   - Well, you know, one of the things that kind of took me up
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.800]   a little bit, and you probably saw the Tech Crunch article
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.880]   by M.G. Seagler, the AT&T is a steaming heap of failure.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.560]   (laughing)
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.720]   - It got a lot of attention everywhere.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.840]   I mean, it was the trending topic on Twitter
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.600]   for a couple of days, and I had to kind of concur with him,
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.360]   'cause we're at the same time he's complaining about
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.280]   a variety of things, including a failed voicemail system
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.280]   that he wasn't getting his visual voicemails
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.800]   for a long period of time.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.120]   I didn't happen to me, but, you know, I'm using the usage meter,
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.000]   which, you know, you presume, in fact, AT&T's own recommendation
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   is if you're, I bought the 100 megabytes
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.880]   international data plan, and I'm using the usage meter
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.960]   watching it every day, same thing with Henry.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.760]   He had 50, we were watching it very carefully.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.000]   AT&T also sends you a text message saying
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.480]   you've exceeded your 100 megabytes when you do.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.360]   So I thought, I'm in good shape, and I was very careful
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.640]   when it got to 99.9 on the usage on the iPhone,
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.480]   and I stopped.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.880]   I turned off 3G, I turned off roaming.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.160]   I said, "No, that's a phone now."
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.400]   That was only the last few days of the trip.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.000]   I call AT&T when I get back, they said,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.440]   "Yeah, I used 251 megabytes."
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.920]   I said, "Wait a minute.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.320]   "The phone says 100 megabytes."
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.560]   They were saying, "I used 250% more than the phone says.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.400]   "How could that be?"
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.880]   I could see some rounding error.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.400]   I said, "No, that's what it says."
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.760]   So a word of warning to anybody who uses AT&T
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.120]   and the usage meter on the iPhone,
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.120]   there's no relationship to their...
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.120]   This has cost me 750 bucks.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.000]   It's a big rounding error.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:48.840]   - Yeah, it's a huge rounding error.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:49.680]   - That's ridiculous.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.680]   - And you already paid it, and how much did you pay
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.520]   to get the 100 bucks?
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.600]   - Oh yeah, not including the 100 bucks,
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.880]   110 bucks I paid for the 100 megabytes.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.240]   - So they're saying that the phone did not give you
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.720]   an accurate representation of your usage.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.760]   - Yes, and I could see 10 megabytes.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.880]   - Is there a solution?
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.480]   Could you find an accurate representation online?
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.400]   - Yes, you can.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   Well, you can't dial star data, pound sign, I think.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.520]   And they have an application on the iPhone,
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.440]   which I wasn't gonna use,
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.600]   'cause I didn't wanna use data to find out
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.120]   something I thought I already knew,
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.560]   but there's an application on the iPhone
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.160]   that connects your AT&T wireless.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.560]   - Evidently, this is much more important
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.920]   than we expected.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.520]   - Yeah, well, just a word of warning anybody uses the iPhone.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.000]   AT&T is a steaming pile of failure.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   - I'm not gonna disagree with my name.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.040]   - And they even tell you when you leave,
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.280]   make sure you check your iPhone usage.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.120]   - Which you did.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:45.240]   - Which I did, I trusted it, I have pictures from the,
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.680]   so I don't know what to do about it,
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.680]   I'm gonna pursue it obviously.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.280]   - AT&T joins the longest companies whose motto is,
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.480]   "We're not happy until we're not happy."
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.200]   - It's pretty appalling.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.040]   - It's pretty appalling.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.720]   - Everything, you know, their billing has just
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.200]   flapped, sucked forever, and that was, you know,
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.200]   back to the old days of the Apple phone show,
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.640]   the very first comment I made about AT&T being the carrier
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.440]   with the iPhone was, "Oh, 'cause their billing sucks."
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.520]   I had trouble with them from day one,
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.680]   in fact, had to start home phoneover
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.720]   because of some billing problems, it did get them fixed.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.960]   I haven't experienced all the other problems people
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.880]   talking about like battery problems or--
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.200]   - No, I love my iPhone.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.000]   This is the sad, terrible one.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.960]   - I can tell you, I just opened a bill with a shock
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.080]   every time wondering if it's gonna be accurate.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.080]   - Well, I've asked for an itemization of all the data,
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.520]   I'm gonna see where, okay, how did this happen,
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.240]   where did it go wrong?
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.440]   It's possible that something happened.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.280]   - I don't know.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.960]   - I mean, I could see if there are 50 megabytes,
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.000]   over 250 megabytes.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.840]   - That's a lot of accuracy.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.120]   - That's a lot of accuracy.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.200]   - I can understand 10.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.960]   So perhaps the moral of the story is to buy the 250 megabyte
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.800]   pumping. - Oh, you can't,
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.000]   I mean, it's really expensive.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.400]   (laughs)
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.040]   I don't even think, I don't even know if they offer it.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.200]   - How much was it 100, Lee?
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.200]   - 100's, 110 dollars, more than a buck of megabyte.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.440]   But the thing is, if you go over,
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.840]   it's five bucks a megabyte.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.160]   - Oh, and I went to it when I was in,
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.480]   when I was shooting in Europe, I didn't have it,
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.800]   but I was watching all the data, just figuring out,
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.880]   I knew that I'll spend maybe $100 on roaming.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.840]   It was $800 over--
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.320]   - So you gotta buy the international.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.160]   - So then when I went to Japan,
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.640]   I bought the international plan, of course,
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.480]   now that what happens if you don't forget to turn it off,
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.200]   again, it was charging every month.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.160]   So I don't know if you got, you probably got it one time.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.000]   I got the monthly one
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:31.840]   'cause I was gonna be in and out of the company.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.560]   - No, I got the monthly one.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:38.560]   And one way the AT&T has reduced this a little bit,
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.040]   has said, well, your contract date is in the middle
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.280]   of your trip, so what we're gonna do is make it two monthly ones.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.280]   And so then I get 200 megabytes
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.120]   for an additional $100.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.280]   And so I only have to pay $250 for the overage.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.000]   So instead of paying 750, I'm paying 350.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.120]   But my content, well, first of all, for all of you,
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.080]   what I'm really saying, who cares about my problem,
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.680]   is if you don't watch the usage meter on your iPhone,
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.760]   and I'm saying AT&T, you gotta fix this problem
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.480]   'cause you've got a phone that you're selling
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.880]   that has usage information
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.280]   that is apparently completely worthless.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.120]   So that's all I'm--
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.720]   - Yeah, that's just totally unacceptable.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.240]   - Yeah, I mean, if it doesn't work, folks, tell us.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.200]   And say don't use it.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.320]   Don't in your own documentation say,
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.800]   use the usage meter on the phone
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.480]   'cause it's broken, it doesn't work.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.880]   Speaking of iPhones, did you see this terrible story?
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.480]   This just came out.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.280]   Apple has confirmed the death of a man
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.160]   who worked at the iPhone plan in China at Foxconn.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.600]   According to Chinese media reports,
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.880]   the worker at Foxconn committed suicide last week
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.920]   after a fourth generation iPhone prototype
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.080]   for which he was responsible went missing.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.480]   So this guy took this so seriously
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.520]   that this prototype, of course,
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.120]   he was probably more afraid of steep jobs.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.840]   - I was just about to say.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.800]   I was gonna make that joke,
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.000]   but thought it could be too soon.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.960]   - Yeah, he just didn't wanna hear about it.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.840]   - I would rather die than be caught by the seat.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.440]   - I mean, that's gotta be, you know--
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:09.560]   - It'd be years of pay.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.480]   - Yeah, I feel bad for the guy.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.760]   I think he probably overreacted,
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.440]   but that just shows you what a big deal it is.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.680]   - Now, do you think we'll see this
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.360]   for G iPhone show up somewhere?
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.640]   Well, I don't think we would see a 4G iPhone
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.920]   before January unless there was a tablet.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.760]   So maybe it was a tablet.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.640]   - Well, don't we need some 4G service someplace
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.320]   before that makes any sense?
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.240]   - You know, it was a fourth generation or 4G?
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.720]   - 4G, whatever that means.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.560]   That could be--
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.640]   - I think it could be either.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.760]   I don't know what it means.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.360]   It could be a fourth G wireless or fourth G phone.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.200]   - Well, AT&T isn't offering any 4G that I'm aware of.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.040]   - No, no.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.800]   - In Japan, they supposedly have 4G.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.440]   You should see their phones.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.240]   Everybody, there was a big article in the Sunday time
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.760]   saying, "Oh, it's too bad we can't get the Japanese phones."
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.560]   You want a clunky phone.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.240]   Most of them are flip open one way or the other.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.080]   They're huge, big.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.400]   I mean, they're like little computers,
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.640]   but it turns out in Japan,
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.440]   a lot of people don't have personal computers.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.680]   They have their phone.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.560]   So a lot, but all of it's proprietary.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.640]   I don't think we want that.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.200]   - What's amazing is how much you can do with your phone.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.720]   You know, the video chats,
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.960]   all the other stuff.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.200]   I mean, they handed me one when I got to Japan.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.680]   That was my local phone.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.560]   And I barely could understand.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.280]   I mean, I felt like an old person.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.120]   - It's a different internet.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.720]   - I was like, "I don't know what to do with this."
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.160]   You know, people are watching TV on it.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.840]   - Yeah, oh yeah, a lot of TV.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.920]   And they complain that we can't get these phones here
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.880]   for a variety of reasons.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.680]   One, because they think we're too stupid to use them.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.920]   - And now I was.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.240]   (laughing)
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.560]   - Well, one thing they know, these manufacturers,
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.040]   and it's Panasonic, it's all the companies you'd expect.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.000]   - NEC, but one thing they know is that
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.760]   Americans don't read manuals.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:48.600]   - Right.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.800]   - So if you're not gonna read the manual,
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.160]   we're not gonna let you have fun.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.960]   - You don't need, for a Japanese phone, my experience was,
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.800]   you pretty much need to go to a class.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.640]   Like I really would need,
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.440]   I needed like a tutor to understand it.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.840]   - So more detail, this is from a digital beat.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.000]   The fellow's name was Sun Dan Yang.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.720]   He was a recent engineering graduate,
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.120]   had landed a job handling product communications
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.680]   for Foxconn in the Shenzhen.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.000]   That's the world's factory,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.360]   it's in the Guangdong Province near Hong Kong.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.560]   He was tasked with shipping iPhone prototypes
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.200]   from Foxconn to Apple.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.880]   Why that's sad.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.440]   Apple says, "We're saddened by the tragic loss
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.280]   "of this young employee.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.360]   "We are awaiting results of the investigations into his death.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.920]   "We require our suppliers to treat all workers
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.600]   "with dignity and respect."
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.520]   So Sun got 16 prototype phones from the assembly line
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.960]   at a local Foxconn factory.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.040]   At some point in the next few days,
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.280]   he discovered that one of the phones was missing.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.920]   He suspected it had been left at the factory,
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.160]   but couldn't find it.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.480]   On July 13th, he reported the missing phone to his boss.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.400]   That Wednesday, three Foxconn employees
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.600]   searched his apartment illegally according to Chinese law,
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.240]   but there's no Chinese law.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.520]   There's no, no.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.920]   Accusations are flying that Sun was detained
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.000]   and physically abused during the investigation,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.320]   although this has not been substantiated.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.440]   What is known that a little after 3 a.m.,
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.560]   he jumped out of a window in his apartment to his death.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.640]   So I think we wanna actually follow this story,
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.040]   make sure that in fact there was no abuse involved.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.080]   I can understand the shame might have driven him to that,
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.080]   but I hope it will be so long.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.640]   - Well, in that culture, that shame is a big factor.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.440]   Saving face is a big deal for those folks.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.440]   So that could be a real factor.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.960]   - So people like Sun are pretty helpless
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.360]   when things go wrong in Apple's supply chain.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.080]   Stephen Lin, a Chinese blogger and marketer says,
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.280]   "Students like Sun have been studying in schools for years.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.240]   "They've been carefully protected by their parents.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.800]   "They can't endure such pressure.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.680]   "Their house being illegally searched or house arrests.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.920]   "Employees at these and other factories
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.480]   "sometimes kill themselves simply because of the pressure
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.520]   "from their daily jobs.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.640]   "You know what's going to happen
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.920]   "when they face more serious threats."
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.120]   Also, young Chinese guys don't have friends who are lawyers,
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.440]   so they don't know how to protect themselves
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.480]   in the legal system.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.320]   They won't even look for help from the legal system.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.400]   They'll just endure the pressure.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.720]   And finally, sometimes find an extreme way
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.680]   to end all their troubles.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.000]   So that's a very sad story.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.240]   Nothing more really to say about it.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.760]   I'm sure that not an end,
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.840]   a consequence Apple was looking for.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.960]   But what would that phone be?
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.440]   It must have been a tablet, right?
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.280]   - I think so.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.120]   - If it were a tablet,
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.440]   you could see where the pressure would be pretty intense.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.600]   - Well, I think doing work for Apple in general
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.520]   would be the pressure would be intense
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.440]   because it's so hard.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.440]   I mean, you're the amount of money
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.720]   people are willing to pay you for a photo or whatever
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.960]   would be the equivalent of a month of salary.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.360]   So consequently, I'm sure the security and pressure
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.800]   in the factories specifically working for Apple
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   are pretty high.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.120]   - Yeah.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:52.960]   I have to say,
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.680]   I was very happy with the iPhone's performance in China
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.240]   despite the data issue,
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.960]   but that's an issue anywhere you go.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.040]   That's not, but it's a great little travel device
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.120]   and it really points up how you can use it as a computer.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.320]   And if you're somewhere where, you know,
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.360]   traveling around the US or somewhere where data is not
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.360]   so pricey, wow, this is great.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.440]   - You know, I don't,
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.360]   I just can't imagine being without it when I'm traveling.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.040]   I was telling someone to ask me
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.360]   what I thought of an iPhone.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.200]   - And the GPS at all.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.320]   - I pulled it out in the airport,
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.040]   someone asked me what I thought of it and I said,
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.320]   "When I think about the time before I had an iPhone,
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.320]   I really think of it as a time before time."
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.800]   (laughing)
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.920]   - Well, it just shows you.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.000]   - This is pretty serious stuff.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.280]   - Well, you just feel like, you know,
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.920]   I just feel like I watched someone trying to figure something
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.920]   out on even a GPS that goes into a car
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.760]   and I can sit there and Google.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.600]   - It's much easier.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.120]   - Google will figure it out, boom, boom, boom.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.840]   I know exactly when they're open, when they're closed,
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.840]   I have the phone number, I have the GPS
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.000]   and I know other phones do it,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.720]   but other phones don't do it as seamlessly.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.200]   You know, and I think that's the, you know,
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.280]   that's the real issue and that's what I'm looking for.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.560]   And I have to admit, I'm looking forward
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.400]   to being able to read books on the tablet.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:00.080]   I was literally getting ready to order a Kindle last week.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.200]   - Well, I lost my Kindle on the trip.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.080]   - Did you really?
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.120]   - The DX or the regular one.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.280]   - Regular one, I didn't have a DX.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.640]   And I, because I'm in the middle of a book
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.840]   that I just totally grossed and I'm reading on the iPhone,
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.120]   it is not the same.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.200]   It's really hard to read it on the iPhone.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.880]   - Yeah, people tell me at all the time
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.080]   when they see my Kindle, they're like,
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.480]   "Why don't you just read on your iPhone?"
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.160]   I said, "Have you ever read a book on the iPhone?"
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.920]   - It's not the same, unfortunately.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.880]   - Yeah, but I was just about to buy a Kindle
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.800]   and then I watched the whole thing with him taking 1984 down,
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.000]   removing it from people's--
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.160]   - Yeah, that's pretty shocking.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.040]   - And I was like, "Oh, I'm gonna take a little time."
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:33.880]   - Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.800]   - I backed up real quick.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.640]   - Yeah, Amazon.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.200]   So the story on that, just so everybody understands,
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:42.320]   is that Amazon has a way of quickly publishing books
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.560]   of to the store and selling them
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.000]   with apparently little oversight.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.280]   So somebody who didn't have the rights
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.240]   to the George Orwell books put them up
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.640]   in the Amazon store for sale on the Kindle.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.880]   I don't know how many people nobody knows bought them.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.200]   - Are we sure, 'cause some of the news I had
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.040]   wasn't the publisher?
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.120]   - No, the new original news was wrong.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:58.960]   - Okay.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.640]   - So this was corrected by Amazon later.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.840]   This was somebody who just published it without rights.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.800]   Amazon, when informed of that by the publisher,
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.880]   had the rights, made the big mistake of yanking them off
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.440]   of the Kindle, reaching into people's kindles
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.480]   and deleting them.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.440]   They did credit you for the sale in the Amazon store.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.600]   Of course, a hue and cry.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.480]   Amazon has said, "Okay, we're wrong.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.960]   We're not gonna do that again."
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.800]   - Okay, exactly.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.880]   - We will never do that again.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.520]   I see we were wrong to do that.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.240]   But I can understand why they might feel like they could do that.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.200]   - Nevertheless, it does raise that huge issue
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.600]   that they can go in there and do that stuff.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.480]   - I took a step back.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.000]   I decided I'm waiting until October.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.160]   Like literally, I was ready to buy a DX.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.800]   The Economist is now being published to it.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.080]   And I was ready to buy a DX.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.080]   And literally when that happened,
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.920]   I was like, "I'm just gonna wait and see how it comes out."
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.760]   'Cause that was something I told her.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.360]   - But I just wanted, I just played devil's advocate.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.080]   I mean, what should they do in that?
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.400]   - The same thing a bookstore would do.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.480]   Let's say-- - Stop selling it.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.320]   - Yeah, stop selling.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.240]   Same thing a bookstore would do.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.040]   If it, let's say this happens in a bookstore.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.120]   They've discovered that, oh, they've been selling a book
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.200]   that the person didn't have the rights to print that book,
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.960]   which by the way happens all the time.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.240]   They pull it off the shelves and that's that.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.640]   They don't come to your house,
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.560]   take it off your nightstand and leave a $5 bill on there.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.200]   They can't and they shouldn't.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.680]   And I don't think Amazon should have done that either.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.680]   And I think Amazon knows that now.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.520]   I don't think they should have done that.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.560]   - How would you have felt they offered people the choice?
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.760]   - Yeah, maybe that.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.440]   One thing they do have the capability of doing I presume
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.400]   is sending a note to everybody who has a Kindle,
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.840]   maybe even on the Kindle saying,
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.720]   "Hey, we've discovered these 1984 books are,
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.960]   you know what the right thing to do is,
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.360]   we've discovered these books are wrong.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.960]   We would like to replace your pirated version
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.000]   with the real version at no cost to you."
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.120]   - Yeah, that would have been much more.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.400]   - Or refund your money.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.560]   - Or refund your money and give you the choice.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.400]   - Right.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.120]   - I think you hit it on the head right there, Leo.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.640]   The right thing to do would be offer super duper,
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.000]   uber customer service and say,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.120]   "It's not our fault, but it is our problem
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.160]   and here's how we're gonna fix it."
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.520]   - Yeah, I mean, this is a huge black mark.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.720]   And it was a huge black mark and it could have been a huge,
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.160]   you know, gold star for them.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.280]   If they'd handled that well, you know,
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.560]   people would have been, "Oh, wow, this is a great assertion."
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.080]   - That said, I'm not worried about any of my legitimate
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.520]   books disappearing and being out anything.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.360]   I don't have any concern over that.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.840]   They, you know, they did give money back to people,
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.680]   so nobody was out any money.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.960]   I just, I do think they handled it poorly,
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.640]   but I'm not like planning to keep up my Kindle
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.480]   because of it.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.320]   I enjoy reading on it.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.520]   - Well, I'm not giving up my Kindle either,
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.600]   but I think twice about buying another one
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.680]   and I realized I'm so hooked on it, I have to.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.520]   - It's like a drug.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.360]   - It's a drug.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.520]   And so I, of course, did buy another one, but--
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.360]   - Wait, Win and Prince,
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.680]   - I seriously are going to buy it.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.520]   You already did?
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.360]   - Yeah, I did.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.200]   Well, you know, I was--
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.760]   - What did you mean?
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.360]   - Oh, don't tell me they lowered the price again.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.720]   I bought it on Monday or yesterday, Tuesday,
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.720]   or Sunday.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.560]   - Just kidding.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.200]   - No, they lowered the price, $2.99.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.240]   They've already lowered the price, right?
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.080]   - That's it.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.480]   - Much more affordable now.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.360]   - And I looked at the DX, but there was a three,
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.360]   three week wait and I said,
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.440]   "I can't, I'm in the middle of this book, I've got to finish this book,
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.280]   and I cannot read it on my iPhone."
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.400]   That is a nice feature, though.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.480]   You can at least still read it on the iPhone.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.320]   - Right.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.120]   - If you lose your Kindle or if you still have an iPhone.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.600]   - I bought the, or not bought,
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.160]   I got the new free book from,
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.400]   you know, from the,
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.200]   you know, from the editor from Wired Magazine.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.040]   - Oh, free.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:14.880]   The book is called free.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.720]   - Yeah, free.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.560]   - So I got it since free.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.080]   - It was free last week if you downloaded it.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.360]   I think Andy you twittered it.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.520]   - Why isn't it free all the time?
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.920]   If the guy's saying,
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.240]   "Here's his thesis, everything should be free."
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.840]   Chris, your book,
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.000]   it should always be free.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.040]   Oh, well, anyway.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.840]   Yeah, I ordered, you know, this is another one.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.760]   You know, I left it next book should be called Poppy Cop.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.920]   - I left it in the seat back at a,
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.400]   on my Northwest flight, Northwest 28.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.120]   I was in business class, left it in the seat pocket.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.680]   Get off the plane, go through customs,
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.040]   'cause we were landing in the US,
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.600]   realized immediately,
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.760]   oh, I don't have my Kindle,
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.360]   went to the front desk, they called down this,
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.720]   and now we don't see it.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.640]   - I've left that Lost and Found thing here.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.200]   If you find it, call me, and I haven't heard anything.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.080]   Either somebody getting off the plane snagged it.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.400]   - Do you label your stuff?
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.440]   - No, it was not labeled.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.440]   - I put stickers on it.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.840]   Like when I travel, I have one of those little
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.600]   those little, those brother labelers.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.160]   I have one in my house on my desk,
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.360]   and literally when I travel,
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:17.000]   everything that has a flat surface has my name and my number.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.560]   'Cause what I found was that people will actually call you
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.400]   if it's on there.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.240]   I mean, when you forget it,
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.400]   it's amazing how people are a lot more honest than they--
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.080]   - I should have put my name on it.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.520]   But clearly what happened is,
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.120]   is somebody snagged it on the way out,
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.080]   or a steward is snagged it,
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.960]   and did not report it that they were, it was found.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.800]   - I go a step further,
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.960]   I put a $25 reward if found, please call.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.800]   - I should have done that,
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.640]   I don't know what I was thinking.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.520]   I do it on most things.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.000]   - Right, I just did that.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   - I actually got it, I got the habit from you.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.840]   - Yeah.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.080]   - And then I turned it up for a little less labeled.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.200]   - Yeah. - Right, yeah.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.040]   Except for that.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.640]   - See, now I know that we can additionally,
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.520]   ladies and gentlemen,
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.680]   in addition to following Alexander airplanes,
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.960]   you now know to follow legal onto airplanes,
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.320]   and your technology collection will be substantial.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.520]   - And Rask says, "Actually it was Amazon
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.680]   "delivered the Kindle."
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.920]   (laughing)
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.240]   - They deleted your Kindle legal,
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.520]   right from your bag.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.880]   - And here's a,
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.120]   DJ Scarett points out in our chatroom,
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.000]   and this is a good point.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.680]   What if you were a student reading 1984,
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.360]   you'd taken a lot of notes, the notes?
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.160]   He says that he believes the notes go with the book.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.000]   I don't think that's the case,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.760]   the notes are in a separate file, aren't they?
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.600]   - No, but I just know--
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.520]   - That would be bad.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.520]   - I'd be peeved.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.360]   - That would be really bad.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.200]   - That would be really bad.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.040]   - That's a good point.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.040]   That's the first really solid one I've heard.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.760]   - You know, you take notes,
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.880]   there's a separate notes and clipping file,
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.480]   but of course they refer to lines on the book.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.320]   I think you're notes--
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.280]   - I think you could be a sidecar file
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.640]   that would be attached to the book,
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.600]   and if the book was gone,
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.680]   then the sidecar file would nowhere to go.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.720]   - I'd have to check that, that's interesting,
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.800]   'cause your notes and clipping file is a separate file
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.200]   on the Kindle, but you're right,
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.840]   it could be attached somehow to that book,
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.760]   in some way the book goes away, the sidecar goes away.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.600]   - But we're gonna have,
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:54.240]   you know, the whole grail continues to be this one device
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.840]   you can carry, and I don't think we're ever gonna have it.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.760]   I mean, you're gonna have to,
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:02.080]   in the iPhone, Errington wants to post a crunch pad,
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.120]   there's gonna be the Mac mini, Mac book,
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.160]   the Mac, tablet, the Mac, whatever.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.080]   I mean, you know, people are still gonna carry
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.780]   multiple devices no matter what.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.320]   - Yeah, I guess you're right, but you're right,
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.280]   it's where we wanted to go anyway.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.600]   Hey, let's come back and talk about Microsoft.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.280]   Apple's a little peeved at them
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.160]   for the laptop Hunter ads.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.160]   - You know, I don't believe that.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.200]   - Well, let's talk about it.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.520]   - Save your powder as they would say back
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.440]   when Scott was in the Revolutionary War.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.280]   - Thank you.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.240]   (laughing)
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.440]   I'm getting my little ball loader ready.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.400]   (laughing)
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.560]   - Do they use Flintstocks,
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.160]   or had they moved on to something a little more advanced?
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.400]   - You know, we'd moved all the way up to the M1 car
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.240]   being by the time I got there, buddy.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.280]   - All right, I'm not messing with you.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.240]   I wanna talk about go to meeting, my friends.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.800]   Go to meeting from the great folks at Citrix.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.640]   We love go to meeting.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.960]   They are a regular sponsor of all our shows,
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.560]   because, well, they know that you're smart people
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.880]   and smart people are interested in maximizing
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.480]   their time and their money.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:10.080]   Business travel just kills companies' profits.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.840]   You don't have to ask me.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:15.120]   Man, it is expensive these days.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.000]   And frankly, if you're traveling to meet clients
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.400]   or colleagues, I understand the value of that face-to-face
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.360]   and certainly sometimes you're gonna have to do it,
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:27.360]   but how nice, I've spelled the coupon code M-A-C-B-R-E-K.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.920]   No, there's an A in there.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.960]   I'm not kidding.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:35.520]   How nice, wouldn't it be if you could have a meeting
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.360]   that was as effective as a face-to-face meeting
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.480]   without actually leaving your office?
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.040]   That's where go to meeting is so fantastic.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.560]   We use it now all the time.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.120]   We use it on our shows.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.040]   We use it.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.680]   We've found more uses for go to meeting.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.480]   And I know you will too.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.760]   That's why I've got a 30-day free trial for you.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:54.280]   If you go to go to meeting.com/macbreak,
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.000]   no cost, absolutely no cost to you,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.240]   unlimited meetings for a month,
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.840]   so you can really find the many, many ways
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.440]   you'll be using it.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.200]   Save money, save time, driving, or flying.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.800]   It's great for sales presentations.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.000]   We use it on Maxwell's house,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.080]   rate as the screenshots,
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.160]   and I can see them that way,
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.440]   and we can broadcast them that way,
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.760]   and they're beautiful.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:15.600]   And it's real time,
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.720]   and they make the pointers big.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.680]   It's easy to see.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.240]   We can even trade control of the document.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.640]   I can show them documents on my desktop.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.840]   That's why it's so good for training.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.320]   You could say, here's how this program works.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.880]   Now you try it.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.640]   Collaboration on documents.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.480]   I've used it for that,
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.440]   for speeches, preparing speeches.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.760]   Just about any kind of conference call.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.600]   You're gonna love it from Citrix, of course.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.640]   That makes it the easiest,
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.720]   the most secure way to hold an online meeting,
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.440]   and it just takes a minute.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.600]   You could, if you start now,
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.200]   you'll have it done before I'm done.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.600]   Go to gotomeeting.com/macbreak,
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.040]   and then after your first free month,
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.320]   if you decide to buy just 49 bucks a month,
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.080]   that's less than one plane ticket,
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.240]   for unlimited meetings too,
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.720]   and compare that to the other guys.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.640]   I mean, meet as much as you want,
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.240]   as long as you want.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.360]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.600]   We thank them so much for their support of the Mac Break Show.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.440]   Give it a try.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.560]   I know you're gonna love it.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.800]   I use it all the time.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.000]   In fact, I'm mad at myself,
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.280]   'cause I had to go to my PC setup,
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:13.440]   and I didn't think of using it
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.040]   when I was in China for getting to Facebook,
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.920]   and Twitter, and all that.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.880]   And I bet you there's a slant.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.520]   Yeah, what was I thinking?
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.560]   What was I thinking?
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.440]   That's okay, they would have banned that too empty.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.960]   I know. (laughs)
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.680]   Here's a blog post from Virgil,
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.880]   that my Kindle 8, my homework,
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.680]   this is from the Huffington Post.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.680]   So, apparently it is true.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.560]   Well, I don't know.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.400]   No, this is just somebody,
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.560]   this is just somebody
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:49.520]   guessing that this might be the case.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.960]   So again, I don't have confirmation
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.720]   that the Kindle would eat your notes.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:55.080]   Moving on, Apple apparently demanded
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:45:00.160]   that Microsoft stop advertising PC's price advantage over Macs.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.520]   Microsoft's COO, I think,
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.280]   I bet you're gonna say the same thing.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.960]   All right, I won't say what I think.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.080]   Microsoft's COO, Kevin Turner,
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.920]   relayed a funny story about Apple the other day,
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.200]   the Cupertino Mac Maker,
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.960]   recently, according to Microsoft,
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.880]   recently called Microsoft and demanded
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.440]   that the software giant stop running
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.240]   its laptop hunter ads on TV.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:25.520]   Turner revealed how desperate Apple is
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.840]   to prevent people from realizing
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.720]   how much more expensive Macs are than PC's.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.120]   All right, go ahead.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.320]   Fire away, Alex Lindsey.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.280]   And he said that it was from the legal department.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:36.960]   You know, an Apple called someone
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.480]   at the legal department, called him and said,
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.440]   "You know, we're making the laptop's cheaper or something."
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.640]   Like, there was some kind of, you know,
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:43.880]   and can you take those down?
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.920]   He said, "Hey, you need to stop running those ads.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:47.640]   "We've lowered our prices."
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:52.160]   Yeah, so anybody from Apple that called Microsoft
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.560]   to say something like that would be fired
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.880]   and they'd probably take their house.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.080]   You know, like, no one at Apple.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.200]   I mean, just this is a minute store.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.040]   You're saying this a minute store.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.320]   No one at Apple. It's a BS.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.240]   No one in Apple legal, definitely.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.360]   As soon as I started reading it,
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.440]   it sounds like Kevin's saying,
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.760]   he's making it up. He's making it up.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.040]   It's a beneficial story that he's completely--
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:09.960]   Oh, yes.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.160]   And you know how much listening,
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:15.600]   I got a simple, simple, simple, two-word sentence to say.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:16.920]   Yes. Prove it.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:17.760]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.600]   Yeah, let's hear those recordings.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:19.600]   Let's see those notes.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:20.960]   Just tell us who it was.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.160]   We wouldn't be calling anybody on the phone.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.960]   They'd be sending a service of products.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.160]   We don't even call people on the phone.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.960]   That's not how you handle this stuff.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:29.800]   No. No.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:30.880]   In fact, it's a certified letters.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.720]   Are you a certified?
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.600]   Well, and even if no one at Apple legal would call
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.760]   and say anything that would be construed that way,
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.360]   if he should name the person,
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.000]   if it is because-- Prove it, Chris.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.040]   Because they don't exist.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.240]   I call it Kevin out.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.680]   It's such an obvious-- Yeah.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.080]   And what's sad is, and the state of journalism
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.520]   in this country sucks.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.520]   That it just keeps on getting reported?
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:55.960]   This story is reported completely without, of course,
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.240]   you know, what's really sad is because of Apple's stance on PR
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.280]   is that they won't respond.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.120]   No, they don't respond.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.720]   And they're right not to respond.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.960]   It's-- they leave it to people like us to say--
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.280]   (laughing)
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.440]   Yeah, the serious case, are you kidding me?
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:11.800]   But I think that 90% of the people who've read this story
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.000]   believe it and think, "Ah, see, they're getting to Apple,"
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.600]   which is, of course, what Microsoft would like you to think.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:18.600]   Right.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.120]   But it's like the little kid who just--
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.000]   I don't know, it's like the scrawny little kid in school
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:22.840]   is like, "Yeah."
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.240]   And then I told him this, and then I told him that,
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.560]   and then he ran away.
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:27.400]   You know--
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.240]   At the same time, they both violate one of the basic tenants
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.480]   of PR, which is you shouldn't, you know--
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:33.320]   Don't mention the other guy.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.160]   You're a competitor.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.480]   Well, Microsoft for a long time didn't, right?
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.320]   Remember?
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.160]   And I think they took a lot of heat
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.680]   for not responding to the switch ads.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:45.200]   I think it would have been okay for Apple to move the switch ads
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.080]   perhaps a little differently than they did,
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.840]   but when they came right out and took on Microsoft,
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.560]   I can say they violated that basic tenant of PR.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.880]   They don't give PR to your opponent,
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.120]   which is why, for instance, when you see politicians
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.280]   attacking each other, they'll say, "My opponent,"
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.920]   they won't say the name because they don't want
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.640]   to increase their name recognition.
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.560]   And you certainly don't understand stuff like the airline
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.640]   saying, "You're a dildo.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.520]   We crashed less often than Northwest."
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.960]   I just-- you know, and Apple has done it really effectively.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.360]   The problem is that I think also,
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.960]   the ads that Microsoft has run, some of them, I guess,
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:20.480]   are somewhat valid, but some of them are just preposterous.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.920]   I mean, the filmmaker who goes in and wants to have the--
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.840]   you know, she lists off the stuff that she wants
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.480]   and everything else, and you're just like, "Are you crazy?"
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.600]   You mean, you know, I'm so many of the major motion pictures
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.480]   that Alex, we know, are made on this movie.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.680]   That's movie maker.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.960]   No, I mean, and the truth is, you know, of course--
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.960]   yes, you can buy a PC.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.120]   I've got one right here.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:41.920]   That's cheaper.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.240]   That's $400.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.240]   Right.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.440]   Do you-- I mean, and if somebody's in the market for that,
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.840]   they're going to buy that, but that's not the Mac market.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.600]   Well, and I just always--
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:55.600]   my response is always, I value my time.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.920]   You know, and I just can't--
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:57.840]   This is a perfectly-- you know what?
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.480]   This is a perfectly good PC for surfing the web.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.000]   Yeah, I'm not going to edit movies with it.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.280]   I'm not going to do Photoshop with it.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.760]   I didn't bring it to China with me.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.760]   Right.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.760]   It's not that kind of a workhorse,
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:11.400]   but for surfing the web and getting your email, it's fine.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.240]   And I did say-- I think while you were gone,
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.560]   Scott and I talked about it a little bit.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.520]   I did buy a 13-inch for one of the producers at the office.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.080]   I love those.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.840]   The MacBook 13, I know.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.120]   It's really nice.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.960]   I'm really sad.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.040]   The only reason I bought the 15 is Firewire.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:26.880]   I know, and I--
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.880]   The only reason-- and that's why--
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.000]   that's the only reason we got it for him was because of the Firewire
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.280]   and he needs to be able to get it in and out of those drives.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:36.360]   But it's-- if I didn't have a 15-inch,
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.160]   I'd be really tempted.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.160]   I have to say.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.640]   I just want to point out that this is the second longest
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.960]   I've owned any Mac computer.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.520]   I'm still living my 17-inch-back unit, Ollie.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.480]   Oh, you love it.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.840]   OK, here's the New York Times.
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:52.840]   Justin Gowronski, a 17-year-old from the Detroit area,
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.240]   was reading 1984 on his Kindle for a summer assignment,
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.880]   lost all his notes and annotations when the file vanished.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.560]   They didn't just take the book back.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.080]   They stole my work.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.440]   You know, I think I'm going to go back to the same comment
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.920]   that I had for Kevin, prove it.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.040]   I think people like to jump onto this stuff
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.560]   and do a little faux victimization sometime.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:13.920]   You know, it used to be-- you could say, well,
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:14.720]   it's in the New York Times.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.360]   It must be true, but I don't--
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:19.840]   Yeah, those days are long gone, aren't they?
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:20.840]   I don't think we can say that.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.400]   Well, I think the matter where is, you know,
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:26.160]   people 1 to 15 minutes of fame, the New York Times
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.120]   could be accurately reporting what they were told.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.760]   That means what they were told to accurate.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:31.960]   I'd like to see more.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.520]   But if that's the case, I mean, I think we all agree.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.920]   It was the wrong thing to do.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:38.520]   Yeah, I think your suggestion, Leo, was the best.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.040]   They should have just said, you know what?
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:40.720]   This happened.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.840]   It wasn't our fault, but it's our responsibility.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:48.400]   We've just got the license copy for you and our expense.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.560]   Yeah, that's-- it's simple.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.760]   I mean, you know, it's not a huge expense.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.880]   No, I mean, I think they--
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:53.800]   They screwed up.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.000]   Their process is screwed up.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.560]   If somebody could publish illegally
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.640]   and sell in the Amazon store, then obviously,
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.960]   they need to fix that problem.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.760]   Well, and this is the other side of what everyone complains
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.200]   about with Apple, by the way.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.920]   Is Apple is that people complain too much
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:09.800]   about Apple being touchy about the App Store.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:10.560]   Yeah, isn't that funny?
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.520]   You know, and this is what happens when you're not.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.200]   This is what Apple's afraid of.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:21.720]   Apple did pull free promos for some of these 17-plus, you know,
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.800]   high boobs, things like that.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.760]   Said, you can't give away free promos.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.000]   I understand why they did that.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.800]   Because you can't control who gets it.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:29.680]   Right.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.720]   With a credit card, you can at least do age verification.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:37.600]   Not that my 14-year-old hasn't downloaded worse things
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.280]   than high boobs.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.960]   However, I can understand why Apple did that.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.840]   I don't think to see any reason for a hue and cry over that.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.280]   No.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.680]   Do you-- what about-- OK, what about this?
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:50.320]   Have you seen this?
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.320]   I don't know if you could still download it.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.000]   The iPhone app that lets you score, helps you score.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.280]   It's called Canibus.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.160]   Oh, I saw that.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.040]   And it helps you find--
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.920]   well, because it's-- now, remember, in California,
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:07.920]   it's legal.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.000]   Well, it's not legal.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:09.960]   It's legal if you get another--
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.720]   They're talking about tax in Oakland.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.480]   I fully believe that by next year,
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.320]   California is such a budget crisis
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:17.240]   that marijuana will be completely legal.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.720]   In fact, I keep saying--
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:19.440]   My prediction was--
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.600]   We should be investing in this somehow.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.400]   I should be buying a shop or something.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.640]   And you know, there's 600 acres of land
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.320]   a little west of here.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:24.880]   I would buy it.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.840]   I've been looking at it.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.800]   If it's good potcrows and land, I'd buy it.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.560]   Well, there's another 600 acres this way.
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:30.720]   I'm kind of looking at it.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.160]   And I am not part of this.
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.160]   No, no, we're not presuming it's going to be legal.
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.680]   But-- well, OK.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.040]   The theory I have here.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.280]   There is down on the corner here.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.640]   You looked at this property, this old bank building.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.160]   What was the rent on that?
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.360]   It was $10,000 a month.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.320]   You know what's in there right now?
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.360]   Seeds.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:51.800]   A Mennonite or something, because they're
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.160]   where the funny hats.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.440]   Seed store.
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:57.520]   Now, you can't tell me that selling heirloom seeds
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.960]   is worth $10,000 a month.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:03.080]   So I'm thinking, what are these guys doing in there
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.680]   with a seed store $10,000 a month rent?
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:07.160]   How many--
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.560]   There's a lot of rooms in that back building.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.360]   How much profit is there in seeds?
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:14.240]   There's not-- however, we are at the southernmost tip
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.480]   of the most rich marijuana growing area of California,
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.840]   which is the Mendocino coast.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.440]   Yep.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:22.480]   One of the richest in the world.
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.440]   And I'm just thinking, OK, call me crazy
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.960]   that these guys are investing ahead of time.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.600]   They figure when marijuana is legal,
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:30.840]   guess what kind of seeds are going to be selling?
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.000]   But the seeds aren't worth very much.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.680]   Oh, well, I don't know about that.
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:38.680]   If you have a good prototype for something really extra
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:39.680]   hybridized--
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.240]   You know, if I actually--
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.680]   Not that I know anything about that.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.480]   I don't smoke.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:45.160]   I have smoke.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.400]   I look, I inhaled when I was--
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.400]   Look, our T-shirt.
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:51.360]   Our license plate says THC on it.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.320]   But I don't smoke anymore.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:52.680]   I don't like that.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:53.320]   See, my prediction was--
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:54.160]   I don't like what it does to me.
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:54.520]   My prediction was--
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.320]   I went over it and I don't recommend it.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.680]   And I tell my kids, you must not smoke.
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:57.920]   I had some in Amsterdam.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.320]   I felt like I was trapped in my own body.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:53:59.920]   Yeah, I don't like that.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:00.880]   I'm never going to do it again.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:01.960]   I was just like, whoa.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:02.360]   That was horrible.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:02.880]   Bad for you.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.720]   If you want to-- look, kids, if you want to succeed
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:07.040]   in this business, you need every brain cell you got.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.600]   Do not waste it on that.
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.320]   By the time you get to our age, they're--
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:10.680]   That's it.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.080]   If you are going to waste it, we've got a crop out back.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:15.840]   All right, anyway.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:17.520]   But the-- yeah, it's legal.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.200]   It's so legal in this state that if you drive down Highway
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.560]   1 and 1 here, there's a big billboard
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.480]   that says, marijuana medical evaluations,
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:28.480]   lowest cost possible, call this number.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:31.120]   And all you do is you call up-- and I've been told that all
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.000]   you have to do is say, I'm just a little stressed.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.120]   OK, no problem.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.120]   And they write out a prescription,
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:39.960]   which means you can go to these marijuana pot shops,
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:43.160]   these legal pot shops, pot clubs.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.600]   The feds have been busting them, but now they say they're
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:46.360]   not going to do it anymore.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.520]   Because still against federal law, it's just state law
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:49.320]   that's legal.
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:52.280]   And you can go in there and you can buy-- so this application,
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:55.480]   cannabis, starts by helping you find a doctor who
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.920]   can improve your need.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:02.080]   Then it helps you find the nearest medical marijuana
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:02.680]   facility.
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.680]   It offers precise directions, probably a Google map,
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:08.400]   with big letters.
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.360]   Yeah, turn here.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:14.320]   No, you missed it.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:17.200]   No, and it starts-- most of the directions start off with--
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.120]   dude, man.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.240]   Like-- whoa.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.880]   I have a TomTom.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.880]   TomTom lets you put celebrity voices on here, a navigator.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:26.200]   And I have--
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.000]   Bill and Ted.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:27.500]   Huh?
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:28.000]   Bill and Ted.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:28.840]   Bill and Ted would be good.
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.440]   I have better than that.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:30.940]   What?
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:33.040]   No, see, what's his name now?
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:38.800]   The guy who is an easy writer, and he was in Apocalypse Now.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:39.400]   Robert of all?
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.240]   No, the other guy.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:41.880]   Dennis Hopper.
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.040]   Oh, Dennis Hopper.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.120]   And so his voice is on there.
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:48.360]   And it's exactly-- he says, oh, dude, turn right.
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.200]   And then when you arrive, he says, why would anyone want to go
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.320]   here?
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.640]   It's so stoned.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.440]   It's so stoned out.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.920]   I don't leave it on there, but it's pretty funny.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.280]   I have a series of these apps.
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:02.320]   They're one that helps you avoid police, Friday checkpoints.
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.040]   Well, the new one is-- in fact, Tony put McGamey in there.
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.760]   I don't know why Tony thought this was a good deal.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.440]   There's a new radar speed trap.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:10.680]   And it's very controversial.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.880]   It's called Tran--
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.200]   Trapster for the--
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:13.880]   Why is it--
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:14.520]   I'm down on that.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:17.000]   That's not much different than, hey, I've got a radar detector.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.440]   It's illegal to have a radar detector in your car in California,
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:20.200]   anyway.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.240]   Well, it's not illegal to have an iPhone app.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.080]   It's not illegal to have a radar detector.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:26.440]   It's illegal to have a radar detector mounted on your windshield.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.800]   Oh, it's illegal to use it.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:30.680]   You may own it.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.880]   You may not use it.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:37.320]   Anyway, cannabis, the app also--
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.680]   this is the part I like--
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.880]   helps you find a lawyer who specializes in marijuana
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:44.240]   and relaxes cases.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.800]   And by the way, the new upgrade is coming out,
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.480]   which shows you the location of every in an outburger.
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.040]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:55.040]   And 50 cents for every cannabis purchase--
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.680]   cannabis, the application--
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:00.360]   purchased to a cannabis nonprofit reform fund.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:03.280]   They said, we're going to set it up once the application gets
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.080]   1,000 subscriptions.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.080]   Which means you're done.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.040]   And if you hurry, now you get a free download
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:10.400]   from the Apple movie store of Reefer Madness.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:11.320]   Reefer Madness.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:14.440]   No, Bill and Ted's excellent adventure or high school.
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.240]   What was the--
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.040]   Fast Times--
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:20.440]   Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.680]   How about them, Cheezy John, man?
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:24.760]   This is the Cheezy John.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.120]   My Cheezy fan.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.600]   You see my Cheezy.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.160]   Dave's not here, man.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:30.760]   Dave.
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:31.400]   Dave who?
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.840]   Dave's not here, man.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.240]   All right, so--
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.880]   We just dated ourselves, there.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.720]   Yeah, which is better than dating somebody I don't like.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:44.160]   What?
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.560]   Should we talk about the new version of Skype for Mac people?
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.200]   The theory is that it fixed 130 bugs
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:52.280]   that you can do the screen sharing now between Mac and PC
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.600]   if both are running the most current version.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:58.360]   And they've got a couple of other features
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:01.520]   that are not important to me.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.520]   I always--
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.520]   Because I forgot.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.600]   I just want more power.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:07.720]   Worth noting too, it happens automatically
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:08.680]   when you launch your Skype.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.400]   It'll say, hey, there's a new version you want it.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.680]   Did you see that Microsoft on top of the fact
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.120]   that they're scaring Apple?
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:16.280]   They're moving stores next to the Apple stores
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.480]   or near the Apple store?
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:21.840]   Weird, Apple's real estate guy to help them position these stores.
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:22.880]   Near the Apple store?
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.960]   Now, Microsoft said this once before that we're going to put--
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.200]   But what they'd end up doing is putting kiosks right in front
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.520]   of the Apple stores in malls that would let them.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.600]   Saying, you know, hey, you know, zoon.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.280]   But come on.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.480]   You're going to the Apple store to buy an iPod.
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:38.000]   And there's a kiosk that says zoon.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.440]   What are you going to do about laugh and keep going?
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.760]   You're not going to stop and say, oh, well, maybe I'm making a mistake.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.240]   And I think that they really need to think about who buy--
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.560]   Like, I'm sorry.
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:47.240]   Zoon.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.440]   I shouldn't go there.
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:48.880]   I was saying--
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:50.520]   Well, wait, if you're a real estate expert,
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:53.800]   I would not be putting my stores where Apple puts them.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:54.560]   I would be putting--
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:56.200]   Yeah, you should put it in strip malls.
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:00.560]   Put it somewhere where people are more price conscious--
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:01.040]   Right.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.680]   --where people are more likely to buy.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:03.880]   Now, Gateway was in strip malls.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.960]   And you remember the Gateway retail was a flop.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.000]   In fact, when Apple started its retail, I said,
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.200]   I pointed to Gateway retail.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.000]   See, I said, Apple, you're-- this is crazy.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:12.640]   What are you doing?
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.240]   Boy, was I wrong?
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:18.040]   Well, the thing is that this is the same story
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:20.880]   just a different day.
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:22.560]   Apple comes out with the iPod.
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:24.040]   Microsoft comes out with the Zoom.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:25.760]   Apple comes out with the App Store.
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.560]   Microsoft comes out with the Zoom Store.
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:29.920]   Microsoft can just copy everything Apple does.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:32.480]   And the work, the problem is it's like, well, Apple
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.840]   does keynotes at the very big show.
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:36.200]   Microsoft does keynotes.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.240]   And the difference is that Apple's keynotes
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:41.200]   use these elegant, beautiful slides and everything smooth.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:45.320]   And Microsoft uses a slide with 750 words, 4.5.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.600]   And that's where the retail store can look, too.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:53.000]   I think that for one thing, there was a Microsoft store
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.760]   at the Sony Metreon Center.
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:56.680]   And it was a try.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:57.600]   I remember I forgot about that.
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:01.240]   I'm not compelling because Microsoft doesn't sell hardware
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:01.760]   mostly.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.600]   I mean, it sells mice and stuff.
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.240]   Microsoft's selling software that
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.280]   goes on other people's hardware.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.080]   It's very hard to go to a Microsoft store.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.000]   What are you going to buy a boxed copy of Windows?
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:11.520]   No.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.040]   Right.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.960]   And I have to admit, the Metreon is a place where stores go
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.480]   to die.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.480]   That's true.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.520]   But I went in the store.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.360]   It's just a bunch of boxes.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.200]   It's a bunch of--
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.240]   So what they're going to have to do--
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.840]   It's going to really be an HP store.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:22.800]   It's not going to be a micro--
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.760]   In fact, what are the ads that the laptop hunter adds,
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:24.880]   really?
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.160]   They're HP ads.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.280]   Right.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:27.780]   Right.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:29.280]   At that HP, it's helping to pay--
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.240]   You better believe it.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.240]   Those are HP ads.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:37.240]   Microsoft doesn't really sell anything but bits.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.160]   So I think it's hard to do a store.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.000]   One, I think that the danger that they have
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.720]   is once they start putting out those stores,
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.320]   turning them back off if they don't work
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.560]   is going to look really embarrassing,
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.840]   especially in the right next to the Apple store.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.480]   I think it's kind of a mistake.
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.200]   I'm thinking it might be more of this kind of kiosky thing
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.520]   where it's just this--
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.240]   It's like an army recruiting center next door
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.160]   to a high school or something.
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.520]   You just hope that maybe somebody--
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.320]   Like a drug dealer, right?
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.600]   --make a mistake and drift in by accident.
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.880]   One more story that we're going to get our picks of the week
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:10.120]   and that story is that the long-awaited Apple iTunes
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.440]   update that breaks the pre-syncing has come.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.640]   It's 8.2.1 and pre-no-long.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.040]   Are we surprised?
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:15.880]   I am a little bit.
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.560]   They left it for a long time.
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.120]   They could have done it a month ago.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.840]   I think they were looking at the number of pre-s
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.160]   out there and said it wasn't worth the engineering cost,
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.560]   but maybe they went ahead.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.600]   That might have been a very valuable way
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.440]   of getting some information.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.600]   If you had your iTunes--
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.360]   I don't think that Apple does this,
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.240]   but they could have-- have iTunes report home--
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.080]   oh, a pre is being sunk right now.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.080]   Let's keep an eye on this one.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.560]   You could have gotten some good information out of that.
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.320]   I also think it probably would--
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.360]   given that a lot of the pre-engineers were
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.160]   ex-IPod engineers or an iPhone--
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.840]   They just knew how to do it.
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.080]   That I bet you Apple had to be pretty careful about how
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.240]   they stripped that out to make that work.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.760]   To make it-- they probably couldn't
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.680]   start until they had a pre in their hand.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.520]   And then it was a matter of making careful
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.840]   that they can separate the pre from the iPod
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.400]   and figure out find something--
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.640]   because those engineers, I'm sure,
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.600]   thought about it pretty deeply, thinking
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.800]   that they had beat it.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.640]   And it's got to be hard for people who bought the pre,
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.880]   thinking that they're going to be able to sync it.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.440]   I mean, I didn't think-- I thought
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.400]   that was kind of silly for them to even try or claim
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.960]   that they're going to be able to sync with iTunes,
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.080]   because I was like, Apple is not.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.760]   I can allow that to continue.
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:24.480]   On the other hand, they're going to turn that one right off.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.720]   We're seeing the world to let people that own pre-buy stuff
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.640]   from the iTunes Store.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.140]   Right.
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:31.480]   That's one reason I thought maybe Apple would continue
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:32.480]   it'll allow it just because--
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.360]   It's still revenue.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:33.700]   Right.
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:34.200]   How much is it?
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.400]   Yeah, but they don't make any money on the music.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.480]   Apple doesn't make any money on the music.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.400]   They say they don't.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.560]   I don't think they do.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.200]   That's another one.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.160]   Prove it.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.200]   And they say they don't.
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.640]   I think they make some.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.840]   If you look at three to five of the reports,
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.680]   it's a small percentage of their business,
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.160]   but their thinking is that it drives people to the hardware.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.160]   So they make tons of money on the hardware,
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.560]   but that's why they're not going to let other people
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.240]   survive stuff off there.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:00.240]   They sold a billion and a half--
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:04.600]   a billion and a half songs times three and a half pennies.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:05.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.200]   It's not completely a waste of time.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.360]   It is a termality.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:10.080]   But it is not the kind of revenue that most companies
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:10.320]   would just rule.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.120]   They're not making as much as Walmart would be,
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.040]   but they're making money.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:18.840]   But in the world of Apple, that would be considered noise.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.320]   I mean--
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.440]   Must be nice.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.520]   Not for apps because they're making more money
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.600]   on the applications.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.480]   Apple's making far more money on the applications
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.080]   than they are from music because they're making 30% on that
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.880]   and there's not much download.
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.960]   Most of the applications are much smaller than the songs are.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.480]   And one thing you'll notice is that a lot of times you don't
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.520]   get your invoice from Apple for a couple days.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.480]   They're trying to gang them up so they say--
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.680]   Because I think that does help them save money on the Visa
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.320]   chart.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.760]   But they're making far more.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.280]   The 30% that they're making on the apps
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.800]   is far more than they're making on the music.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:52.320]   So I think that when you see a billion and a half of apps--
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.320]   now we don't know how many were free and how many were bought.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.520]   But I don't buy--
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.760]   I have to--
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.840]   I don't get that many free apps.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:03:59.520]   I look for them.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.880]   But I find that the quality apps are generally--
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.400]   They really--
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:02.960]   I don't think about it.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.120]   People got smart about pricing their apps.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.760]   And they're so cheap that it's a real impulse purchase.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.000]   I buy so many apps.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.560]   So sad.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:11.600]   I want to see photo editing.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:12.600]   So I just bought all of them.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.000]   I think it today is not a cheap app.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.040]   Oh, good.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.840]   Yeah, I mean, I could do an iPhone app because I did--
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.040]   that was my lecture on Mac Mania.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.640]   And I took a lot of--
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.560]   like photo buddy, photo forge, mobile photos, color splash.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.160]   I've bought a lot of expensive apps.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.800]   Because they were really good.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.000]   I mean, it's worth it.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.360]   I like the pre--
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.040]   I like the BlackBerry, but it ultimately comes down
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.120]   to the app store is really what puts this over there.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.400]   Well, and the problem that we talked about before
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:46.520]   is that I've now spent more than $500 on applications
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:46.960]   for my--
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.920]   I am very resistant to even considering another phone
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.160]   because there's so many things.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.360]   And I get to a point where--
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.960]   I'll talk about it when I do my pick.
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.680]   But when you realize that you can randomly--
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.360]   you just need to fix some problem.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.200]   And I was thinking, oh, maybe I'll write that app.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.480]   Maybe that's a good market opportunity.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:04.880]   No, there's like four of them.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.200]   There's four people that thought of this crazy--
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.160]   I mean, just insanely--
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.320]   There's every kind of app out there.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.320]   And I'll talk about it on the pick.
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.720]   There's every kind of app.
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.000]   Well, we're going to take a break, come back,
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   and talk about our picks of the week.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.120]   Never did get Andy Inako.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.880]   I've been calling him kind of off and on,
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.240]   and I haven't heard back from him.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:20.840]   Hope he's OK.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:21.800]   I bet he's just sleeping.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.360]   You know, that jet lag is really tough.
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.360]   He had been up for like 30--
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:27.440]   I find it harder when you fly east.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.880]   So like, when I go to Africa, when I'm in Africa,
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:30.800]   I have a hard time.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.680]   They're like a burly.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.760]   Going west is easy.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.480]   Yeah, when I come back west, when I come back to the United
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.400]   States, I'm like, everyone's always surprised.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:36.920]   I feel fine.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:37.640]   I've been fine to my own.
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.920]   It's hard going--
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.040]   I don't know why that is, but much harder going east
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.640]   than it is going west.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.440]   Somebody come on, give us an explanation.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.280]   A scientific explanation.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.600]   Maybe I'll get Ray Maxwell to do a Maxwell's house on this.
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:48.120]   Why is it?
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:48.560]   It's true.
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:49.920]   When I got to China, I was on--
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:50.440]   I was right.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:50.920]   I was gone.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.160]   Same thing when I went to Australia.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.760]   No problem, no jet lag.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.080]   I hit the ground running.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.880]   Of course, I sleep on the plane trying to get on that
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:57.880]   schedule.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.280]   Did the same thing come at home, and it took me two weeks
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.040]   from Australia before I was better.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.320]   I keep waking up at two in the morning, ready to go.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.640]   Well, now when you get back, we're taking--
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:06.320]   I'm exhausted.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.480]   We're right holding.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.360]   But the--
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.840]   Oh gee, wait a minute.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:10.400]   Wait a minute.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.040]   Oh, no.
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:11.760]   Radhol--
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:12.240]   Where is it?
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:12.880]   Where's the music?
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.880]   I don't have the summer music.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.880]   My Mac won't play music.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:18.960]   The thing that I do, my big thing,
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.360]   is if I land in the day--
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.600]   usually I land sometime during the day--
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.040]   I will not allow myself to go to sleep until 10 o'clock
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:25.960]   at night.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.280]   No matter how like a zombie-ish I feel,
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.520]   I won't let myself--
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.480]   I push myself so that I--
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:32.840]   then I go to bed at 10.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:33.320]   I sleep.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.800]   I go into Comatose State until 8 in the morning.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.560]   And usually I'm 90% back.
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.160]   If that doesn't do it for me, I did everything.
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:42.240]   And I walk in the sunlight with my eyes wide open.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.440]   I am at stay time.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.280]   Did you say two picks?
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.280]   Did you say two picks?
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.000]   For my eyes?
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:46.520]   For your eyes?
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.800]   No, that's a cartoon.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.320]   You don't do that.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.160]   They do that in cartoons, Alex.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.160]   You don't want too many cartoons with Malachi.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:57.160]   It's time for our Audible Pick of the Week.
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.960]   Audible, Audible, Audible, Audible, Audible.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.880]   Audible.com, the place to go for audio entertainment.
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.600]   If you listen to podcasts, I know you already
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.240]   got the idea of filling your brain through your ears.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:10.440]   It's really-- maybe it's just me and maybe it's just those of us
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.600]   who are kind of built that way.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.360]   I suspect it is.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.920]   They say there's many different ways of learning.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.040]   Some people are visual learners.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.560]   Some people have to do it to learn.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.760]   And some people can learn through their ears.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.920]   If you're that kind of person, if you listen to podcasts,
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.240]   makes sense to you, Audible is so cool.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.960]   I mean, I brought with me to China, as I had mentioned,
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.720]   a bunch of books.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.600]   I am learning as I'm walking through the streets of the city.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.520]   I'm seeing the history of it.
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.280]   It is fantastic.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.760]   I learned through my ears.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.840]   It's like pouring stuff directly into my brain.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.480]   I also love listening to fiction that way,
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.120]   because the books come to life.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.040]   I see them.
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.840]   It's like watching a movie.
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:49.680]   Audible.com, it's the single best source for audio entertainment.
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:52.880]   60,000 book titles now and going up all the time.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:56.080]   Radio shows, podcasts, comedy performances.
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:59.720]   Now, we talked about this on Twitter on Sunday.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.960]   Frank McCourt passed away on Sunday.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.720]   I don't know if you know who Frank McCourt is.
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.040]   He just wrote Angela's Ashes and Tiz,
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:11.440]   some of the most beautiful fiction about growing up in Ireland.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:15.680]   And I thought it would be really appropriate to pick Angela's Ashes
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.000]   today as our Audible Pick of the Week,
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.880]   because he reads it.
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.520]   And normally, I'm always a little leery
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.680]   when authors read their own books.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.160]   But boy, does he do a beautiful job with it.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.000]   He brings it to life.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.560]   It's his memoir of his childhood in Ireland,
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.880]   and it is spectacular.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.360]   So my recommendation for this week's Book of the Week,
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:40.400]   Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt, highly recommended it.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:43.600]   It's one of the first audiobooks I think I ever listened to.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.640]   And it blew me away.
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.360]   Now, you can get this free.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:52.000]   You can get this free by going to audible.com/macbreak,
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.240]   audible.com/macbreak.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.160]   You get what happens.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.960]   You'll sign up for a gold account, which gives you a book a month.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.960]   I'm a platinum member, because I need two a month.
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:04.160]   But you get-- try with a good way to start.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.760]   And the first book is free.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.240]   You can go to audible.com and look up Angela's Ashes
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.040]   and listen to a little clip of it.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.480]   Wonderful, wonderful book.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:15.920]   And his second book, Tiz, also a great follow-up to this.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.360]   But I think you must read Angela's Ashes.
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.480]   Sometimes people do say this book is sad.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.280]   It's moving.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:21.960]   It's not sad.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:22.480]   It's moving.
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:24.120]   In the long run, I think it's life-affirming.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.720]   It's really a beautiful book.
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:30.240]   He grew up very poor, very poor in Dublin.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.920]   And of course, rose to become one of the best
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.320]   novelists in the world.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.520]   The late Frank McCourt just passed away on Sunday.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:37.800]   This would be a great way to remember him.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:41.120]   Our Audible Pick of the Week, audible.com/macbreak.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:45.000]   We thank him so much for the support of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.800]   And now it's time, my friends, for our Pick of the Week
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:50.920]   will start with Alex Lindsey.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:55.000]   Well, so you know, my wife had a baby.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:55.680]   What's that?
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:56.680]   I know it sounds crazy.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:58.840]   You're not going to recommend something like what to expect
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.000]   when you're expecting on the iPhone.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.880]   But this is the app I was talking about.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:03.400]   OK.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:07.200]   OK, so I just thought it was hilarious that it existed.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.400]   OK, and so I--
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.400]   and this pick is more of a--
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.120]   if you're expecting, if you're a father,
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.880]   because if you're the father, your job
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.680]   is to pay attention to all kinds of certain things.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.920]   You have to get your wife to the hospital.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.920]   Because you're actually not doing anything of significance.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.040]   You've got to do as much as you can.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:23.840]   You've got to do everything else.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:24.920]   You've got to do everything else.
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.280]   And so one of the things that is always--
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:29.880]   well, always the last two times for my job
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.480]   was I have to keep track of the contractions.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:33.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.720]   I wrote a hypercard script to do that.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.400]   But it all went by the window as soon as she actually--
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.320]   Had the right.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:38.720]   Right.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.480]   But I just have to say that there's
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.520]   this little app called LaborMate.
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.280]   Because I was the--
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:43.600]   LaborMate.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.800]   I was telling her, I'm going to write a app.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:45.880]   I'm not going to get it done for this one.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:47.800]   But I'm going to write an app based on our experience
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.480]   that will let me do it.
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.840]   And I figured, oh, I'll search to see if there's
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.520]   anything else out there.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.280]   And there's three or four.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.560]   For those who've never had a baby,
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.000]   the idea is that the contractions begin, labor begins.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.080]   And you're not supposed to go to the hospital right away.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.000]   You're with my wife.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:58.520]   We go the first--
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.040]   the first contraction, we're like, OK, we're gone.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.640]   But normally, there's some hours of contractions.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.960]   And then when they get to be a certain regular number
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.560]   of minutes apart, I can't remember what that is.
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.480]   What they go, 411.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:10.920]   It's a contraction every four minutes
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.360]   that last for a minute that goes for an hour.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.360]   Then you're supposed to go to the hospital.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.720]   That's like serious contractions.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.480]   So a timer would be very helpful.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.200]   So at first, I was writing them down.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.440]   On the first round, I was typing them in a note on my--
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:24.840]   I wish I still had that on it.
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.720]   Time, time, time, time, time.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:29.920]   Anyway, and so I went up because I was thinking of writing one
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:31.520]   because I was like, oh, this would be simple.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.760]   So laborMate, what it does is you just hit--
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.400]   all you do is you hit start when the contractions hit it
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.360]   and you hit stop.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.240]   And it tells you what the duration, frequency,
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.880]   if you hit start again and stop, it'll keep track.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.880]   So if you hit start again, it'll keep track.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.880]   And I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.880]   I'm like, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:44.880]   If you're single, just in case, you know, I'll tell you, you're on a date, you want to impress a woman?
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.880]   You just say, you whip it out and you say, hey, run it out.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:54.880]   Yeah, well, in that in my case, you whip out the iPhone and you say, I'm ready when you are.
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.880]   I just want to let you know.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.880]   I can time. That's a great item.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.880]   That's a great way to pick up girls, actually.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:02.880]   I bet you hear from them one more time.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:06.880]   By the way, not Dublin Limerick. I apologize. I correct that. Not that one.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.880]   Limerick for Angela's.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.880]   [sighs]
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.880]   Mr. Scott. Mr. Scott E. Borne.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.880]   I have no idea how to follow that, but I'm going to--
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:19.880]   [laughter]
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:24.880]   I have a $30 app from the App Store for the iPhone.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:30.880]   As my pick, it is one of simply the most incredible things I have ever seen.
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.880]   It better be a $30 freaking box.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:36.880]   Let me tell you, if you are a photographer or a cinematographer,
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:40.880]   you will say, why wasn't it $300 because I will have paid that?
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.880]   Really?
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.880]   It's called the Helios Sun Calculator.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:45.880]   Mmm.
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:50.880]   It's available from an oddly named company called ChemicalWedding.TV.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.880]   But it's an iPhone app. It's an iPhone app.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:59.880]   And what it does is it helps you predict the path of the sun from dust to dawn on any day.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.880]   In any place.
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:04.880]   And it does it in a way that just blows your mind.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:10.880]   I mean, you can find out, you know, on any number of looks at this,
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:15.880]   where the sun's path is going to be, they have a thing called Skyview,
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:18.880]   which is literally draws a path of the sun across the sky.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.880]   But then the cool thing is you can hit a button and say, what's going to look like tomorrow?
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.880]   Or, you know, what did it look like yesterday?
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:29.880]   It will show you how long the shadow is going to be.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:30.880]   Wow.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:31.880]   How cool is that?
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:37.880]   Now, if you're taking pictures and you've heard us talk about magic hour or golden light,
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:42.880]   that's all relative to shooting around the time of sunrise or sunset.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:47.880]   So knowing where the sun is in the sky really helps make the difference.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:51.880]   That's just one view you're showing there in the Sky Passaurus.
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:56.880]   There are many other views you can get, but it has an inclinometer,
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.880]   which allows you to predict the sun's height at any given time in the day.
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:00.880]   This is crazy.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:01.880]   Yeah, look at this.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.880]   It reads time and angle.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.880]   It has an international database with 30,000 locations in it,
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:13.880]   but you can use the GPS to put your particular location, make your own favorites.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.880]   And then what's really cool is if you're thinking, well, I'm going to shoot here or here,
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:22.880]   you can have different locations saved and say, oh, well, sunsets are going to be over here.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:27.880]   And it just blew my mind because I've spent a lot of my life chasing the sun.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:33.880]   And in fact, my Japanese friends call me a light and shadow warrior instead of a photographer.
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:37.880]   And this is one of those tools that will tell me instantly what's the sunrise?
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:38.880]   What's the sun's?
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:39.880]   Where's the sun going to be?
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:45.880]   And the height of the sun in the sky means more to a photographer than just about anything else.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.880]   So that is if it's really high sun, you're going to have harsh shadows.
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:54.880]   If you have a low sun in the sky, you're going to have golden light with nice, long shadows.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.880]   And this app for 30 bucks is going to save me quite a bit of time.
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.880]   It's called.
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:01.880]   What is it?
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.880]   Helios.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.880]   Helios Sun Calculator.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.880]   Helios Sun Calculator.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.880]   And it is expensive, but it does sound like it's something that you could really use.
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:18.280]   But I think when you, especially when you get into these professional applications, one
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.440]   that I've just bought that I haven't really started playing with yet is a program called
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.240]   PCAM, which is the cinematography calculator that a lot of people, it was available on,
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.760]   I think, palms and everything else.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.240]   But it's like $40 on the iTunes store.
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:34.040]   And you know, but that's worth it if you're doing that.
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.160]   It has so much information.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:38.520]   So, you know, when people will think that this is a really expensive application, but
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:42.400]   if you're a professional, having that at your fingertips makes just such a huge difference.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:48.720]   HP, you know, makes versions of their classic calculators, the 35 and stuff available on
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.720]   the iTunes store.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:50.720]   It's also 30 or 40 bucks.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:51.720]   They're very expensive.
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:52.720]   Right.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.120]   But when you think about how much an HP 35C cost, it's a deal, right?
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.120]   And it's beautiful.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.920]   I mean, it's perfect rendering even looks kind of aged, you know, it's just, it's got the
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.240]   faux wood and everything.
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.720]   That's how I learned how to use a calculator of my uncles.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.720]   Financial or the scientific.
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:06.720]   The scientific.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:08.720]   And it's all the 25 and the third.
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:11.600]   I can't remember the numbers, but anyway, yeah, pretty cool.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.040]   If you're a RPM fanatic, that's a good choice.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.040]   All right.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.840]   Well, mine is not is a kind of a meta a recommendation.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.800]   And that's because, you know, I did on the Mac Mania cruise, I had to do two lectures.
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:27.360]   One of the sick, my 60 favorite iPhone apps, which ballooned to 90 before I was able to
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.360]   do it.
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:32.600]   I mean, there was no way I 60 90 easy and 60 free applications.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.400]   And that's a little more challenging because there's a lot of great apps that I use and
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.960]   you use that are share where commercial, but these are, these are absolutely free.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.360]   And I've found a lot of good ones.
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.800]   And one of the tools I used is a site.
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.840]   I'm going to recommend, I know you all know it, but I'm just want to tell people who don't
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:48.440]   yet know about it called I use this.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.680]   Have you ever seen I use this?
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.680]   No, I haven't.
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:51.680]   Okay.
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:52.680]   I well, there you go.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.680]   I use this.com.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:57.240]   They have an iPhone section and a Mac section as well as you don't have to pay any attention
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:59.040]   to it in a Windows section.
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:04.320]   And the idea of the site is people will write down programs they like, write reviews, write
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:09.200]   recommendations, and then you can go as I did and look at what the most interesting
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.280]   apps are and what the top apps are.
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:17.300]   So a really great way to find new in, you know, of course you've got to listen to Mac
[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:21.120]   Break weekly for our picks of the week, but that's only three or four a week.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:26.720]   This will actually give you a whole long list of some really excellent stuff based on, you
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.200]   know, how many users have used what the top apps are and so forth.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:33.920]   And I've brought it down because it's got like a little bit of a dig thing going on.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:34.920]   Digish.
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:39.680]   Now I've talked about what Koopa before and what Koopa is kind of automated.
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:44.640]   So that what Koopa is probably a second one that's you would add to your list as well.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:51.760]   Well, Koopa tracks what you do using a little, a little thing that runs in the background.
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.720]   And I'm chief twit on Yakupa.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:55.920]   Wakupa if you want to follow my recommendations there.
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.960]   And I don't really remember what my password is.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:58.960]   So I'm a login.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.840]   No, and I got it wrong.
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:05.720]   So Koopa, so Wakupa is an automated tool, but I use this you have to go in there and enter.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:09.240]   But either way, great ways to figure out what people are using what the most popular apps
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:12.200]   are and to be introduced to new apps.
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:17.280]   The nice thing that I use this is it's really more focused on people giving reviews for
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.280]   the programs that they use.
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:22.960]   So it's a, it's, you know, Wakupa is automatic.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.800]   So you get a probably more accurate list of what people are using.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.440]   But I use this really is a great way to find apps because you can see why people like
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:33.080]   it and what the features are and so forth.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:38.560]   And it has new releases, top apps, interesting apps and reviews.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:44.280]   I use this.com for iPhone and Macintosh.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:48.840]   And I was able to find quite a few freeware programs that I had never seen before because
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:53.840]   you can search by price as well that I was able to recommend on the cruise.
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.160]   So there's my secret.
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.800]   I'm giving it away.
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:58.280]   How I did it.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.280]   Nice.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.040]   Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have concluded yet another fun episode.
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.680]   I don't know where Andy is and I apologize.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:08.160]   I know he's alive because he twittered earlier today that he'd had pancakes for breakfast.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.880]   But evidently too many.
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:10.880]   I'm thinking.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:11.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:12.880]   Exactly.
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:13.880]   He had a stack.
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.960]   He said, I got a couple hours before Mac break weekly.
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.480]   He got in bed and he's.
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:18.480]   You mix sleep.
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:22.400]   Here's the thing is if you mix pancakes with jet lag, you end up with coma.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:26.440]   He's out for the world.
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:27.640]   I do use one password.
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.560]   It just doesn't always remember all my passwords.
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:32.560]   Somebody's saying, why don't you use one password and you wouldn't have to remember your passwords.
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:35.680]   I don't know why I do use it.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:37.640]   It should have remembered.
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:38.640]   Thank you, Mr. Scott.
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.640]   Born.
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:40.640]   I appreciate the offers of rescue.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.640]   I'm glad we didn't need to use them.
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:45.640]   So now you still have that get out of jail free pass that you've got in your wallet.
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:46.640]   Yep.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.640]   Since name.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.280]   Yep.
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:51.040]   Never had to use it, but you never know.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:54.680]   Scott's always, always up for danger.
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:56.320]   Great to talk to you.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.320]   Thanks for feeling it.
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:02.840]   And airborne ranger here on the way of a life of danger hidden down the trail for another
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:03.840]   shootout.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:04.840]   Woo hoo.
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:06.480]   Thanks for filling in last week.
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.480]   You did a great job.
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:08.840]   I did my very best.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.640]   We always miss you, my friend.
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:13.080]   When you're not here, it's just not the same.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.240]   Well, thank you.
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.440]   Same to you, Alex Lindsey, for filling in the week before.
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.000]   It was my pleasure.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.160]   And as again, we always realize how good you are at what you do.
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.160]   And I have to do it.
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.560]   Yeah, I just want it before we sign off.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:27.000]   That's everybody that thinks this is easy.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.880]   All you gotta do, all you gotta do is try it.
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:34.960]   Well, you know, I got eaten by 17 year old daughter has been doing a show and she's actually
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:35.960]   doing pretty well.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.320]   So I think it is pretty well.
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.320]   Well, she is 17.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.320]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.520]   She's able to pull the, she's got the jeans.
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:42.560]   She's maybe got the jeans.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:46.320]   She hasn't, I was talking to her because she leaves the camera on the guests too long.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:49.120]   And I am going to work with her a little bit on switching more.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:51.200]   She says, but they, but I, you know, they're doing all the talking.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.680]   I said, oh, I have a trick every once in a while you go.
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:55.680]   Uh huh.
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:56.680]   Uh huh.
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:59.000]   And then you let them talk some more.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.880]   It's those little things that make the difference breaks it up, breaks it up.
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:08.600]   If you want to watch the show live, by the way, we do do it live, roughly 11 o'clock
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:13.680]   Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern, you know, if you tune in at 2 15, you probably won't miss a whole
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:16.920]   lot every Tuesday at live.twit.tv.
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:19.120]   My wife said, I went there and I got a porn site.
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:20.200]   I said, what site did you go to?
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.200]   She said, I want to twit that live.tv.
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.560]   I said, no, there is a difference.
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:28.880]   Believe it or not, between live.twit.tv and twit.live.
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:31.520]   I've been in a lot of different, fairly significant difference.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:32.880]   She said, some woman was shaking her butt.
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:34.840]   I knew that wasn't my daughter.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:35.840]   Uh huh.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:38.800]   Live.twit.tv or twit.live.tv also works.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:41.000]   That's the, that's another way to remember it.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.920]   Maybe I shouldn't have done that because that's what the confusion came from.
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:48.500]   Alex Lindsey is at the Pixel Core, Pixel Core.tv for the podcast, Pixel Core.com to find out
[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:53.600]   more about the wonderful guild of multimedia warriors that he, that he's formed.
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:58.400]   And if people haven't seen Mac Break Dev, we have really gotten that one going.
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:03.600]   So we have some great developers talking about programming, talking to everything from, you
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:10.520]   know, Sal, talking about Apple Script and Automator to programmers, talking about programming.
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:19.440]   It is, we've really, we went crazy at WWDC and captured a whole slew of, of videos.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.960]   So definitely check out Mac Break Dev.
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:22.960]   It is running very strong.
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:23.960]   Let's put it this way.
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:30.120]   If, if the, if the title adding creator fields in core data gets you hot, we got a show for
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.120]   you.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.120]   That's great.
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.920]   We can't leave the developers out.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:36.080]   No, I think it's really good that you're doing that.
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:40.160]   You got 19 episodes in the can making recipes and core data templates and Xcode getting
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.640]   started with the iPhone SDK all listening to that one.
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:46.520]   The thing, the big thing is, is that, you know, these developer, the developer tools
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:47.520]   are free.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.520]   Right.
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:49.520]   Yes.
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.680]   You know, and so this is the kind of stuff if you, you know, there's no reason not to kind
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:55.360]   of dig in and, and this is hopefully going to, you know, people who have thought about
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.920]   maybe programming or even, I know one of the things when Sal comes over, he gets us just
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:04.240]   excited about Apple Script and Automator and our guys are doing all kinds of automation
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.040]   that saves days of work.
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.040]   And so,
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:10.560]   One reason, sorry, there is one reason.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:11.560]   What's that?
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:12.560]   Sanity.
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:15.640]   Sanity is very important.
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:16.800]   Yes.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:17.800]   It's the sanity clause.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.360]   So anyway, check it out.
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.800]   Pixelcore.tv.
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:21.800]   That's where you can get it.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:24.640]   And of course, you subscribe and iTunes and you'll get every single one.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.640]   Yep.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:29.080]   Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you so much for joining us on the show.
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.080]   Back to work now.
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:30.600]   Break time is over.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:54.680]   [MUSIC]
