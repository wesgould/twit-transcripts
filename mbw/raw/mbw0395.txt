[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.680]   Your Macintosh world and Mac world is on this week.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.160]   So we've got a great big studio audience.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.640]   Nice to have you all today.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.560]   Macworld starts tomorrow.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.320]   Renee Richie's in town for Montreal for Macworld, I presume.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.360]   - I came for the weather Leo.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.360]   Macworld is just a great side benefit.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.560]   - You know, it started raining.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.960]   It got cold the minute you got here.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.280]   I don't know. - This is like summer for me.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.120]   This is fantastic.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.960]   - Okay, you're okay.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.800]   - Absolutely, yes.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.680]   - It's very strangely unseasonal weather.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.520]   - I brought it.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.360]   - Jason Snell is here.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.200]   He's here all.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.040]   He's just down the road a bit.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.640]   - Yeah, I came all the way from 33 minutes away.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.480]   I don't know.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.320]   - We're thrilled to have you.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.160]   - It's so rainy up here.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.000]   - Always nice to have you in the studio.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.960]   And in Boston, Andy Enaco from the Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.160]   Andy, do you miss coming out to Macworld Expo?
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.960]   They used to do it in Boston, didn't they?
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.040]   I mean, ever since I was a teenager, like 1985.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.520]   And so just taking like three, two buses
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.560]   and commuter rail and what to get there.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.680]   And then seeing, I was at every Macworld Expo
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.320]   from like 1990 onward.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.160]   And yeah, I miss it.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.120]   It's a great scene.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.640]   I had to be a little bit pickier
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.000]   about how I spend four or five days
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.680]   and flying 3000 miles these days.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.280]   But yeah, I do miss it.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.920]   At some point, someone should,
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.520]   someone should like, yeah.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.800]   (laughs)
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.880]   - I don't want to be negative about Macworld,
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.040]   but somebody here has to just point out
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.520]   that since Apple left, it has shrunk.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.800]   And everybody says, oh, but it's not about the community.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.400]   It's about the pull, it's not the pull.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.320]   - It's not, it's changed.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.640]   I don't want to send the message
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.440]   that it's no longer worth my time.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.040]   It's more like, usually when I commit to like again,
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.640]   3000 miles, it's because I'm going to get
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.120]   a whole bunch of new stuff that I can write
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.320]   lots of columns about.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.040]   And so now it's no longer the sort of thing
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.400]   where someone like me goes there
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.760]   to get lots of news stories.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.240]   But it is the times where I went.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.920]   But I think the last one I went to was a year ago
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.840]   or two years ago.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.920]   It's just a nice little festival for people
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.640]   who are interested in Macs, interested in Apple,
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.120]   and interested in the stuff that people who use Macs
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.960]   and iPhones and iPads do.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.600]   - Apple is in no way at Macworld.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.440]   - No.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.960]   - Not even like people walking around.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.720]   - Apple employees will go, but it's not official
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.320]   in any official capacity.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.400]   I should say, I should disclaim,
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.720]   IDG, the company that owns my company,
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.920]   also owns the company that produces Macworld.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.480]   We're not the same company.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.320]   I don't actually have any real control
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.000]   other than the power persuasion or what they do.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.840]   - You're like kissing cousins.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.120]   - Yeah, we're like cousins.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.880]   We're kissing, we'll see.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.680]   We're hugging cousins.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.520]   But you know--
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.720]   - That Try Can still puts some great show together.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.480]   - And his challenge, I mean, first off,
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.960]   the trade show business isn't very good.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.480]   And second, then Apple leaves,
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.960]   and their challenge has been,
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.480]   how do we turn this into something different?
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.960]   They are trying to turn it into, like Andy said,
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.720]   it's more of a festival, it's more of a fan event,
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.600]   it's more like a comic convention
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.440]   or film festival or something like that.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.440]   And I think they're doing a good job
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.560]   at turning it into that.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.840]   But it's tough because it's a very different business
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.080]   than the business of having a bunch of software companies
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.000]   pay you a lot of money for space on a trade show floor.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.640]   - Yeah, that's actually a really good point.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.600]   And you know, it isn't just Macworld, it's everything.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.280]   You know, the new media expo this year
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.400]   had a keynote by a hypnotist
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.840]   because he was willing to pay enough money
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.600]   to become a gold or platinum sponsor
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.360]   and then tried to sell $1,000 books.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.640]   And really to me, it was, it was that,
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.480]   when you see, and I'm sure you'll see it in Macworld,
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.920]   the massage chairs and real estate sales and stuff,
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.000]   you realize it's tough to get the economics to work.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.960]   - Well, yeah, unless you've got,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.000]   if you're a high-end conference
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.640]   that people will spend several hundred dollars
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.840]   to get access and there is actually a high-end IT conference
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.880]   that happens, I think tomorrow, in advance of the show,
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.240]   and then there is a conference pass
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.520]   that's got lots of content.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.120]   So that's a business that's going on.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.960]   If you just wander in and look at the trade show floor,
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.520]   yeah, it's nothing like what it was.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.680]   They're trying to make it not be about the trade show floor.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.640]   - Yeah, especially the top.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.640]   - It's a double whammy as well
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.440]   because Apple moved to their own events.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.320]   They think they're big enough now
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.600]   that they can run their own events.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.360]   But at the same time, you have shows like CES,
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.080]   which have Apple and iPhones just became so popular
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.080]   that everybody wants a piece of it now.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.280]   So you'll go to shows that have nothing to do with Apple
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.720]   traditionally and they have monstrous amounts of cases
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.120]   and gadgets and how do you.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.640]   - You also said that because as they've moved Macworld later,
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.600]   now this is as late as it's ever been in March,
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.920]   it comes up closer and closer to WWDC.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.960]   And so now it is even less important
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.800]   from the point of view of news.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.360]   - Well, there was never much non-Apple news at WWDC.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.120]   This is really about getting, I think,
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.920]   part of it is the trade show logistics.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.200]   I know from talking to Paul Kent that,
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.280]   trade shows reserve conference space years in advance.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.920]   So it's actually very hard to move the dates
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.680]   and the date that they had last year
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.320]   that they said that they were gonna do the show
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.880]   was like Super Bowl Sunday or something.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.600]   - Oh, oh. - So they got this date,
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.680]   but they wanted to move away from CES
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.640]   'cause it was a big problem.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.880]   The press didn't wanna come.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.960]   The exhibitors didn't wanna come a week after CES.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.080]   So now it's at least got some distance from CES
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.000]   and we'll see how this time works for them.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.840]   - Yeah, I've become less interested in trade shows.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.280]   But I get so much of this information online.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.560]   I do love the community.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.480]   - Conferences and meeting people
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.640]   for the interesting content and interesting speakers
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.720]   are much more, I mean, I see Renee and Montreal
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.200]   every year now because there's a great
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.000]   Mac developer conference in Montreal,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.400]   a guy English and company put on called Singleton
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.680]   with a little thing down at the bottom of the sea.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.680]   It's very French.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.040]   And I love those conferences
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.760]   and I'm going to one in Ireland in a few months,
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.440]   but those are not trade shows
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.160]   and the economics are really different.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.240]   - Yeah.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.400]   Yeah, there are a bunch of those developer conferences
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.240]   aren't there and I'm just like Jason's like,
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.600]   when I fly to speak now,
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.240]   it used to be mostly conferences like a Mac world.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.320]   Now it's these smaller like two day events
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.640]   that are developer conferences or consultant conferences
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.480]   because there seems to be a good model for that
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.520]   because more and more keep popping up every day.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.800]   And some of them are being done just explicitly,
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.840]   like all the conference that I think Jason was talking about
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.520]   is just one of the finest conferences I've ever spoken at.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.560]   And it's like, they invited me back and forth.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.760]   I couldn't make it this year, but I'm now, it's like next year's
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.800]   like, let's put aside some time and some money
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.320]   to come back to Ireland because that was a really good time.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.160]   - Yeah.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.680]   Andy and Andy, Andy Beow does XOXO fast in Portland.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.560]   - That's a great one. - That's fantastic.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.720]   - But these are much smaller.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.800]   - And oftentimes they're a labor of love and they're not.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.800]   I mean, IDG is running this to make a profit
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.920]   and that's a really tough business.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.840]   A lot of these things are sort of break even propositions
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.640]   for their organizers.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.160]   - Yeah, I mean, Jason, you kind of put on the head
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.920]   when you're comparing things to like Comic-Cons
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.280]   because that is pretty much the exact same model
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.080]   where people of a certain part of the country
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.480]   or of the world who feel as though,
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.720]   "Gee, there's not a good conference in our part of the country.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.600]   Let's go put one on ourselves and we can put our own stamp
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.240]   on it and our own signature on it."
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.800]   And they're hoping to break even.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.480]   They're just not, it's just not a money-making venture.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.040]   And that's what gives them the freedom
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.400]   to put on these really quirky special events
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.880]   that take only about a year or two
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.920]   to develop their own personalities
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.720]   and quickly become legend from something you've never heard of
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.640]   to, "Gee, who do I have to butter up to get invited
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.800]   to go to XOXO?"
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.080]   'Cause every video that was coming out of that conference
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.080]   was like, "Wow, I'm gonna set aside
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.680]   the rest of the day to watch this."
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.280]   - One thing that's really nice about Macworld still
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.280]   is those CES is not a consumer show,
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.520]   it's a consumer electronics show,
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.360]   but it's analysts and buyers and media.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.160]   Macworld is meant for the community.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.280]   So you can go there and talk to the developers
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.840]   who make the apps and the people who make the peripherals
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.000]   and everything like that and get that one-to-one contact,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.560]   air your grievances or give your admiration.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.080]   And also with the absence of Apple,
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.800]   I remember covering Macworld years ago,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.200]   people would fly in for the keynote,
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.880]   watch Steve Jobs or Phil Schiller,
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.880]   and then fly out.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.720]   - And then leave.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.680]   - Go to the show floor, walk through the Apple booth,
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.480]   which was really just like an Apple store and leave.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.320]   - Right.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.160]   It used to be like I was somebody that everybody,
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.200]   all my friends knew that,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.760]   "Oh, Andy, Andy knows someone who is in Coldplay.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.600]   He can totally hook you up with tickets if you need them."
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.840]   I'm sure that pretty much everyone on this panel,
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.480]   like we'd be starting getting those emails,
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.960]   like three recent events saying,
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.000]   "Is there any way that I can get an invite
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.400]   into the keynote for Macworld?
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   Do you know anybody?
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.160]   Can you get any pull?"
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.280]   But this was another area in which Apple
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.200]   sort of led the way for other companies,
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.480]   where it used to be that a company felt as though
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.240]   they needed to debut a new product
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.200]   or announce a new strategy at a larger conference
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   or at a larger trade show,
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.240]   maybe because there were just so many
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.800]   of those other trade shows out there.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.440]   Now, well, how much does it cost to rent a ballroom
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.480]   in New York City?
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.960]   Not very much, so let's launch our new phone in New York City
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.120]   at an event that we can,
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.040]   so we can choose the timing
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.240]   so that we can control the news cycle that day.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.040]   And so that's another reason why these huge mega events
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.520]   aren't as important to so many people as they once were.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.120]   The real challenge is to get a free calendar date
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.000]   for your mega event,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.160]   'cause everybody's doing it.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.640]   As we are doing this show,
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.640]   HTC is unveiling its new HTC One Mark II, the M8.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.680]   Next door.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.000]   Literally next door.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.720]   So, and you can watch that on,
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.080]   I mean, this is a Mac show,
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.280]   so we're not gonna spend any time on it.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.120]   I'll tell you it with a little bit.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.040]   And it's beautiful.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.800]   That's the unpredictability of it now.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.640]   When is it gonna be?
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.480]   You never know.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.760]   Well, like last year CES,
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.680]   we had a ton of stuff.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.120]   In Mobile World Congress, we had almost nothing.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.960]   In this year CES,
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.080]   it wasn't very much in Mobile World Congress was jam-packed.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.920]   Huge.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.640]   And it's hard to tell now what's gonna be where or when.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.360]   I think announcing at the big trade shows
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.160]   is actually a huge mistake for most people,
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.720]   because unless you are so big
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.280]   that you can take advantage of having all the media there
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.480]   and they'll swarm to cover you.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.720]   But even then, the media then will move on
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.440]   to the other 8,000 things they've got.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.840]   I always, there are always people
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.600]   who back in the Apple keynote days
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.040]   who would release their press release
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.520]   of their new product announcement.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.680]   The morning of the Apple keynote.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.000]   And it was the dumbest thing in the world
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.040]   because nobody was ever gonna talk about that product.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.680]   They were gonna talk about whatever Apple talked about.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.840]   That's when you release your poor earnings for the past.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.520]   You're not your new product.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.760]   So HTC or Samsung or Apple,
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.040]   who led the way here, doing their own events.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.720]   It's so smart because if you've got the way,
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.560]   enough way to get the journalists to fly
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.200]   to wherever you're doing the event,
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.680]   it's a way better 'cause that's all they're gonna be talking about.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.160]   We do have an event coming up Thursday.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.160]   Microsoft's gonna do an event in San Francisco.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.840]   And we think that Microsoft's gonna announce,
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.680]   it'll be the first public event their new CEO, Satya and Vela,
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.760]   has led and we think they're gonna announce
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.960]   Microsoft Office for the iPad long awaited.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.520]   Absolutely. And it's a week before build,
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.600]   which is odd and it's timing
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.200]   'cause they have their big show in San Francisco
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.000]   a week after they're doing this show in San Francisco.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.360]   Well, they got Satya down there.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.960]   They'll just keep them there for a few extra days.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.320]   It's a pain for journalists though.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.520]   You know, Paul, throughout Mary Jofoli
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.920]   are not coming out for Thursday's announcement
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.720]   'cause they'd have to stick around for another week
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.680]   for build, which they aren't coming out for.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.720]   It's tough.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.400]   Look at all the Mac world expo people.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.760]   Are you excited about Office for, as long as I mention it,
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.720]   Office for iOS?
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:17.440]   Oh, yeah. I mean, there was a time when I was excited last year.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.320]   Yeah, she'd better late than never or the promise.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.840]   You can't wait too long, can't you?
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.680]   Yeah, because I mean, you've given us,
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.800]   Microsoft has given us all about three years
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.040]   to figure out alternatives to Microsoft Office.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.760]   And that's given us time to not to realize
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.240]   that we don't need the desktop version of Office.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.520]   We need something that's relevant for mobile use,
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.000]   which means that we're willing to accept fewer features
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.320]   for better interface design like what we get in pages.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.760]   But the other side of it is that you have to realize
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.600]   that the Office user isn't someone who particularly cares
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.240]   about a better interface.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.800]   All they care about is that,
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.920]   can I get the work that I'm supposed to be getting done
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.000]   on this device instead of this other device?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.640]   So on that basis, if it integrates with the world
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.840]   that they have to work with inside the Office,
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.400]   where they don't have to care about anything,
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.400]   they don't have to sync anything,
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.520]   they don't have to install anything,
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.840]   they don't have to update anything,
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.840]   just miraculously this nice slim device will do
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.040]   everything they have to do in Word, Excel,
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.000]   and PowerPoint, and Outlook,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.360]   then that's just automatically a win for them.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.320]   So it's not necessarily the same market
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.920]   for Office users as it is for a page as user
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.520]   or even a Google Docs user.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.720]   >> And it's so tough for Microsoft.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.200]   For example, they licensed Exchange to Apple and Google,
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.480]   and that was great for the Exchange team,
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.200]   but it really hurt Windows, mobile, and then Windows, phone.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.400]   And Office, you're thinking,
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.920]   is that the crown jewel that'll help promote surface sales,
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.520]   or is that something they want to get on the iPad
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.800]   so that Office sales blow up?
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.720]   >> The increasing of the opinion,
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.880]   they just didn't have it in time,
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.760]   and they weren't ready,
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.720]   and they shipped it as soon as they can.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.520]   They seem to be doing joint development between that
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.880]   and what they call Project Gemini,
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.880]   which is a touch forward version of Office
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.200]   for their own platform, for Windows,
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.120]   particularly for Surface.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.160]   >> By 2014.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.280]   >> Yeah, if they're trying to do those two together,
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.840]   then that could explain.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.840]   >> How do you wait so long?
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.280]   >> You're Microsoft, you're one of the smartest,
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.960]   best engineering companies in the world,
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.560]   and it takes you seven years to get a touch optimized version.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.360]   >> I am sure that if they wanted to,
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.040]   they could have had it done very fast, absolutely.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.080]   But it wasn't a priority because it was the other guy's platform.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.400]   I think that the bottom of the world--
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.400]   >> But the surface didn't ship it.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.320]   >> Well, that's true.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.480]   That's true, but did they rush the surface out?
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.080]   >> I think Microsoft in the latter years
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.560]   as Steve Malmer was trying a lot of things
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.760]   and was changing tech every few months.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.360]   >> That's why, Yody.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.680]   >> You had one note for a while, now one note on the Mac.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.800]   Is that everybody going to stand up and cheer now?
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.360]   >> One note is a good example, though.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.960]   I think that what I would have said a minute ago
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:44.360]   was that the Microsoft that was structured 10 years ago
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.960]   would have definitely rushed out an iOS version of Office
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.360]   immediately because they were 12 different fiefdoms
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.880]   that could, now, reach competing with each other
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.200]   for Microsoft's attention and resources.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.320]   Whereas Microsoft now tries to be a little bit more cohesive
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.640]   in the image that they try to project
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.760]   and create a suite of apps that is designed to work together.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.640]   They're trying not to be two game of thrones about it
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.400]   in terms of their corporate structure.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.200]   And when you look at what one note was like,
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.120]   there was the first app that they really rethought
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.320]   for their multi-touch interface.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.520]   And it was as far removed from the desktop version as possible.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.160]   They came up with some really interesting interface design
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.960]   and some new interface elements
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.800]   that took really nice advantage of it
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.720]   and really made me interested in what they would be doing
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.200]   for Microsoft Office.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.600]   But as we said, it's maybe irrelevant at this point.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.960]   I mean, we're expecting something that is so good
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.120]   at this point that will make us, again,
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.560]   have to link right back to the tools that we're using
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.320]   on the desktop and not even care about alternatives
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.840]   that have been now have three years' worth of integrity
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.120]   on iOS.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.080]   And I'm not sure if that's a doable thing at this point.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.280]   - Now replace the words Microsoft Office for the iPad
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.480]   with the iWatch.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.440]   It is as an analyst says,
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.000]   time ticking for Apple to announce an iWatch.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.560]   - Time is always ticked.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.480]   - Trip Choudry of Global Equity's Research says,
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.400]   Apple has 60 days left to either come up with something
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.720]   or they will disappear.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.600]   - I love John Gruber's take on this.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.920]   John quotes the Katie Thompson article on CNBC.
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:25.520]   And it says, Choudry says,
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.880]   "It will take years for Apple's $130 billion
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.360]   in cash to vanish, but it will become
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.560]   an irrelevant company. . .
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.560]   It will become a zombie if they don't come up
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.400]   with an iWatch."
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.800]   This is, again, managing director
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.920]   at Global Equity's Research.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.760]   And Gruber says, "I'm guessing the . . .
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.240]   denotes when he paused for another line of Coke."
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.640]   - Ooh, ow!
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.800]   - How did they keep their jobs?
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.120]   - Ow!
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.560]   - So I guess, I gather the Apple community
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.480]   doesn't agree that time is ticking.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.280]   - They say, people say this all the time
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.560]   about everything Apple does and 60 days left.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.120]   I mean, that's one of the dumber things.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.240]   People say lots of questions about Apple.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.080]   - Is short.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.640]   - That is so stupid that it defies understanding.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.960]   - Raise the dumber's level.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.480]   - That is like almost in Rob Enderly territory there.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.200]   Maybe not that much, but it's kind of crazy.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.160]   I mean, Apple releases things on its own timelines
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.320]   and we're all really impatient.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.120]   And there's so much in the press and in analysts
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.480]   that comes out of boredom, out of impatience.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.040]   We want the next cool thing to write about or talk about.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.520]   And in fact, most of these groundbreaking products
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.680]   that Apple has done over the last 10 years
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.960]   have been things that came in what you would call late.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.520]   But they were the right product at the right time.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.840]   And maybe they'll be too late with this or not,
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.480]   but I look at the current amount of available
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.720]   smart watches and other wearables out there.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.720]   And they're not hemorrhaging customers
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.760]   to other people right now.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.960]   It is a non-existent market.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.200]   A lot of big ideas and some big--
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   - The Android Wear.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.440]   - And some weird products like this.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.960]   Maybe, but it's not a real product yet.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.400]   - Right.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.120]   - And Apple tends not to do those proof of concept
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.000]   announcement and then a year later,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   you see a real product.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.840]   - You're the renderings.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.040]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.120]   - Which isn't necessarily the right way to do things.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.480]   But yeah, I mean, this isn't this.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.160]   Apple usually waits for someone else to establish a market
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.680]   so they can take a look at how people are actually--
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.320]   how actual users are actually reacting to these things.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.560]   They also buy them themselves to see,
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.000]   to point it, laugh at certain things,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.840]   and take copious notes on a few other things about it.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.240]   And yeah, it's gonna be late this year,
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.280]   maybe even next year when this thing comes out.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.480]   But I mean, it's clear to see though
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.800]   that Tim Cook is something a stressing amount,
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.720]   'cause you see the same sort of Obama thing
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.040]   going on with him where when he took over a CEO,
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.920]   he had this rich head of black, black hair.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.880]   And now, you see it go white over the--
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.680]   just over the course of the eye watch development.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.760]   So maybe we're just wrong about this.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.680]   - I would be the opposite.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.800]   If Apple put out an eye watch before it was ready,
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.280]   I would start to get nervous about Apple.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.520]   - That's what Apple is doing is--
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.720]   - Apple needs to get it right,
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.520]   as opposed to get it first or get it--
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.520]   - Like the iPhone, there were trios and blackberries
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.160]   and windows mobiles for years before the iPhone.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.760]   There was tablet PCs for a decade
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.520]   before there was the iPad.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.520]   Apple does not, they don't move first.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.840]   They liked exactly what Andy said.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.880]   They wanna see what's wrong with the products
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.640]   already in the market and then see if Apple
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.040]   can make a compelling solution.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.520]   And if they can't, they won't go there.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.600]   And if they can, they produce their version of the product.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.120]   - Dave Moren, who is a former Facebook guy
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.720]   who created Path, which is a beautiful app
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.200]   first on iOS and now on Android,
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.480]   wrote an interesting article on Medium, came out,
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.920]   I think today or yesterday, in which he's--
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.000]   it's called Super Normal.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   He says, "Innovation starts with the ordinary."
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   He talks about the key, and I think Apple's right in here,
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.240]   but to creating a great something is to take the normal
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.200]   and then add a twist that makes it an innovation.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.120]   And he talks about the Mac was a personal computer
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.600]   with a GUI, the iPad was an MP3 player with a,
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.520]   or I'm sorry, iPod was an MP3 player
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.480]   with a click wheel interface.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.600]   The iPhone was a smartphone with multi-touch.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.440]   It's those little things that they did
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.480]   to already existing product categories
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.440]   that created the innovation.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.440]   - Their innovation is mainstreaming technology
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.360]   to make it accessible to a much larger market
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.360]   than it traditionally has been.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.440]   - He says, "By removing friction for the user
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.200]   "to interact in a new way,
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.520]   "each of these products unlocked massive value."
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.120]   I think that's what Apple's trying to do, right?
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:14.960]   - That's true.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.280]   It's more like, I think, not everybody.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.560]   You don't have to go in, and if you're not
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.120]   in the business of simply selling in volume,
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.360]   you don't have to dive in to just jump into any market,
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.800]   that seems to have presented itself.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   Just because someone else is making a lot of money
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.560]   on netbooks doesn't mean that you have to start
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.000]   making netbooks too.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.840]   I've used that example so many times
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.000]   that I don't even have to go into that again.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.280]   But there should be some comment in this conversation
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:46.400]   that trios were wonderful and blackberries were wonderful.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.360]   And if both of those companies had held off on,
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.760]   no, the keyboards are on the way out,
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.520]   these tactile interfaces are on the way out.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.440]   We're not gonna enter, we're not gonna create this market
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.240]   until this thing is absolutely perfect
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.680]   and as blown mind-blowingly different
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.400]   from what the phones people have today as possible,
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.600]   we wouldn't have had five years of these wonderful devices.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.200]   We also wouldn't have had that information,
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.800]   infrastructure that made the iPhone possible.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.320]   So I think that Apple definitely does things
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.720]   exactly the right way for them
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.000]   because they are telling a story with every product
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.080]   that they do and they wanna make sure
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.840]   they're telling their story correctly.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.760]   Nonetheless, let's not turn this into denigrating,
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.440]   blackberry and palm for doing things early
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.000]   with a successful product that people love.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.160]   It's just that sometimes you're doing,
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.840]   sometimes you're doing market research
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.920]   for whoever comes next to you.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.360]   - Right, and I don't think we're denigrating
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.720]   them so much as pointing out that Apple isn't usually
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.720]   in that place.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.240]   I mean, one of the times Apple was in that place
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.680]   was with the Newton and look how that went, right?
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.440]   And I love my Pebble, but my Pebble feels to me
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.160]   very much like my Trio or my Palm 3 did back in the day,
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.800]   which is, well, this is really cool
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.880]   that this can even work, but this is not how it's gonna be.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.200]   - It's the early adoptees.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.720]   - It's a Tesla-like device where the people
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.920]   who are buying Tesla cars are people who are optimized
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:05.080]   who like that kind of car and are open to different
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:05.920]   and new things.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.720]   They're willing to accept that they have a 230
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.360]   or 240 mile range instead of 400 mile range.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.800]   People who are actual legitimate Pebble owners right now
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.080]   are people for whom they've always imagined
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.200]   that a smartwatch on your wrist is exactly the way
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.040]   to do things.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.520]   They're willing to suffer a little bit
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.000]   if it's not quite perfectly done,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.120]   if the charging time isn't what they'd like it to be,
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.360]   if it's not as slim as what they'd like it to be,
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.880]   and if the tools aren't what they'd like to be,
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.920]   because this is something they've been wanting
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.760]   for a long time.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.120]   I think that things like Google Glass
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.640]   is also a Tesla-like product.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.520]   I think that Google Wear is also a very Tesla-like product
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.040]   where Apple doesn't want to build a Tesla,
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.680]   they want to build a Toyota.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.800]   - I don't even think Google Glass is that far along.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.680]   I mean, Google Glass is in its own way off.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.320]   It's proof of concept more than anything else.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.920]   - I think it's not proof of it.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.080]   I mean the sense that unless you're a journalist,
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.720]   you're not buying $1,500 Google Glass,
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.080]   unless this is something that I've always felt
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.640]   as though this is the way to go,
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.120]   and this is something that even if it's a little bit painful,
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.400]   the alternative is nothing like this,
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.000]   so I'm gonna go with this.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.840]   That's what it is.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.640]   - As long as we're debunking false stories,
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.480]   Eddy Q never threw a pen.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.320]   I mean Steve Jobs never threw a pen at E.Q.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.920]   It was an extended E.Q. - It was not Eddy Q.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.520]   - Get your story right.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.520]   - Yeah.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.840]   - Did he throw Eddy Q at a pen,
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.040]   or did he throw a pen at E.Q.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:23.880]   I'm not sure.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.920]   - I've heard through the grapevine
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.480]   that Phil Schiller has never owned a Lamborghini
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.320]   either.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.160]   - Oh really?
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.040]   - So he was a Porsche man.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.080]   - Apparently a lot of the anecdotes and haunted empires
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.480]   are mistaken, I don't know, at least they're denied.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.040]   Eddy Q denied it in an email, Benjamin Mayo of 9-5 Mac.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.040]   Sent him a note saying,
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.200]   "I'm slightly obsessed with the anecdote about Jobs
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.720]   throwing a pen in your face is a story true,"
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.840]   Eddy Q said, "No, it's not."
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.400]   Rivaling Jim Dallrimple for Tursman.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.240]   - He could've just said, "Nope."
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.080]   - Nope.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.640]   - Nope, would've been great.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.160]   - Nope, would've been kinda wheels within wheels.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.040]   I would deny it too if Steve Jobs threw a pen at me.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.680]   Doesn't mean he didn't.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.680]   - Why would you deny it?
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.200]   Steve Jobs is famously grumpy.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.200]   - He's dead.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.040]   - It's a mark of honor.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:08.880]   - No revenge.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.400]   - Yes, the famous Steve Jobs threw a pen at me once.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.320]   - Yeah, all right, maybe maybe maybe, okay good.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.520]   - I just don't know, yeah.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.360]   - All right.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.640]   In his first days as CEO,
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.080]   took two immediate actions.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.960]   First he promoted Eddy Q.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.320]   Q had started out as an intern in one version of a story
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.640]   that he told everyone.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.240]   He was plucked out of the IT department
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.720]   by Jobs during a meeting
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.720]   in which he had dared to write an opinion
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.640]   about the topic at hand,
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.400]   or voice an opinion about the topic at hand.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.200]   When Jobs looked at him and told him to shut up
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.800]   and undeterred Q spoke up again,
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.280]   causing Jobs to throw a pen at his forehead.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   Q, who by then figured he had nothing to lose,
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.720]   braced himself and offered his opinion for the third time.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.040]   Jobs hired him.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.720]   (laughing)
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.400]   Now in the book, Heart of Empires,
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.520]   she says Q repeated this story to everyone.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.680]   - Isn't that how George Steinbrenner
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.920]   understands on Seinfeld?
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.840]   (laughing)
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.680]   - Yeah, I had it.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.000]   - Yeah, I threw a pen at you.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:04.920]   You didn't blink.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.760]   Yeah, I had it.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.240]   - You know, my favorite--
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.720]   - My favorite spunkin' went with.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.280]   - My favorite bit of silliness in Haunted Empire,
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.600]   which is Renee and I both reviewed.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.440]   It's just not a very good book.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.280]   There are a lot of people who are like,
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.160]   "You like Apple, that's why you don't like the book."
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.600]   It's like, you know what, I went,
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.720]   I was hoping to get a really good argument from her
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.000]   about why Apple was haunted by Steve Jobs.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.680]   There's nothing coherent in that book
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.600]   in terms of an argument.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.400]   It's a series of anecdotes.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.400]   Much of it re-reported from other sources
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.880]   and some of the original reporting is kind of bizarre.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.040]   But the one that really got me was explaining
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.840]   that Phil Schiller has an aggressive personality
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.960]   because he likes to listen to Led Zeppelin
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.480]   and is a fan of the San Jose Sharks.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.400]   - Oh. - But that's the whole thing.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.240]   Hockey.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.240]   So hello, aggressive Canada.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.080]   - They have.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.000]   - The entire book is two plus yellow equals sandwich.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.840]   - Right.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.880]   - And I'm willing to believe that's possible,
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.040]   but you gotta show me the math.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.680]   - Yeah, give me the show me the math, show your work.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.360]   - Yeah, it's just not, yeah.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.800]   There is a good argument to be made.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.360]   I might or might not agree with it,
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.960]   that there's a good argument to be made
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.360]   about Apple losing its way.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.560]   But first you need to establish,
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.360]   is Apple losing its way because they're not following Jobs
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.760]   or because they're following him too slavishly.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.960]   Neither argument is made in the book.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.640]   Or actually both arguments are made in the book,
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.640]   even though they're contradictory to each other.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:22.520]   And sadly, I think because you do this as a book
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.720]   instead of on the web,
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.120]   I think she wrote most of this book more than a year ago.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.360]   iOS 7, which would be an argument
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.240]   that Apple has changed in Pro or Con,
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.560]   is mentioned for about two paragraphs in the afterward
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.520]   because it happened too late for the book.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.920]   Which is why covering anything this current in a book
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.720]   is probably a bad idea these days.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.880]   - Now books, they're doomed.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.680]   - I don't know why you, they gotta fix that problem.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.520]   - They gotta fix this.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.760]   - The whole thing is so disconnected, for example,
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.800]   she argues that maps were a huge blunder
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.480]   and then that Scott Forest law being fired was a huge blunder.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.960]   - But wait a minute, he was fired because of maps.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.440]   - Well, he was fired for other reasons than maps.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.840]   But I mean, all these arguments are going
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.840]   so many different directions
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.640]   and there's just no structure or reason.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.440]   It's a random anecdote generator.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.160]   And I find some of the anecdotes interesting,
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.000]   not all of them--
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.840]   - He'll do up with what I've heard personally.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.600]   - Tim Cook's typing teacher
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.760]   doesn't have a lot of perspective on his personality
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.240]   but she says it's a bit, they're so random.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.240]   There's no book.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.400]   - Tim with always a very aggressive type.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.360]   - Clearly somebody, either Yukari Kane
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.920]   or one of her researchers went through the microfilm
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.480]   of his hometown newspaper
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.400]   and they really wanted to show their work.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.040]   So it's like Tim accepted this award
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.920]   when he was in high school for a speechy game.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.160]   - It makes me sad because she was a well-known
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.000]   Apple beat reporter.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.720]   I believe she had the liver transplant story
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.560]   from Steve Jobs.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.120]   - Yukari what, Tani Kane.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.640]   - And I was expecting greatness from, not greatness,
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.440]   but I was putting a really good book from this
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.120]   and it turned out to be two pieces of cardboard
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.200]   with some paper in between.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.760]   - And in the afterwards she says she'd never written
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.000]   story longer than 3,000 words before.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.440]   And I think it shows, I think she's a good reporter.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.840]   There's some good original reporting
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.200]   about Chinese factory workers in here
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.640]   that reads almost, you take two or three chapters
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.480]   and it's a feature story.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.200]   And I think that's what happened here is she has
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.740]   Apple knowledge, made a book proposal.
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.080]   This was the way to sell the book
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.800]   and then had to try and make a book fit the concept
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.400]   and the title, which is a great title.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.440]   And it's just kind of, it's too bad.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.480]   I was ready to be challenged by this book
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.560]   and it's just kind of a mess.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.760]   - But wouldn't you, if you were the editor of "Polosha,"
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.960]   wouldn't you kind of give it back and say,
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.160]   can you make this a little more--
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.000]   - You think it'll go to your argument?
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.320]   - Or they just care about, like it'll sell either way.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.320]   - No, they know it's gonna sell.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.560]   In fact, we're probably selling more copies
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.640]   even as we speak.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.880]   I put no link in my reveal.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.800]   - I don't know, I feel like--
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.640]   - I didn't wanna put a link.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.480]   - I didn't wanna put a link.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.680]   - I've heard that that you shouldn't talk about it
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.520]   because it's a bad book.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.080]   I feel like the reviews of this have been so specifically bad
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.200]   in saying it's not very well executed
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:46.160]   that I don't think it's gonna sell as well as it would have,
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.360]   if it had been controversial for making these cogent arguments.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.920]   Instead, it's just sort of a scatter shot.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.600]   - We're basically saying this is the Fred Phelps of Apple Books.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.600]   Don't give it any more attention.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.800]   Just let it be anonymous and slink off into the obscurity deserves.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.640]   - They didn't sell at least one copy 'cause of your guys
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.640]   'cause I didn't buy one.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.400]   So that was one.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.400]   I love your picture.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.000]   The only thing I'm sad about you being here, Renee,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.720]   you built, what was it, a haunted house?
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.800]   - No, it's Lego Batman Arkham Asylum.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   - Arkham Asylum.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.680]   - I wanted interesting things in the background.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.840]   I like Lego, I like Batman.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.840]   So I figured-- - Are you leaving
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.360]   Kane's book in the background there?
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.680]   - Well, I have the Steve Jobs stuff thing
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.520]   and the Steve Jobs thing is on one side.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.920]   - Yeah, the ICO, we have one of those.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:22.980]   We don't have the-- - We don't have the
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.160]   - Bubble heads. - The Lego on the other.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.920]   My God, I have God 'cause one is five and one is eight
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:27.760]   and they love this stuff.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.160]   And I just, I was an excuse to get them a ton
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.400]   of different sets as well.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.720]   But Uncle Renee keeps the building.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.720]   - I got duplicates so that they don't--
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.560]   - Oh.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.880]   - So now they say this is on my side
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.280]   and I get, you can play with that, that's fine.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.840]   - We've actually haunted a full, haunted.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.600]   We've actually hired a full-time Lego builder
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.840]   here at the Brick House.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.040]   He had Jeff Needle's, he started, when is Jeff Start?
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.720]   He's gonna be, he's gonna be, June 1st,
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.920]   he's gonna be a full-time Lego builder in residence.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.320]   - So you're a Lego Brick House now?
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.360]   - Yeah, the Lego Brick.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.360]   - The Lego Brick?
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.840]   Now that that's not patented, we can say that.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.080]   We're gonna say he majored in it.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.320]   So it's glad we're mist (laughs)
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.600]   We're gonna take a break, come back with more Renee Richie,
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.640]   Jason Stell, great to have you both in-house.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.360]   Andy Inaco, more about Mac Effect.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.120]   We're gonna say goodbye to two Mac institutions,
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.120]   Apple institutions in our next segment.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.480]   But first a word from legalzoom.com.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.760]   I want to tell you, legal zoom is not a law firm.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.880]   They say, you gotta tell people that.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.680]   It's not, it's better than a law firm.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.560]   They provide self-help services at your specific direction.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.920]   This is National Start Your Business Month.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.320]   And what a great time to start a business.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.760]   LegalZoom makes it easy.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.920]   You do, look, when we did our LLC for a Twit,
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.760]   we, it was me back in 2005.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.600]   I wasn't gonna be able to hire a white shoe attorney
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.760]   or a law firm to do this.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.880]   I went online, filled out the forms, got the LLC.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.000]   Boom, 99 bucks plus filing fees.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.520]   That's it, boom.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.340]   It's important to do that.
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.640]   I trademarked the Twit logo.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.120]   I trademarked the Twit name.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.760]   That's 169 bucks plus filing fees.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.000]   You can also do a chapter S or C corporation.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.280]   And of course, a lot of personal documents
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.240]   to last wills, trusts, things like that.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.120]   You might say, well, I don't, okay.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.400]   I, but here's a question.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.680]   I had this question too.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.560]   LLC or chapter S or chapter C,
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.960]   they have the legal plan attorneys
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.200]   that can give you legal advice.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.520]   They'll connect you with the right attorney
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.920]   for pre-negotiated flat rate, very affordable.
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.480]   And so you can get the advice you need
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.440]   for your state, which is important.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.280]   Read their profiles and unedited reviews
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.840]   from Legal Zoom customers.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.480]   They'll give you a good idea
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.880]   what those legal plan attorneys can do.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.640]   So they're, you know, absolutely,
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.480]   you can fill out the form.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.960]   And I did, I just decided,
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.120]   I'm gonna do an LLC in Delaware.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.960]   I think I asked Kevin Rose instead of an attorney.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.800]   That was all right, it worked.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.440]   And by the way, we've never revised those papers.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.240]   We're still using that, those documents.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.680]   Here we are eight years later and they work.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.720]   Start your own business.

[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.560]   - Hey Leo, is LegalZoom a law firm?
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.720]   - They're not a law firm.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.560]   I'm glad you asked.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.400]   - Okay.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.240]   - But they can't help you do some of your paperwork.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.080]   - I wanted to know that, thank you.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.760]   - A lot of law stuff is not, you don't need a guy.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.920]   You don't need a guy to a $350 an hour.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.320]   How much an hour are attorneys?
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.160]   They're like $450 an hour.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.320]   - Like audio equipment, the price just goes up.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.160]   - Unbelievable.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.000]   But no, but that's how you know
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.840]   you're getting a good attorney
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.560]   'cause they cost more, right?
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.400]   - Sure.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.240]   - Yeah.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.080]   - Totally.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.600]   - Yeah, I get attorneys by price.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.480]   How much are you?
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.320]   - Oh, $350.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.280]   Oh, no, you're not good enough for me.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.880]   - I put the pictures in the chat for you Leo.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.480]   - Leo, that sounds like the sort of thing
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.920]   you don't want to say on Mike.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.680]   (laughing)
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.520]   I just screwed myself.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.360]   - I'm not the dealer lot in one cost $10,000.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.200]   - Oh Lord.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.200]   - That's the one I buy.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.400]   - So we can't go to Renee Richie's studio,
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.160]   but next time you're on camera, next week,
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.240]   we'll get to see this Arkham Asylum.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.400]   Wow.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.240]   - It loses some of the eerie spookiness
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.240]   when it's made out of plastic bricks.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.440]   - You'd think so, but actually when it's lit properly,
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.080]   it is even spookier, it is the uncanny valley.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.880]   - What is this guy, the half?
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.880]   - Too face.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.120]   - Oh, sorry, I'm not up on the Batman.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.120]   - That's the case.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:52.960]   - That's the case.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.960]   - That's the case, Brandon. - He said everybody at the same time.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.800]   (laughing)
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.640]   - He must read some comic books.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.520]   - I believe that's the Harvey Dead version
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.000]   of the two-case character.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.040]   - Okay, I advise.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.040]   I can't believe that.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.520]   - Clearly outmanned here.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.480]   We're out nerded.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:11.080]   Julio O'Hade is a pot of writing
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:15.320]   in the Minneapolis Twin Cities Pioneer Press.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:20.320]   Sad to say the end of the very first Apple dealer
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   after 35 years, first tech is shuttering its doors,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.560]   started in the early '70s, I mean late '70s,
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.120]   I should say when Apple first started selling Apple IIs.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:39.560]   So it started as team electronics became first tech.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.160]   And I've seen this happen.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.000]   You probably remember Tom Santos and Mac Adam down
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.400]   on the Harrison Street in San Francisco.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.440]   And I remember him going out of business some years ago.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.560]   He said, "I can't compete with Apple.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.000]   "They've got their own stores now.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.200]   "They get the products and much better allocations
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.600]   "and we can ever get.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.120]   "You can offer service and support, as Tom did for years,
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.680]   "but eventually people just stop going to you."
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.080]   - It's a different world now.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.840]   I mean, the Apple retail stores have totally changed that game.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.440]   I remember, I mean, this era,
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.960]   that's when I got my first Apple II.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.000]   Was it a store?
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.400]   I remember walking in the doors.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.440]   It was in Modesto, California.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.760]   And it was like beige carpet with beige tables
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.040]   and beige computers on them.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.480]   And it salesmen and they were, it was a different world.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.920]   And some of those stores survived by adapting,
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.320]   but it's not like, you know, we were talking about Comic Con
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.480]   earlier when I go to Comic Con,
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.320]   I hear comic book retailers talk about this
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.680]   and they have their businesses a little different,
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.560]   but it's also changing dramatically
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.880]   because they're, you know, people aren't buying stuff
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:42.040]   in paper anymore and the rise of digital retailers.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.320]   It's not that different than the rise of Apple retailing
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.520]   where you can survive by being super,
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.920]   building a community, being super supportive,
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.000]   but even then it's just a brutal business to be in
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:52.880]   'cause the world has changed.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.080]   - Or being in an area that there is no Apple store
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.280]   and serving those remoter areas.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.600]   But look at a normal Apple store now,
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.280]   they have machines that are in the back
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.000]   that they just go and use to replace screens on iPhones.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.240]   - You can't get those machines, yeah.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.880]   - Here's a video from when the Macintosh came out
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:12.880]   that features that store, the first tech store
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:16.880]   in Minneapolis, this hike harkens back to 1977
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.720]   when the first apples were sold.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.560]   Where the five million machines sold all started
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.000]   in Minnesota, the first Apple store.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.760]   - It really is a bit of history.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.520]   I don't think they had hummers back then.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.840]   - One of the biggest stuff stories I guess would have to be
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.520]   what was known as team number one.
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.280]   Team number one was--
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.840]   - That was back where the Russian franchise--
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.680]   - That was back where the Russian franchise--
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.000]   - The Russian, the former Marines--
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.840]   - The former Marines, between the back--
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.760]   - What's the maker had had a team central
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.240]   organization-- - You listen to Wayne, Wes Laff,
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.920]   who was-- - Apple store, nice.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.480]   - Apple store, I remember this, I remember there was
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.400]   an Apple store in San Francisco,
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.000]   they had every bit of Apple software.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   - They now change their name to--
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.480]   - Every single Mac program.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.160]   - The team electronic stores, but to my knowledge,
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.440]   that will make them the longest continuous--
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:59.360]   - You go in there to buy software, box,
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.640]   and you talk to somebody, and they, you know--
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.480]   - I like your comic book--
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.320]   - Look at the lease.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.800]   - You could talk to somebody who was mean
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.480]   and dismissive to you, or you could talk to somebody
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.920]   who was great, and you wanted to come back
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.680]   and buy stuff from them.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.040]   - That's certainly--
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.200]   Ooh, Bell and Howell Apple, too, very nice.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.040]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.880]   - But yeah, that's part of the problem, too.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.040]   People who--
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.440]   Silent-type thermal printer--
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.600]   (laughing)
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.440]   - Oh, man.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.920]   - This is like for two generations earlier,
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.280]   what looking at classic cars is what I get
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.960]   from looking at a couple of them.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.880]   That's the Silent-type, I remember--
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.200]   I printed out my first Apple Soft programs on it.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.040]   - Anyway, that is--
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.080]   - And used to race those in his youth.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:39.240]   - Great article by Julio in the Pioneer Press,
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.840]   and you can see it online as well.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.120]   And he sent us a link to that,
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:43.960]   and I'm glad he did.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.560]   Thank you, Julio, for writing that story.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.440]   - The other problem they're facing is that,
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.960]   remember that when stores like that
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.280]   were doing really, really well,
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.320]   it wasn't just getting that interaction from Apple,
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.440]   it was also the idea that most people coming in,
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.360]   that was their first time,
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.960]   they had an opportunity to actually put their hands
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.600]   on a real home computer.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.360]   And now, one of the things that makes it so easy
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.440]   to order online is that I know what computers are,
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.800]   I know how they work, I know what I want,
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.760]   I don't have to have someone walk me through,
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.600]   do I need a floppy drive, or is the cassette drive?
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.560]   Cassette tape gonna be okay for me.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.980]   - So, and another late lamented website,
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:20.520]   MacFixit.com, which was owned by CNET at this point,
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.280]   and CNET silently shut it down,
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.800]   an article from Ted Landau,
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.360]   who was the creator of MacFixit,
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.800]   way back, hard to believe, in 1996.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.200]   It was a site I used all the time,
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.240]   a place to go to see what people were doing about bugs
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.160]   with it, this was a known bug.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.080]   He managed to site for four years,
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.640]   he said, sold its tech tracker,
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.680]   which did the same thing for all computers,
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.400]   in 2000, he was editor to 2002.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:49.280]   And I guess the last man standing,
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.840]   Tofur Kessler, who has been the primary contributor
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:55.600]   to MacFixit under CNET, has started a new site, Mac Issues.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.600]   So same idea, we'll send people to macissues.com.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.040]   But yeah, I mean, I loved MacFixit,
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.280]   I used it all the time, and it was the place I'd go,
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.840]   somebody'd call me on the radio show and say,
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.160]   "Hey, if you heard about this," and I said, "Let me check."
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.760]   Let's see.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.640]   >> This is, I know this is kind of inside baseball,
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.440]   but CNET bought tech tracker because they wanted
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.600]   the version tracker, what do you think?
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.880]   Mac users think about version tracker,
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.840]   but they wanted, especially the tech tracker,
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.040]   software database for download.com.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.760]   And they wanted to integrate that data,
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.760]   they eliminated a competitor,
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.920]   but they also integrated all that,
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.680]   updates data into their database,
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.800]   which was like strategic for them.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.760]   The version tracker stuff less so,
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.240]   and then there was MacFixit,
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.600]   which wasn't like the other two things.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.720]   And so they inherited it and it kind of kept going,
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.920]   but I think this was inevitable
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.160]   because that purchase was never meant to be about MacFixit,
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.920]   and CNET's history with Apple-based information
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.920]   is not very strong.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.560]   >> Well, and I gotta tell you frankly,
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.360]   you guys don't run into this probably,
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.680]   but Windows users do all the time,
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.720]   download.com, their download site is notorious now
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:05.080]   for layering Adwyr upon Adwyr upon your downloads,
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.560]   'cause what you get is instead of the original file,
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.920]   you get a original file wrapped in a downloader,
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.440]   which installs a lot of crap.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.360]   It's so close to malware, it's hairs breadth distance.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.200]   >> Some of my very first Mac software reviews
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.360]   are I think in that database somewhere.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.200]   >> Really?
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.080]   >> Only because I worked at Zif Davis.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.640]   The Zif Davis Software Library went to ZDNET,
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.960]   which got bought by CNET,
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.960]   and I'm sure my five mouse review of Drag Thing
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.200]   from 1995 is still there.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.040]   >> Still there, still there.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.160]   >> Anybody wants to--
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.280]   >> We're like blues musicians that like,
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.920]   we're giving $50 in a bottle of Ripple to record H-song,
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.520]   and now it's owned by a company--
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.920]   >> Michael Jackson owns it now.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.040]   (laughing)
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.280]   >> There will be however, a new Apple Store in Istanbul,
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.040]   simultaneously with shutting down Twitter,
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.240]   Turkey is now getting its own Apple Store.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.560]   I love the way they're building this under wraps.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:58.080]   You literally, they've got it all hidden.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.000]   >> It's part of the magic, Leo.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.640]   >> The magic of the Apple Store, Tim Cook,
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.680]   I think is gonna go there for the opening,
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.400]   but maybe now what's been going on in Istanbul,
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.560]   it might be inappropriate.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.280]   April 4th will be the opening, be interesting to watch.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.960]   Istanbul is an amazingly beautiful city
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.720]   with wonderful people, and it is a little scary
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.680]   to see what's happening there right now.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.040]   Let's see, what else do you want to talk about?
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.800]   There's always good news here in the Apple world.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:31.160]   Apple and Google agreed not to poach each other's employees.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.120]   It turns out it wasn't just Apple and Google,
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:37.280]   it was a dozen Silicon Valley company.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.960]   >> A vast Silicon Valley conspiracy.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.880]   >> This one's real.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.520]   >> Absolutely, this one's real.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.360]   >> It is illegal, it is a form of trust.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.240]   It's an antitrust violation to say,
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.680]   hey look, if we said to revision three,
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.160]   we won't try to hire any of your people,
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.320]   if you don't hire any of our people.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.520]   The reason being those employees are disadvantaged
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.800]   'cause they can't basically get a competitive offer.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.680]   >> Right, right, either to get a better job
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.880]   or to get you to give them more money in order to keep them.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.320]   And this is the case of,
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:10.600]   I would actually say well off tech executives
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.200]   deciding that they want to protect the value
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.640]   of their company and they don't really care
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.480]   if their employees don't have a free market
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.400]   for their services.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.200]   And it's not only is this the rare conspiracy
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.240]   that's totally real, but it's awful.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.200]   It is just, it is staggeringly terrible.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.760]   And there are lots of people in technical fields
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.640]   in Silicon Valley who got chatted by this.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.480]   It's really bad.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.200]   >> It started as an agreement between jobs
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.560]   and Google's Eric Schmidt.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.960]   It expanded to include companies like Dell, IBM, eBay,
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:44.960]   Microsoft, Comcast, Clear Channel, DreamWorks,
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.800]   the London-based public relations firm WPP,
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.560]   the Justice Department has focused basically
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.600]   on Adobe Apple Google Intel Intell
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.520]   and to it Lucasfilm and Pixar,
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.600]   smoking gun memos galore on all this.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.080]   I mean, they did not even really attempt
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.360]   to hide it particularly.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.120]   >> Not only that, but smoking gun memos
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.400]   from the very top.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.240]   You have CEOs talking to other CEOs
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.600]   about what their policies are going to be.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:14.160]   And so there's just absolutely no cover whatsoever
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.120]   against the awfulness of this game.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.840]   >> CEO of eBay Meg Whitman called Eric Schmidt
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.600]   to complain that Google's recruiters
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.280]   were hurting profits and business at eBay.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:29.440]   Stop it, stop it.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:34.160]   So Eric Schmidt responds to her with a do not forward,
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.760]   actually this is to his own hiring team
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.120]   with a do not forward email.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.280]   >> That'll stop the subpoenas.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.120]   >> Yeah, that'll stop.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.760]   Whatever you do, don't tell anybody about this.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.840]   Meg called to talk about our hiring practices.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.800]   This was a rough call from a good friend.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.800]   We need to get this fixed.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.560]   Fire the recruiter immediately.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.520]   >> Ouch.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.840]   >> For cause.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.720]   >> And imagine you're a developer who's got an okay job
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.240]   or maybe it's a bad job.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.520]   And somebody at Apple discovers that you were really talented.
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.760]   They see something you did or they have beer with you
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.120]   or you're a friend of a friend.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.280]   And like, "Oh, we need somebody with your skills."
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.600]   And it's a much better job.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.160]   And you never are allowed to have it.
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.000]   >> Horrible.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:12.840]   Just ridiculous.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:13.920]   >> Do you think that it's possible
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.280]   these people did not know how wrong and illegal this was?
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.040]   >> Well, I mean Steve Jobs is a guy.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.400]   We can say lots of good things about him.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.080]   But he's also the guy who refused to drive with a license plate
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:24.320]   and just kept getting a new car.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.280]   >> It's a nice one.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.000]   >> So I think it's fair to say that Steve Jobs
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.720]   maybe didn't care about some of these rules
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.160]   because he thought that this was,
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.280]   he was protecting his company and didn't really care
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.640]   that this was a secret cabal that was preventing
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.000]   the freedom of the world.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.240]   >> The war in hell is in my engineers.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.680]   >> He would definitely have taken this personally
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.440]   and saying, "I'm defending my company against people
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.160]   "who would attack it by taking away my key personnel.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.040]   "My cause is holy and righteous
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.640]   "and I will prosecute it into the last drop of my blood."
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.880]   >> Yeah, but it also doesn't say,
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.800]   and I'm not gonna go after their employees.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:59.280]   >> Yeah, one of the things that I missed
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.800]   in the haunted empire, not to get back to that for a second,
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.360]   but I think one of the ways that Steve Jobs
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.280]   is truly haunting Apple to this day
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.480]   is his disregard for a lot of these laws.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.800]   You see it in the e-book settlement,
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.000]   which we can have issues with Amazon's monopoly on e-books,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.040]   but you can see it in the way that they approach that.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.160]   You can see it with this story.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.840]   And you could argue that all of the patent lawsuits
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.120]   where he said we were gonna go thermonuclear,
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.040]   these are, I think, some of the ways
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.760]   that Steve Jobs really is haunting Apple,
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.600]   because they're still trying to dig out from this stuff
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.840]   and paying the price for some of Steve Jobs's decisions.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.920]   >> I would buy your book in a second, Jason.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:35.760]   >> You know?
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.600]   (laughing)
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.440]   It's a comic book.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.600]   >> What's interesting, one company
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.680]   that you might expect in this list as not is Facebook.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.920]   Cheryl Sandberg says, "I was approached by it with this idea
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.160]   "and I immediately said absolutely not."
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.480]   >> I think Palm said that too.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.120]   >> Yeah, absolutely not.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.200]   >> One of the most Mr. Burns-ish emails
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.240]   in this paper trail was Steve Jobs,
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.080]   like Mother the CEO of Palm saying,
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.360]   "I don't feel as though I can really go ahead with this.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.600]   "I don't think this is right."
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.200]   And then Steve saying, "Let's take a look at..."
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.600]   We could fight this out with lawyers,
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.120]   but take a look at Apple's financial position.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:07.960]   (laughing)
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:08.800]   Take a look at your position.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.320]   That's what I would recommend that you do.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.680]   >> Oh my God, that's horrible.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:13.560]   >> Oh.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.720]   >> I think the only, I mean, I can only,
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:20.320]   I kind of quiver when I think about if Steve were still around
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.600]   and had to make some sort of public statement on this,
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:28.200]   oh my God, that would have been an epic statement
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.600]   about you're all idiots,
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.680]   you don't understand how business works.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.040]   I can't believe I'm even forced to waste my time
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:37.600]   to address this, but don't worry fans of Apple
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.600]   and employees of Apple,
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.160]   we will defend our integrity against these people
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.640]   who are wished to harm our company.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.760]   Don't worry, I'm gonna be fighting the good fight
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.600]   for all of us.
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.360]   >> You want a free bumper fine, here's your free bumper.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.800]   (laughing)
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.120]   Babies.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.880]   >> You're hiring it wrong.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.720]   Did you do that right?
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.400]   (laughing)
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.480]   >> Apple is in talks with Comcast once again,
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.920]   but this time not about employees,
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.320]   this time about a streaming service.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.280]   We'd heard before the Comcast time Warner merger
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:05.600]   that Apple was talking to Time Warner.
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.280]   So is this just continuing talks?
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.120]   >> Same story.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.400]   >> Seems to me that they said,
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.080]   "Well, now you need to talk to this guy now."
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.880]   So we got a new guy.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.320]   New guy in town, although I don't think that mergers happen yet.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.160]   So--
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.160]   >> No, but they could probably see the writing on the wall.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.760]   >> They're being proactive.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.600]   >> It's smart.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.320]   I mean, Tivo's got a deal with Comcast
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:26.760]   that gives Tivo boxes on Comcast network access
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.320]   to all of the Comcast on demand stuff.
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.640]   So I think Comcast makes a lot of money
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.400]   selling internet services, having it go through Apple,
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:38.120]   if that's a premium add-on like Tivo is.
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.760]   Comcast has shown in the past that they're happy,
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.640]   like, "Look, you don't want our crappy box?
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.000]   You want to pay more for Tivo?
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:43.840]   That's fine.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.200]   We'll give you all our stuff on Tivo too."
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:49.640]   >> So the Apple TV would become a Comcast,
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:53.320]   like HBO Go, would become a Comcast on demand service
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.240]   or would have a Comcast app?
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.960]   >> Well, so Comcast service,
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.600]   I just switched six months ago to Comcast,
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.800]   got one of the new Tivo's.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.760]   So I got to discover all of this.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.360]   Comcast has on demand.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.880]   They've got a bunch of live TV channels
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.360]   that stream on their app or on the web.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.840]   So if you're a Comcast subscriber, you can stream those.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.520]   So you roll all of the stuff that they're bundling
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.360]   that's live and all the stuff that they're bundling
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.360]   that's on demand.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.040]   >> You get the streamcast too,
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.160]   which is their streaming,
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.520]   like their Netflix competitor, I think.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.520]   >> I don't know.
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:26.600]   I haven't looked into that one.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.760]   And then they'll be on the TV.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.920]   >> So it's like Comcast is really becoming,
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.880]   as you said, is net forward.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:34.680]   >> And they own NBC on top of that, right?
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.600]   So you could imagine bundling all of that Comcast stuff together
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:42.240]   for Comcast customers under an Apple TV channel even of Comcast
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.480]   and have access to all the on demand
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.920]   and all of the streaming live channels that they've got.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.000]   >> But can I get channel four?
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:49.880]   Can I get channel five?
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:51.160]   That would be the question.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.200]   'Cause then I wouldn't need--
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.440]   >> I bet you could get channel 11 'cause they own that.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.120]   >> But--
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:56.960]   >> That's a big question.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.040]   >> And you see I could get but not.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.440]   >> Interesting idea.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.640]   And it would be fascinating to me if Comcast,
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.440]   you know, we have such strength in internet
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.480]   that we're gonna go over the top,
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:07.320]   which is what they call it
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.400]   when you take the cable box out of the equation
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.520]   and say we're gonna put every channel we can live
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:17.640]   and recorded on the internet for our subscribers.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.440]   >> Yeah, you still have to have a cable account
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.920]   and Comcast-- >> Right, but maybe you don't need a TV
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.480]   account anymore or something.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.400]   I don't know.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.960]   >> Apple, in fact, I think I've mentioned this before.
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.440]   We were talking about the Netflix Comcast brew ha ha
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:30.840]   and there's a lot more in that.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.240]   We will talk about that at some point.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:35.760]   But one of the things we learned at the time
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:39.080]   was that the best way to watch Netflix is on an Apple TV
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.960]   'cause they host it.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.160]   They have their own CDN, Apple, of course,
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.640]   concerned about quality, says, you know what,
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.120]   we're not gonna trust the public internet
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.040]   to bring you Netflix, we're gonna do it ourselves.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.880]   They've consistently had the best quality Netflix.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.320]   So imagine if they do this with Comcast.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.160]   >> Absolutely, but the thing is,
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.160]   there's a couple of challenges with this.
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:58.160]   One is that no one really knows what's happening yet.
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.040]   There's some rumors that they're gonna actually build
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.720]   the Comcast box and sell it.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:03.160]   So you'd be able to get an Apple version
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.480]   of the Comcast box.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.560]   Some are that it would be an app
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:08.600]   and it would go on your iOS device or on your Apple TV.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.920]   But there's questions about whether they have
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:10.920]   the rights to the programming.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:13.160]   Can Comcast just give them the rights that they have?
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.640]   Or do they need separate agreements?
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.520]   And this again goes all the way back to Steve Jobs
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.040]   at all things digital.
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.840]   They had a deal with AT&T, which at least covered the country.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.360]   This is gonna have to go region by region in America
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.160]   to get the deals just to roll it out.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.720]   Then they're gonna have to talk to Canadian cable companies,
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:30.680]   talk to Lithuanian cable companies.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.800]   It's an incredibly arduous go-to-market strategy.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.200]   And I think the rumors heating up just show how difficult
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:37.360]   it is for Apple.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.000]   And maybe originally they just wanted to make their own
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.360]   TV deals and get their own subscription service.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:44.880]   But the cable companies make this L companies look like
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.120]   the happiest, most go-luckyest companies in the world.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.200]   - So my theory is that because Comcast is,
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.840]   pending this time Warner merger, just gigantic
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:54.760]   and covers a huge amount of the US,
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:56.760]   that one way you might approach this is to say,
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.440]   we're gonna build it with Comcast.
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:00.040]   That's gonna show how it's done.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.560]   It's gonna be an Apple TV app.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.040]   The other cable companies will give them our developers kit.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:06.840]   They can make channels that do the same thing using
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.640]   be like Comcast, do it like that.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.160]   And that might be the only way they can go forward
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.560]   is to find the biggest name, make a deal with them,
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:15.880]   and use that as the example.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.280]   Because otherwise, you're right.
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:20.000]   It would take, there would be dozens, if not hundreds
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.360]   of different negotiations they have to do.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:22.200]   - That's the beauty of you.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.680]   See Comcast, this is massive.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.520]   - It's, yes.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.800]   - You only have to make it with one person,
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.280]   they got everybody, you know.
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:31.000]   But this is why my main problem with these stories,
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.600]   and we've been following these for a couple of years now,
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:37.560]   is that sometimes it feels as though Apple's working
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:41.920]   really, really hard on a Blackberry style phone.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.520]   Where it could be the most beautiful thing ever,
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:45.520]   the most wonderful thing ever,
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.400]   that doesn't change the fact that people are moving away
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.000]   from phones with a mechanical keyboard,
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.800]   it's that run with the way that Blackberry does.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.760]   In my imagination, I stress the word imagination,
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:58.680]   I imagine Apple saying that why do we want to encourage people
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:02.040]   to get all of their content from cable companies forever?
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.440]   If we're really getting them to invest
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.000]   in the next five or 10 years, let's create a way,
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.200]   and if we're going to burn so many lawyers
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.880]   into mortal combat against each other
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.400]   to make these deals happen,
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.080]   let's make it easier for cable channels individually
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:17.360]   to produce content for Apple TV.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.600]   And they'd still have to go through a sign in,
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.720]   through the cable company to prove
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.560]   that they've actually created a--
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:23.400]   - That's what we've gotten now.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:24.480]   - That they have access to it.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.760]   - Well, but they could improve that too,
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.960]   and therefore then they don't have to make any deals
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.040]   with any cable companies, they can create an API
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:33.760]   that every single channel will love to use
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.880]   and will make it so easy,
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.640]   and they'll give these companies so much help
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.640]   that maybe you will stop using your cable box to access
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:41.720]   because these apps will run it that much better.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.920]   - Well, you understand why Comcast wants this,
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.120]   because they do see the train coming down
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.680]   the tunnel at them, and so this is a way to kind of
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.600]   make that transition to, as you said,
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.800]   over the top network internet-based system.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.120]   - And it could be as simple as adding something
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:59.000]   like an accounts setting where you log in--
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.240]   - Here's what the journal says.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.160]   This is what the journal says.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.360]   Apple and Comcast aren't close to an agreement.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.000]   In fact, I saw a great conversation on TNT a couple
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.880]   of days ago, I think, or maybe it was Monday.
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.520]   Mike Elgin had a guy from Variety
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.520]   and a guy from Ars Technica,
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.440]   so you had the technical side and the Hollywood side,
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:17.160]   and both agreed this is never gonna happen.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.600]   Apple and Comcast aren't close to an agreement
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.160]   according to the journal delivering the service quality
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.840]   Apple and Visions would require Comcast
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.960]   to make significant investments in network equipment
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.960]   and other back office technology.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.440]   According to people familiar with Comcast thinking,
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.760]   the companies also differ on how deep a relationship
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.160]   Apple should have with Comcast customers,
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:37.040]   'cause Apple wants users to sign on
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.200]   to the new device with Apple log-ins.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.960]   They want to control customer data,
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.600]   of course, Apple does, right?
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.520]   They also asked for a cut of the monthly subscription phase
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.560]   paid by customers.
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:49.000]   - This also sounds like somebody's negotiating
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.320]   in the press. - Yeah, because these are,
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:54.080]   Wall Street Journal's got people from Apple
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.960]   and from Comcast's side in this article.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.760]   Comcast says unnamed sources wants to retain
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.880]   significant control over the relationship with customers
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.240]   and the data, of course, they both do.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.920]   Furthermore, Apple, and this is the trick that you mentioned,
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:11.040]   must require significant TV programming rights
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.480]   from media companies.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.640]   It's not just Comcast.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.560]   And Comcast would want to ensure the price Apple
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.720]   has to pay to acquire those rights.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.880]   Wouldn't cause the service to be priced higher
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.200]   than traditional pay TV.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.200]   It's gotta be less or the same.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:24.280]   - It's a bag of hurt.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.480]   - Yeah, that's why I think the most likely thing
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.560]   that'll happen is an agreement where you'll have to be
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:31.120]   a TV customer of Comcast.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.400]   You can't cut your TV. - Yeah, that's exactly.
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.160]   - And then it'll be like HBO Go or something like that,
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.400]   where you'll have access to the on-demand
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:37.320]   and the streaming channels,
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:39.640]   but it won't be a cord-cutting kind of thing
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:41.680]   because that's gonna be that much more complicated.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:44.200]   - Now, if they do that and they have an SDK for games,
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.200]   it could maybe be interesting enough that people
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:49.360]   will be willing to swallow the login stuff.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:52.480]   - Maybe. - But there's so many ways
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:54.640]   you can make the login stuff so much easier
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:55.800]   and so much faster.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.000]   And I would see Apple fixing that as part
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.240]   of the solution to the problem.
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.320]   - Well, for me, it's not logging into the cable companies.
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:03.400]   It's having to have anything to do with the cable companies.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.720]   - Exactly.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.920]   - Like I would love an Apple version of Netflix
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.360]   where Apple just had the rights of the content
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.200]   and they could do it.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:10.760]   But there's so many, like,
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:12.880]   Jason said Comcast owns NBC.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.280]   They also own the internet pipes.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.680]   And do we get into an agreement?
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:17.800]   You know, Apple can buy a lot of infrastructure,
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.240]   but do they have to start paying Comcast
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:21.480]   the way that Netflix is now having to pay some companies?
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.320]   There's so many hurdles that these companies
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.560]   can put in Apple's way from them
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.960]   just delivering a direct-to-consumer product.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.000]   - So tell me how this Tivo thing works.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.480]   So I can buy a T because I have Comcast in there.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.240]   Their cable box is horrific.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.080]   - Yes.
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:34.920]   - The UI is terrible.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.680]   - See, buy a Tivo and you gotta pay Tivo for that
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:40.040]   and you gotta pay a monthly or buy the lifetime to Tivo.
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.800]   - But then it's just like it's got a cable card.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:44.680]   - But you get a cable card and it's one of those,
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.000]   I think I've got one cable card.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.360]   It's got six tuners on it, which is insane.
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.200]   - Yeah.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.040]   - And--
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:50.880]   - So you can record six shows at once.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.280]   - Six shows at once.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.360]   It's got a giant hard drive.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.720]   - You like that little lady who had the eight VCRs
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:57.080]   in her house and was recording.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.880]   - And Tivo's got its own streamer called Tivo Mini
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.280]   that you can put in other rooms
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.560]   and they will stream off the hard drive.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:03.400]   - So you recommend this?
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.240]   - Including live.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.080]   - Sounds expensive.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.040]   - It's not cheap, but it's actually,
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.280]   when I switched from direct TV,
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:11.280]   I ended up the savings paid for the Tivo stuff.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.840]   So it ended up being a wash for me,
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.400]   but it does have access to the on demand stuff
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:19.320]   that you would expect a third party cable box wouldn't have
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:22.480]   because Tivo made a deal specifically with Comcast.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:25.160]   So to me that shows that Comcast is at least open
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.600]   to making some of these deals.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:29.120]   If in the end, the people who are getting this,
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.480]   they're still getting their money basically.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.760]   They're still getting that,
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:34.880]   you're still paying them for your cable and internet.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.200]   - That's all they care about it.
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:37.040]   - That's what they want.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.480]   - Comcast has their Xfinity box and there's a Tivo box,
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.320]   but I look at my local cable box
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:43.400]   and it's still an SD interface that looks like
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.920]   it was developed in Soviet Russia.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.920]   I've gone from a trio to an iPhone 5S
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.720]   and I still have a box.
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.320]   There's just no innovation in that industry.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:54.160]   - There's still screens in the Tivo Romeo that are SD.
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.400]   Most of them are not now,
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.960]   but there are still a few that are, it's baffling.
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:59.800]   - So do I go to Tivo to get this?
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.760]   Or do I go to Comcast?
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:03.520]   - You go to Tivo, if you wanna get it, just, you know?
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.320]   - But then I have to talk to Comcast and get the cable car.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.920]   - You have to go get a cable car from Comcast.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.400]   I waited in line at my local Comcast office.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:11.240]   - That's the best way to do it.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.400]   - For 10 minutes, they handed me the card,
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:14.800]   I plugged it in, that was it.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.040]   - I have found if you go to the Comcast office,
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:17.880]   those guys are--
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:19.360]   - You don't have the guy come to your house.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.920]   - No, or call the phone on the phone.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:21.760]   - Oh no, no, no.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.200]   - You know, I have a Google Voice number
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.720]   which has a Baltimore area code,
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:28.400]   so they keep routing me to Comcast Baltimore.
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.080]   No, I'm not in Baltimore.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.680]   That's just my phone number.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:36.680]   Anyway, again, I mean, I, through a 20 minute story
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:39.720]   that gets collapsed down to,
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.880]   I rearranged the furniture in my liver room
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:44.200]   and suddenly became an awesome place to watch TV.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.880]   (laughing)
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:47.040]   There you go, that's the whole story.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.680]   But then I thought, gee, I should actually
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.040]   like get a cable box installed here
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.640]   'cause now this is a place where I like to
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.240]   like hang out and watch TV.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.200]   But I put that off for about a month
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.400]   and then I realized that, well look,
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:59.480]   all the shows that I really, really like are on Hulu Plus.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.320]   I don't need that.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:03.720]   A lot of the shows that I watch in clip form,
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:04.600]   I can get through YouTube.
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:05.840]   I don't need that.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:07.840]   I've got the Slink Player app on my Roku,
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.600]   so I don't have to transfer something
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:11.560]   from the cable box I've got upstairs.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.600]   I really think that I'm so close to simply saying
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:16.360]   that I don't need regular cable TV anymore.
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:18.600]   And I'm a middle-aged old man.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:21.440]   I'm not one of these young hipsters with a poochy,
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.920]   you know, slam down the Mountain Dew
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:24.640]   and riding the skateboard or whatever it is
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.160]   the kids are doing these days.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:30.240]   I'm just not convinced that making cable TV work better
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:33.560]   is the solution that any forward-thinking company
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:36.520]   is gonna be really pursuing very, very hard at this point.
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:38.360]   By the way, if you get your Tivo from Weakness,
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:41.200]   you can get an eight terabyte drive in there.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:44.720]   I would run a record 1280 hours.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:46.800]   You could literally record for a while
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.240]   and then drop off the grid.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.360]   For all six channels.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.680]   I don't know how you do this, Jason.
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.880]   I'm stressed out enough knowing that there are like
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:56.480]   at least four different cable series on Netflix
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.120]   that I can find out.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:59.680]   I still haven't seen House of Cards.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.120]   I know that, oh man, I have to see it,
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:01.960]   but they're all there.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.480]   And how am I gonna get through the stress
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:05.120]   of watching all of these shows at once?
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:07.320]   If I had six shows recording at once.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:08.560]   The six is as it is.
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:10.600]   I still haven't seen this week's amazing race.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:11.920]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:13.960]   Six tuners is outrageous,
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.440]   but it means that there are never any conflicts,
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.280]   which is kind of nice,
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.400]   especially if I'm recording sports.
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:23.120]   I have not even filled the hard drive up halfway.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.720]   Another, not to plug Tivo here,
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:27.120]   but their Netflix app on the Tivo
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:28.240]   is actually pretty good now.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.080]   That's actually a P.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.840]   That's how we watch Netflix now is also from the Tivo.
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:32.680]   Oh, not your Apple TV.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.600]   The Roku version of the Netflix app
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:37.160]   kicks Apple TV's butt.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.680]   It's so far behind at this point.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.800]   Would you stick around after the show
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:41.800]   and help me buy a Tivo?
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.480]   Sure. Okay, thank you.
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:44.880]   And anybody wants to continue to watch?
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.040]   We'll do a special.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:49.240]   Helping Leo by Tivo.
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.080]   Helping Leo by Tivo.
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:51.880]   Click the buy button.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:52.720]   Is that easy?
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.360]   Did you get on Amazon or?
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:57.400]   I think I got it straight from Tivo,
[00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:58.240]   but there's also one.
[00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.080]   I'm just glad they're still around.
[00:59:59.080 --> 00:59:59.920]   I thought they were gonna be,
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.120]   I thought they were dead.
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.720]   Really did, I thought that there was no.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.520]   They got a lot of patents,
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.240]   now they're making deals with cable companies.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.240]   That's key.
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:09.640]   Anything not to use that crap box.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.280]   And they never had good luck in Canada
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.040]   because we have no cable cards,
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.640]   we have very limited access for them.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.920]   So it's still hard.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.960]   They're moving to the cloud now.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.960]   Their idea is they're gonna be able to run their software
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.840]   on the cable companies systems.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.760]   And so you'll be able to just do all the,
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.040]   it's like an internet DVR over cable companies.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.800]   So they're finding ways to stay in business.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.160]   Because they always did have it.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.040]   They always did have a better UI than anybody else.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.320]   Okay, this is Twitch special number 173.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.600]   Leo buys a Tivo coming up next.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.680]   (laughing)
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.880]   I showed it, they brought to you by Gazelle.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.440]   You got an old gadget?
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.440]   They don't buy Tivo's,
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:49.240]   but they, or unfortunately, scientific Atlanta
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.240]   said top boxes, I wish they would.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:54.040]   But they will buy your old iPhone, your old iPod,
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:54.960]   anything from Apple.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.720]   They'll even buy broken iPads and iPhones
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.720]   'cause there's really a market for those G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.600]   We saw some beautiful Gazelle's
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.560]   when we were in San Diego at the Safari Park
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.280]   and they do have orange that looked just like that.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.680]   Were those Thompson's Gazelle's?
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.480]   I can't remember, I think they were.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.880]   Gorgeous.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.320]   A Gazelle is not only a beast that runs fast
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.280]   across the African plane,
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.800]   but a place to go with your old iPhone.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.760]   They will buy old blackberries.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.040]   You got an HTC One, you want the new one?
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.880]   Sell it there, an LG, a Motorola Nokia or Samsung phone?
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:28.880]   Sell it to Gazelle.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.240]   Now here's how it works.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.560]   You've got 30 days on that quote.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:36.680]   So maybe you got an iPad three
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.600]   and you wanna get the new Apple iPad four,
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.400]   which they're now offering.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.040]   Let's get an offer on my 165 bucks
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:47.080]   for my decent condition, third generation iPad.
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.480]   Now here's the beauty part.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.760]   I don't have to sell it today.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.440]   I have 30 days to take advantage of that.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:56.040]   That offer cannot change even though it's a fairly safe bet
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.920]   that anything you price on here
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.880]   is gonna be worth less than 30 days.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.160]   You lock it in for 30 days.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.960]   When you've got enough stuff in your Gazelle card,
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.680]   and I suggest you go through all those drawers
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.640]   and everything, get everything together,
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.840]   pull the trigger, check out.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.680]   They'll send you a box prepaid postage
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.400]   and everything you pile it in there.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.720]   If you forget to wipe your data,
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.880]   don't worry, Gazelle will do that for you, of course.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.440]   And then they'll send you a check or a PayPal credit
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:23.800]   or if you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon and who doesn't,
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.920]   you can get extra 5% with the Amazon gift card.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.840]   Gazelle.com, go there now,
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.920]   get an offer for your iPhone, your iPad,
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.440]   or any one of your old junkie products.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.640]   Gazelle is incredible.
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.200]   They've paid more than $100 million now
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.880]   to 700,000 customers.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.040]   It's free shipping, it's fast processing.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:45.480]   It is the way to sell your gadgets.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.760]   GA, who's got, I mean, this is the way to do it.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.520]   Who's got an old gadget?
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.360]   I bet you do.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.520]   Gazelle.com, try it today.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.320]   You're gonna love it.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:00.320]   Renee Ritchie is here from imore.com, a mobile nations site.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.480]   The editorial director at IDG, Jason Snell.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.200]   He is editor, editorial director
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.080]   for both Macworld and PCworld, go figure.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.680]   And Greenbot, which is our new Android site.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.800]   So crazy.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.800]   Greenbot.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.400]   Greenbot, yeah.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.880]   So you know, it's nice is all of you
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:18.120]   kind of agnostic nowadays.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.280]   And TechHive, which is great.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.120]   Don't let TechHive, which is for everything, yeah.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.920]   Greenbot, oh, I get it 'cause in Android
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.280]   he's a little green bot.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:25.960]   Took me a while.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.160]   You've already got a hands-on with a new HTC One there.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.440]   Nice.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.920]   Love those names like iPad.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.200]   You've got to put something in the brackets
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.920]   that people can tell it apart from the last one.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:35.960]   This drives me crazy.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.640]   It's just nuts.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.560]   We have to say fourth generation iPad
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.720]   because they decided not to make a distinction.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.640]   We have to say it.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:47.640]   I kind of like that better than having it be iPad A0139, right?
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:50.080]   Just say the year or the generation and let it go.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.280]   We got my mom one of the new iPads for her birthday
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.200]   and she just kept searching new iPad case
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.920]   and it was mostly relevant.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.800]   It results possible.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.720]   Right.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.680]   Well, and the HTC One is the M8, the old one was the M7,
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.640]   but they call it the same thing, HTC One.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.280]   So that's got to be confusing for consumers.
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.040]   I would think.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:09.200]   I really like how on, did they add in Mavericks
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.680]   that if you go to more info about your Mac,
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:15.240]   it now says 11-inch mid-2013.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.840]   It's actually on there like--
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:17.280]   It's mid-2013.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.760]   I'm getting mid-2013.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.400]   But at least that's what Apple calls it.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.240]   So if you--
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.560]   I'll say tell me what it says there.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.680]   One of our writers, Derek Kessler, he went through a thought
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.920]   experiment of actually going to a store and trying to buy one.
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.040]   He going, I want the new one.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:31.840]   Which one?
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:32.480]   The new one?
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:33.120]   HTC One.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:33.840]   I don't know the new one.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:34.840]   The new Samsung?
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:35.560]   No, the new one.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.560]   My friend said get the new one.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.560]   The new one.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.560]   One one.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.560]   Yeah, it's like a cruise sensor.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.760]   I call the store on one phone.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.440]   Who's on phone?
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:41.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:42.360]   What do I say?
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.000]   Get the new phone.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.120]   You're the one.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:44.880]   That's the one I want.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:45.440]   What do you mean?
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.040]   He just said the new one.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.640]   I have to say it's a little depressing, though,
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.800]   when you have the brand new Mac Pro and they call it the late 2013
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.280]   Mac Pro.
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.000]   It's already out of date.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.240]   It's already last year's Mac Pro.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.480]   I'm going to buy you and Leo.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.000]   If they had one.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.280]   There's a gold one coming Leo.
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.640]   It's not a-- it's champagne.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.680]   It's nasi-trivio gold.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:16.200]   Apple and Google agree with Microsoft and Yahoo
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.840]   that it's OK to read your user's emails.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:21.840]   Actually, the Microsoft story is not a particularly scary story,
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.360]   although I think people interpreted that way,
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.960]   probably because of all the Microsoft's scribbled ads
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.160]   in which they assert the Google's reading your email.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.400]   And then they read the email of an employee who
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.600]   is stealing company secrets.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.960]   And it scares everybody to death.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.120]   But if you look at the terms of service in all of these online
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:42.360]   services, iCloud, Gmail, Yahoo mail, and of course, Microsoft's
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.720]   Outlook, it says, under certain circumstances,
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.200]   we can read your mail.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:46.360]   Right.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.000]   The question is, I think people always
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.680]   understood that that might be a subpoena or something.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.000]   But in Microsoft's case, there was
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.440]   a writer who received Microsoft intellectual property.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.640]   It's absolutely true.
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:59.560]   And they're like, oh, that's one of our sites.
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:00.600]   Let's read his mail.
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.080]   Yeah, hot mail at the time.
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:06.200]   Well, the foolish thing is that they were using MSN messenger
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.440]   hot mail and SkyDrive to share all this stuff stolen
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.360]   from Microsoft.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.760]   Clearly, iMessage should have been used.
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:14.280]   Yes.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.280]   And Gmail.
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:15.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:18.160]   Microsoft says-- and I think this is good--
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.760]   from now on, they will have a process that
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:22.280]   will duplicate the subpoena process.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.880]   It's like a quasi-lethal process.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.760]   Review by a former judge, General Counsel, who'll review
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.880]   this and see if it steps up to the level
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.440]   that you would have to submit to get an actual subpoena
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.120]   before they do that.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:40.640]   And what I'd like to do is hear Yahoo, Apple, and Google
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.480]   say the same thing.
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.120]   Now, Apple, for some reason you trust Apple, right?
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.240]   They seem to be really working hard to protect privacy.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:49.160]   Also, the fallout from this kind of stuff.
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.320]   You'll imagine that Microsoft didn't think about the fallout,
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.160]   but now everyone's going to think about the fallout
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:53.840]   of this kind of activity.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:57.880]   Well, this happened-- and we were talking about this yesterday,
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.360]   or maybe it was on Twitch, but this happened
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.080]   before the Snowden revelations, this Microsoft,
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:02.680]   everything.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:06.200]   And I think post Snowden, post NSA revelations,
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.120]   everybody's now a lot more aware of this issue.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.600]   And had that happened, like in the last few months,
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.760]   Microsoft probably would have been a little bit more careful.
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.640]   Also, the language in the Microsoft terms of service
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:18.680]   was a lot more explicit than Google's or Apple's,
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.440]   where it's saying that you would expect these services
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:24.840]   to say that, please don't expect that your mail will never
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.920]   be read by anybody inside, because it's possible
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.800]   that for customer services, service purposes,
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.520]   we're going to have to make sure the things are working
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:30.960]   properly.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.560]   It's possible that what we are doing with your mail,
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:34.720]   just to keep the service running,
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:37.800]   meets some legal definition of we're looking at your mail.
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.000]   And so that's what we're doing.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.120]   In Microsoft, I think there's actual explicit language
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.800]   saying we will look at your mail if it's in defense
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.240]   of Microsoft's interests.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:48.920]   And it's like, yeah, let's red flag that one in circle around
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:51.560]   when we talk about whether we're going to use the service or not.
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:55.920]   But yeah, I love that there is--
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:00.200]   if there's not this term in the social conversation
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.160]   that's become like a standard Russian dashcam video--
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:08.320]   This is your basic Russian dashcam video accident of,
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.520]   yeah, you're getting confidential information
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:14.160]   from Microsoft and via a Microsoft free mail account.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.520]   Yeah, let's reshare that 40 times,
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.800]   because that's going to be epic.
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.080]   When Tim Cook said we've got products coming out
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.960]   in some brand new categories, we thought
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.960]   he was talking about the iWatch.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:29.520]   Maybe he was talking about a 12-inch Macintosh.
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.320]   Would like to go.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.320]   I would like to go.
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:32.320]   I'm not sure that's a new category.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:32.680]   Oh, come on.
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:33.800]   Give me a break.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.720]   In the broadest, most possible definition.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.640]   It's a very Samsung-y thing.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.200]   They got the 11-inch, the 12-inch.
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.040]   And the 13-inch.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:41.560]   Yeah.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.280]   I somehow think that if they have a 12-inch MacBook,
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:46.320]   they won't maybe have the 11.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.280]   Well, the 11-inch--
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.480]   Well, first of all, this is a rumor.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:51.160]   I think the 13-inch would go, because they've
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.040]   got the 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.960]   And they're now thin and light enough,
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:57.440]   and the battery life is now similar enough that you have--
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.400]   I think you have a lot of people confused about,
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.560]   do I want the air or do I want the retina?
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.680]   So if this is true, I would guess.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.920]   I'll put my money on losing the MacBook retina.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:07.960]   This is a leak from a forum.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:12.360]   Actually, it's a forum post on YPhone.com, Chinese site,
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.640]   W-E-I.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.000]   And although the author of the post
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.560]   has posted leaks and legitimate leaks and photos in the past,
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:22.600]   so has some credibility, the poster
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.560]   says there will be a new MacBook Pro line, as well as
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.600]   new 12-inch notebooks.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.680]   The MacBook Air updates are coming soon, he writes.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.640]   MacBook Pro updates won't occur until September.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:34.400]   Like last year.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:37.440]   New 12-inch notebook without fan assembly
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.800]   comes with a new trackpad, the design, that doesn't include
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.920]   the mechanical button.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:44.320]   How would you tap instead of click?
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.360]   I don't mind that, because I actually do turn on tapping.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.480]   But you like this physical--
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:51.000]   That's one of the first things I do.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.600]   I turn off tap to click, because that just gets so many bad
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.200]   clicks.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:57.400]   And also, what's wrong with actual having mechanical feedback?
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.760]   The report indicates that they've got something
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.320]   to actually replicate the sensation of a mechanical--
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.400]   some sort of tactile feedback that says you've just clicked
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:06.720]   something.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:07.720]   It's like a haptic thing.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:10.360]   Like a hap finger trampolines.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.400]   It's an electro-trib.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.920]   The interesting thing is, you know,
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.360]   12-inch-- Jason's got an 11.6-inch screen,
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.720]   because Apple just rounds these things.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:17.720]   So that is almost a 12-inch screen.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.080]   So who knows what 12 will be, 12-point something.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.040]   But they've been trying to do a Retina MacBook Air
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:22.840]   for a while now.
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:23.440]   That's what I care about.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:24.040]   It's the Retina.
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:24.680]   Absolutely.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.440]   But they just can't cram enough battery in.
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:27.600]   And if you look at--
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.960]   Retina is always a compromise.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.080]   Like the iPad 3 had to get thicker and heavier.
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.840]   The Retina iPad Mini had to get slightly thicker and heavier.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.920]   If they have to get slightly bigger to make a Retina iPad Air,
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.880]   it goes from 11.6 to 12-point X. I'm OK with that,
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.320]   because it's hard to go back from Retina.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.480]   You can start getting sandpaper on your eyeballs.
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.680]   I mean, it's just--
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:47.960]   I don't have the same problem.
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.160]   No sandpaper?
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.280]   I hear lots of people say that.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.280]   I respect that opinion.
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.840]   But I have a problem with a non-retina phone screen.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.760]   I have a problem with a Retina iPad.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.920]   But I don't keep my face eight inches away
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:01.920]   from my laptop screen.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.360]   It's far enough away that I certainly
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.680]   notice the improvement in a Retina display.
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:09.760]   But I would not have bought a MacBook Pro specifically
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.200]   so I can get a Retina screen.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.280]   It's not that big of a deal breaker for me.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.720]   Well, you go back and write it.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:15.320]   And Renee is right.
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.800]   If they have to compromise anything that's good about the MacBook
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.560]   Air to get a Retina display in there, it's not worth it.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.040]   It has to be the $999 machine that
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:28.120]   gets 41 hours of battery life and weighs about as little
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.200]   as a second thought.
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.840]   Is the lightest air we've ever made?
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:38.320]   We think it's the lightest.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.960]   The thing that scares me about that report
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.160]   is the fanless thing.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.040]   Because, OK, these processors can generate some heat.
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.400]   That sounds a little bit like a gimmick.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.040]   Like, it's like, well, fans make noise,
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:48.640]   and we don't like noise.
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.440]   So we'll take the fan out.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.240]   And as somebody who had that original MacBook Air,
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.800]   that overheated and turned off a core so you couldn't use it.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.440]   But it was running, but you couldn't use it.
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.600]   That scares me that you end up with other heat problems
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.960]   for something that I'm not sure why does it need to not--
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:05.960]   It's a problem that no one's complaining about.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.960]   Yeah, maybe they come up with a clever way to do it,
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.960]   and that'll be great.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.960]   But I get worried that that is a bunch of problems
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:12.960]   waiting to have it.
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.960]   It's 12 inches because there's going to be a slip stream
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:31.740]   in the middle of the computer, like Leo's Mac
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:32.740]   would mean.
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:34.420]   How much rewriting would they have to do, though?
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:35.420]   I mean, what is that?
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:36.320]   It's probably already done.
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.980]   I mean, the same way they had Intel running for years.
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:39.980]   I bet they have it working.
[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:40.500]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.820]   But what about apps?
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:43.300]   They're going to have to all be re-rerereled.
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:45.340]   It'll be as painful as the Intel transition was.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:47.220]   But I think that with Broadwell and with the ability
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:49.940]   to do what they're doing now, they sort of don't have to make
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:50.460]   that switch anymore.
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:53.380]   What's the Intel emulation like on a Broadwell chip?
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:54.860]   Well, Broadwell is going to tell, so Broadwell's going
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:56.260]   to be their next generator-- whatever after it--
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:57.260]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:00.100]   What's the x86 emulation like?
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:01.020]   That's going to be a good question.
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:02.180]   Yeah, can you do it?
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:03.740]   But I think the power savings--
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:05.900]   because the computer have forgotten fast enough.
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:08.380]   All of us can do anything we need to do on a modern computer.
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:11.700]   So Apple is changing tactics and doing battery life now.
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.060]   And power efficiency.
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:13.540]   Display.
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.740]   So these are the things that are increasingly important.
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:17.100]   And Intel was in trouble, I think,
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.660]   there for a while with their CPUs.
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:20.500]   But now with Haswell and with Broadwell,
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:21.700]   I think they're going to get to a place
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:25.340]   where they'll do everything that an ARM-based error could
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:26.420]   have done.
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:28.940]   Same leaker says, I watch not for a while.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:30.420]   Still just prototype.
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.940]   Maybe not even till 2015.
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:33.780]   Late 2014, I promise.
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:35.740]   I would rather they take their time and do it.
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:38.100]   I don't understand the Apple's not doing new categories.
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:41.020]   Apple and Neeza watch, 60 days or they're dead.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:42.540]   I do not want to bat I watch.
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:45.220]   I would pay good money not to get my watch until it is ready.
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:47.340]   Yeah, I think if anything, all the movement
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.540]   on the Android side and the pebble side this year
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:53.060]   gives-- if anything, it buys Apple some more time.
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:55.540]   Because no one's-- there's interest in it.
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:57.700]   There are people who wear pebbles all the time that like them.
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:00.140]   But there is not that sort of mass consumer support
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:02.180]   that would tell Apple, oh my god, we really
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.500]   have to ship this year or else we're
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:04.900]   going to start missing that boat.
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:07.860]   So I have no inside information on what their timeline is
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.460]   on a watch or, excuse me, a wearable device.
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:13.820]   But I were asked maybe four months ago at what it said.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:15.500]   I'm pretty sure 2014.
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:18.140]   Now, late 2014 at the earliest, I wouldn't even
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:21.660]   be surprised to see 2015.
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:23.660]   If you watched Jimmy Fallon and Billy Joel
[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:26.740]   doet using Lupi on an iPad, perhaps you're
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:28.860]   curious about the technology you use.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:30.420]   I'll jump ahead a little bit here.
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:31.100]   It was pretty cool.
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:33.300]   They each had handheld microphones.
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:35.260]   They had an iPad between them.
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:38.660]   And they would sing the loops from Mac--
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:39.860]   sorry, appleinsider.com.
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:46.020]   The story of how they did it.
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.940]   So they're recording the loops and then
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:49.820]   singing over on top of it.
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:52.660]   But it turns out they had an Apigee quartet as well,
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:55.780]   connected to the iPad Mini.
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:58.500]   That allowed them to have standalone microphones.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:05.700]   I have to say, the Lupi app is now half price on the App Store
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.100]   smart marketing move.
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:07.940]   That's--
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:10.300]   I think a lot of people download it immediately.
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:13.700]   And found out you actually have to have talent to use it.
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:16.220]   Somebody went from deciding that perhaps next year,
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:18.620]   I'll buy I'll replace my 10-year-old car to let's
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:21.260]   buy that cabin cruiser boat next week.
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:22.780]   That was a fair-- that was a gift.
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:25.060]   Well, the iPad is only $4, $500.
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:29.900]   The Apigee quartet is $1,400.
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:30.260]   It is--
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:30.860]   Not silly Joel there.
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.180]   You're going to want him to sound good.
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:35.020]   Yeah, I think it's perfectly fair to get the--
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.780]   so I haven't used this.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:37.900]   Anybody uses this?
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.140]   It's a multi-channel audio interface for the iPad,
[01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:41.980]   which is a very interesting idea.
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:44.220]   Four analog inputs.
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:45.900]   So it has mic preamps and fan and power.
[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:47.380]   So that means you can use these mics.
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:49.260]   Any mic can want good mics.
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:56.060]   Low latency monitoring, USB 2.0 audio, 24-bit 192 kilohertz
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:58.740]   A to D and D to A. Good quality.
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:01.980]   It makes an iPad pretty much like a recording studio.
[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:02.300]   Wow.
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.420]   Pretty impressive that the iPad is a device that
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:08.820]   can actually exploit audio of that high bit rate too.
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:09.860]   And keep up with it.
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:11.260]   Keep up with it.
[01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:13.060]   If anybody's looking for a story-- oh, of course,
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:16.580]   you can do that with an iPad if you have a $1,500 device.
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:18.060]   But really, the focus is, no, if you
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.300]   have a source of really great audio, the iPad is not
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:21.020]   going to dumb it down.
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:23.020]   It's going to actually treat it like really good audio.
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:23.820]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:24.660]   Pretty cool.
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:27.060]   It's the same thing with the iOS devices becoming interfaces
[01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:29.260]   to so many other cool parts of technology.
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:30.260]   Yeah.
[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:35.140]   Great article by, again, Mike Elgin.
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:37.380]   Mike gets more point-pointless points here
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:42.900]   on Cult of Mac about a technique that is built into iOS 7.
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:45.620]   We've known about it for a long time, called Mesh Networking.
[01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:49.340]   It allows an iOS 7 device that has no access to the internet
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:53.860]   to get to the internet via another iOS 7 device.
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.860]   And there's an app-- and by the way, I downloaded it
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:59.020]   and don't-- stupid fire chat.
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.180]   Considered a peaceful concept.
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.060]   It's a proof of concept, thank you.
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:04.700]   Because boy, the chats I was watching were wow.
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:07.700]   It can deliver an emoji con in a way
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:09.220]   that's never been done before.
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:10.340]   But if you remember those old cartoons
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.620]   that the guy jumping across the river one crocodile at a time,
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:13.620]   it's one of what you're doing here.
[01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:14.420]   It's multi-pier.
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:16.740]   So here's a little bit of Wi-Fi, a little bit of Bluetooth,
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:17.740]   a little bit of Wi-Fi.
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:20.660]   You're trying to find your way to someone else.
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:22.780]   Yeah, and you see everybody else along the way, which
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:25.020]   is a little weird.
[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:26.460]   But I could set it up.
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:27.420]   I'll install it right now.
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:28.420]   We'll put it on here.
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:30.420]   It's an iPhone app, but I could put it on my iPad.
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:31.300]   Fire chat.
[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:33.580]   So tell me about the Mesh Networking.
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:36.980]   Mike says this is a feature that could be used in a lot of other ways.
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:37.980]   It could be very significant.
[01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:40.140]   Airdrop uses it, I guess.
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:42.540]   So it sort of brings a lot of things together.
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:45.380]   So you have these Bluetooth 4.0 low energy, which sort of already
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:46.860]   piggybacks on Wi-Fi.
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:49.820]   You have these devices which do peer-to-peer Wi-Fi networks,
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:51.660]   like ad hoc Wi-Fi networks.
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:53.980]   And what this basically does is, neither of us
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:55.460]   are connected to the internet.
[01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:57.020]   But there's another device.
[01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:58.300]   Maybe I can get to that device.
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.500]   And maybe he's connected to the internet.
[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.380]   I can do a short hop off of him and then
[01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:03.660]   find a Bluetooth connection to somebody else.
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:06.780]   And literally, you're in a spacesuit pushing yourself
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:09.300]   from asteroid to asteroid to get to another planet.
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:12.180]   You're not relying on an existing highway or infrastructure
[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:13.180]   to do it.
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:14.180]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:16.260]   The big deal is that it makes communications possible,
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:17.980]   even if you don't have line of sight.
[01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:21.180]   So how many times have you been in a hotel, like a conference,
[01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:24.420]   where you're the only room that doesn't have access to Wi-Fi
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.220]   or can't get a signal on the phone.
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:29.420]   But that's OK, because there are 100 other people inside the hotel
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:32.460]   who also have the same sort of device
[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:34.180]   wearing the same sort of operating system.
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:38.020]   And so long as you can reach the iPad in the room next door
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:41.220]   and the iPad can reach the iPhone two doors down,
[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:43.300]   you can basically have the snakey sort of route
[01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:45.380]   that gives you internet, even though you're basically
[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:48.300]   in the econolodge dungeon.
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:49.100]   Yeah.
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:50.820]   Mesh networking is the next big thing,
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:53.940]   especially with a lot of wearable devices as you move around,
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:55.740]   the idea that you could then connect to something that
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:56.860]   could connect to the internet.
[01:18:56.860 --> 01:18:59.980]   Yeah, there won't be an LTE radio in a watch for a while now.
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:02.020]   But also in third world countries or in places
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.580]   where people are interfering deliberately
[01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.900]   with the traditional internet, it just
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.540]   enables communications that might not be as outstanding
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:11.020]   as we're used to in our broadband soaked world.
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.980]   But we'll just let you have a connection under hostile
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:13.460]   circumstances.
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:16.180]   Meanwhile, fire chat will feature one laptop per child.
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:19.940]   Fire chat brings back the old AOL rooms,
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:22.540]   because I tell you whatever's going on in here.
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:24.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:25.780]   Can you see that chat?
[01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:26.620]   I don't know if you can.
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:30.020]   I was told that there's very inappropriate things in my phone.
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.220]   So I was going to try to tell you.
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:31.700]   Go ahead, Joe.
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.740]   If there's anything inappropriate, I'll hide it with my hand.
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:36.220]   But this is the fire chat interface.
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.460]   It's just like, hey, guys, how are you?
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:38.340]   Yo, I'm all right.
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:38.700]   You?
[01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:39.220]   Good.
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:40.860]   Vancouver St. Louis and Indianapolis Union
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:41.380]   City.
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:43.420]   There's also nearby, and there's somebody--
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:43.900]   Hello.
[01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:45.220]   I also have Mesh Network.
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:46.700]   Do you have Mesh Network?
[01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:47.200]   Yeah.
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:47.700]   All right.
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:48.540]   I have Mesh Network.
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:48.900]   Yeah.
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:50.620]   Again, proof of concept.
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:51.860]   Yes.
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:54.460]   Anybody who's watching the show wants to join me in fire chat,
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:56.540]   just I don't know how you even--
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:57.620]   I don't know whatever you want.
[01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:58.740]   It'll be right in the feed.
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:01.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.420]   It sounds like it's going to be a problem,
[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:04.500]   but I'm sure everybody's going to be nice and polite.
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.540]   Anybody watching twit.tv?
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:08.220]   Yeah, it was in the Indian Ocean.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.900]   Well, that's another subject.
[01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:10.900]   Don't hurt.
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:13.860]   So there's a bunch of stuff going.
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:16.020]   I don't even understand what the point of this is.
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.660]   It reminds me of one of those old AOL--
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:18.160]   Hey.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:18.900]   Hi, iPhone.
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:19.380]   How are you?
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:20.220]   Good to see you.
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:24.620]   Everybody in our audience is now trying to get on fire chat.
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:25.580]   But so I'm not sure--
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:29.260]   I guess I could then-- if I knew somebody else was on,
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.860]   I could then add them, right?
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:32.740]   You've got to imagine there'll be other applications coming up.
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:35.100]   I'm Leo, if you want to say hi.
[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:35.500]   Huh.
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:36.700]   There'll be things like AirDrop, and there'll
[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:38.540]   be other applications that come up that take advantage
[01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:39.700]   of multi-peering.
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:40.540]   Because that's nice.
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:42.380]   So if you don't have to be on the same Wi-Fi--
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:43.900]   I don't have to be on the same Wi-Fi network as you
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:44.660]   to use AirDrop.
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:46.020]   We can share files just because we're--
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:47.500]   I've done it on airplanes.
[01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:50.100]   NS Hipster had a good article on the multi-peering technology
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:50.820]   just in general.
[01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:52.020]   And it's something that developers--
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:53.780]   that's the nice thing is that it's not just proprietary
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:54.220]   to AirDrop.
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:56.260]   Apple made an API, so any developer
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:57.740]   can use it for their products.
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:20:58.500]   Yeah, everybody's saying it.
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.020]   I was talking to someone on Twitter about this
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:03.260]   when they're suggesting that if Apple wants
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:04.500]   to collect fitness data, it wouldn't
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:06.740]   be a cool idea to have a restaurant when
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:08.700]   they give you your check that there's a way that you can
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:11.940]   actually download the information on nutritional info
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:13.100]   of what you ordered.
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:15.060]   And I had a debate with a couple people
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:16.620]   because everyone was saying, oh, it should be Bluetooth.
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:17.300]   It should be Bluetooth.
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:19.380]   And I said, well, maybe if it's just a QR code,
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:20.620]   then they could take the receipt with them
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:22.140]   and they could actually make it work.
[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:23.860]   Because one of the problems of wireless communication
[01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:26.260]   is that there's always that first step of establishing
[01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:27.900]   the connection and making sure that both of these
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:29.140]   are on the same wavelength.
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.940]   One of the great things about technologies like mesh
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:32.260]   is that it's zero configuration.
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:34.100]   It's just the fact that these two are simply
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:37.140]   in the same-- consuming the same amount of oxygen
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:39.140]   means that they have the ability to talk to each other.
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:43.340]   I'm just having fun chatting with them.
[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:45.660]   Are they saying something rippled?
[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:47.660]   Anything you can share with yourself, Leo.
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:49.660]   But Leo took the selfie on you.
[01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:55.060]   I'm matched to mesh.
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:57.700]   It is dangerous to have this app open while Leo is trying
[01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:58.460]   to host your show.
[01:21:58.460 --> 01:21:59.100]   I'm just saying.
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:02.020]   We're $1.93 or $4 a minute, Leo.
[01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:03.740]   Your promise you show is the goods.
[01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:08.820]   It's really a strange experience to join a chatroom
[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:10.940]   where people are not talking about anything in general.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:11.740]   And it's all just--
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:12.740]   Chat roulette appeared.
[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:13.180]   Yeah.
[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:14.140]   It's like chat roulette.
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:14.460]   Yeah.
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:16.300]   I'm just going to leave it running.
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:19.140]   We won't show it on the air.
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:21.580]   Leo, this will be a good time to have
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:23.700]   that monocle in your eyes so that you can
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.020]   hop up and see something.
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:26.020]   What?
[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:32.700]   As badly as the Apple 5C sold--
[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:34.500]   and I think everybody's saying it sold badly--
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.660]   it beat Blackberry, it beat Windows Phone,
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:39.860]   it beat every Android flagship in the fourth quarter.
[01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:41.460]   And it still was a flop.
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:42.940]   Well, by whose definition--
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:44.900]   I mean, it's by media's definition is a flop.
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:48.740]   Maybe by the amount of iPhone 5s sold, it's not the same.
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:50.580]   But a lot of companies would give their IT's
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:51.740]   to have that sort of flop.
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:52.900]   Yeah, including Samsung.
[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:54.540]   There have been some fairly credible reports
[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:56.220]   that Apple maybe made a lot of these
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:59.180]   and didn't sell them and had more inventory than it expected.
[01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:01.140]   So maybe Apple thought this would be a bigger hit.
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:01.980]   Well, they said that, right?
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:03.140]   But I know people--
[01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:04.180]   I see people buying them.
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:06.180]   I know people in my family and friends
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:10.420]   who bought them instead of the 5S because they don't need the 5S
[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:11.780]   and they want to get the cheaper one.
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:13.860]   My mom reviewed it for my more last week for me.
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:16.220]   My mom is going to get one when she's visiting us
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:17.220]   in a couple months, yeah?
[01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:17.940]   It's a kiss of death.
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:18.940]   Mom's.
[01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:19.940]   I really--
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:21.100]   It's another act?
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:22.620]   I really get tired-- I'm sorry.
[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:23.540]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:25.700]   I was just saying, I really get tired of conversations
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:29.100]   like this because unless you are running Apple,
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:32.140]   what do you care how much the 5C is, how well this--
[01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:33.460]   poorly the 5C is selling?
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:35.420]   So as long as it's making profits for Apple,
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:39.420]   what do you care that it's a quote dog or quote as a failure?
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:42.020]   And even on the other side of it, what do you care
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:45.260]   that it's outselling the Galaxy S5 or whatever other phone?
[01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:46.900]   You should not care about this.
[01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:48.140]   Sorry, I brought it up.
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:50.580]   I'm not saying to you because, again, you are rational.
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:54.220]   You're at least willing to exploit this story for content.
[01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:55.900]   So I'm not going to respect that.
[01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:57.940]   But when people are saying, you know what?
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:00.780]   I've got this to say to all the Apple haters out there,
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:03.620]   you're so-called failure phone is actually
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:06.820]   outselling your precious little window.
[01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:09.660]   If the end of what I care is, I want the HTC One
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:11.540]   to sell enough that they make an HTC Two.
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:14.060]   So because that company doesn't have as much money as Apple.
[01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:16.660]   Apple, if you just find regardless of the sales of this phone.
[01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:19.300]   But I do want them to make more experimental phones.
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:20.860]   So what you're saying is, if you love Apple,
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:23.380]   you should all go out and buy the new HTC One.
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:26.020]   If you love HTC, I'm going to get one because I love HTC.
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:27.060]   I love them since the Trio Pro.
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:28.260]   It's our way of-- it's like Kickstarter.
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:29.820]   We're just supporting them to continue--
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:30.500]   Absolutely.
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:31.580]   Doing their fine work.
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:33.180]   You can have my money.
[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:37.780]   So basically, documentary about Scott Ben, McStapes, and HTC.
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:39.860]   Yeah, that's the same sort of emotional response.
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:41.460]   Same thing, exactly.
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:43.500]   Hey, good news if you use iTunes Radio,
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.820]   and I really think Apple's going to try to promote the fact
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:46.860]   that this thing exists.
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:47.540]   Because you know what?
[01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:48.820]   It's great.
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.180]   But I don't think anybody knows it even exists, right?
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:54.100]   Because it's kind of hidden away in the music app.
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:55.660]   Music app, right?
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:25:00.020]   And you've got Spotify or Google Music,
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:01.980]   or whatever you've already got working.
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:02.340]   You don't--
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:03.900]   It's in Australia only still.
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:05.780]   Well, OK, sorry, Canadian.
[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:06.260]   I know.
[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:06.660]   I would use it.
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:10.100]   But one rumor is that they're going to separate it out
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:12.460]   and make it a standalone app, which I think is a good idea.
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:15.740]   They've added some new channels, including, by the way, NPR now.
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:18.540]   So this isn't music, which I find interesting.
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:22.580]   You can listen to a stream of NPR talk news shows.
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:24.020]   Yeah.
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:27.700]   They've got great playlists under the featured stations.
[01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:30.620]   I'd like to see a Twitter channel on my TV.
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:32.900]   So what do I need to do to get a deal like NPR?
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:34.700]   Oh, now you zoom in, Jack.
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:36.220]   What do I get to do?
[01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:36.860]   What do I got to do to do that?
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:38.460]   The interesting thing is see if they do do that.
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:39.140]   And then, who--
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:41.300]   So their partner deals like Siri and Apple TV,
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:42.740]   or if they open it up a little bit.
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:47.460]   Yeah, let me turn it up and see what they're talking about now on NPR.
[01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:49.780]   It's craft work.
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:51.220]   Of course.
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:53.620]   Of course it is.
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:55.460]   The system is down.
[01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:57.260]   The system is down.
[01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:57.900]   The system is--
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:59.780]   Welcome to the end of our podcast day.
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.780]   Yeah, because the last thing I heard was talk.
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:03.540]   So I don't know what-- this is part of the problem.
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:05.540]   You can't tell what you're listening to.
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:06.580]   Station break.
[01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:08.580]   Yeah, station break or something.
[01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:09.900]   But anyway--
[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:14.460]   That would actually be great if they started using some of these features
[01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:16.220]   for podcasts and things like that.
[01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:16.740]   Wonderful.
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:17.420]   Shuffle through those.
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:19.180]   Yeah, Apple.
[01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:21.220]   I take back everything I said.
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:22.580]   Put me on your radio.
[01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:24.580]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:25.580]   We'll come back.
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:27.580]   You pick, ladies and gentlemen, get it together.
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:28.580]   Yeah.
[01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:30.580]   Give me something.
[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:31.580]   Something you can use in Canada.
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:32.580]   Yes.
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:33.580]   OK.
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:34.580]   And Petaluma.
[01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:35.580]   And Petaluma.
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:36.580]   But first a word from audible.com.
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:40.580]   Audible is our wonderful, wonderful source of audiobooks.
[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:47.580]   More than 150,000 strong of all kinds read by some of the best readers these books.
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:49.580]   Take life in your mind.
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:54.060]   And whether you're in the car or at the gym, whether you're walking the dog or doing the
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:59.980]   dishes, audible is just a fabulous way to read.
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:02.300]   And it's pretty much the only way I do books these days.
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:07.740]   I know Andy and Jason are big audible fans, so I won't steal their thunder.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:09.580]   What do you listen to, Jason, these days?
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:12.140]   I just finished a book that's excellent.
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:16.060]   It's actually nominated for the Nebula Award, which is from the Sci-Fi Writers Association.
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:17.060]   It's from a local author.
[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:18.380]   She's in Berkeley.
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:20.980]   And it's called Helene Wecker, I believe it's pronounced.
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.780]   The Golem and the Genie.
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:23.780]   And it's really good.
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:25.900]   It's set in like late 19th century New York City.
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:27.420]   And it's about immigrants.
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:32.460]   And among the immigrants is a genie who's trapped in human form and a Golem that has
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:38.060]   been made by a kind of renegade rabbi as a wife for a guy who dies during his passage
[01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:39.140]   to North America.
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:44.500]   And so she's trying to make her way in the Jewish society of New York.
[01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:47.860]   And the genie is trying to do it in the Middle Eastern society.
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:49.340]   And then they, of course, they meet.
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:50.780]   And there are interesting things that happen.
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:51.780]   And it's a lot of fun.
[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:52.780]   It's like an Isaac Machevish.
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:57.660]   It's a famous singer story that went wrong, but horribly, horribly wrong.
[01:27:57.660 --> 01:27:58.660]   It's funny.
[01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:02.300]   It's got a little feel like maybe even like Cavalier and Clay or something like that.
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:03.300]   Oh, I loved that.
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:04.300]   That was a great one.
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:05.300]   Yeah, it's really good.
[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:06.300]   I liked it a lot.
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:07.780]   And George Guidol narrates it.
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:09.500]   I just love his voice.
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:10.500]   He's a great narrator.
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:12.620]   Let me play a little bit of the audio from this.
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:13.860]   This is the Golem and the Genie.
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:16.860]   Knocked on the door and waited.
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:17.860]   He's a great.
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:20.700]   After some minutes he heard a shuffling step.
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:26.820]   The door opened, a hands with revealing a man of perhaps 70.
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:29.100]   He was bald, save for a fringe.
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:31.980]   You see you listen to these and you just kind of go, "Wow, I just can't wait to hear
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:33.300]   more of this.
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:36.140]   This is a drive around the book, a drive around the block book."
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:37.140]   Yeah.
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:38.460]   "Gollum and the Genie."
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.180]   Okay, there's a pick for you.
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:41.580]   We're going to get one of these for you for free.
[01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:43.460]   I like to give you some choices, though.
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:45.820]   Andy, you're not going to go, "What are you listening to?"
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:49.420]   Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, but a really, really special set of recordings.
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:55.420]   This is the radio drama that was starring Sir John Gielgood as Sherlock Holmes and his
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:29:01.300]   long, long time acting partner Sir Ralph Richardson as Watson with some cameo appearances by
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:03.300]   Orson Welles and the rest.
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:07.580]   And oh boy, I have bought a couple of different versions of Sherlock Holmes stories like in
[01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:09.780]   my day of my using of Audible.
[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:13.940]   But as soon as I clicked on, I heard about this and I clicked on it, "You heard Sir John
[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:14.940]   Gielgood?"
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:15.940]   I love him.
[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:17.940]   Speak like this and say, "Well, it was very simple.
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:18.940]   I don't know."
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:20.740]   Like, "Oh, goodness, I want to listen to that.
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:23.100]   I want that on my every device I own that can play.
[01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:24.300]   I even want them on devices.
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:28.340]   I can't play audio just so that I've got that touch of class in my wallet at all times."
[01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:30.220]   Sixteen episodes, seven and a half hours.
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:31.700]   Let me play a little bit of this.
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:35.620]   Millivander has managed to get hold of some important letters, Watson, which she wrote
[01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:39.740]   some time ago to a penniless young fellow in the country, only imprudent, mind you, but
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:42.660]   they'd be quite sufficient to break off the match.
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:44.420]   And your commission to meet him.
[01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:46.460]   Yes, and make what terms I can.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:47.460]   Here comes Mr. Sudson.
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:48.460]   He's here, Watson.
[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:49.460]   Will you let him in?
[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:50.460]   These are great.
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:51.460]   So these are radio plays.
[01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:54.380]   Mr. Holmes, will you come in, please?
[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:59.500]   I've graduated with this and then I will start talking like that from now on.
[01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:02.620]   Oh, wow, that's great.
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:08.980]   These are from the mid-50s with Sir John Gilgud, Sir Ralph Richardson.
[01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:13.660]   And yes, a little Orson Welles as the evil Moriarty.
[01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:14.900]   Perfect casting.
[01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:16.780]   I knew Moriarty was an American.
[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:17.780]   Damn it.
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:18.780]   All right.
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:19.780]   So how do you get this for free?
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:20.780]   Here's how.
[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:21.780]   You go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:24.740]   You'll be signing up for the gold account.
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:28.980]   And that means you get a book a month plus the daily digest of either the New York Times
[01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:31.260]   of the Wall Street Journal, but your first month's free.
[01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:33.380]   So you can't sign time in that first 30 days.
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:37.380]   You won't pay a penny, but you will keep your book, whatever book you choose.
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:41.220]   And I think you just want to keep doing it because every time you get a new Audible
[01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:43.540]   book and I start listening, I just love it.
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:44.540]   I'm such a fan.
[01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:48.340]   And yeah, they have these old radio shows too, which is great, including the original
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:53.020]   radio plays of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which are a must for everybody's
[01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:54.020]   collection.
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:59.020]   Get it free, audible.com/macbreak.
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:01.660]   All right, Renee, your pick of the week, sir.
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:05.180]   My pick of the week is it is not a new app, but it is a new version of an app.
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:06.460]   There's an app called Transit.
[01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:14.860]   Now Apple famously with iOS 6 dropped transit directions, bus directions, train directions,
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:17.060]   metro directions or subways, depending on where you live.
[01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:19.700]   So Transit app has been trying to fill that void.
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:21.180]   Full disclosure, it's a Montreal company.
[01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:24.620]   So I'm affectionate from them to begin with.
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:25.620]   Small Shop.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:27.820]   And what they've just released is their iOS 7 update.
[01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:31.900]   So they made a lot of waves in the beginning because they had almost Windows Phone Metro
[01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:33.620]   like look for their app.
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:36.260]   It was very elegant, very well done.
[01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:41.700]   Now it's still not exactly the way iOS 7 is, but it's got a lot more iOS 7 feel to it.
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:45.300]   They've been adding more places all the time and originally launched, I think, with two
[01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:47.300]   or three cities, but they're adding it.
[01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:48.300]   62 cities now.
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:49.300]   Yeah.
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:50.700]   And it's an arduous process.
[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:52.660]   Anyone's wondering why Apple didn't do it the first year.
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:58.060]   You have to go to municipal authorities or data companies and one by one get the rights
[01:31:58.060 --> 01:31:59.220]   to use their data.
[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:00.540]   Well, there's a standard.
[01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:01.940]   There's an open data standard.
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:03.780]   And this is the thing that kind of irks me.
[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:07.820]   A lot of municipalities have decided that this should be a profit center for them.
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:12.900]   So they've released their own apps or they don't support open data.
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:14.420]   And that's very frustrating.
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:17.500]   I think it's frustrating to Apple and to Google both who would like to include this transit
[01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:18.500]   information.
[01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:19.500]   Absolutely.
[01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.220]   But this is a phenomenal looking app.
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:22.220]   It works great.
[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:25.820]   All the time where I am, it supports, like you said, 67, I think, cities right now.
[01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:27.300]   A lot of Canadian cities, too.
[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:28.300]   Yeah.
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:29.300]   A lot of American cities.
[01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:32.060]   And it's just it's not only a great way to get around, but it's a beautiful and great
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:33.060]   way to get around.
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:34.860]   That's nice.
[01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:35.860]   Really good.
[01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:41.900]   It's thetransitapp.com and it is an Android version if you're forced to use an HTC One.
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:43.860]   How about Jason Snell?
[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:44.860]   What do you got for us?
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:50.020]   I have an app that I full disclosure was written by a guy I have known since college.
[01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:51.220]   It's called Romantic.
[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:53.620]   It's an iOS app.
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:54.620]   It's $2.
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:56.620]   It's by Greg Noss.
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:33:01.940]   Romantic got a lot of press coverage, a lot of really blistering negative press coverage
[01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:05.820]   by people who like to judge other people, which is people on the internet.
[01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:07.820]   Here's the great thing about Romantic.
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:11.660]   Romantic is not a fake out for people who don't love their partner.
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:16.620]   Romantic is a reminder app that reminds you gently that you might want to send a nice
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:21.180]   little message via text to your significant other telling them that.
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:22.180]   You love them.
[01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:24.380]   Now, it doesn't send it for you on a timer.
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:26.340]   It just reminds you that you need to send it.
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:29.420]   It does provide some suggestions of things you could say.
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:31.140]   You can set your own messages.
[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:32.140]   It's a good idea.
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:36.420]   You can use one of the pre-stocked messages, which includes, I believe, and I love you
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:38.140]   in Klingon, in Elvish.
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:39.140]   It's war.
[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:40.140]   It's war.
[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:42.980]   And there's some other obscure made up language that it's got it.
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:45.500]   It's got emojis and then you can also set up your own.
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:48.820]   It'll even tell you how often you've sent various messages so you can vary it.
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:54.660]   But it is a way, I think, at its base, it is a tool for people with iPhones who maybe
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:34:00.100]   don't take the time they should for their partner to have their iPhone say, "Hey, you
[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:03.460]   should stop for a minute and take the time to say something nice to your partner."
[01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:04.460]   How did it do a meeting?
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:05.460]   I think it was a good sense.
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:06.460]   I got it.
[01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:07.460]   It's cute.
[01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:08.460]   Yeah.
[01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:09.460]   Don't tell your partner that.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:10.460]   Oh, she knows.
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:11.460]   I have to sometimes say, "This isn't Greg's app.
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:12.460]   This is me."
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:13.460]   Really, that's the drawback.
[01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:14.460]   Yeah.
[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:16.860]   I actually have a Python script that does that.
[01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:22.700]   One of the prefab messages, "This is totally an original message."
[01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:26.300]   But it's $2 and some people think it is.
[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:28.980]   Some people really get up in their high horse and they say, "Oh, well, if you need to be
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:32.580]   reminded to tell your significant other that you love them, then there's something terribly
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:34.220]   wrong with you and I'm judging you."
[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:35.420]   Okay, whatever.
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:40.380]   I think sometimes we get our heads down and we're working on stuff and time passes.
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:43.540]   And so that phone just reminding you, "Hey, take a moment."
[01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:44.540]   I think it's nice.
[01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:45.540]   It's easy.
[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:46.540]   It makes it easy to choose a sweetheart.
[01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:47.540]   Easy to change your sweetheart.
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:51.340]   And it's -- should you choose too, I suppose?
[01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:55.060]   And it's got a very nice set of the presets are really fun.
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:56.060]   Can I write my own?
[01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:57.060]   It's got a sense of humor.
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:59.180]   You can write your own and you can do that.
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:01.180]   And it's, like I said, it's lighthearted.
[01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:03.500]   It doesn't take itself too seriously.
[01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:04.500]   I like it.
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:05.500]   $2.
[01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:11.820]   Romantimatic by Extrooon LLC for iOS.
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:13.660]   Andy and I coat your pick of the week.
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:16.740]   Well, we're talking about Apple making deals with cable companies.
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:22.140]   So I thought I'd plug two things, my favorite cable channel, Turner Classic Movies, and also
[01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:27.980]   the Watch TCM app, which to my eye is exactly how you should do like a mobile viewing app
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:31.500]   for a cable channel because look at everything.
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:34.500]   It's really well designed for one thing, but look at the features that it gives you.
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:40.260]   You get the East Coast feed, so whatever is actually being broadcast on TCM right now,
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:41.460]   you can watch it live.
[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:45.300]   So if you're watching it, like in your bedroom cable box and then you start walking through
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:49.460]   the house, it will be whatever scene you left at is going to be where you'll pick off from
[01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:51.460]   right here because you're getting the live stream.
[01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:54.140]   You get the East Coast feed and the West Coast feed.
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:58.220]   So if you missed, if you got, if I came in like halfway through a movie, I can catch
[01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:04.460]   the rest of it later on in the day, but also not all, but most or many of the movies that
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:07.820]   they're currently playing are also available on demand.
[01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:14.860]   I was disappointed that I could not see Zardaw's on demand, but Sean Connery is Zardaw's.
[01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:15.860]   Oh my God.
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:16.860]   That was not.
[01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:17.860]   He's not Zardaw's.
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:18.860]   Okay.
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:20.700]   I don't want to spoil Zardaw's right.
[01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:21.700]   He's not.
[01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:23.540]   Damn it.
[01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:27.860]   But yeah, but this is this is exactly how you should do it.
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:32.060]   And I wish that every single channel did it this way instead of saying, Oh, and I'm sorry,
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:36.260]   but that episode or that movie you wanted to see is not been unlocked yet.
[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:39.180]   You can see the episode from season two, five years ago.
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:43.340]   So I interrupted three times with commercials that you can't fast forward through.
[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:47.180]   It's no, if you buy it, the philosophy seems to be that if you subscribe to turn classic
[01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:50.820]   movies and you should because it is the most awesome channel on the entire cable dial,
[01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:53.820]   they'll say, Nope, if you want to watch it, whatever you will, please, thank you for your
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:54.820]   money.
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:56.740]   Please, please continue to give us money for our channel here.
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:37:00.100]   Have a nice, real cool, free app.
[01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:01.100]   Thank you.
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:05.020]   Kevin, I mean, Kevin Marks gave us an eel earworm on this week in Google last week that
[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:08.580]   I want to spread now to every other person who hasn't seen that show.
[01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:10.580]   It is called 2048.
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:11.580]   Have you played it?
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:12.580]   You showed us threes.
[01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:13.580]   I've seen it.
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:14.580]   Yeah.
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:15.580]   This is like twos with like threes with twos.
[01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:16.580]   I had to delete threes.
[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:17.580]   It was ruining my life.
[01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:18.580]   I couldn't sleep.
[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:19.780]   I couldn't do anything.
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:21.300]   This is web based.
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:23.660]   You're trying to make you same thing.
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:25.140]   You're matching up numbers.
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:26.900]   It's subtly different.
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:28.580]   And I'm not sure how it is.
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:30.100]   There are a lot of implementations.
[01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:31.100]   This was the definitive.
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:32.740]   You just Google 2048.
[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:33.740]   You'll find the web implementation.
[01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:36.020]   What you need to do is play the Doctor Who edition.
[01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:37.020]   There are infinite.
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:38.620]   You have a Doctor Who twos?
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:39.620]   Yes.
[01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:43.660]   It starts with the first Doctor makes the second and you can go all the way up.
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:45.060]   What's the URL for that?
[01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:46.060]   It's in the chat.
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:47.060]   I just put it in the chat room.
[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:48.060]   Okay.
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:49.060]   That's awesome.
[01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:51.100]   It's us versus them.com.
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:54.260]   2048 using Doctor Who.
[01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:55.260]   So those two match.
[01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:58.140]   Can you show that chat just so people get what we're talking about?
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:37:59.140]   Those match.
[01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:00.140]   Obviously those don't.
[01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:01.140]   But there's one that one matches.
[01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:02.140]   The next one makes the third Doctor.
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:03.140]   Ooh.
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:04.140]   Okay.
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:05.140]   Here we go.
[01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:06.140]   Here we go.
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:07.140]   Yeah, baby.
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:08.140]   Yeah, baby.
[01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:09.140]   Come on, baby.
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:10.140]   Uh oh.
[01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:11.140]   The guy with scarf now.
[01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:12.140]   Uh oh.
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:13.140]   Got the guy with scarf.
[01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:14.140]   But how am I going to get?
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:15.300]   Oh, there we go.
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:16.300]   I got Mo.
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:17.820]   Now how do I get Shemp?
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:18.820]   Okay.
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:19.820]   That's good.
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:20.820]   That's good.
[01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:21.820]   This is fun.
[01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:22.820]   You're destroying Holy years of conduit.
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:23.820]   Oh, there you go.
[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:24.820]   You got Peter Davidson now.
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:25.820]   Look at you.
[01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:26.820]   Look at you.
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:28.820]   Oh, isn't that cute.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:30.380]   Oh, look at that.
[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:32.060]   Oh, this is fun.
[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:33.820]   I don't even watch Doctor Who.
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:36.860]   You don't, the point of these games is you don't really need to know what you're doing.
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:38.660]   You just keep pressing buttons till something happens.
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:39.660]   Uh oh.
[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:43.100]   All you need is something better you're supposed to be doing instead of this.
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:44.100]   That's exactly.
[01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:47.020]   All you need is a column and you're on deadline.
[01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:49.820]   And this will seem like the best game you ever played.
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:50.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:51.820]   What's the white thing?
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:52.820]   What's oh, there we go.
[01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:53.820]   See that looks just like drama.
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:55.620]   It's a big color.
[01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:56.620]   Ooh.
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:57.620]   Okay.
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:01.380]   Well, you're watching Leo plays games on the internet.
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:05.460]   My only disapproval is that there's only one game I'm interested in called 2048 and
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:06.780]   it's Robo-Touran 2048.
[01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:08.940]   That's a different one.
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:09.940]   Yeah.
[01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:10.940]   Another good one though.
[01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:11.940]   All right.
[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:17.220]   Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this portion of Leo plays games on the internet.
[01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:19.940]   Coming up, Leo buys a Tivo on the internet.
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:22.540]   A very special edition.
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:25.660]   I want to thank everybody for being here and especially our two in studio.
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:26.980]   Guess it's so nice to have you in Renee.
[01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:27.980]   We see a lot of you.
[01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:28.980]   I'm trying.
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:31.340]   It's a great effect that you're like all the way diagonally over there.
[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:32.340]   I'm trying.
[01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:33.340]   Get some nice weather once in a while.
[01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:34.340]   Love having this.
[01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:35.340]   Love having you.
[01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:39.260]   In Renee Richie is at imore.com which is really the definitive place to figure out
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:40.700]   what's going on in the Apple world.
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:41.700]   Thank you for doing that.
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:43.340]   Mobile Nations also.
[01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:44.340]   Crackberry, etc.
[01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:45.340]   Etcetera, etcetera.
[01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:46.980]   Can I get a quick plug in for a show?
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:47.980]   Yeah.
[01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:49.220]   We've been recording debug lately.
[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:50.380]   We've done an interesting arc.
[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:56.820]   We had the guy on who did the NT port to deck and then we had .net and then we had Miguel
[01:39:56.820 --> 01:39:58.820]   the Akaza for mono.
[01:39:58.820 --> 01:39:59.980]   Oh, I love.
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:03.780]   From that we went to Syracuse arguing about mono versus Objective-C.
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:04.780]   Wow.
[01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:07.780]   And then we've just recorded, which won't be out for a couple of weeks, but Ken Ferry
[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:12.940]   who did auto layout and passbook at Apple and now has his own app coming out.
[01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:14.820]   You really have good people on.
[01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:15.820]   Where can I find debug?
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:16.820]   It's imore.com/debug.
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:17.820]   Okay.
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:18.820]   I went to imore.com/podcasts.
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:19.820]   It was fabulous.
[01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:21.580]   You guys have too many shows.
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:22.580]   imore.com/debug.
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:26.020]   Renee has more podcasts than I do.
[01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:27.540]   And I have a lot of podcasts.
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:28.820]   You too?
[01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:30.820]   This podcasting thing might take off.
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:33.860]   I have to listen to yours and Leo's and what do you do?
[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:34.860]   What do you do, Jason Snow?
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:37.140]   I know you have The Incompraable, which is fabulous.
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:38.140]   That's right.
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:39.140]   So there's The Incompraable.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:40.380]   You go to The Incompraable.com.
[01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:44.000]   We have a new spinoff called Total Party Kill where we play Dungeons and Dragons on the
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.660]   Internet for your amusement.
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:46.660]   Fascinating.
[01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:48.020]   Incompadently, I might add.
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:49.020]   Even better.
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:51.860]   And that seems to be a thing.
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:56.540]   And then we were doing clockwise on TechHive, which is me and Dan Warren and a couple of
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:40:57.540]   guests every week.
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:58.540]   Wow.
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:40:59.540]   You're a busy, busy boy.
[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:00.540]   Yeah.
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:03.180]   And of course, he's also editorial director at IDG, which apparently requires no oversight
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:04.180]   whatsoever.
[01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:07.180]   Macworld.com might be a good spot to go to.
[01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:08.180]   He runs itself.
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:09.180]   He runs itself.
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:10.180]   So you can do podcasts.
[01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:11.180]   Sure.
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:12.180]   Good man.
[01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:13.180]   I like that.
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:15.220]   Andy Inaco has a five, also a five by five podcast.
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:19.220]   Inaco's Almanac and is a regular here on Mac and Break Weekly.
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:21.420]   And episode 100 coming up in a couple of weeks.
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:22.420]   So we're preparing for that.
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:23.420]   Awesome.
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:27.220]   If you want to check out my blog has been rather fallow for a few months as I've been
[01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:30.460]   trying to figure out how to create WordPress themes that don't stink.
[01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:32.500]   I decided to throw some money at the problem.
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:36.580]   So now there's a new theme and now I'm actually blogging a little more often there too.
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:37.580]   That's inaco.com.
[01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:42.380]   Inaco.com, the rite of passage is that you have to know how to spell my last name correctly.
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:44.380]   I have no idea.
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:45.580]   That's a no idea.
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:47.080]   That's your show.
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:54.160]   And those of you who hated me last year for switching to Android and for the three part
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:57.020]   that I wrote for Tech High about the reasons why there's going to be a follow up coming
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:42:03.020]   in and green blog very, very soon that will help you renew my hate, your hate for me.
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:05.460]   So what I'm saying is bring it on.
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:08.140]   Whatever it is that you've been kicking.
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:11.100]   It's now shriveled like a like a like a like a like a like big.
[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:12.100]   So you can't hurt me there anymore.
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:15.820]   So I have the strength again to tell you how it's going a year on.
[01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:18.280]   And hopefully be doing some more stuff for that later on.
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:21.680]   I've been doing I've been doing I've been on like a semi sabbatical for a few months that
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:22.680]   has now ended.
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:26.520]   So it's like now I've got oh how much how many of these 18 things I want to do this week
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:27.520]   I'm not going to get to.
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:32.460]   So actually what's nice is if I think I'm going to start referring people to inaco.com
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:35.600]   I H N A T K O dot com because it's all there.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:36.600]   You're writing your podcast.
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:37.600]   You're speaking.
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:40.840]   And fixing up as I go along it was really embarrassing.
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:46.940]   It's just that I was not I'm the guy who wrote his own blogging software in the mid 90s because
[01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:48.260]   none existed.
[01:42:48.260 --> 01:42:50.740]   And so I kept thinking that I can it's PHP.
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:53.420]   I can learn PHP and I can learn CSS.
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:57.580]   But there are people who are doing nothing but writing great blog software with that stuff.
[01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:02.020]   And like I can't I'm I think at this my my heart is in the right place and I'm learning
[01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:04.180]   the right stuff but I'm just not as good at it.
[01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:07.660]   And you're telling me that for $40 I can just buy something that good.
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:08.660]   Okay.
[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:09.660]   Here's $40.
[01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:11.140]   I'm an old person.
[01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:14.240]   I don't I don't have the time interest or energy anymore.
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:17.040]   I just I know I know.
