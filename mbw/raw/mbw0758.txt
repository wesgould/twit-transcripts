[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.640]   Why rumor, Manger John, Prosser shaved his eyebrows.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.960]   Today I'll give you him.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.080]   It had to do with the Apple event that didn't happen in tell versus the M1.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.040]   Who's the winner and Tim Apple's pop quiz.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.320]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.760]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.680]   And you know, we thought there might be some snooze from Apple.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.440]   The only news today is that John Prosser no longer has eyebrows, Renee Richie.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.800]   This is true.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   This is accurate. He did it.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.240]   Crazy, so be did it.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.160]   There's some education news today. There's not like we didn't get anything.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.840]   Maybe that was what the 23rd was.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.600]   It was a day that Apple announces updates to schoolwork in classroom.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.360]   Boy, wow, I'm glad I didn't miss that.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.040]   Wow.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.440]   I think the 23rd was going to be the date that they fire all of the people inside
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.280]   of Apple that leaked out that 23rd was going to be a big press event day.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.040]   Actually, and you I think Alex, by the way, Renee Richie, Andy and I go Alex.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.400]   I got you know, trio.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.080]   We got straight into there.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.640]   We were like, yeah, I launched into it.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.120]   But Alex, you are the one who said that in fact, I think you said it last week or
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.080]   the week before that Apple was known to float incorrect stories to see you
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.080]   was leaking.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.360]   I think I just mentioned it happened.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.560]   It did happen once.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.840]   Well, it's the early is happened again.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.720]   Yeah, I don't I don't know anything about the newer ones, but it definitely has
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.440]   happened in the past.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.400]   So Prosser, among others, said there would be an event today.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.760]   Not yet that last week, but today.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.920]   So they were half right.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.680]   Prosser said foolishly in his tweet, I will shave off my eyebrows.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.560]   If you do it, yeah, look.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.440]   Oh, there it is.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.840]   That's improvement.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.680]   See, too few men realize that grooming does not stop at the mustache.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.240]   You need to trim those those those and you really sell.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.720]   He actually does not look bad because he has a, you know, beatling brow, as they say.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.040]   But I think a lack of eyebrows can make you look like an alien, frankly.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.960]   It's just something a little a little weird.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.560]   He looks like I have to say you used our sponsor, Manscapes.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.680]   I brought trimmer, so that's good.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.400]   Maybe this is all a setup, but just a big add or big for Manscape.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.600]   Yeah, like the story though was apparently
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.560]   that Apple floated this story to catch leakers.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.720]   That's not what I heard.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.160]   OK.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.080]   So I also mark German said nope.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.640]   So I think like if Mark and I both heard the same thing, that's two different universes.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.680]   Like my understanding is like this was like maybe late last year, I mean, this was an
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.680]   early date they floated just for like preliminary planning purposes and somebody
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.600]   probably heard that and passed it on.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.120]   But there this year, at least, like in terms of actual solid events, there was
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.880]   nothing ever planned for this week, which is why so many people found it so amusing.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.480]   Well, certainly it was good for John Prosser.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.360]   You know a lot of legs on that.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.440]   Love to dream.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.840]   Twitter, I was just talking about the 23rd in general.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.600]   Like it's a good day.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.800]   Maybe give yourself a good meal.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.840]   I didn't mean anything else.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.160]   OK, so is it safe to say no Apple event March?
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.320]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.560]   They got they could do it in the 30th.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.480]   It would be difficult.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.240]   It's April.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.200]   I think it would be unlike as far as everyone knows, it's April.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.080]   It's April now.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.480]   Same slate of products in April.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.320]   Yeah, iPad Pro, maybe an Apple TV and air tags.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.200]   We are seeing iPad Pro kind of weird little leaks, a pad and quill apparently
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.840]   accidentally tipped a new iPad Pro with a case.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.600]   You know, they're little little tidbits here and they're coming out.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.160]   So I guess I mean, we knew they needed to do it.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.880]   Right? It's been a year.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.920]   They sometimes update them like they usually update them once every 18 months.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.560]   But last year's update was so I want to call it significant because they did add
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.160]   a wide R and they didn't prove the camera.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.400]   They got it a second camera.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.160]   So it wasn't like a spec bump.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.320]   It was a little bit more than that, but it wasn't a giant update and they were so
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.480]   far behind on the processor.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.680]   It was still an A12 that it really is due.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.520]   That will be the upgrade is to the 14 X.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.720]   With mini LED, I can't wait, which is essentially an M1 you said last week.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.000]   Yeah, it's going to depend on implementation because the A what would be an A14 X is
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.400]   actually what an M1 is.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.640]   An M1 is basically an A14 X with some virtualization and emulation
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.480]   acceleration and two Thunderbolt controllers on the board and too and much more
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.680]   ram than an iPad.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.920]   Usually as eight or 16.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.800]   So instead of a type of apple finds it cheaper to to fab more of those or make
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.960]   a unique process instead of a USB type C, it will be a Thunderbolt port.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.320]   It could be.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.000]   I hope it is.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.320]   I really hope it is.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.920]   This is something to be holding back at this point.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.400]   Are you talking about USB C as a connector or USB as as an interchange device as
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.400]   well as a type C.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.680]   It's a type C.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.800]   So type C.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.720]   If you have a number of three
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.520]   speeds that would be significant.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.200]   Yeah, well, also if it if it identified itself to other devices on the bus as a
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.520]   Thunderbolt device, it's I mean, I I've always I think we talked about this last
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.360]   time the name was on where I'm trying to I was trying to figure out what would
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.360]   what kind of thing could you plug into an iPad that would really take advantage
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.680]   of Thunderbolt, the only things that would be really, really significant would be
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.440]   the ability to simply plug in any sort of a video controller to it and it would
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.560]   simply work.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.840]   But Apple being Apple, I'm not going to necessarily take it on faith that Apple
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.480]   won't say, oh, yes, it's tech.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.000]   It's a Thunderbolt display, but we're going to use a special protocol so that doesn't
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.200]   interfere with whatever we're doing on the iPad.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.440]   So USB 3.2, which I presume is what's on there, is 10 gigabits.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.760]   The second generation is two channel for 20 gigabits.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.960]   Thunderbolt would be double that.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.280]   Well, USB 4 incorporates Thunderbolt.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.280]   So what they have on the Mac now is USB 4 and that includes that basically builds
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.440]   in Thunderbolt 3 into the specs.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.440]   So you can handle both.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.280]   And for me, it's been storage because all the storage I use is high speed.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.560]   It's like the Samsung X2 or X5 over there.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.320]   Yeah, I have an upgrading to Thunderbolt 3 storage, which is very expensive.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.400]   So much faster and they don't work on the iPad, which is frustrating.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.400]   But at the same time, the iPad doesn't have the same relationship with external
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.640]   storage that Windows or anything else does.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.200]   So it's more like shuttling files one place to another.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.800]   So somebody in the chat said, hey, just does that mean I can copy a file now?
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.280]   That's just an interesting video.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.560]   Like they make a big deal about being able to edit 4k, but it takes forever to get
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.840]   4k onto the thing because it's like the old USB speeds.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.880]   Is there a reason why they wouldn't just put an M1 chip into the
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.600]   into the end of the iPad?
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.320]   Just just it doesn't use all the silicon.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.000]   It doesn't use all the IP on the M1.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.880]   They could and just turn it off like the iPhone and the iPad air use the same chip
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.120]   and they just hit it differently.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.440]   So I think it really just depends on what's cheaper for them to fabricate a chip
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.560]   that doesn't include those things or a chip that does and they just turn it off.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.800]   But you would want to turn it off for battery life, right?
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   You don't want it to be wasting time powering something that doesn't use.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.800]   They're really efficient with their gating and it is such small things.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.120]   But literally virtualization and emulation and tooth.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.280]   I would love to fund.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.120]   I would love two ports on an iPad, but I'm not not going to expect.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.760]   Two ports.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.160]   Come on.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.880]   Now you're going crazy.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.960]   What are we going to do with all our dongles?
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.280]   So this is German's.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.080]   Five great new ones, which is which is all they want.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.200]   They all just always throw a lot of dongles by new dongles.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.400]   Yes, a week ago, this was we should have probably I should have paid more
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.040]   attention on Wednesday of last week Bloomberg.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.960]   Mark Gurman says Apple plans to announce new iPads as early as April.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.400]   Adding to the product line.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.680]   It's everything that you've said.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:21.080]   M1 chip style, you know, a 14 X, perhaps mini LED, which would be brighter
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.080]   and better contrast ratios because it's better local dimming.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.880]   Is that right?
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.440]   Yes.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.640]   OK.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.360]   In testing, Gurman says the new iPad Pros have used a thunderbolt connector.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.200]   The same port on the latest Max with custom Apple processors.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.280]   In other words, not really its USB four.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.320]   Yes, yes, but it's thunderbolt three.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.000]   But it includes a thunderbolt standard.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.280]   Yeah, the port does not require a new
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.360]   channel chargers according to Gurman again, all rumor.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.440]   Gurman's well connected, but it would enable connectivity with additional
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.760]   external monitors.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.280]   That's something we didn't mention.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:00.240]   Yeah, of course, thunderbolt hard drives and USB four hard drives and other peripherals.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.880]   Faster at sinking data than the current USB C technology in Apple.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.640]   Spokeswoman declined to comment.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.520]   But Gurman is pointing out that this is was a great year, as we have mentioned before,
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:18.120]   for the iPad, perhaps because of work from home and school from home that the iPad
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.320]   sales jumped.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.520]   Yeah, huge jump.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.880]   And it's an it would be an exciting move towards their messaging that, hey,
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.880]   think of the iPad as like a Kindle or as a $100 Amazon fire tablet.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.880]   This really is a computer that you could you should consider if you are on the same
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.400]   budget as what you would be considering to spend on a mid range or even low end
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.360]   Windows machine.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:47.720]   I mean, I had my sister asked for my advice of, hey, I've got 800 bucks to spend on
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.040]   on a laptop for for my daughter.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.880]   And I was I knew I by now as as the geek
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.080]   in the family, everybody will probably commiserate with us that you know that, OK,
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.480]   I have 10 ideas in my mind.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.080]   Oh, that's right.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.080]   They don't want 10 ideas.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.600]   So I found them like a really nice $800 laptop that runs Windows because that's
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.560]   what they're used to.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.440]   And that's what they're hoping for.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.160]   But this was this is one of the first times I was able to say, well, look, if you
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:18.360]   really want something that's laptop like do at least consider a low end iPad pro
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   because now that there's mouse support and now that there seems to be a real
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.200]   trajectory towards filling in a lot of the gaps that the iPad has traditionally had,
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.960]   it really is a credible choice for someone who has just basic needs for a laptop.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.960]   So, yeah, but go Andy, it's $9.99 for the 12 unless you say it may be say,
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.160]   it get an 11 inch, but see, I'm having a laptop's really small again.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.280]   Yeah, then you stop a bit of a keyboard.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.840]   Don't forget, but but you don't have to get the $300 like magic keyboard.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.160]   You can get a very, very good 40 or $50 keyboard, a very good $20 or $30
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.560]   and all these things are very, very good things to bring up.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.680]   And I brought that up myself.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.800]   That's the reason why I'm like, oh, you're a fool to think about laptops.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.000]   That's still one of the biggest problems when Apple tries to make this case that by
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.840]   the time you add by the time you buy everything you would need to buy to make
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:16.000]   it really competitive with a basic $800 laptop, you are really talking about $1,200
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.160]   mid range, exactly.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.320]   So that's the way that bugs me that Apple, I mean, I guess it has
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.880]   it doesn't because I'm the one among others who says, oh, yeah, you should at
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.120]   least make one thing that prices no object.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.640]   And that's the I mean, if you're talking about iPads, that's the iPad Pro 12.9.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.160]   But the iPad the iPad Air is credible as well.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.960]   Yeah, I've suggested the iPad Air to a number of people now.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.880]   Well, and depending on someone's technical
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.200]   background, a lot of times I'll say, well, and like, tell me what you're going to do
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:46.920]   with it.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.600]   Well, I always say, and they're going to serve and they're going to do a bunch of
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.800]   things I'm always asked. You might want to think about an iPad just because it just
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.480]   there's not you're not going to have issues with the same level of virus attacks and
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.480]   absolutely.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.680]   And especially with a family member, I know that whatever I recommend, I'm going to
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.680]   support.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.920]   So my my interest in in PCs is pretty low.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.560]   I used to say actually do it by a Windows machine.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.800]   I help in you.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.600]   Well, I I laid the line out with my family knows that if they if they ask me any
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.880]   PC questions, I'm going to just say, I don't know.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.800]   Don't know. It's it's so it's so very telling that every time you see what
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:28.000]   what has happened to the PC laptop market, all of the cannibalism has been from
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.800]   iPads and from Chromebooks because it turns out that people don't necessarily
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.400]   need a full bore operating system desktop operating system.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.960]   They either need something that is very, very advanced and sophisticated like
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.880]   iPad or they need a screen and they need a trackpad and they need a keyboard all
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.040]   together with a battery, which the Chromebook will do for them almost just
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.640]   for many people just as well.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:56.080]   And as I had the price for or even less and without any of the maintenance
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.800]   that's involved to this day, my Chromebook, my pixel book is probably the it's
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.840]   probably even more reliable than my iPad.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.880]   And but only because it does much less than the iPad does.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.440]   Right. Well, and I you can when you're at we haven't had to deal with this, but
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.880]   I noticed before COVID when you're going through an airport, you would look at
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:20.000]   like who's using what and the kids and the and the everyone below below 10 and
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.160]   over 55 were generally using iPads.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.520]   They were like they're like an iPad land and then and then business there be
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.240]   business travelers and suckers are still working for like the most of the
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.840]   like the folks from like what you would think of a social networks are all on
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.240]   Max and then and then you'd have the other business folks that are on PCs.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.440]   Yeah, it's kind of a bit.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:43.240]   But then you also hit the other the other place to check is go to like coffee
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.360]   shops that are kind of near a college campus because either either the kids who
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.560]   work kids who go there got like presents from rich parents or they have a budget.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.760]   And that's where you see a lot of like aces or you see a lot of aces left tops
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:01.840]   because they seem to work fine and I don't I got I got you remember what it's
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.400]   like when you're in college and you know to the penny how much money you have left
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.320]   in your account.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.360]   And if it's like less than 20, it means that, OK, I guess I'm going to I guess I've
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.800]   got to volunteer for that cyclab experiment that gives me $20 because otherwise I
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.160]   won't be able to be able to do anything next week.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.520]   Yeah, I've been mentoring a high school senior in computer science and programming.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.840]   And I got you know, I decided to take the workload off myself to make him watch
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.080]   Harvard's introduction to computer science is their biggest class.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.760]   They do it with enjoy only with MIT CS 50 and repeat it with.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.800]   I was very interested to see that at no point do they make any judgment about
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.480]   computer you using every tool that they use.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.360]   It could be used in a Chromebook or an iPad because they're basically web based
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.480]   tools.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:56.560]   They don't mention the iPad, but they and the teacher is using a MacBook to Mac
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.880]   books.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.760]   So there may be is a little leaning towards Apple, but they say very clearly this will
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.960]   work on your Windows machine, your MacBook, your Chromebook.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.080]   They understand that at least freshmen and incoming freshmen, even in the computer
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.960]   science world are going to be carrying a variety of tools.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.880]   There's no dominant tool at Harvard.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:22.080]   It's really it's really immature to have a real alliance towards one platform
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:22.680]   or preference.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.480]   I think so.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.760]   This is why Intel's like Intel's push about, oh, they have one chip is horrible.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.240]   They're putting one over on you.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.440]   They're they're they're pulling a badger game on you by telling you it's as good as
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.200]   a laptop like, oh, God, is this is this 1994 again?
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.120]   It's like, actually it is because they have
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.200]   Justin long in them.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.840]   So I thought that was very weird that remember Apple at its last event had John
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.400]   Hodgman, the PC from the I'm a Mac.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:55.160]   I'm a PC ads as a he had they had him as a PC, but at least they were paying for him.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.280]   Intel has hired and I'll play I'll play one of these for you.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.120]   Justin long Alex because the positing is so bad.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.520]   It's going to hurt him really.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.680]   Is it that bad?
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.600]   Here we go.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.720]   Some of them, they have the screens on top of the guy's hands.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.880]   Oh, let me let me let me I'm going to get my sound to come out of the right hole.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.880]   One second.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.600]   That's the only problem with Linux.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.280]   Sometimes you have to tell it what to do.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.360]   Here we go.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.560]   This is Justin long.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.400]   Hello, I'm Justin.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.000]   Justin real person doing a real comparison between Mac and PC.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Come on. OK.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.120]   So first of all, I hate you now, Justin.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.640]   I just want you to know you've gone over the other side and you turn.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.400]   Remember him.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:34.880]   That's good.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.520]   You are now with me.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.800]   I hate I hate him for a different reason because he's definitely been like using
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.520]   moisturizer because he doesn't look like he looks the same.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.280]   Freaking age.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:44.760]   Yes.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.440]   Well, when you're young, aging doesn't happen quite as quickly.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.800]   See.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.440]   Oh, cool.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.600]   This whole thing's a touch screen.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.760]   And there's another one.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.760]   Oh, wow.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.320]   All right.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.880]   And now for Mac, let's see.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.520]   Oh, you've got a little bar here.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.560]   Little baby one.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.000]   Sorry.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.680]   I didn't catch that.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.400]   Oh, where's the mute button?
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.800]   Here's what I found on how to cook.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.480]   No, I don't want to cook mutton.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.560]   What do you do?
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.960]   That's by the way, the best part of the whole series.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.440]   Yeah, that's we have.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.560]   We don't have much to say against any of those.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:20.800]   He accidentally because the touch bar because touch bar hits it and Siri launches.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.640]   And says here's out of Cook mutton.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.960]   So that's kind of my experience with the touch bar as well.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.600]   I might add.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.520]   I will admit that that is my experience of the touch.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.600]   Mostly my experience is how do I turn all this off?
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.000]   How do I get this to stop?
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.200]   Like because I'm constantly, I think that the biggest problem
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.760]   of the touch bar is that it's constantly changing what it's doing and you're
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.320]   constantly accidentally hitting it.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.480]   So it's so we had, you know, we had to
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.480]   until guys on Windows weekly last week because it's Windows weekly.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.440]   And I asked them, you know, what's and I think maybe Paul asked them, what's the
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.720]   reaction to the M one?
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.920]   And they actually said exactly the right words, which is we're taking this as a
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:03.120]   challenge and it invigorates us because competition.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.440]   But no, be honest and say it has zero market share and we're not even thinking
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:06.800]   about it.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.760]   Yeah, no, they probably are thinking about it because I don't know how long it'll
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.640]   have to market share.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.800]   Certainly there are windows.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.360]   People look at the battery life and the cool operation and the speed of the M one
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.040]   and go, yeah, be nice to have.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.440]   Well, I mean, the hard part is just the perception.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:26.160]   You know, I don't think that Intel's problem is really even, you know, Apple as
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.920]   much as it's just perception of them getting knocked down, right?
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.440]   Because right.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.480]   And if they keep on getting whacked, you know, and yeah, I am.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.240]   These do it.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.560]   So that's two blows.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:39.480]   But I think that, yeah, and really showing that they can't, I think Intel tried to
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.320]   live for as long as they could on the fact that they had a better chip.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.520]   AMD was cheaper.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.680]   They had a better one.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.080]   All things equal.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.160]   If they if they lose all aspects of that, which they've lost most of already,
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.600]   if they lose all aspects of it, it really has a value proposition problem for them,
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.000]   you know, in, you know, down the road and not just in the Apple market.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.840]   They're not that I don't think the Apple market means anything to them.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.560]   The as much as the perception that the M1 is pulling away and they can't figure
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.240]   out a way to do it.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.280]   And the problem that they have is that how do you do that?
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.240]   Like, how do you fix the problem when you you need to own the operating system
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.800]   and you need to have and you need to have a singular development platform
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.520]   and you need to be able to make the hardware that goes that it goes into.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.280]   You need to make all those things and there's only one company in the world that's so bad.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.520]   But that's why it's not bad.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.120]   This is why this is why these are good ads.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.560]   They're smart ads because you're right.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.760]   So they double down on the one thing
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.560]   Intel has going from the PC industry has, which is variety.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.640]   So that's not specific.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.440]   Those are Windows and vendor differentiation.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.440]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.440]   But it's in their commodity and that equation.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:43.840]   I agree.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.880]   They're only on Intel.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.840]   But that point is I think reasonable that if you can't say we're optimized
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.360]   because we own the whole stack as Apple can, you say, well, but there's a virtue
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.560]   in not only owning the whole stack, which is variety.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.320]   And that's really true in the Windows world.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.080]   There's a variety.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.040]   There's a lot of variety.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:01.760]   I think there is.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.080]   There is.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.280]   It's a sense.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.840]   But as the new chips come out, it's going to just the spread is going to get a lot
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.280]   further.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.400]   That's the problem.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.160]   And I think that, yeah, there's that's why they're doing this now, by the way.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.760]   They have to get ahead of this is because there won't it'll be really complicated
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.520]   a year from now.
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.880]   Like again, none of us, I expected when Apple puts out these silly little chips,
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.920]   I'm going to buy a bunch of Intel machines so that I can stock up and deal
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.960]   with Apple like screwing this up for two or three years.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:33.480]   And we immediately did a full stop on buying anything else with Intel when we saw
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:37.960]   what the once we got in many immediately tested it.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.520]   We're like, OK, yeah, we're not going to buy any more Intel machines.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.520]   You know, like and which you consider.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.680]   The empty.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.720]   Well, I mean, on our PC stuff, sure.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.440]   It is.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.120]   Is it a vote against Intel or a vote against x86?
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.400]   I don't think I don't think the whole platform has any.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.200]   I don't think it competes right now.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.360]   I think by the time we get to a Mac Pro in 18 months, it's really.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.840]   It's really anything for Apple Silicon is what it is.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.680]   Not against four apples.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.760]   Yeah, I just don't see.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.920]   I guess I don't see how they fix the prop.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.800]   It's not just that Apple's head.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.800]   It's that I can't calculate a way that the PC manufacturers can get their hand.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.040]   They can't it will take them 10 years because it took Apple 10 years.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.040]   It took Apple 10 years to get to this chip and it's going to take them 10 years
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.560]   and they and that 10 years requires them to all get along and all agree and all
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.480]   build a consortium.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.680]   What do you have to do?
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.040]   In fact, the only company that could do it is Microsoft because they at least own
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:34.040]   the software stack, they have to buy up Intel or make it more make it deal with
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:34.480]   Qualcomm.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.240]   I think more likely and I think you'll see this.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.400]   They're already working with Qualcomm.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:42.400]   They'll make a deal with Qualcomm to do a custom Windows chip that that can
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.400]   call along with that.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.320]   Does it have the advantage that Apple has either?
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.120]   I agree.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.440]   I mean, so the thing is just to get to get to to get to version one, it will take
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.880]   them four or five years and Apple has is already running down the path.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:58.560]   That's the do you think that if they can get the process down, I mean, that's one
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.360]   of the problems Intel has is process is still 14 nanometers barely 10.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.840]   It's six years behind scheduling.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.160]   So if they get the process down and if they can get the cores up and if they can
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.480]   get the no, it's the it's the integrated RAM.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.320]   It's the architect.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.720]   Well, they can do that architecture.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.520]   They can do that.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:20.560]   You could do you have to have to have a fine memory with with an Intel chip at
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.480]   that much that many gigs.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.280]   I mean, I only to build the whole thing and then all the apps and the
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.000]   OS is hard to tell.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.680]   AMT.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.760]   They're doing it in it.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.680]   Unified memory architecture is not new.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.760]   It's been done in the consoles for a couple of generations.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:41.320]   These interesting and they're doing it and they're doing it with with x86
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:41.960]   architectures.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.560]   So there's nothing to stop them from doing unified memory.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.280]   GPUs, that's interesting.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:53.920]   Does do Apple's GPUs compete with Nvidia ray tracing or AMD's top of the line?
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.640]   Not right now.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.200]   Yeah, but I think that's the efficiency, but not in terms of overall power.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.520]   But but as an integrated solution, I just think that they're going to have a
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.160]   hard time and I don't think that they can I don't think the performance can
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.080]   keep up like I think it's not there yet.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.920]   I mean, I think but they're really fast right now and that was the first little
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.240]   ones that they put out and so now you have.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.080]   I agree.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.960]   I think everybody should be terrified on that side because there's not because
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.120]   the thing is is that once Apple gets out ahead, it's not it's not like an upstart
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.000]   who came out with this really fast computer computer that you can buy or you
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.800]   can compete with scale or whatever.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.000]   You know, Apple is bigger than all of them and now it's running faster and is ahead
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.760]   if all that math is very scary, you know, like to have an Alex and I'll be a
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.840]   little devil's etiquette because I've been arguing your position for a long time
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.720]   and went this weekly.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:44.280]   On the other hand, the response to that is but Intel chips are more than fast
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.080]   enough for what people do.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.440]   I mean, it's not like, you know, you're gaining a lot of overhead that suddenly
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.320]   people are going to find, you know, maybe they will new ways to lose all this
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.560]   over the speed.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:00.040]   But I mean, I think Intel and this is really the point that Paul
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.720]   Thorett makes it again and again.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.160]   It still satisfies people still getting the job done.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.920]   It's still going to be the mass market.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.440]   It's completely.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.520]   I don't think that's going anywhere anytime soon.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.000]   The problem is is that when you start losing the opinion of everyone,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.240]   well, only certain that is a yeah, but publicly you're going to you know,
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.880]   it's going to be one of those things that they're really getting constantly bash
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.280]   or being behind it's it's a mountain that's really hard to it's just hard to turn
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.040]   that I agree.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:27.680]   I agree with you.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.920]   The hard thing is that they don't control the stack and controlling the stack is
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.720]   something that Apple can do at all.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.960]   You know, you do the uniquely.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.120]   Could you do the first 10 seconds of my second to last video or the first 20
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.280]   seconds of my second to last video?
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.000]   This was my favorite thing about the Intel.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:49.520]   OK, commercials Renee Richie, commenting on the one that says the
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:54.040]   until this is the one where you where you get where you go after the comp
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.600]   the comp composition, but not just that.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.280]   Because it works so well for Apple.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.160]   OK, here we go.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:03.000]   Renee Richie, the first few seconds of his video.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.200]   Wait, what is that?
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:08.640]   Hold up, hold up, zoom and hands, zoom and hands, zoom.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.520]   Oh, wait, wait, are they running a Mac?
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.680]   That's big sir.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:17.040]   Watching this is all watching Intel screwed up and photoshopped the bezels off the
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:17.600]   Macbook.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.960]   That looks good.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.360]   Sponsored by brilliant.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.040]   I got to see that again.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.200]   Are you kidding me in that ad?
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.960]   They rush to do the compositing and they they composited it.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.560]   All the bezels off the Macbook.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.280]   Oh, I see.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.120]   The Mac was I see.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.800]   So this is the Mac that he's showing not a Windows machine.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.560]   Yes.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.720]   But there's no bezels.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.640]   So maybe this is the new Mac book that they already have access to that we don't.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.520]   No, Ryan tweeted about it later.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.840]   They said that they were rushed and they couldn't get the compositing, right?
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.480]   Because one of the scenes also like they keep it on the basis is floating over his hands.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:55.280]   Oh, man, that's pretty funny.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.120]   Oh, well, and the fact that they're rushing out that they didn't have enough
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.680]   time shows you panic.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.680]   Yeah, like it's like it's you know, the fact that they didn't say, oh, wait
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.240]   another week to get the compositing, right?
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.480]   Wait another whatever, like what are they?
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.240]   Well, they were then.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.800]   They were actually it's a little late.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.880]   They should have done it right at the beginning before the benchmarks showing
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.680]   an M1 beating an I nine came out.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.320]   It would have been a lot more credible.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.520]   But don't you think I think that a critical mistake like I wouldn't have done.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.720]   I wouldn't have done this at all.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.160]   Like I would not have gone back to get a Mac.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:28.120]   I would have gone back to Intel inside and just shown like a bunch of really
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.000]   amazing Intel PCs.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.960]   Don't even start the Apple or the AMD.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.400]   And then at the end, slow pan onto a Mac Pro and just say,
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.840]   every powerful computer runs Intel and then just drop the mic and walk away.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.680]   Well, there you go.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.520]   The problem is that you're then you put weight on the on the pro and when it
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.600]   stops, it's going to be, you know, and I think the issue about it.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:52.600]   But then again, I think the issue is is that it's not their competitors,
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:58.200]   AMD, not Apple, it's it's that the perception of size and scale is really in
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.680]   and in some kind of technical lead is really important to Intel and they've
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.000]   lost it almost everywhere.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.320]   And if they publicly get whacked over and over again, it's not that that Apple's
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.280]   going to overtake them.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.240]   It's that AMD is going to overtake them.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.040]   You know, and and you know, and they're not going to be able to get the
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.360]   perception back to where it was before.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.000]   And I think that's the challenge.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.560]   Well, you also have to think about this is this is you have to the diplomatic
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.880]   purpose of these commercials.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.440]   They're not fighting Apple here.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:28.240]   Realize that Mac OS is no longer the number two operating system of the world.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.880]   It's not the number three operating system in the world, but but they I feel
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.840]   they need to have a way of telling all of the different manufacturers who build
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:38.520]   based on Intel.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.560]   Hey, look, we're fighting for you.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.840]   We have committed our marketing budget towards helping you sell your laptops
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:44.800]   based on our chips.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:50.920]   And so they kind of have no alternative but to try to talk up the entire platform
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.040]   as opposed to a single CPU.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.640]   And the best target is, of course, a Mac because it's the other one that has a
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.800]   lot of marketing money behind it.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.920]   So at least it shows that there is and it shows to the people who are doing
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.640]   business with you that you are investing in the platform.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:10.480]   You're investing in also the messaging behind the platform, even though really a
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.640]   lot of the lot of discussions that we're having about the M1 versus AMD versus
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:20.240]   Intel is it really is a lot like when the three guys on top gear talk about the
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.400]   power plant inside these three different cars.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.960]   No, most people absolutely don't care about all these little differences.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.760]   What they care about is I'm in the store or I'm on Amazon.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.440]   I've got $730.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.440]   I'd be able to stretch that to $800.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.440]   What can I get?
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.920]   And here are my needs after that.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:41.960]   It just doesn't matter to them what the what kind of silicon is under the hood.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.360]   It's it's true.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.320]   It pains the hell out of me.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:50.120]   You know, on the radio shows they stop buying windows, but there's there's
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.640]   that convince anybody.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.480]   I mean, from a business perspective, it's the the margins that were so small on the
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.160]   the people who are passionate are the ones buying computers that have margins.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.640]   You know, like the people who are not passionate or buying ones that have almost
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.200]   the same for phones and not just that just makes it really, really complicated to
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.280]   build business models around it.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.600]   Just hard to innovate when you have nothing to make it up in volume.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.920]   I mean, you have a small margin if you're here until I mean,
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.000]   or Lenovo or a Dell, but but you sell a hell of a lot more computers than Apple
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.560]   does and you make it up on margin.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:28.520]   I I mean, you know, this this past month, there have been multiple zero days.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:33.200]   It's really been a nasty security environment for Windows.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.840]   People call me all the time and say I did the Windows update and my printer.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.280]   You know, there was a big flaw in the last Windows update.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.520]   We had it if you had printers from Qsara or Rico or a number of
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.600]   laser printer models.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.240]   Windows would blue screen when you tried to print.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:55.720]   It's not that you couldn't print the whole system would crash to its knees.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.800]   I mean, this is a very fragile that it forces you to do.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.440]   Yes, and it's a very that's the thing.
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.040]   Yes, it was a security update.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:06.760]   Microsoft fixed it since, but this is a very fragile ecosystem.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:11.200]   And I always basically what I see on the radio show is if you have an IT department,
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.440]   fine, and you know, you need it for your business, fine.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:19.360]   If you're willing to be your own IT department, fine, but most people just want
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.480]   something works. The problem is the default is still Windows.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.720]   Like, well, that's everybody buys Windows. Windows is a PC.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.200]   That's a computer, right?
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.760]   Oh, I'm not a Mac max for fancy people.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.960]   It's expensive. I can't.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.520]   It's not for me.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.040]   And so I think that's the problem.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.320]   It's a perception problem and I don't think that's going to be overcome.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.720]   In fact, I wonder if those ads are even aimed at consumers as much as they're
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:49.040]   aimed at the OEMs saying, see, see, just like you said, we really we make great
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.400]   processors, so he ends keep making your great computers.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.560]   I also wonder whether they use the the actor to make sure that he doesn't end up
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.480]   because now of course he's burned from an Apple perspective.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.600]   I'm a Mac anymore. Yeah.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.560]   Yeah, maybe they saw a hot minute at the event and they said, oh, get just get me
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.240]   just in long quick.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.360]   Well, I mean, you can't literally it could have been.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.000]   I expected Justin long back with Hodgman.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.440]   Yeah, when I saw when I saw Hodgman there, I was like, oh, I think that this is
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.280]   going to be Apple's just going to pummel them next year.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.040]   Yeah, yeah, good.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.600]   Yeah, but Apple doesn't like to go back to their old ways, right?
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.400]   Yeah, I would have been a fun one.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.760]   I mean, they've got a new.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.120]   What's really they're doing a think different style campaign right now, aren't
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.160]   they with all those famous people in black and white shots?
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.200]   So maybe they do.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.600]   It's really it's really weird, though, because there's very few people who are
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.960]   like, we all remember that I'm the Mac commercials.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.640]   Most mainstream customers now don't like a lot of people were asking who it was.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:51.000]   And he comes out and I'm a Justin, which is, yeah, I mean, it's not it's not a mainstream
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.000]   you know, kids are on TikTok these days and not watching all that.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Full commercials.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:54.520]   Right.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.640]   We know what it was.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.360]   No one else.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.120]   And then it's called Justin gets real, but all the composites are badly done to the
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.200]   point that it looks fake.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.680]   So like the entire thing to me seems like they rushed it out.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.280]   It was ill conceived, ill considered, it'll executed.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.640]   And it just it I want Intel back so badly.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:13.440]   I want like a I want a competitive environment where AMD and Intel and Apple
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.480]   and Qualcomm are all, you know, vying for our attention and our money.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.560]   And this this is just not a good.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.920]   It's like making the execs happy.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.120]   This is the ad you make to make your executives happy, not to improve.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.240]   Somebody said somebody it feels like somebody just said, we have to respond.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.200]   Like we have to respond.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:29.720]   We have to respond.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.280]   What are we going to do?
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.120]   How are we going to handle this?
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.520]   Like somebody's got to do something right now.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.120]   And then there was a whole bunch of people running around.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.600]   I bet despite the fact that you're right, most people don't know who Justin
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.360]   long is and didn't get the reference, I bet they were successful ads because
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.880]   the fundamental point they were making is is true.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.400]   There's a lot more variety in the PC ecosystem period.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:54.760]   That's one is Apple's getting sued now in a class action lawsuit because of
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.640]   their crappy butterfly keyboards.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:02.640]   You know, the touch bar, no, I very few people love the touch bar.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:07.720]   I think that they targeted reasonable things on the apple side and and showed
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.880]   the one big strength the PC side has, which is variety.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:15.720]   So in that two things that hurt me as a marketer were one.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.240]   Coke never does Pepsi never.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.120]   It mentions Pepsi never does a Pepsi challenge.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.440]   It's not what a market leader does.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.720]   And second, you always want to advertise your strengths and every strength.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:26.360]   They advertise with the strength of windows and PC vendors.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.400]   Nothing to do with Intel.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:31.480]   So in one foul swoop to sort of be to make their executives feel better.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.560]   They said we are no longer the market leader and we are also a commodity part.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.080]   Thank you.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:35.560]   Good night.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.000]   And it just broke my heart.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.800]   That's a good point.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.280]   Like I said, I doubt it was to make them make it.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.600]   I doubt it was promoting Intel.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.800]   I do think it was again part of part of the discussions that you have when you
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.320]   have these contracts is to say not only not only are we going to give you
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.760]   engineering, not only are you going to we give you our technology, but we have a
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.040]   marketing budget that will help you to help you promote how well your hardware
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.000]   is going to be because it uses our products inside it.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.080]   So I don't at that at the level of Intel, I don't think that they're quite that
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:09.760]   thin skin, but I do agree that this was pretty misguided and that they could have
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:16.000]   done a lot more to promote the Intel platform devices to consumers than what
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.040]   they're doing right now.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.120]   I agree that you don't.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:22.840]   You I will give them kudos for saying thank you, Apple, for investing tens of 20
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:29.400]   million dollars in creating an idea, an advertising brand or an advertising sort
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.960]   of trade dress that we could easily hook on to 10 years later.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.320]   However, it really is.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.240]   It's it's what happens when you're locked in a conference room for years and
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.560]   years and years and you don't spend a lot of time again hanging out at coffee
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:46.000]   shops near college campuses, you know, spend a whole lot of time.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:50.600]   Hanging out at public libraries and seeing how your technology helps people
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.040]   that are actually on the ground there because they had a lot more to they had
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.400]   a lot more to do a lot more to say.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.760]   There also I might say for fighting a battle in a more that's been over for a
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.600]   while because it's really the mobile the mobile arena.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.080]   If you if you what you're talking about as young people, they're not buying
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.440]   PCs or Macs, they're not they're not might be buying iPads.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.280]   Really, they're buying phones and they're most you can't tick-tock on a PC.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.600]   It means that I was canceling that that Mac Pro
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.640]   update, doesn't it? Like there's no way they're going to roll out a new
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.520]   Intel chip after those commercials, right?
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.840]   Oh, I doubt that they were going to do anyway.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.280]   I mean, as far as I know, they were they were going to do one last update to the
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.720]   Mac Pro before it went M1.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.160]   Yeah, I don't know if they will now.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.160]   Yeah, but I think that I don't know of anybody that I mean, I know there's nobody
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.360]   I know that would buy one now.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.040]   Once they saw the M1, no one's going to want to upgrade.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.080]   They're no one's going to want to touch their Mac Pro.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.280]   I mean, you know, and I'm sure that it was worth whoever bought it.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.040]   It's worth the money they put into it.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.880]   If they didn't amortize it over two years, they shouldn't have bought it, right?
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.240]   So it's not so they got a good value out of it.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:56.720]   But I think that no one's going to no one's going to invest after they saw the M1.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:01.480]   Everyone knows that an M whatever it is, M2, three, four, one X, one Z, whatever
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:07.480]   that ends up being in the in the Mac Pro is going to be so fast and so big that
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.560]   whatever comes out as the new one that no one wants to invest in.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.160]   So I think there was the there was big Navi and the Intel stuff, you know, some
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.320]   some boot reports that somebody found in the operating system.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.640]   But I'm guessing that's not happening.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.800]   Oh, wow, I didn't know that.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.320]   It's interesting.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.320]   Let's take a little break.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.600]   Renee Richie, Andy and Aco Alex Lindsey.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:27.800]   All here.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.200]   The team is assembled for Mac break weekly.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.320]   Our show today brought to you quite literally by cash fly.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.640]   When you download one of our shows, you're getting it from our content delivery
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.800]   network cash fly.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.440]   They've been innovating content deliveries since 1999 and we've been using them.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:51.040]   Gosh, I think since 2009 for a long time, they really solved a big problem we had,
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.360]   which is how do you get
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:57.520]   podcasts, especially now that we once we started doing video podcast, large files
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:02.080]   to customers without delay, without error, customers won't know that, you know,
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.520]   that we're doing cash fly.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.520]   But what you don't want them to do is say, hey, it took a long time to get that
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:11.400]   I didn't get the file and all that cash fly has really saved our bacon for more
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.480]   than 10 years.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.120]   Thank you cash fly.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:18.000]   They now if you're streaming off for something really interesting, they call it
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.480]   ultra low latency streaming and it's not it's not the web RTC solution that's
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.360]   let you down in the past.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:28.320]   This is less than one second of latency.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.760]   You could play it anywhere.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:35.200]   They have a fabulous HTML5 player that easily supports whatever platform you want.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:40.160]   SDK available if you want to make a mobile app of your own, whether you need your
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:43.720]   player to run on websites, applications, mobile devices or another platform they've
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.920]   got you covered.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.440]   Of course, cash fly is global.

[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.680]   in just thousands of synchronous streams.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.560]   In fact, speaking of ingest, their platforms designed for transmuxing thousands
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.080]   of streams simultaneously with live failover.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:26.880]   They can ingest our TMP, RTMP, SSRT and more to deliver ultra low latency SLDP
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.760]   and HLS streams at the same time.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.400]   Plus cash fly works with you.

[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:49.480]   And I can vouch for the support 24, 7, 365 days a year priority support.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.880]   They're always there when you need them.

[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:03.320]   And it's the world's most reliable CDN backed by a 100 percent SLA.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.520]   I can vouch for that too.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:08.080]   And 10 years we've never ever lost a download.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:08.800]   I love that.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.080]   Cash flies helping others in need.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:16.040]   They've partnered with World Central Kitchen, helping to serve 300,000 warm meals.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.200]   They've donated over $50,000.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:23.320]   They also pioneered, by the way, the first any cast CDN infrastructure back in 2002.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:27.360]   Their best hop technology automatically finds the fastest route to and from
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:31.520]   customer origin across their global network of pops for maximum performance
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.000]   and reliability.

[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.040]   You will too.

[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:20.760]   Not been a great week for Apple in terms of court orders, but I have to say these
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:25.800]   things, it feels like patent trolls to me and I think Apple kind of even insinuated
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.000]   this.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.840]   Another article in Marshall, Texas, another trial in Marshall, Texas.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:41.320]   Jerry says Apple has to pay $308.5 million to personalized media communications
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:46.880]   saying that Apple infringed their patent on digital rights management.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:53.880]   Apple insinuated by saying, quote, cases like this brought by companies that don't
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:59.200]   make or sell any products, stifle innovation and ultimately harm consumers.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:06.760]   It was disappointed by the jury verdict and will appeal.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:10.120]   It's been going on for five, five years now.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.960]   I think at some point we it would be great if the Supreme Court just decided we're
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.160]   going to overturn everything that comes out of that county.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.160]   Like just we're just going to let you know.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.360]   Like they just say, hey, you just see, you know, we're anything that comes out of
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.160]   the county, we're not going to we're not going to support.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.160]   And that would end this.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:29.200]   Like it would literally end it overnight if they if Robert's got up there and just
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.040]   said this is gone.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:34.840]   This has gone far enough and you can't just keep filing into one county and we're
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.480]   just going to just we're just letting you know once it gets here, we're going to
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.680]   throw it out.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:42.680]   So soon Google and YouTube actually lost.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:46.360]   They sued Netflix that that case is pending, but it's in New York.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.240]   Mm-hmm.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.160]   That's it.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.720]   By the way, that was going to be our strategy if we got sued when there was a patent
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:56.080]   troll over podcasting is a change of venue out of West Texas because right
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.400]   Texas, because that's the worst place it could be.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:05.280]   The lawsuit oddly, Apple challenged the validity of the patent back in 2015 at
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.720]   the patent trial on a peel board and won.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.520]   The patent was invalidated.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:14.920]   And then last year, US appeals court overturned that decision, which was some
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.240]   of expired and they've been forced to pay like on patents that were exhausted
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:18.880]   and expired.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.120]   It's really interesting.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:26.360]   Well, if you can call it that Eastern district of Texas, thank you very much.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.720]   You know, I don't even have to.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.760]   I didn't look at the patents.
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.000]   I don't have to look at them.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.680]   Like literally I just see Eastern District of Texas and I just immediately know it's
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.160]   BS.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:38.560]   You know, like this is just, you know, yeah, Apple fine in Brazil.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:47.400]   Not a lot, two million big deal for not putting a charger in the box with the iPhone.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.440]   Oops.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.000]   Oops.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.640]   This actually wasn't by the country of Brazil.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.040]   It was by the state of San Paulo.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.960]   So also charged
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.320]   for allegedly misleading customers, maintaining unfair contracts and not
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:08.280]   repairing products under warranty, but not this, not the hugest find ever.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:12.440]   I don't know what Apple's going to can appeal if they want to, but there's no word
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:16.160]   about whether they will.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.840]   And by the way, that's not a court order.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:21.000]   That's an order from the Brazilian
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.400]   Consumer Protection Agency.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:26.000]   So they could actually ask to go to court on that.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.560]   And it just goes to show how difficult it is to make even these simple changes
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:33.960]   because every country and every even municipalities within those countries have
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:40.000]   different laws where we're already seeing all the chaos that California is causing
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.680]   not not negative chaos, which I say, but the fact that the lack of a federal
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:49.240]   federal laws about digital content, federal laws against about privacy,
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:54.440]   about net neutrality has forced individual territories to simply say, OK,
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.640]   if our government is not going to do it, then our local government is going to do it.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:04.120]   And now you make a simple change like we decided to we decided to make our boxes
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.680]   gray instead of white and suddenly there is a place that's saying, well,
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:13.080]   because you're using a die instead of a bleach, your consumer packaging no longer
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:16.120]   qualifies for a recycling a recycling initiative.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.840]   And now you've got this other this other problem on your hands.
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:23.880]   Yeah, I think I think there's potentially case we made that that I mean,
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:27.280]   it was fine when we started doing this in California, but I think that as states
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:32.040]   get more and more picky, there's going to be some interstate trade issues with a
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:36.120]   constitution that are going to show up, but that's going to become the argument.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.000]   And that's going to become something that probably could invalidate a lot of these
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.240]   rules, but it is going to give consumers a lot of leverage, a lot of leverage,
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:47.480]   a lot of bargaining power against big companies like Apple and Google, because
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.520]   there is there are very few things that they're scared of.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:54.760]   One of them is having to comply with 50 different only slightly overlapping pro.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:59.440]   But if they are forced to, if when it comes to time to create a federal law,
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:05.480]   if they are now saying, well, look, Wisconsin wants this, New Hampshire wants this.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:09.960]   We can't simply wave our hand and say, no, you're not getting that because we don't
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:10.840]   want them to say, OK, great.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.400]   Well, then we'll create our own law.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.720]   We're going to we're going to use our own lobbying to make sure that we get kind
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:19.840]   of what we want. It means that they do have to they can they can no longer have a,
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.400]   hey, we are complying and if you don't think we are, well, fine as we'll just write you a
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.120]   check and we'll move on.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:34.080]   The jury, the witness list is in for the Apple versus Epic mega battle in the arena.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:38.400]   Tim Apple versus Tim Epic, Tim Apple versus Tim Epic.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.880]   Apple, I guess Apple be calling Tim Cook.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:44.000]   It's weird. I guess you can stipulate how long they'll be there.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.720]   Tim Cook will be examined for one hour with a one hour cross examination.
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:53.240]   Craig Federighi will testify for two hours with a one hour cross examination.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.880]   Tim Cook can say good morning for an hour and be done.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.880]   Yeah, you just feel shiller.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:58.400]   I like that.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.800]   Porch Phil's taken the brunt.
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:02.920]   He'll be testifying for 10 hours on the App Store.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.920]   Yeah, all of them will be doing it in person.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:10.560]   Also, the App Store Vice President Fisher had a fraud engineering algorithms and risk.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:11.800]   That's a good title.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:16.720]   I'm the head of fraud engineering algorithms and risk Eric Friedman,
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:17.880]   bunch of other people.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:22.720]   Epics witnesses, of course, include Tim Epic and other Epic employees.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.920]   They'll also bring in third party executive witnesses,
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.600]   executives from Facebook, Microsoft and Vidya.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.360]   Eddie Q is on the Epic list.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.360]   Former iOS software chief Scott Forstall.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.520]   I guess they got his phone number.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.480]   They found his phone number.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:38.200]   I thought they said it.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:38.920]   They had to put one in.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.280]   They slid into his DMS.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.720]   They slid into his DMS.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.040]   No, they did.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:44.520]   They found him.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:44.920]   Epic.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:48.120]   Well, he's on the witness list last.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.480]   He's on the witness list, but I think they haven't in that article.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:51.720]   I think they've said they hadn't found him.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.640]   So we've, yeah, this is back in February.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.800]   I don't know if they've found him.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:59.760]   It's really telling that so much of their stuff is hinged on letters between Steve Jobs
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:03.000]   and his executives, which is like over a decade now.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.720]   It's so fascinating to me.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.280]   Well, the other thing I is like, why do you write those letters?
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.120]   Like as a lawyer side, you're like, why would you do that?
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.640]   I know.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:20.120]   But that's also telling that you want to pull correspondence from a name that's
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:24.840]   going to have a big effect on a grand jury, but also from a time when this is
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.680]   before all of this malarkey was happening.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.800]   And if you have someone who knew who was known to be very, very loose,
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:33.520]   slipped during what he thought was going to be always private correspondence.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:39.120]   Oh, boy, that's where they say things like we want to kill them because I just
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:42.280]   hate them and I know it's unfair, but I think they should die.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.240]   That means we're going to kill them like, OK, great.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.200]   That'll put a couple of zeros on the settlement check.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.400]   Wonderful.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:53.160]   This was an interesting reveal from Mark German.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:49:00.720]   The HomePod mini has an unused humidity and temperature sensor in it.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.840]   It's got a secret. It's got a secret secret.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.800]   It's the way it's placed.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.920]   It's not it's not for internal temperature or humidity.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:16.040]   It's positioned by the power cord so that it can sense the room's temperature and
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.240]   humidity.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.520]   Why? What would you?
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.160]   Why would you put that in?
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:27.400]   Why would you possibly want to supply home kit, the temperature of a room and let
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:31.480]   you control your AC?
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:35.120]   I know, but the thing is, like, if you have an AC system, you already have a temperature
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.600]   sensor that's controlling the AC.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:39.560]   It's not as though this thing is just it's just randomly.
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:43.240]   You don't turn your AC to eight, but you would need to see to 68.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.920]   You just wouldn't need it. You wouldn't need a nest to do it.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.000]   I mean, well, and I have a honey well, but the honey wells are horrible.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.360]   I have one in my house.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:57.000]   At least for my antiquated heating and cooling system, the thermostats in the hall.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.640]   So the bedroom is never adequately heated or cool.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:04.680]   So having additional sensors because I did affect scatter,
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:08.200]   scatter earpud, minis all over the damn house.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:12.640]   It's a lot easier to drop an air given that it does other things.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.720]   It's a lot easier to drop it than another thermostat.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:18.480]   And so it a centralized location, a centralized system,
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:22.040]   knowing what the temperature is all over the house could be super useful.
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:26.320]   Yeah, maybe there's there's also rumors that Apple and there's even some evidence
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:30.760]   that Apple wants to make a home pod with a screen.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.440]   There's code in much rather just have a doc.
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:37.240]   Just give me a make a new home pod that's halfway between the old one
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.320]   and the mini that has a U1 chip in it so it can give Leo that follow me around the
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.880]   house with my music thing that he's always wanted.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.400]   Give me that automatic spatial audio set up.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.920]   I've always wanted and then build a little doc into it so I can pop my iPad
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:53.680]   into it in the room, in the kitchen, in the living room for the grandparents,
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.520]   for all of that.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:57.720]   And then Apple gets what they want, which is to sell multiple devices and I get
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:01.440]   what I want, which is just like my mom can do easy video conferencing with me.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.160]   I think there's a big market too of people who maybe even own or at least
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:10.320]   considered Google's assistant devices with the screen or the face of the
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:14.200]   portal or the Echo Show and have decided they don't want to give all of that
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.840]   information to Amazon, Facebook or Google.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.920]   Here comes Apple with a similar product.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.320]   I think that might be an untapped market.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.440]   Even without the baggage, the portal has done really well.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:28.600]   Oh, honestly, we all care.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:32.080]   But normal people go, what are you worried about?
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:36.000]   And if you have a Facebook account and three and a half billion people do,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.880]   clearly you don't care.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:42.160]   Because there you have the app on if you have your app.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:47.400]   I will go one further that if you have the app on your phone, that's the that's
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:52.600]   the line of demarcation between like, OK, I will occasionally log into Facebook
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:58.160]   and on the web and check to see what my my aunts and uncles are and cousins are
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:02.440]   doing. However, I am not putting an app on my phone with access to all those sensors,
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.640]   but the number of people who just OK, we're good.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.640]   No, why not?
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.960]   Or just like put them in their house with all the virtual reality stuff now,
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.160]   where they basically say, we're just going to take all the data from your house.
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.280]   It's cool. Cool. OK, great.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:18.200]   And the thing is the number one reason for me not to put it on my phone now
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:20.200]   because I don't have it on my phone is
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:24.680]   is the battery life is like twice double your battery life by just taking Facebook
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.160]   off your you know, that's when I worry.
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:29.560]   I was like, what are they doing if they take like you take it off the phone?
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.240]   It's immediately.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.840]   I deleted Messenger.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.280]   Now, every time I was like, do you want to receive Facebook Messenger things here?
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.480]   You have to take it all off.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.440]   All these notifications.
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:41.560]   You have to scrape off all Facebook material.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.160]   You have to get rid of all of it.
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.400]   You just got to get rid of all of it.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.280]   They're following me everywhere, Leo.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.920]   There's no Instagram for you.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:51.240]   See, you're you've got a problem because you're you know, you're a YouTube guy.
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.640]   You're going to influence her.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:56.680]   So you've got to have TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, all of them.
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:57.760]   I'm not an outsourced.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.520]   I'm going to outsource to a vault that just seals all stuff.
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:01.400]   I just decided to slide a video.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:02.600]   I don't care.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.960]   I don't I don't I don't I think just the touch it is.
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:08.320]   Just sign in and attach it to a monkey and set him free.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.440]   Let him run away.
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.800]   Run away algorithm.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.360]   We're like, I'm going on here fly free.
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.200]   Yeah, this person likes a lot of bananas.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.960]   There is very briefly there's an article on MIT technology review.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:26.640]   That's worth looking at about like a cons a concentrated and planned movement
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.800]   to poison data sets being collected by social media companies.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:32.000]   Father Robert was a leader in that field.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.360]   He started doing that years ago.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:39.800]   You know, and I don't want to poison it and I'll be honest.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:44.160]   I also don't care if advertisers have information about me.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.920]   They have lots of avenues for that anyway.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.880]   It's not like it's not a big deal to me.
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:53.440]   I consciously decided you had to be in around years ago, you know, like
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.640]   you just you're just either you're not having choice and it's a lot of work to be out.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:01.040]   You've got to find a monkey to put your phone on for one.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.640]   Phone on.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:08.280]   And I was really serious about it, you know, 30 years ago, you know, and you gave up to.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:13.680]   You know, I had some meetings and realized how deep the water was and just decided it wasn't worth it.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.840]   Once you understand, they want to understand how deep the water was.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:22.360]   I was like, and honestly, I also think the harms aren't.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.720]   It's like, OK, advertisers know everything there's to know about me.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.640]   Who cares?
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.720]   Why should I? What do I care about that?
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:32.360]   I understand the principle, but it's a principle.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:34.480]   And they sell it to Cambridge Analytica.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.280]   So it's not exactly who care if I'm not on Facebook.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:40.360]   I'm not seeing the ads, you know, I think it's it's less about people.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:44.920]   It's it's it's it's less about folks like us and it's more folks that are probably a
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:46.200]   little more impressionable.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:50.720]   Yeah, but then you're also us because they run sciops on us like they'll tell us who to vote
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.760]   for and what TV thing they tried to try to tell me who to vote for.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:54.920]   I don't care about that.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.240]   It's hard to see that because they do things where they adjust your feed to make you sad
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:54:59.440]   and reproduce the result.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.600]   You can control people by understood by show.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.040]   That is incredibly terrifying.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:10.680]   And my my one of my issues is simply the fact that what if I am I try to get a home
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:15.160]   loan or what if I'm applying for an apartment or if I'm applying for for a job
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:20.080]   and these the company that that is processing these applications is using
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:25.520]   relying on one of these absolutely juncts science mystical who do do do services.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:30.400]   Because of our we have we have with using the power of machine learning and
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:34.360]   artificial intelligence, we have access to social media and other metrics that will
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:38.440]   tell you precisely whether this person is trust is trustworthy or the scum of the
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.520]   earth and it's based on wealth.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.480]   What what what they're buying data that they're from from marketers.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:48.240]   They're applying algorithms that have not been proven that are absolutely not
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:52.600]   not public knowledge and can't be tested and they're making life changing decisions
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:57.360]   people will never they will never know how come I how come I'm I've never gotten
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:01.240]   a call back on a certain job on on jobs.
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:04.960]   And it's because they're all 20% of the industry is using this one service and this
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:11.520]   one service believes that because you have you both visit a lot of dirt bike dirt bike
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:16.600]   sites and you also live in this one you also visited this this one public park
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.520]   several times that you are a deadbeat.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:19.720]   It's like no thank you.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.320]   So I don't have a Facebook Instagram.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.880]   Any of that stuff obviously on my phone for sure but just in general.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:31.000]   The company does because they've decided it's not my choice.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.080]   They've decided to mark it but I don't I don't want to do that and I don't have
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.600]   an on Twitter either.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:40.200]   But it's not because I'm worried about being tracked.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:43.840]   I'm being tracked in a variety of ways and they look at your sideburns and say
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:45.000]   we're not going to give you any money.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.680]   There's all sorts of things.
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:48.520]   Well, you don't have any control.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.760]   You don't have any control over.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.800]   I just don't want to give many money.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.800]   I just don't want Mark Zuckerberg to get a penny of my money.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:56.680]   That's all.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.320]   So it's not the information I don't want to have.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.040]   It's the money I don't want to have.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.440]   I just don't like the time suck.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:06.800]   I realized when I took the Facebook off my phone and meant that I just didn't look
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:07.920]   at it and I look at it.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.880]   I still check it every day like oh what what messages are coming in like there's
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:13.320]   people you have to go and check your mail.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:18.680]   But but I don't do it on my phone and it just freed up a lot of time.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:21.800]   I was spending on things that I didn't need to spend time on like it does.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:25.560]   My life has not been negatively impacted by the fact that I spoke every day,
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:28.280]   you know, or you know, and I don't really dig through the timeline very much.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.760]   I have my own addictions.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.680]   I play Animal Crossing every single day.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.880]   I play Kingdom Kingdom Rush.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.480]   So that's pretty much it.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.840]   But we get to choose our addictions, right?
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:43.000]   Now Microsoft is buying Discord and we're going to have no safe harbor.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.680]   Yeah, I don't buy that story.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.720]   We've seen any time anything's for sale.
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.160]   Microsoft's going to buy it.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:51.200]   They were going to buy Pinterest to remember that.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.040]   I'm not sure.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:54.120]   But it's it's it's an electron app.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:55.400]   So it fits their portfolio.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:56.680]   That's true.
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:57.480]   That's true.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.360]   Somebody will buy it or they'll do an IPO.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:02.320]   They want to cash in is what the the message is.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.760]   We want to I prefer more choice in my networks.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:07.000]   I don't need everything to be owned by everybody by the same three.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.920]   No, I completely agree with you.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:09.720]   But you know what?
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.040]   There's other choices out there.
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:14.400]   Open source discords out there that are very good, like matrix and element.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:21.040]   But that's the that's the problem with things that are based on social networks.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:25.160]   It's like how many it's there are other alternatives to discord.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.640]   But if everybody is on discord and they're saying, OK, here's we can we can
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.040]   invite you to our to our discord.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.040]   We can invite you to excuse me.
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:31.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.960]   We can invite you to our slacks like, OK, but hey, what if we all like go off of
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:40.160]   slack and onto this open source alternative that isn't like controlled by a
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:41.240]   certain company?
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.440]   Well, there are 800 of us will talk to some of them.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.600]   No, that's not going to happen.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:49.280]   That's the reason why I'm on Facebook because I can't get my family to go.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:53.360]   I will create a server that's just for us that we can try and do a million things
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:57.880]   you can do easy and it's like and my response will be OK.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:02.840]   If you could like my community groups page on Facebook, they just don't care
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:03.440]   and they're not interested.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.480]   No care. That's exactly right.
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:09.440]   All you have to do is look at the numbers three and a half billion users.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:12.280]   They don't know what it cares.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.680]   Just just the tech pundits. That's the only people will care.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:21.960]   So Gurman in that mini sensor story mentioned, you know, oh, and you know, in one line,
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:25.760]   I love how Gurman, you know, like sometimes he buries the lead, like in one line says,
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:30.800]   they're working on the work on cameras and screen technology.
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:34.520]   Well, I mean, it makes sense to have to have to be able to set something down and
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:35.200]   talk to folks.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:38.800]   I think that it and the screens can provide a lot.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:44.680]   And we have a what I was at the Amazon, the original one with the screen.
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.960]   I can't think of the name of the moment.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:52.920]   Echo show show and number one, you support is the clock.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:55.160]   Like, you know, like we look over and there's a clock.
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.600]   And you go, oh, because that's the place where we know that it's there.
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.120]   The number one way I use voice
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.440]   assistants is to set timers for cooking.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:06.200]   The number my number one used from my Apple watch is timers.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.360]   Like by by a long shot.
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.080]   The fact that we use stuff for trivial purposes doesn't make it.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.440]   This is true.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.000]   But it is important.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.600]   It's important.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.520]   But I think there is a lot of opportunity in all of these things.
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:24.000]   I don't think anyone's really hit it yet, but I think that there's
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.720]   you know, we started doing.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.040]   I don't think Apple will do this.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:31.760]   I think it's more of an Amazon thing, but but we started we did a this kind of
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.160]   collaborative cooking over the weekend.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.840]   And it was interesting about it is that the
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.960]   it's just the very beginning.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.480]   You see like this tiny little seed of lots of people being able to be in there
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:47.280]   in their kitchen cooking together, learning how to do it from somebody who
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:47.920]   knows what they're doing.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:51.080]   And for Amazon, it's much more clean because you just say, OK,
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:55.040]   if you want to join this thing, you can, you know, whole foods will deliver all
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.960]   the food for you to go forward.
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.960]   And you can just follow along with Thomas Keller or whatever, you know.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:06.000]   And so I think that but I think that there's a lot of interaction that whether
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.080]   it's, you know, thousands of people or just you and an extended family being able
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.360]   to have something in the kitchen that and I think the advantage that Apple has
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.720]   with screens and interaction is that of their stance on privacy.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.600]   And I think that's going to be the thing that that you feel like you can do that.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:25.680]   I think a lot of us don't do that that naturally in with other devices because
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:27.840]   you just feel like you're being watched all the time.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.040]   Yeah. Well, Apple Apple can do a lot of really great things with with that kind
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:36.480]   of a device. The thing that's holding them back is that Siri has always been
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.840]   about text, whether it's spoken text or typed text.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:44.160]   And I think that that's what that's the core of what it kind of wants to do all
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:48.760]   the time, we'll ask Google, I have more experience with Google Smart Screens.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.040]   They really try to make it if it's on a smart screen, they will give you an
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.280]   entire visual experience towards the things you're asking it to do and the
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.240]   content you're asking you to display.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.080]   So if Apple were to an Apple, but Apple is really good at that.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.320]   If they were to create a visual version of Shlomo, sorry about saying the
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.960]   S word before, sorry if I activated your devices, that if they were to create a
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:14.720]   really, really good visual, like a four by six experience where it will give you
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:19.760]   a really, really wonderful, delicious experience every time you ask for stuff.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:24.920]   Even maybe that's the key to going beyond setting timers and setting simple reminders
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:29.480]   because there are things that I do on my older Google Smart Screen that I don't
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:33.760]   do on the desktop, I don't do on my phone because I'm no longer going to get like
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:38.080]   more of a more of a comprehensive panel, more of a comprehensive result because
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:42.080]   it'll give me the results spoken, but it will also give me information and
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.640]   controls around the thing that I've asked for that kind of make it into a valuable
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:52.760]   experience. I did preorder the second generation Nest Home coming about next week.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.800]   And part of it is that it is it's an entry.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.400]   The second generation became a very, very intriguing device as something to put on
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:05.720]   my nightstand given how many things that are kind of going through my mind in the
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.240]   last half hour, 45 minutes before I go to sleep and in the first half hour,
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:14.480]   45 minutes after I wake up, that became an interesting prospect for me, at least
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:18.880]   worth me putting $99 into seeing how much it would work out.
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:22.720]   Apple Apple could do something much, much better than that.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:30.080]   Apple also apparently in iOS 14.5 in the actually TV,
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:36.840]   OS 14.5 beta code has added FaceTime and iMessage frameworks along with the new
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.680]   AVF capture framework for capturing interesting.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.800]   So with that, if they're doing that, it means it would be part of a new Apple TV.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:49.680]   But what so Renee described to me in Apple TV that would incorporate FaceTime
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:53.160]   message and AVF capture.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:56.560]   So it's super interesting because those are amongst like the stickiest of Apple
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:00.200]   services, you know, those are the things that they've become almost nouns, like
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.800]   you FaceTime something to wait for someone to wait, you Google something.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.760]   Physically how they implemented to me is going to be curious, like, is it going to
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:11.120]   be a like a next generation eyesight camera that you mount on your television?
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.240]   Is it going to be incorporated into the Apple TV box because not everybody puts
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:18.080]   their Apple TV box in a place where it would actually camera them?
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.360]   No, mine's a third party accessories.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.840]   All it would see is up my skirt.
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:22.600]   Put it.
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:23.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.400]   It's down.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.000]   Or some people will be the server closet.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.280]   So I like it.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.000]   Was it going to use like a remote camera?
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.600]   Is it going to use your iPhone's camera or something and give you a family?
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:35.400]   Oh, what Apple is doing is seldom is interesting to me is how they're doing it.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.640]   And this is the kind of stuff I love just like figuring out an implementation
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.840]   for this.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.400]   Yeah, very interesting.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:45.920]   I mean, I always thought that they were going to eventually put they had a USB
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:49.440]   connection for a lot of the older Apple TVs and I always figured eventually
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:52.080]   they're just going to put a webcam in there so that people could interact.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.880]   It's just hidden underneath the
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.640]   it's a service port behind the ethernet jack now.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:57.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:58.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:02.160]   So if you so I mean, I would presume this is for a new Apple TV.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:05.640]   This is not something you're going to do with the old Apple TVs or that small
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.880]   speaker if that small speaker runs TVOS rather than.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.480]   Oh, does it?
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.040]   Where useful?
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.320]   What I was just saying it did.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.040]   It does.
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.720]   It runs it runs audio S, but it's based on TVOS.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:22.400]   So maybe those frameworks aren't intended for an Apple TV, but for a new
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.440]   home pod mini with a screen in a house.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.640]   I'd show.
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:32.480]   I have to say I've done Google Duo video calls with my Google home.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:38.240]   I've done a portal calls with a portal and I've I mean, it's it's actually it
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.360]   makes a lot of sense.
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:42.720]   I used to have my mom you were talking about Alex about cooking with your
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:47.840]   show. I used to have my mom on the Echo show in the kitchen while I was cooking.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:48.840]   We would talk.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.640]   I'd be making her sauce and she loved it.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.520]   It was like she was sitting in the kitchen.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.840]   So I could really there is that is a real good use case.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.280]   I like those devices a lot.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:05.840]   Yeah, I really wish that when I 10 years ago, I had like both parents
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:11.200]   and nursing care and hospitals and boy, the ability if I thought that'd be the
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.920]   biggest money to spend to simply say, I'm going to put one of these different
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.960]   camera devices in each one so that not not just for those of us who could visit
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:23.280]   like every day or every other day, but friends that could simply video drop in
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.760]   once a week or once every couple of weeks.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:30.840]   That that is what that is one of those those uses of technology that makes me
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:35.000]   smile and makes me optimistic because that is that is that is a problem without
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:35.640]   a solution.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:38.840]   Loneliness when you are having health problems, particularly the kinds that
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.880]   we're going to get away from that make it really, really difficult for used to be
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.000]   used to be easy to get in the car and drive 90 minutes to visit a friend of yours.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.920]   And now that's not going to happen.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.800]   So yeah, that's such a beautiful, beautiful use of technology.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:54.400]   That's why that is why I hope that Apple does something like this because they
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:59.480]   could make a very, very special version of this that would be you buy it for you
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:03.520]   buy it for your mom or your dad or your uncle for Christmas.
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.760]   They plug it in and it just works and suddenly, you know, you're talking to them
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.640]   like a couple of times a week casually instead of let's set up an hour in which
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.520]   we're going to have this big, this big sort of event where we get to talk to each
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:14.920]   other.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:18.000]   Although, I mean, Apple already has that product.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.320]   It's an iPhone and iPad.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:23.520]   It is, but there's something like if you look at the tech, like the portal is
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.920]   pretty good at the tracking process that really does make it a little bit more
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.920]   fluid, you know, where it's taking a 4K image.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.960]   Have you seen the new Amazon one?
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:38.960]   If it's a screen on a pivot and it follows you around.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.920]   And then it tells you if you need to order an or 20 paper as it's following you,
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:44.920]   which is really creepy scans your house in the middle of the night.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.800]   But you're right.
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:49.680]   I mean, that that ability to follow the Google does that too, where because it's
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:53.560]   got such a high res camera, if you move, it can refocus without moving.
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.080]   But now the echo is going to move.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.880]   You move it just like that.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.760]   I bought two portals because I was going to send mom one, but I realize I don't
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.480]   know what Facebook accounts.
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.680]   It's good to me.
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.240]   Did you think it was a valve thing, Leo?
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.840]   Were you buying it based on the valve?
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.880]   Yeah, I thought, oh, I could put holes in the hole.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.720]   Aperture science?
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.880]   Yeah, no, I don't know what I was thinking.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.080]   I guess it was for review more than anything else.
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:19.240]   I remember there was a person I knew who worked on it and they
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:22.080]   they released it round about the time of Cambridge Analytic.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.840]   And he's like, I feel like it's a really great product that I worked on,
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.240]   but I know none of you are going to buy it now.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.160]   Exactly.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.280]   Exactly.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:30.040]   Exactly.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.920]   Facebook just kind of screwed the pooch and
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:37.360]   you know, it's why I don't have an I think the Oculus Quest is really, you know,
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:40.280]   they're inexpensive one is fantastic, but I don't
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.880]   I don't have a second one because it requires a login.
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:47.000]   Yeah, I don't want any money going into Mark's pocket.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.760]   All right, let's take a little break, put some money in my pocket.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:54.080]   That was a big waste.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.440]   I was really creepy.
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:58.000]   Sorry about that.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.800]   We're putting money in Alex's pocket.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:03.080]   OK, and Renee's and and and we appreciate it.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.920]   Yeah, OK, and a little bit in mind.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:08.760]   Our show today brought to you by IT Pro TV.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.240]   Actually, these guys are good guys.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:15.160]   I I try to pick advertisers that I really can get behind and I love these guys since
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:20.600]   they started Tim Brum and Don Pazette were trainers doing, you know, IT training
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.000]   in a classroom, the kind of traditional style.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.760]   This training, by the way, is really important.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.200]   If you want to get a job in IT, you could know everything.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.960]   You could be sitting and listening to the show going, you're wrong, you're wrong,
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:35.320]   you're wrong, but getting a job is is another matter entirely.
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:39.160]   You've got to show you have the skills and generally that first IT job,
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:43.600]   they want you to have certificates, maybe one of the comtia certificates,
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.920]   a plus or security plus or network plus, maybe a CCNA for a Cisco certificate or
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.640]   MCSE for Microsoft.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.240]   They want to know you've got those skills and that's what Don and Tim were doing,
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.400]   but they were doing in the classroom.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:00.560]   They came to an NAB panel I was on with Adam Corolla, a bunch of other people
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:05.040]   about streaming and they said, wait a minute, this is they got the idea.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:09.680]   We could do the same thing we do in classrooms, but better on the internet,
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.840]   people, everybody everywhere could watch it.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.120]   They created it pro TV.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:19.240]   That was back in 20, I want to say, 2013.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:23.360]   They now now they've just kind of gone, you know, it's amazing.
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.360]   I'm so jealous.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.320]   We went out to Gainesville a couple of years ago to see their brand new facility.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:27.960]   It's gorgeous.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:34.640]   Seven studios operating all day Monday through Friday because there's always more
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:39.320]   content to create new versions, new questions on the exams, new software coming
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.280]   out, new things to teach people.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:47.560]   If you want to if you want to learn it, there is no better place than I T pro TV
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:51.400]   with seven studios, fun and entertaining edutainers.
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.480]   I T pro TV is just really the best online I T training platform.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:59.800]   One of the big areas right now, cyber security, there are literally more than
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:07.160]   a million jobs unfilled right now in in desktop and network security.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:13.480]   Businesses need not only the people on the ground, but they need strong I T leadership.
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:16.200]   So that, you know, that's one of the things you get these great people on the
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.840]   ground and they keep complaining that the leadership doesn't understand what's
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:24.600]   going on. If you want to strengthen your I T leadership, this is how you could do
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.000]   it. The I T pro TV business platform, it's been developed from the ground up to
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.680]   sport online I T training for both I T leaders and employees.

[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.360]   There's lots more rumors.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:42.960]   There's patents, you know,
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.800]   just I don't I don't want to get too much of the rumors.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.920]   Ming Chi quote talking about next year.
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:53.320]   An Apple headset with eye tracking.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.720]   Iris recognition.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.640]   Yeah, fine. We'll talk about.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.040]   He's just pangry into Alex at this point.
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:02.600]   I thought this was a funny story.
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:06.760]   Since the iPhone 12 mini didn't sell great.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:12.880]   According to supply chain sources, Apple is going to have to pay Samsung
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:21.200]   because the screens come from Samsung and they bought fewer than they agreed on number.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:27.400]   The penalty clause will be six hundred thirty eight million dollars.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.920]   Is that right? Yeah.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.560]   Wow.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.760]   Or is it six hundred thirty eight dollars?
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.960]   It's hard to tell.
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.960]   It looks like a typo on the other screens they buy.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:41.320]   If they over purchase on other ones, it might mitigate the under what happened was Apple
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:47.080]   said to Samsung, OK, but Samsung display, you got to build a factory.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:51.680]   It's exclusively making screens for the iPhone.
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:55.840]   And we're going to need a hundred million of them.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.520]   So the contract didn't materialize.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.800]   But as Samsung said, smartly wisely, if we're going to build a factory,
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.880]   it's going to be a penalty clause if you don't buy.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:07.200]   Yeah, much so.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:10.280]   That's kind of amazing because you have to imagine that at some point,
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:13.600]   but I'm a little sorry whenever you watch.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:17.960]   Oh, God, we wish we had the problem where we weren't selling as many as we would like
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.800]   because it would really make it.
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:25.400]   It's it's it's really it's it's kind of a breath of splash of cold water
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.720]   and a lot of people's faces, myself included, because how many times have we
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:34.480]   discussed how a smaller size phone is a gap in the market and that there there's a
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:37.600]   whole bunch of that there seems to be a whole bunch of people that would benefit
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.360]   from having smaller sized phones and the thing, oh, wow, that's great.
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:44.520]   That Apple is making a really, really high quality small phone, but oh, goodness,
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:48.360]   you don't get you don't get any clearer of an indication that there people just
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:52.000]   don't want an iPhone like that than the fact that.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.800]   Again, if they're if they're if they have to pay off a contract because they didn't
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.920]   buy as many as nearly as many as they thought they would, I guess that means
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.480]   that you're not going to be looking forward to a second generation piece of hardware.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.160]   Where are you? Yeah.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.680]   I think they're committed to the second generation one was the third one.
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:09.800]   I think now it's super into.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:12.080]   Do you think Apple make him any this year?
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:17.760]   iPhone 13, there's supposedly they they do those they work several years out,
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:19.960]   which is both an advantage and a disadvantage.
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:27.480]   That's where I mean the design work is a sunk cost, but you have to imagine that
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:31.480]   they're just going to that you have to imagine that, at least with this,
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:35.760]   I'm sorry, I'm thinking as I'm talking, which is not something that works out well for me.
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.920]   But yeah, it's it's oh, go ahead.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:40.240]   Why should you be any different for the rest of us?
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.360]   I'm not thinking at all.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.720]   I just don't think anything anything anything is better than dead air.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.840]   No, I was saying you have to you have to imagine.
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:51.800]   I I find it interesting to imagine what happens when you you're designing the second
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.240]   generation of this hardware and fully anticipating that the first generation will
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:59.040]   be a success and you get to use all the ideas that you weren't able to put into
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:03.360]   the first one and now the the brief comes down that we're we're committed to making
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.560]   a second generation.
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:08.400]   We've put too much money into the second generation to simply kill it.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:12.520]   However, that means that we need you to use a cheaper display.
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.720]   We need you to use cheaper manufacturing because we're basically going to be lucky
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.200]   to get in to sell our first run here.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:23.520]   So don't be super ambitious or are they going to simply say that, OK, if we get
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:27.520]   if there's no way there's going to be a none of the generation, then there's no way
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.520]   we can possibly fail.
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.520]   We may as well just go nuts with this one.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.480]   And with their cost also, I think was a big fact.
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.640]   Previously, it was hard to tell whether people wanted a cheap phone or a small
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:40.440]   phone and it successfully conflated those markets with the original SE.
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:44.240]   And now they have both the cheaper and the smaller, but also a bunch of things went
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.600]   wrong, like those Qualcomm boaters were really expensive and they couldn't get
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:52.200]   the GOE panels, which were basically Samsung panels that BOE decided to start
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.520]   making at a much lower price.
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:57.000]   So they had to go with LG or Samsung panels, which are much more expensive.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.200]   And I think that that mini at that price might have been the problem and if they
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:04.360]   can get it 50, 70 bucks lower without the carrier incentives or even with the carrier
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.160]   incentives, maybe it's got a chance.
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:10.240]   I don't I feel like the part of the problem is is the phone got so big that
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.800]   the phone is so close to the man that you're kind of like, well, you kind of want
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.880]   to go all the way up to a to an iPad.
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:19.840]   You know, I I bought a lot of minis, but I don't buy them anymore.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:24.560]   You know, the size isn't doesn't distinguish itself in the same way it used to.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.200]   We're talking about the phones.
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:27.640]   Not the iPad.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:29.280]   The iPad minis.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.560]   I do like those.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:33.440]   We're talking about the iPhone mini, which did not sell well.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.120]   I'm sorry to say I had a little I had an audio glitch and I got in the middle of it.
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.880]   You were thinking while talking.
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.000]   That was your mistake.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.600]   No, I was thinking while talking.
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.680]   I dare you.
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.680]   But you're running.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:45.920]   Renee is absolutely right, though.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:52.280]   The Samsung last week revealed the A 52, which is their best selling, which is
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:59.360]   their best selling phone and for a was going to afford a $400 US equivalent phone.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:03.720]   The stuff that is that used to be premium or even this year premium, this is this
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:07.520]   phone will have high refresh display either 90 or 120.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.320]   It's going to have under under display fingerprint.
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:13.840]   It's going to have a phone is going to have an earphone, Jack.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.760]   Sorry, you have to get it.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:17.680]   That's all about all but all modern radios.
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:21.200]   And so and meanwhile, we're thinking about, well, wouldn't be nice if the premier
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:24.640]   phone, the flagship iPhone has under the display fingerprint.
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:29.240]   So it must be really, really difficult now to if you're going to sell a phone
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:33.120]   for a certain price point and if you're good, if you're targeting it towards
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:36.280]   people who are very, very sensitive towards price, you're now competing with
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:42.480]   excellent phones from top tier manufacturers that have not not 2019 or 2020 features,
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.040]   but 2021 features.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:48.760]   Yeah, but do consider that this A 52, but the best selling Samsung phone is six
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:49.560]   and a half inches.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:50.400]   It's huge.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.440]   So true.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:53.720]   These are not these are not many phones either.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:58.080]   And I think the other reason the A 52 sells so well is because it's offered by
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.280]   carrier stores.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:19:59.480]   Right.
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:03.480]   And Samsung has very different price structures from Apple because both they
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:07.320]   met their their own manufacturer and they have huge businesses that subsidize their
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.480]   mobile business quite often.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.640]   It's a nice way.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:13.120]   Even if you don't even if you don't get the same.
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:17.880]   Even if you I guess the only thing is there are there's a market there for that
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:21.040]   for that because people want to stay in the ecosystem as well.
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:21.360]   Right.
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:24.480]   You know, like that's the problem that Apple has is that they are supplying the
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.280]   entire ecosystem.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.240]   And so you can't just leave that market behind.
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:27.920]   You really have to.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:30.800]   So even if it doesn't work, you almost have to keep on doing it.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:33.320]   I mean, I want to give my kids a less expensive or smaller phone.
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.360]   I don't necessarily want to give them an expensive one.
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:38.920]   So I think that Apple has to serve the market even if it they have to wonder,
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:42.960]   though, if Samsung do that with the Samsung makes like so many models.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.160]   Everybody knows about the Galaxy S and the note every quarter inch, but they make
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.000]   yeah, so many models.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.040]   And I think that's the philosophy exactly is we want to keep you in the Samsung
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:53.720]   ecosystem.
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:55.360]   So we're going to make a phone for every user.
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:58.800]   Well, I don't even know if it's as as important for Samsung to keep everybody
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:02.920]   in the ecosystem as it is for Apple because Apple's you know, it's an OS issue.
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:06.680]   You know, like, no, Samsung is kind of they see themselves as an ecosystem.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:09.400]   They customize it so much, right.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:13.800]   And they sell watches and other devices that go with the phone.
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:17.200]   And I feel like they really
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:23.280]   are the closest to Apple of all the Android manufacturers in terms of an ecosystem play.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.000]   I mean, even OnePlus has a watch now.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:25.840]   I mean, they're getting there.
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:26.680]   They're all working on it.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.120]   Oh, they announced it.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.280]   One plus announced the nine.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.520]   I think they did.
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:31.480]   Yeah, they did.
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:34.440]   It is it is with Apple slides and Apple website.
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:37.720]   It is so funny to watch, but it looks like an amazing phone.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:41.600]   Where is the is this at one plus?
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:45.120]   And the watch doesn't run Android where or where the sort of where OS is.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.120]   This is the website.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.040]   Oh, it does look like the Apple website.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:49.440]   Wow.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.240]   The slides they use with exact same ones with the little square boxes with all
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:52.960]   the little illustration.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.880]   It was like I was I did a double I literally did double take as I was watching it.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:59.360]   Well, it's an it's an homage.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:21:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:00.720]   Yes.
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:03.720]   It is, but that that goes to the basic point.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:08.160]   I mean, I think I've demonstrated over the years on the show that there are very
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:11.120]   few nerds with more more more.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:14.560]   It was paid more of a social and personal handicap for the intensity of his
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:17.440]   nerdy interested in technology than myself.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:24.040]   However, I did buy a three hundred fifty dollar baseline pixel for a thinking
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:27.520]   that was just going to be well, there are no there are no iPhones or Android
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:30.080]   phones that super excite me this year, but I do need to upgrade.
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:34.160]   This will tie me over until next year when I will buy either a new switch over
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:38.920]   the iPhone or find something else and I'm just I've not noticed any sort of a
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:43.560]   downgrade between this by the level of sophistication of what you can put into
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:50.440]   a cheap phone nowadays is so great that it becomes difficult to tell people why
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.120]   they would want to spend.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:55.160]   Why would they expect to spend eight hundred to nine hundred dollars on a phone
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:23:00.000]   when they can spend less than five hundred and get something that is half the
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:02.000]   price, but 90% as good.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.680]   You just have to figure out if that 10% is such a big deal for you that it's
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:07.960]   worth the extra money.
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:11.840]   So I'm looking at the one plus nine there.
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:15.520]   I mean, obviously that's got huge shutter lag on it and he's hoping to fix it.
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:19.280]   But basically it takes a picture shows a preview then the picture changes after
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.720]   the preview and he says we put it down to you.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:24.960]   So yeah, I've seen camera phones do that before.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.080]   That's really frustrating.
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:30.720]   They have they branded hostile blood, but that just shows you how little these
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.400]   brand names mean these days.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:36.800]   Yeah, I mean, how much did hostile blood have 150 million dollar thing over two
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:41.080]   years, but it sounds like this is the least of the the least of the actual branding
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:42.000]   is this year.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.320]   This is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 88, which is the newest snap dragon.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:53.920]   It comes with one plus buds, which looks so much like AirPods that the customs
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:24:01.000]   stopped and thinking they were they were Apple AirPods, you know, counterfeits.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.520]   And all of that eight gigs of RAM, 128 gig storage, 729.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:10.240]   So that's a pretty competitive price if you're if you're, you know, but but I
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:11.120]   think Alex, you nailed it.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.720]   Dual batteries for faster charging, which is an interesting idea.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:16.280]   You'll give up some capacity and you can charge in parallels.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.720]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.880]   But I think Alex, you're right.
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.280]   People people want to live in the ecosystem.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:25.600]   They're one plus users or they're Samsung users to their iPhone users.
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.320]   It's kind of hard.
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:30.240]   I mean, the problem is especially if you start with family, the family plan is
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:34.600]   the thing that really pulls you in because you have, you know, your kids and your
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:39.240]   wife and everybody else have have access to all these apps and and movies and all
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.280]   the other things that you have based on the family plan.
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:44.080]   And so you're it takes all the fun out of it.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.760]   You start getting outside the ecosystem.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:48.240]   So that's the that's the issue.
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:53.480]   The pro version is a little more expensive, 12 gigs of RAM, 256 gig storage,
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:55.440]   a thousand, sixty nine dollars.
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:56.720]   So that's a little bit less.
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:59.720]   That's more in the Apple range.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:01.880]   Why?
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:02.840]   That's it.
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:03.800]   Go ahead.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:05.480]   Oh, just very very quickly.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:09.920]   A lot of one of Apple's marketing problems is that a lot of the technology they put
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.440]   in isn't worthwhile as a bullet marketing point.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:15.000]   It's fit and feature and function sort of stuff.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.640]   Like you're talking about how there's a shutter lag.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.360]   The picture photography works kind of weird.
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:25.120]   So much of the hardware so much the over what seems to be over engineered CPUs
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.920]   and performance in there is just so that you tap the button, you immediately get
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:31.400]   a brilliant picture and there's no lag.
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.640]   There's no, oh, well, sorry.
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:33.400]   Why is it?
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:36.760]   Why is the screen black for half a second before it bounces back to the home
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:41.680]   screen, you touch a button, you get a brilliant picture and it's it's continually
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.280]   continuously hiding all of the muscle behind that screen that is making that
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:47.280]   simple thing happen.
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:53.520]   This is why, as as as Renee said, it's I think that the highlight of design is no
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:57.120]   longer going to be, oh, look how many megapixels this camera has or hey, look
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:01.320]   at the quality of the screen is going to be things like how can we change the way
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:06.640]   that this device charges so that it charges faster without the cost of fast
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:09.200]   charging? Hey, what if we do two batteries in parallel?
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:09.440]   Great.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.360]   It's kind of like that.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:11.320]   It's kind of wild.
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:12.840]   Yeah, kind of interesting.
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:18.840]   If you're an iOS developer, probably if you're a pro iOS developer, I don't
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:22.160]   need to warn you, but if you are maybe, and I think there are a lot of people
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:25.840]   learning to write iOS or you've got an app and you're doing it yourself, you
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.000]   should be aware attackers are going after you.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.960]   There's an open source project that's legit called tab bar interaction.
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:39.120]   You might think, oh, that'd be very useful for me in my iOS project, but it's
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:44.320]   forked and this is, you know, unfortunately easy to do with an open source
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.400]   repository.
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:50.720]   It's been forked and republished with a trojanized code library.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:54.840]   It attempts to install advanced surveillance malware
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:27:01.320]   on your Mac if you're an iOS developer because it's an Xcode project.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:07.240]   So it installs a custom version of egg shell, which is an open source
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:11.280]   connector that spies on users through their mic, camera and keyboard.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:14.320]   So just be aware.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.200]   I think this is true in general.
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:21.120]   If you're forking an open source repository or cloning it and using it, you
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:26.600]   might you might be extra careful because you don't know what you're getting.
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:30.680]   The only warning a developer would get after running the Xcode project would be
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:34.680]   something looking like this project is a workspace downloaded from the internet.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.720]   Are you sure you want to open it?
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:40.440]   So there's a little warning opening, building or running a project containing
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:43.280]   a malicious code can harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:47.600]   Be sure you trust the source of the project before opening it.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.920]   And then there's a trust and open button.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.920]   So be careful.
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:55.640]   Just a little bit of a warning.
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:59.200]   Tim Cook says we're coming home.
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.600]   Can't wait.
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:06.280]   Can't wait to say good morning to people as they walk in the door at the Apple
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:09.200]   campus. He told People magazine.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.560]   People exclusive.
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:14.080]   Tim's really sexy a CEO of the year.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.480]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:21.040]   He anticipates Apple implementing a hybrid environment for employees in the coming
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.440]   months.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:23.800]   And what is people?
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.680]   Why are you putting little emojis on Tim Cook?
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:28.080]   Knock it off.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:34.280]   So my gut says he says for us, it's still very important to physically be in
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:37.920]   the future with one another because collaboration isn't always a planned
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:42.280]   activity. Steve Jobs always said that it's a bumping into each other over the
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:45.200]   course of the day and advancing an idea you just had and you really need to be
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.920]   together to do that.
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:53.640]   So no hard date, but we're starting to see more and more companies say,
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:55.000]   yep, you're coming home.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.280]   One of the challenges is going to be with everyone who built open offices.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.040]   It's just how do you manage that?
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:01.440]   Yeah.
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:04.000]   You know, like it's pretty big cluster.
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:07.760]   Well, and yeah, the Apple campus is open big time.
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:08.840]   Well, the main one.
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:13.840]   I mean, there's there was, yeah, yeah, the main the main ones open, but not all of
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:14.320]   them are open.
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:18.600]   Cooks when asked about that said we're still figuring that out to be honest with
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:18.960]   you.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:22.760]   Put up plastic barriers in that beautiful open space.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:23.320]   I don't know.
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:24.880]   Those little teller windows, they had it.
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:25.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:31.520]   Although got to point out and people magazine does point this out.
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:33.960]   It's done all right in the quarantine.
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:38.440]   They managed to come up with a whole new processor platform for their max.
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:40.680]   And they did that hundred million
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:44.840]   industrial justice initiative and they pledged to be carbon neutral.
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.080]   There's a lot of it.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:46.960]   They kept busy.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:50.440]   Cook said we did all that while reinventing the way we were working.
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:55.000]   We were we were very much an in person team because we believe that's best for
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:55.680]   collaboration.
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:59.520]   We knew that was no longer possible or not possible for this period of time.
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:05.080]   We had to reinvent ourselves and I really give the team credit for rising to the
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:05.720]   occasion.
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:11.160]   I think what will be interesting is as the other companies don't do that, whether
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:15.920]   it becomes harder to to compete for programmers and so on and so forth when
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:19.680]   people are like, well, I can just live anywhere, you know, making that salary.
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:22.840]   And I don't have to be in Silicon Valley to do that.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:25.920]   You know, or you know, I think that's going to be a challenge, not in the short
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:29.960]   term, but it's an awful lot of people moving out of the that that were that are
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:34.720]   still working at Google and Facebook and other things like that and taking advantage
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:41.280]   of the fact that they're not going to be forced to come back to to relocate and
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:44.640]   chances of them wanting to come back to California pretty low.
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:48.160]   I kind of wish I could play this from People magazine, but they'll probably take
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:54.120]   it down, but they did two minute like rapid fire questions.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:59.320]   I guess via I messages, what time do you get up in the morning?
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.280]   Four AM.
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.840]   Tim, go back to bed.
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:04.160]   What time do you go to sleep?
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:08.080]   I go to bed at night somewhere around nine thirty.
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:10.280]   Wow, he does not sleep enough.
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.560]   Nine thirty to four AM.
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:12.920]   Time does he go to sleep?
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.280]   Ah, yes, that's right.
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:16.480]   What's the first app you open?
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:18.920]   And of course, people is on there and so I get to go.
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:20.560]   Oh, come on, Tim.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.920]   You don't have to kiss their butts.
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:26.480]   They're happy to have you hand over your phone right now.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.560]   Show me the book.
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:29.160]   He says he opens people.
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:32.560]   He says he can't live without coffee.
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:38.200]   Coffee and Apple Watch.
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:40.440]   Last TV show you binge.
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:44.720]   That last of 10 last of course is going to be an Apple TV plus.
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.240]   Yeah, it's so optimistic.
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:47.840]   Well, I can see Tim watching that.
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:50.200]   Who's your favorite artist?
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:51.280]   If he says people.
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:54.840]   I said who?
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:57.160]   Cosama strength training.
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:00.480]   You like strength training.
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:01.400]   All right.
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:02.680]   Anyway, I'll let you watch the rest.
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:04.880]   I don't want to I don't want to get taken down by people.
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:07.720]   There's lots more juicy tidbits.
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:10.000]   People.com.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.400]   I plugged I want to reverse a plug I made.
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.880]   It's like Twitter on edit button.
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:18.240]   I wish there were an edit button.
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:21.560]   So David Dobrik's this bow, which was a photo sharing app.
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:22.840]   Yeah.
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:32.080]   Recent investigations by business insider about sexual assault with Dobrik's vlog squad.
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:35.200]   A number of early investors have pulled out.
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:39.880]   Spark Capital has severed all ties with this bow.
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:45.560]   Apparently Dobrik has left as well.
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:49.720]   So I'm sorry.
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:51.680]   I had no idea.
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:52.800]   I didn't and I plugged it.
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.560]   The truth is it was kind of dopey and I stopped using it anyway.
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:56.840]   So there.
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:57.960]   So there.
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:01.440]   I didn't know what it was until until it was evidently dead.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:03.200]   It's the whole party.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:05.720]   Yeah, you missed the whole party.
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:08.920]   It's been a it's been a kind of a
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:14.240]   nasty situation for the vlog squad.
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:19.400]   Goldman Sachs cleared of bias.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:24.960]   New York State review of Apple card department found no fair lending violations.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:28.840]   I think this was this goes back to David Heinemayer Hanson DHS.
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.400]   Yeah, he is so quick to get angry on Twitter.
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:32.080]   Yeah, same.
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:36.040]   My wife got a different credit limit than I did.
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:37.720]   But he does no due diligence first.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:41.240]   He just goes right to Twitter in like the angriest way possible about everything.
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:44.600]   I'm sorry that the New York State Department of Financial Services has to
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:49.600]   investigate tweets, but I guess that's the world we live in now.
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:50.920]   The viral tweets.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.520]   I feel like I'm the review.
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:55.200]   I don't like the way he does it, but I'm happy that people investigate this
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:56.520]   up because it's important stuff.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:00.240]   It's just the methods are often good.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:03.040]   Ever came out of Twitter anyway, I think that it is good.
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:04.680]   They investigated it and you know what?
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:09.000]   Yes, they're completely equitable according to the investigation.
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:12.800]   I think the rush to have opinions about this stuff and throw up on Twitter and
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:16.880]   then which also accelerates the rush for the press to say stuff about it,
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:18.600]   creates an environment that makes it hard.
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:21.600]   I mean, I think it's part of what undermines people believing anything.
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:22.040]   Yep.
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:24.400]   You know, because it's completely great.
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:25.240]   It gets thrown out.
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.400]   I saw it in Twitter, man.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:27.240]   It's got to be true.
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:29.320]   Well, that's why Craig Mason famously left Twitter.
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:32.880]   He said that if he felt compelled to have an opinion instantly about everything
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.960]   regardless of how little he knew about it, it was just like a social compulsion.
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:36.880]   That's our job.
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:38.040]   We're the pundits.
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.600]   Keep that in mind.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:43.160]   We're going to be wrong information.
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:46.000]   If anybody's going to give you bad information, it's us.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:46.920]   That's our job.
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:50.240]   Think without speaking or speak without thinking it's us.
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.680]   We're trained in that.
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:56.760]   Niantic has got a new augmented reality program.
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:00.240]   They're partnering with Nintendo on, I don't know, but maybe you know what
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:03.440]   Pikmin R Renee, what are Pikmin?
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.640]   I don't.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:05.640]   I must be so out of it.
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:09.320]   Pokemon are trendy and hip to me, and I'm sure this is like everyone's going,
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:10.400]   "You don't know what this is.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.480]   You people are so old, but I really don't."
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:14.240]   It looks very similar.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.000]   The app is being developed in the year Niantic's Tokyo office.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.040]   We'll launch later this year.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:22.480]   We'll include gameplay activities to encourage walking.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:23.960]   It's back, boys and girls.
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:28.400]   You can leave the house now and make walking more delightful.
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:33.640]   I have to say Pokemon Go was made more delightful by the fact that we could play it at home.
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:35.120]   Don't you agree, Renee?
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:38.680]   Just the raid passes and all that.
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:41.080]   Yeah, I have quite a bit of a lot of stuff.
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:43.280]   I feel like they've been doing lately is incredibly tedious.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.880]   It's like endurance test.
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:47.840]   It's like read the dictionary.
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:50.400]   Do 300 excellent throws or something.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.000]   They're trying to find a way to level people up.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.360]   When they increase the level from 40, they want to make it really hard.
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.600]   Lisa, I don't play it anymore. Lisa complains.
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:01.040]   But the hardness is tedium.
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:02.480]   It's not actual skill.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.280]   It's just doing it 500 times.
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:07.760]   Yeah, a lot of people still, I guess they're still making a lot of money.
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.240]   I'm assuming a lot of people are still playing it.
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:10.400]   Oh, God, yes.
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:12.320]   I played it for a couple of months.
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:13.600]   And then I was like, OK, this is great.
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:14.800]   And then I went on to something else.
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:18.200]   I kind of lost interest, but.
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:23.440]   You know, Lisa, it's one of her favorite games and she still she because of it,
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.000]   we still go for a walk.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.600]   She goes for a walk twice a day because she needs to go out searching,
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:32.320]   spin things and fight battles and stuff.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:34.280]   Here's Pikmin, or Pikmin.
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:36.360]   I don't know how you pronounce it, Pikmin 3.
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:41.400]   There are little things that live in the woods or whatever.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:42.960]   But I'm the last person that just
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:46.040]   they are adorable. They are kind of adorbs.
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:49.400]   This is a Nintendo switch game.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:54.560]   And then you're collecting berries and stuff.
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:55.920]   I think a lot of games,
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:58.000]   well, not hard for them, but they haven't had another success.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.880]   Harry Potter game didn't do anywhere.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:00.640]   It was not great.
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:04.200]   And that was the grind that you talk about that was really it just was
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.280]   a lot of grinding.
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:08.480]   And this looks like fun.
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:10.640]   Pikmin look, I don't know.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:14.360]   This feels reminiscent of something maybe
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:16.840]   the nerds still playing.
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:18.920]   Yeah, people still playing ingress.
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:21.680]   That's the original night, the nerds like the hardcore Android nerds are playing
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.200]   ingress, still, yeah.
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:27.760]   So you go by the post office and it's still got it.
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:31.680]   All the modifiers on the guns.
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:38.000]   Tim Cook has written a op ed for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.640]   Do you think Tim writes these or do you think he has people?
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:42.640]   I think he writes them.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:43.720]   I don't know about that.
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:44.840]   I think it was pay wall, though.
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:48.640]   Wasn't it? People were complaining that it was it was an op ed about it.
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:50.960]   Like I don't know why you wouldn't pay
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:53.080]   $149 a year for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:56.040]   Doesn't everybody 40 bucks a month?
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.680]   Yeah, well, it's just you know, that's what you get.
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:01.840]   If you don't buy the money, how do you know
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:02.920]   what's going on?
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:08.320]   Yeah, when the when the when the when the the the the piece went up, I had to say
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.040]   I am I contain multitudes.
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:16.080]   I can both praise him for writing this piece that talks about the inequities of
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:19.960]   racial injustice and economic factors that divide us as a society while also
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:23.240]   pointing out that you need to either pay for $40 a month subscription to the Wall
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:26.960]   Street Journal or 10 bucks a month to Apple News Plus to be able to read it at all.
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:30.160]   I don't understand why you wouldn't have a subscription.
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:31.960]   Yeah, it's a very good website.
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:34.960]   If they had their own blog, then he could just simply post it for free.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.320]   Well, I guess they didn't do that well that year.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:43.520]   But on the upside, they do get the special Wall Street Journal dot portrait of Tim
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.240]   Koch.
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:45.600]   But now he's got it.
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.560]   It's done.
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:49.040]   It's like it's it's been done like he owns it now.
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:52.240]   Oh, man, I want I came this close to having one.
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:53.600]   They were preparing an article.
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.320]   And a stern doesn't even use hers anymore.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.960]   I guess it's like a fleeting.
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:01.720]   This close, they were going to do it on me and they were and they got they asked
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:06.640]   for a picture so they could make this thing these very famous dot portraits,
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.680]   but they probably do it in an app Leo and like face app probably does it or
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:10.520]   something.
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:11.880]   I did I did do it in that.
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:16.360]   But I like to Photoshop filters like a trace contour and I don't like how it came out.
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:18.360]   After.
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.120]   Maybe somebody will do it.
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:23.760]   Yeah, Alex, I'm sure it was a pixel core class back in the day.
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:25.200]   Look at the you know, a lot of those.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:26.960]   I don't know what they're they're different now.
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:28.360]   The Wall Street Journal ones are different now.
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:30.760]   They used to be done by hand like they looked like there.
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:31.080]   Yeah.
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:33.240]   And then now they're doing shading and stuff filter.
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:34.240]   Yeah, some filter.
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:35.880]   Here's here's some other ones.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.160]   Here's Naomi.
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:38.400]   So I'm a tap chat filter.
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:39.960]   Tom Hanks.
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:41.640]   I miss the old ones, the little dog.
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:42.600]   Little more shaded.
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:43.000]   I lied.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.920]   You should be done with India, Inc.
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:50.080]   And a fine point pen painstakingly over many hours.
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:53.640]   Yeah, I think I think that that handcrafted look still looks better.
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:55.880]   Yeah, by Bill Waters and he should be doing it for you.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:56.920]   Yes.
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:58.920]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:05.120]   Come back your picks of the week, gentlemen, if you shall, if you will, prepare them.
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:06.400]   We would appreciate it.
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.480]   Our show today brought to you by Udacity.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:10.280]   You are smart people.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:15.320]   I know that you are a brilliant tech person because you watch this show.
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:19.120]   You have great taste and perspicacity.
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:25.440]   Perhaps you'd like to get a job at one of those big companies like Microsoft or IBM
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:29.880]   Google or Amazon, a tech job, Udacity.
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:34.280]   It's a unique online educational offering designed to bridge the gap
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:40.120]   between what you learn in school and the information you need to get a great job.
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:43.840]   In your career, you're going to learn employable
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:47.360]   skills and we know that because they work with industry leaders and experts who
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:52.880]   understand those what skills are most applicable in the job market today.
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:56.720]   Once you enroll as a student in a specific course, you can watch the course.
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:57.560]   They've got videos.
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:01.960]   They're great, but I find and I think this is one of the things that makes you
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:05.400]   dacity great, just watching them doesn't get you all the way there.
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.480]   You also need to apply what you learn.
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:13.400]   And that's why Udacity includes in the course a series of projects that you will
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:14.080]   complete.
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:16.200]   They will be judged by humans.
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:20.840]   You get human help to all the projects reviewed by qualified professionals.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:26.240]   You get real human helped personalized code reviews and access to qualified mentors.
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:28.320]   24/7.
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:30.720]   There are lots of great free courses too on Udacity.
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:33.760]   I want to point out you should check those out if you're interested.
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:35.320]   You'll learn how to network.
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:38.480]   They've got courses on that, how to get notice, how to land the job you want.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:42.680]   But the nano degrees are really the most amazing thing.
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:49.200]   Consumer and for business clients after after you get these degrees, you are
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:51.640]   highly desirable in the job market.
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:54.000]   The top 10 include data analyst.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.200]   Very big right now program for data science with Python.
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:00.920]   Actually, that's what I'm thinking of taking.
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:02.320]   I did their Python course.
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:05.240]   It was fantastic digital marketing.
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:10.360]   Programs are prepared and created with the help of companies like IBM and Microsoft
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:13.200]   and Google and Amazon people from all over the world.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:18.600]   Usually, it's one of the reasons this kind of always opened 24/7 because not only
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:22.400]   people all over the world, but we know that you might be taking these classes.
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:25.240]   You have a day job and taking the classes at night.
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:30.160]   They can help you with that AI cloud computing data science, autonomous systems.
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:35.200]   Want to learn to create self-driving vehicles programming and development,
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.880]   product management, digital marketing, all the tech adjacent roles as well.

[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:47.360]   Right now, they're working with the Blacks and Technology Foundation.
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:52.000]   They've partnered to provide 1000 free scholarships to help increase
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000]   educational and professional opportunities for the Black community.

[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:57.440]   Alex, Lindsey, I want to start with you today because I know you're going to
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:58.680]   cost me some big bucks.
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:43:59.840]   So I want to...
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:00.440]   Not expensive.
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:02.960]   Well, so it's indirectly expensive.
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:08.760]   So this is a we had Don Kamarachka on office hours.
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:10.280]   Oh, I know who he is.
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:10.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:13.320]   So he came on office hours on Monday and just blew us away.
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:16.800]   So we were just like, we're all getting ready to buy this book.
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:19.000]   And I just thought I'd put it out there to keep your eye on it.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.440]   I think it's I think you can get you might be able to preorder the ebook version.
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:26.120]   But while it was hot to look at, I want people to see it.
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:30.680]   This is on macro photography and he is serious.
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:35.760]   So he's a serious, really, really and just a great thinker about this.
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:37.360]   And just really impressed.
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:40.800]   And he showed a couple pieces of some of the imagery from the book.
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:43.320]   And one of the things we were talking about is stereoscopic 3D
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:47.160]   photography, which is really, really interesting.
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:50.520]   And there's a there's a section in this book about it.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:55.720]   But there's just tons of macro photography and it's a very technical task,
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:58.760]   but not particularly expensive if you already have a phone.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:00.840]   I mean, not a phone, but a camera.
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:03.880]   So if you have a good camera, you just need.
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:07.720]   I mean, there's a wide variety of them, but but a little bit of macro hardware
[01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:10.920]   to start taking some really great photos and you can even take them handheld.
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:14.080]   But there's a lot of skill in lighting and focus.
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:15.080]   And thinking about it.
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:19.280]   And it's one of those things is because it's technical, it's not something you normally
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.160]   you would just say, just go out, take a lot of photos and you can kind of learn it.
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:27.120]   This is there is just tons and tons and tons of tricks on how do you how do you get this out?
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:28.680]   How do you make it work?
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:33.800]   And I think that he is what he showed us on Monday and it's on YouTube.
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:35.920]   So you can check it out on YouTube on on office hours.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:40.800]   But but it just looks I mean, the stuff he's been doing is just amazing.
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.520]   And he's really cool, dug deep.
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:47.280]   And the work is, you know, really, really amazing.
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:51.200]   So so I would, you know, but but breaking it down, if you're interested in it,
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:55.640]   I just think it's gorgeous work, like just just something really pretty to look at.
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:46:00.000]   And anyway, so it's it's really taken in this this level.
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.440]   Like if you see that's a stereo and I have.
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:05.880]   Oh, you need some sort of weighted view at the for that one. Yeah.
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:08.640]   Well, actually, he he actually sent this to me a while ago.
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:12.640]   I think last year and this is like old old fashioned.
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:13.880]   Yeah, look at this.
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:15.240]   It's got little cards on the front.
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:15.880]   I love it.
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:16.840]   And this is a little bee.
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:21.360]   I think that they went past to be there, but but you literally just look in here and it's it is 3D.
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:24.880]   Like it's a 3D it's like 3D circa 1880.
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:29.560]   I guess they and these are about a hundred years old and they they
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:31.960]   you can buy them on Etsy, I think.
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:34.600]   But he says it's not an art book.
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:40.400]   It's a how to book macro photography, the universe at our feet.
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:45.800]   It is pre-order right now, but it's the PDF version is very affordable, 27 bucks.
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:47.720]   So that's a good deal if you pre-order.
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:52.080]   And and and you know, and that's what you want is I mean, the pictures in it are gorgeous,
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:57.160]   but the but really then with macro photography, you have to have the nuts and
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:00.920]   bolts and nuts and bolts are everything because it's just it is complicated and
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:03.120]   technical to do, but very, very interesting.
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:04.880]   Yeah, he's got a whole bunch of us thinking about it.
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:07.040]   It seems like the book on macro photography.
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:08.240]   Wow, I think so.
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:09.640]   Don Camarraschka.
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:11.960]   Nice, nice.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:15.800]   Good pick and it'll be expensive once you have the book because I'm already buying
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:17.360]   like looking at the extra.
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:21.520]   I hear the more lights and my credit card in a box.
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:23.480]   I'm going to get an infrared thing.
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:24.920]   Yeah.
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:33.240]   The office hours, you can join them by going to bit late slash T H E O F F
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:39.440]   I C E H O U R S capitalizing each individual, the first letter, each individual word,
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:45.200]   but no spaces or just go to YouTube.com/allike, Lindsey, Alex Lindsey and see what
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:49.640]   they do and then you can the invites are birthdays tomorrow, not birthday.
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:51.600]   They've been doing this a year.
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:55.440]   Three hundred and sixty five, the three hundred and sixty fifth one in a row is
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:56.000]   tomorrow.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.520]   So it's amazing.
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:02.440]   24 seven, three sixty five, ladies and gentlemen, the hardest work.
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:03.480]   Yes, I know.
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.680]   That's amazing.
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:05.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:09.000]   So I don't think I don't think I brushed my teeth three hundred and sixty five days.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.160]   There's a straight day.
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:12.160]   Alex, my streamers feel lazy.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:14.880]   He hasn't missed an episode.
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:15.680]   Unbelievable.
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:19.320]   I missed an episode here and there, but but the but the team has not missed an episode.
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:24.840]   I've missed about four or five due to production, but the I mean, 10 or something
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:29.560]   like that, but but the but yeah, the the the the the group has met every single day.
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:35.080]   Our three hundred and sixty fifth day is tomorrow and we're going to just celebrate
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:38.880]   it by just talking about what happened over the last, you know, from the first day
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:42.160]   one, a must view episode.
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:42.960]   It should be fun.
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:45.560]   I mean, it'll be it won't be probably as technical.
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:47.000]   It'll be more philosophical.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.560]   I think tomorrow.
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:55.800]   Office hours, a l e x l i n d s a y is how Alex spells his name.
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:59.720]   And if you go to his YouTube channel, you'll see they record only a portion
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:01.080]   of it, but you'll see those.
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:02.080]   Yes, it's.
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:03.480]   And it's you to run out of space.
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:07.640]   Yes, there's I mean, we had we were I mean, like we we had
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:12.360]   Don Don was on on Monday talking about stereo stereoscopic photography.
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:16.320]   And then we today we were talking about isolating locations for audio.
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:18.840]   So how to isolate for audio tomorrow.
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:23.000]   We have our little thing on Thursday.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.840]   We have Chris Meyer talking about modular since Friday.
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:30.840]   We're talking about building streaming capacity in AWS.
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:33.320]   And then Friday, we talk about education resolve.
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:35.480]   So it's busy every week.
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:39.880]   Did you make a deal with Zoom to have their big Zoom logo in the lower right there?
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:41.760]   No, that's just what happens when you stream from Zoom.
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:43.080]   That's the deal you make.
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:45.480]   So that's the deal.
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:45.920]   Yeah.
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:50.360]   So what I'm I'm because we're using Zoom with you now.
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:51.640]   I want to use them more.
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:53.800]   You convinced me it's the right way to go.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:58.360]   It's well, especially now that they've opened up the API for being able to use
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:49:59.760]   the infrastructure, right?
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:01.960]   It's going to be a lot that just happened today.
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:03.240]   So that's exciting.
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:03.760]   Yeah.
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:08.800]   So, you know, people like us can build tools that will let us customize.
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:13.240]   You can imagine what we're looking at or what would it take us to build a tool
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:17.160]   so that instead of just using Zoom, you could be using the Twit version of Zoom
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:20.280]   that does all the things you want it to do for them, you know, for back and forth.
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:23.960]   So you can tell Emory Wells that somebody
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:25.400]   called the radio show the other day.
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:29.280]   He works in Hollywood of doing movies.
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:31.680]   Of course, radio shows on in LA and on other places.
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:35.680]   And he called and said, Hey, if you heard about Frame.io, it's really amazing.
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:36.960]   Everybody's using it now.
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:39.760]   And I said, no, tell me all about it.
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:41.360]   I pretended I didn't know.
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:44.440]   But the words getting out on Frame.io.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.880]   It's tons of youtubers use it.
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:46.600]   Yeah.
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:48.080]   It's amazing.
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:52.200]   I mean, we we run our all of our post production in Frame.io.
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:53.120]   That's saying a lot.
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:56.440]   That means that's amazing because that means you're using the cloud.
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:57.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:00.120]   We just because it's so it just we just put everything up into the folder
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:02.360]   and then and then everyone starts pulling stuff out and working on it.
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.920]   And all the reviews go to the client that way and everything.
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:05.840]   Everything's delivered.
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:06.640]   It's really great.
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:07.520]   Amazing.
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:10.680]   Andy and I go pick of the week, my friend.
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:14.320]   My pick is a really great app that I've kind I didn't know I was looking for
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:19.800]   for a long time, but I turns out that I have it's called keypad and it is all it does
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:25.400]   it turns your desktop back into a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard for any Bluetooth device,
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:27.840]   what mouse or keyboard exactly.
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:29.040]   How can it do that?
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:30.120]   That's amazing.
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:31.280]   Elf in magic.
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:34.080]   And somehow this is actually legal according to the app store.
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:37.360]   This is not like some sort of like a Mac hack sort of sort of thing.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:39.440]   You've installed this very, very simple app.
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:41.440]   All you have to do it's just an app.
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:43.920]   It's not like a it's not like extension or anything like that.
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:47.600]   All you have to do on your Mac is make it discoverable, obviously.
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:51.680]   And then from that point after you get this nice little you get this nice little
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:56.800]   menu let in your menu bar and whatever device it is, whether it's an iPad,
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:00.600]   whether it's an iPhone, another computer, an Android phone, an Android tablet,
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:03.880]   whatever, you just simply look for people on that device.
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:04.680]   You're doing this.
[01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:09.120]   You just I've been using synergy to try to control a Linux computer next to my
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:12.120]   iMac and it's you know, it's funky and stuff.
[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:13.480]   This just do Bluetooth.
[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:14.760]   The computer supports Bluetooth.
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:18.320]   Now this is it's is it easy to switch from one to the other?
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:19.440]   Very, very easy.
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:24.080]   It supports the free version supports only one connection at a time and does
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:26.560]   and only gives you a two week trial for the mouse support.
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:30.800]   However, once you spend now brace yourself
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:38.480]   $2.99, I will I will lend it to you if you need you need the money for $2.99.
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:41.040]   You can you can have multiple devices and mouse support.
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:45.560]   So at that point, all the devices that you've that you've ever like set up for
[01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:48.520]   this are this there inside the little menu let.
[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:51.560]   So now I can simply select pixel for a
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:55.680]   but they my phone and now be connected to it or you can you can create a hot
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:53:00.520]   key and when the connection is is active is also a tiny, tiny little like
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:03.400]   little window that also has like media controls on it.
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:05.840]   So you can start stop playback, do stuff like that.
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:09.600]   Even the keyboard stuff even works with like taking pictures like the
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:15.480]   Vish camera shutter shortcut and for the the only slightly tricky thing out
[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:21.720]   of necessity is for the mouse to work, you have to just tap control and alt and
[01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:26.040]   that will simply remove that will move move your move your mouse pointer,
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:30.040]   so to speak, control from your Mac to this whatever extra device it is.
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:31.960]   But it's but it's also very, very easy.
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:36.200]   But again, the same key switch will turn it back off again and I've I've been
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:40.040]   working for about a week. I have not it just works exactly the way that you would
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:43.960]   hope a sort of there's no must, there's no fuss, there's not OK, but there's no
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:47.680]   point in which I had to restart or anything because I needed to get keyboard
[01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:50.320]   control back to the Mac and it didn't work.
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:53.040]   It just works flawlessly and wonderfully.
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:58.960]   So the big need I had for it is that on my on the on the mystery, like actual
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:03.760]   actual writing table behind the mystery screen, I have like two or three different
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:07.720]   computers and two or three different operating systems and you can buy a KVM
[01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:11.040]   switch, which is hardware that does that kind of a thing.
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:13.840]   But it's just for three bucks for what I want to do.
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:19.600]   Not for three bucks and it's never I'm I'm I'm working on three things simultaneously.
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:23.320]   It's always something like I'm doing like a I'm ripping a Bluetooth.
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:27.360]   Excuse me, I'm whipping a ripping a Blu-ray on one machine and now all I need to do
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:28.720]   is click on OK, that's right.
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:32.760]   Now, please transcode this in in the in a transcode or app.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:37.200]   So that's not worth having a $200 device or an extra keyboard and mouse.
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:39.840]   But this one I just again, click the hotkey.
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:44.240]   I'm suddenly connected to the Mac mini instead of the Mac book and I'm off
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:46.080]   and running that I can click right back in again.
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:47.320]   Can't recommend it highly enough.
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:50.600]   It works beautifully and it's only it's only about a year old.
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:51.600]   You might have heard of it.
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:56.400]   There was a Bluetooth problem, Bluetooth bug in the apps, excuse me, in the
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:00.000]   in Mac OS earlier versions that made this kind of stop working.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.360]   But that's all solved.
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:04.840]   And as I said, I can't think of anything to complain about.
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:08.200]   The only really the only thing the only complaint I want to make is that I
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:11.560]   wish there were another button saying that God, two ninety nine is not enough money.
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:14.840]   Please have another 10 bucks because it just works beautifully.
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:17.840]   It's a simple idea, but I can really see the utility.
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:22.440]   Bluetooth dash keyboard.com.
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.440]   It's in the and does and does take you to the app store.
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:25.960]   So it's not as though you're sideloading something.
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:27.280]   Yeah, very nice.
[01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:34.160]   Good pick and I go when I'll be on WGBH next Thursday at one PM.
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:35.200]   It is pledge week.
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:39.240]   So if you tune in early, you might be reminded of how valuable
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:41.000]   broadcast you in your life.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.520]   GPH and Boston's worth every day.
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:47.960]   It helps keep me helps keep me in like lint rollers for the dark clothing that I
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:49.280]   tend to favor on air.
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:52.920]   So help keep Andy and lint rollers.
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:54.680]   WGBH news.org.
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:56.640]   You can listen to it live or later.
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:57.520]   Thanks, Andy.
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:55:59.960]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:03.120]   So I have an oddball one this week, but it's something that I spent a lot of time
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:06.960]   looking through and I really enjoyed and I I love the idea of media awareness.
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:11.960]   So this is the new ish YouTube channel by Hayden Hillier Smith, who is not well
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:16.400]   known on his own, but he edits some of the biggest YouTube channels in the business,
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:20.080]   like YouTube channels with tens of millions of subscribers and famously will
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:23.880]   take seven hours of their footage and every day and turn it into like a six or
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:26.320]   seven minute video for their channel.
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:31.560]   And he in the first few videos, he breaks down what makes a YouTube video and it's
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:34.840]   not like editing like you see some final cut windows, but he never talks about
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:35.760]   the mechanics of editing.
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:40.120]   It is purely the psychology of editing and it's all based around earning
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:41.080]   consideration.
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:45.440]   So like he points out early that people will watch a 60 second TikTok, but then
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:49.360]   also pay attention to a three hour podcast and it's about earning people's
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:52.560]   attention every second, every moment of the video.
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:55.400]   So he goes through and he breaks down like a Mr.
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:57:00.560]   Beast video and a slow mo guys video and a
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:04.960]   Logan Paul video, all these different videos and shows how when you click that
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:07.960]   button, they instantly give you something like it's not like an episode of
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:08.920]   Survivor when Mr.
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:12.560]   Beast buys an island and says the person who stays on at the longest is going to win
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:15.560]   it the minute you click that button, somebody's being thrown off immediately.
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:19.520]   So you're you're propelled into the story and then how the how they
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:25.160]   change pace, change views, change rhythm, how they speed up to give you
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:26.880]   gratification and then create care.
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:31.800]   It's a whole bunch of really psychology of editing stuff and I spent a long time
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:32.320]   looking at it.
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:34.760]   I found it endlessly fascinating.
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:36.040]   He does some mainstream stuff too.
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:39.960]   Like he talks about Mandalorian always stopping action sequences, a few frames
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:45.160]   early to sort of keep the pace going really fast or like how tenant kept talking
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:48.840]   about people are shooting us, but never bothered to show you who we should get
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:50.600]   somebody at any given time.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:54.960]   And the whole thing is to me, it was endlessly fascinating about how YouTube
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:59.360]   is developing or I guess your online video is developing its own language in
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:00.120]   terms of editing.
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:03.160]   So I like it because I agree with you.
[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:07.440]   I'm not going to ever edit another thing in my life, God willing, but because
[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:12.600]   it's the worst, most tedious work ever, but it's good for media literacy to
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:15.600]   understand what's going on and why some things work and why things,
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:18.520]   what they're doing to get your attention.
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:19.680]   I think this is looks great.
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:20.600]   I will be watching.
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:22.760]   It's really like he didn't do this video, but I saw someone else do it.
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:25.600]   It was really interesting because when they moved, we had I talked with this
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:29.480]   on a previous show, but when they moved some videos, some movies onto streaming
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:31.000]   services, they don't work.
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.120]   There's this statistic called retention.
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:35.240]   There's a few things you care about an online video.
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:38.360]   One is click through rate, how many people see your post or a thumbnail and
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:39.440]   actually will click on it.
[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:44.600]   Then there's average view percentage, which is how much of your video or your
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:45.800]   show that you watch.
[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:49.920]   And for you to resist a lot, like if someone drops off in the first 10 seconds,
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:54.400]   it's terrible, you want them like good is around 50, pretty good is around 60.
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:59:00.120]   A very, very few people can get up to like 70, 75, which is astonishing for
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:03.920]   YouTube, but some movies when they move them over and people watch them on
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:06.920]   streaming before you were captured in the theater, you went to the movie,
[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:08.760]   you paid your money, there was no way you were leaving.
[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:11.920]   So they could do these long character arcs where like the bad person gets
[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:15.320]   themed. Now they're finding on streaming services, people just, oh, I don't like
[01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:19.240]   him. And they just click out immediately and they have no time to earn the stories.
[01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:22.800]   They have to change the opening sequence to like hint at what's going to happen
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:26.840]   later on in the movie, just so that you'll you'll invest the time to actually see it.
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:29.160]   And I find all that psychology again, endlessly fast.
[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:30.480]   I do. I find it very interesting.
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:31.680]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:33.400]   It's editing's hard work.
[01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:34.600]   Geez.
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:36.000]   I can't stand it.
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.200]   I keep I keep wanting to get into street again into video, but I and I'll
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:41.840]   get it and I will shoot it. Yeah.
[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:44.920]   And I'll they'll give they'll take me three or four hours, but the editing, I just
[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:46.440]   get stuck for days and days and days.
[01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:50.400]   I have so much admiration for Renee and others that have just part of that daily
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:54.440]   workflow, just sitting down and watching the same bloated footage and the same
[01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:57.280]   bloated personality in my case over and over again.
[01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:58.280]   Oh, I'm totally with you.
[01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:03.320]   I foolishly years ago, because I had done, you know, I had to sit in a lot of
[02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:06.680]   sweets with an edge and an avid system.
[02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:10.320]   And I said years ago, nobody will ever know no end user will ever want to edit
[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:13.400]   video. It's just too painful and time consuming.
[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:14.800]   Boy, was I wrong.
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:16.640]   In fact, it was weird this week.
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:20.560]   People like brilliant editors, young guy, right?
[02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:21.320]   What was weird?
[02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:26.160]   Yeah, and every day hours a day, but I started a TikTok this week and I wanted
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:29.760]   to cross post Instagram reels and I didn't realize Instagram reels is only 30
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:33.680]   seconds. So I had to quickly read everything to fit in.
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:35.600]   So I got to make it a long short.
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:37.360]   Is that what you did?
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:38.560]   No, I bet it make it shorter.
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:40.120]   Because TikTok was up to a minute.
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:42.800]   So do YouTube shorts, but Instagram reels are only 30 seconds.
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:45.520]   So you have to make like guess why would they?
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:46.600]   Why would it make no sense?
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:47.680]   Yeah, why would you do that?
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:48.600]   What's your tick?
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:50.280]   But I did. I recut it down.
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:53.360]   Oh, because Renee Richie was taken, I literally made my TikTok handle.
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:55.440]   Renee Richie was taken.
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:57.440]   Oh, one word.
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:00:58.400]   Yep.
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:00:59.920]   It sounds like you got Renee Richie.
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:02.440]   A wonderfully evocative title.
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:03.560]   It is kind of good.
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:07.160]   Renee Richie was taken.
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:09.760]   I did. I searched for Renee Richie and there's a woman on it.
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:10.720]   So this is good to know.
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:11.560]   Yeah.
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:17.000]   So you have to take what is a 30 second real and expand it to a minute.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:17.960]   Is that what you do?
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:21.320]   I just left it at 30 seconds because they say like for for short, really,
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:22.560]   like the shorter really is the better.
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:23.920]   You could do a 30 second.
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:26.200]   I see a lot of 30 second TikToks.
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:28.840]   I know on TikTok, here's the worst part is TikTok.
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:30.400]   The maximum is one minute.
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:33.720]   And when you turn it on, if someone isn't picking up speed really fast,
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:35.160]   you look down at the scroll bar.
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:38.360]   It means it's going to go to a minute or longer.
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:40.560]   If there's no scroll bar, it means it's 15 seconds.
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:43.360]   And you make a decision like, I'll give them 15 seconds.
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:47.160]   They're going to come to a good conclusion here because there's a lot of
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:48.360]   you know, likes or whatever.
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:52.360]   But if if there's if you see them starting slow and you see it that ticker
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:54.960]   all the way across, you're like, I'm going to go.
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:56.360]   I'm going to move on to the next one.
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:57.160]   Obviously.
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:00.360]   I'm not going to sit through a minute of this swipe swipe.
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:00.760]   Swipe.
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:01.160]   Yeah.
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:04.160]   They were showing how TikTokkers make these videos and they don't like people
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:05.360]   who thought they edited them.
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:06.160]   They don't.
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:06.960]   They take the thing, they hold down the button.
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:07.760]   Oh my gosh.
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:08.760]   The edit and camera.
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:10.160]   And they put it all in their head.
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:12.560]   And their heads fly off and they go through their own mouths and stuff.
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:13.760]   And it's all done in camera.
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:14.560]   It's kind of amazing.
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:19.640]   My son started doing cooking TikToks under the weird handle sodium
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:21.160]   underscore deficiency.
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:23.960]   But I look at this stuff and say, why don't you cook this stuff at home?
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:25.360]   This is this is good.
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:26.960]   This is good stuff.
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:29.160]   I want some of this stuff.
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:29.760]   I don't know.
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:31.760]   I think Henry knows how to edit.
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:32.760]   He's pretty good editors.
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:37.560]   So that's that's another thing that is so great to see as an as an older person
[02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:42.960]   that you see what happens when when a generation grows up with a technology
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:47.680]   where they never knew a world in which there was not non non-linear digital
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:50.960]   editing and a really nice camera that you just happen to carry with you.
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:56.760]   Whereas we we grew up with I grew up with, hey, I'm going to go to that one one one
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:02.760]   one store that lets you that stupidly lets you return a VCR within 30 days and
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:06.760]   get a free refund not knowing that I'm buying one once every two months for to
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:09.760]   like edit a video project with a clipboard and a piece of paper.
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:13.280]   It is again, I there's so many I've said this before, but I have so much
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:17.560]   praise for these people in their in their twenties and thirties because there's
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:19.360]   so many there's so many channels that I watch.
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:26.560]   I'm in awe of this 2627 28 year old person who sows so is vintage dresses
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:30.000]   that they have just such an instinctive and beautiful knowledge of how to tell
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:30.960]   a story with video.
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:32.720]   It's just wonderful to see in their blood.
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:35.880]   Isn't it is fascinating to make it all I understand like the same way.
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:41.000]   Yeah, they're unconsciously absorbed all this stuff.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:41.920]   And now it's just in there.
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:46.440]   It's like probably Andy, you know how to write because you read so many books.
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:52.480]   You absorb unconsciously, you know, I I grew up with word processors.
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:57.440]   I did not know of time in which you couldn't just simply easily anytime you saw a way
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:00.760]   to improve something you could easily go back and improve it almost immediately.
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:04.280]   And that's certainly I'm sure that that that changed my writing.
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:05.320]   He's 26.
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:07.280]   So he says he uses premiered at these.
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:10.520]   That's the weird thing.
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:12.320]   It's like moving from stage to cinematics.
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:15.360]   Like we had for a while we just filmed the stage and then we learned the language
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:18.280]   of movies and they natively understand that's right.
[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:22.080]   Organically understand the vertical video 60 seconds.
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:24.000]   I why are you people using editors?
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:24.800]   I don't need final cut.
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:26.680]   I just hold the button down three or four times.
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:28.000]   Yeah, it's not amazing.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:28.600]   Wow.
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:32.000]   And and the and I think that the other thing is that this is how they're learning.
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.680]   And I think this is why we need to think about like how education works is that
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:37.520]   you know, they're learning from all this video.
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:39.960]   My daughter's learning how to play the bass and she mostly just watches.
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:42.200]   Oh, haven't you had a cook from YouTube?
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:43.360]   Yeah, right.
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:47.040]   And my kids my kids watch some, you know, they my son's cooking something.
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:49.000]   I'm like, where did you get it in some YouTube channel?
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:53.400]   Invariably, I tried to teach him the family spaghetti sauce and all this.
[02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:57.600]   When he was a kid, no interest, but he's like, he's a great cook now because he
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:04:58.720]   was all on YouTube.
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:00.280]   It's kind of wild.
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:04.520]   My my my wife, you know, she goes up to, I think it's Epicurious or she she won't
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:07.000]   even make a meal if it hasn't been rated a thousand times.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.480]   But she won't even like, no, I'm not going to take any chances.
[02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:10.440]   I'm going to take any chances.
[02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:10.680]   Yep.
[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:11.680]   Why why bother?
[02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:13.160]   Why bother?
[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:16.960]   Real quickly, I just wanted to mention it's not exactly a pick, but I have to say, you
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:20.760]   know, for a long time, the knock on Max and especially on the new M1 Max, they're
[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:25.560]   not for gaming, even though they could be, but games people just don't develop
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:27.680]   for that platform.
[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:29.840]   Stadia has started to change that Google
[02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:34.880]   Stadia and now there's steam link finally available on the Macintosh.
[02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:38.080]   This is a similar idea streaming your steam games.
[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:39.680]   They play them on their servers.
[02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:44.440]   You just see the, you know, the video, which means you could play a lot of PC
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:46.560]   games on a Mac.
[02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:51.720]   So I think this may end up turning the Mac into a gaming platform that
[02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:52.560]   Apple wakes up.
[02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:53.120]   I hope so.
[02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:53.840]   I hope so.
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:55.680]   Yeah, because they really need to support this.
[02:05:55.680 --> 02:06:00.560]   But they have approved now, Steam Link, which was available on iOS now for the
[02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:01.200]   Mac.
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:06.840]   It's in the Mac app store and not a gaming platform, but a blank gaming client.
[02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:12.080]   Yeah, but that works as long as you can actually spend $2,000, $2,000 for this
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:12.680]   machine.
[02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:15.880]   And part of your life is gaming and part of it is desktop gaming.
[02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:19.520]   OK, at least you can make your steam purchases work on this $3,000 laptop you
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:21.120]   just bought.
[02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:23.680]   Tell me about it.
[02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:29.520]   Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this thrilling gripping edition of Mac
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:30.080]   Break Weekly.
[02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:33.120]   Renee Richie is at YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:35.200]   I gave everybody else a chance to plug.
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:36.160]   I didn't give you a chance.
[02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:38.520]   What do you got coming up?
[02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:42.000]   I just did a preview of what I expect to see at the Apple April event.
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:42.640]   Oh, good.
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:44.080]   I'm not sure what I'm going to do next.
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:45.840]   I'm trying to do my this year.
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:47.640]   I'm trying to do fewer but better videos.
[02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:49.800]   So I'm taking my time a little bit more.
[02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:50.440]   All right.
[02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:51.480]   Interesting idea.
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:54.000]   What will we see in April?
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.840]   We didn't really talk about that today.
[02:06:56.840 --> 02:07:00.800]   So you'll have to watch Renee's video, YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:04.160]   Andy Inaco, WGBH Boston, Alex Lindsey.
[02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:08.800]   I guess I can say, oh, 9/0 media and office hours.
[02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:12.120]   Both both he works all the time.
[02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:14.000]   Birch, Birch, Birch, Birch.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.880]   I wanted the office hours at.
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:18.280]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:21.560]   I do Mac break weekly every Tuesday, 11 a.m.
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:24.520]   Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC.
[02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:27.000]   The live streams at Twit.tv/live.
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:28.600]   There's audio and video there.
[02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:29.640]   Tune in early.
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:31.120]   The pre-show is always interesting.
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:34.440]   Tune in late because shows usually goes long.
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:35.760]   It doesn't really matter.
[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:40.000]   If you're watching live chat live, I R C dot Twit.TV.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:43.920]   After the fact, all our shows are at Twit.tv/mbw.
[02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:46.080]   You could still interact with us.
[02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:48.360]   We kind of have a different way of doing it.
[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:52.840]   We have a forum, Twit.community, very active, fun, love it.
[02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:57.000]   And we now have a Twitter alike called Mastodon.
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:01.440]   We've crossed our 1000th user now on the Twit.Social Mastodon,
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:05.320]   which is great because it means it's starting to get a little lively in there.
[02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:10.560]   So that's a lot of fun, Twit.Social, if you want to join our Mastodon instance.
[02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:15.320]   We also can be found on YouTube.
[02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:17.200]   YouTube.com/something.
[02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:21.200]   I don't even know. I guess Mac break weekly or we got whatever we could get.
[02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:22.160]   You know what the easiest thing is?
[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:23.480]   YouTube.com/Twit.
[02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:27.600]   That's the little bits, the Twit bits, but it also has links to all the other
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:29.360]   shows, YouTube channels.
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:34.600]   And of course, maybe the easiest is to get a podcast application and subscribe.
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:39.120]   That way you'll get it automatically or follow if it's Apple's podcast app.
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:41.720]   You'll get it automatically the minute it's available.
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:43.640]   So I'm going to check that box to download it.
[02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:45.840]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:49.040]   Time to get back to work though, because break time is over.
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:50.120]   Bye bye.
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:51.480]   Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:57.760]   I am Ant Pruitt and I want to tell you about my show, Hands on Photography here on Twit TV.
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:08:59.320]   Each and every week.
[02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:00.600]   Thursday, that is.
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:04.680]   I'd like to sit down and share with you the best tips and tricks that are going to help
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:06.400]   make you a better photographer.
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:08.600]   And it's not always about Photoshop.
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:13.240]   It's not always about just having the biggest and baddest and bestest camera.
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:18.240]   It can be the simplest of things like leave your eye open when you're looking
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:19.440]   through the viewfinder.
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:23.120]   All of these simple tips can really help step your photography game up.
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:26.720]   So subscribe to the show today as Twit.TV/HOP.
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:28.720]   And I look forward to talking to you soon.
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:42.440]   [Music]
