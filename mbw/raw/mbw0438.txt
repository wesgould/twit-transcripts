[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.120]   Break Weekly to show the covers you are the latest Macintosh news anti-anacos from the
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.640]   Chicago Suntimes. He's here. Look at the beautiful crisp clear. He's using the Vermeer filter
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.160]   for Instagram today. I think just dynamite. All he needs is a pearl earring in your set.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.200]   And an engineer had mastered the technique for this by staring into a concave mirror.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.720]   It's amazing. I'm told not to move because it really screws up to his vibe. These days
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.880]   we should do an oil painting version of you guys. Renee Richie. Oh, nice. Do you like
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.400]   that? This is on the fly. Looks like he's on the side. I could actually make it very
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.920]   Instagram. He needs four of me. And then you need to put them in the floor. Yeah, it's
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.760]   a whirl. Also with this Renee Richie from the very cold, powerless, canadia. I have
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.400]   three UPSs set up, Leo, just in case. So you have power now? Yes. But I got three of them
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.800]   set up just in case anyone tries to interfere with the podcast. Is it Vermeer or Vellameer?
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.120]   I never know. Freaking Frenchies. I don't know.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.560]   I can't store not. Like I said, a Dutch Vellameer or something. Who knows what the Dutch is?
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.480]   I think Van Gogh is Van Gogh. So who knows what the Dutch is? Maybe J.C. Snell does. He's
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:17.440]   also here. Hi, Jason. I'm here. Van Gogh. Van Gogh. Van Gogh. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Renee.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.000]   You said something? I got yelled at because I said Gouda and someone looked at me and
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   said, it's how to. It's how to. It's not how it is. It's Gouda. Like Gouda baby. Anyway,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.520]   Jason, it's clean. I was once giving like a talk in front of like on a panel in front
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.240]   of like 500 people. And in the middle of this really complex thing that I was trying to explain
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.280]   misattributed a quote about, Hey, here's why do we why do you rob banks? That's because
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.200]   where the money is. And someone else on the panel like decided to interrupt me and correct
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.560]   I'm sorry. Andy actually. And I had to just like, do I yell at this person and call him
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.760]   an idiot or do I just continue with me talking? Because that that God I still relive that
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.720]   moment at least like once every five months like it was a God you pointed that out. It
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.160]   was like pretty boy Floyd or something. Who said it? I said it was Dylan. But it's not
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.080]   Dylan. It's not Dylan. It's someone else. I'm sorry, Andy. I believe you're because
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.920]   because I could see the looks and everybody's faces in that audience because everyone's
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.920]   saying my God, did he just miss out to be to that vague piece of trivia? Thank God you
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.320]   stepped in sir. And yes, no, it's like on the list of things to do with when I get a
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.560]   time machine, it's not in the top 100, but it's on the list to go back and just say,
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.040]   God, Molly, Molly would call it the literal net. And I think it's very apt. A tomato is
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.400]   not a vegetable. It is fruit. It is technically part of the fruit.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.480]   Frid says Willie Sutton, which I think is correct. Are you talking to the day that if
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.640]   you put anything up on Twitter, you will get maybe one reply to it, but you'll get 300
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.960]   people telling you about every typo or mis- actually you should have you seen that tweet.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.720]   There's a great tweet that said you get more responses from making saying something wrong
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:10.680]   than from asking for help. It's called Godwin's law. It works. That's good. It's brilliant.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.440]   And just the loss that the Godwin's law is not because that's the thing.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:25.440]   And wow. Wow. I don't know. This is going to be kind of a slow week, I think. I don't
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.680]   know really if there's any I mean, Apple opening five new Chinese retail stores. I was stretching.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.480]   It doesn't really like kind of gal. I was like, you know, it's either five total links in
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:43.640]   the doc or I just cut off developers in Crimea. Is that not now? They abandoned them. They
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.240]   went to the show's over everyone. Thank you for joining us. This is going to be we're
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.520]   going to talk about comic books. We're going to talk about audio. I kind of sandwiched
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.520]   did you have today? Which kind of sandwich did you wish you have? Now I went to the I went
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.640]   to the the really good bakery because I'm having a really good pasta dinner tonight and they
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.720]   didn't have the crusty kite sub bread. They have the soft kinds of bread. I mean, it has
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.680]   a good like crumb to it. Hey, I just like that crunch of a good Italian. I have a related
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.720]   story. Chipotle is very interesting. Apple pay. I thought you might like that. You might
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.760]   like that. Not not using it. You're making me hungry, Leo. You're making me hungry.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.640]   We're thinking about it. It's gotten to the point now where we're doing stories where
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.800]   people are thinking about things they might do like that. Apple touch patent. I have an
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   Apple pay related thing, which was watching the football games this weekend. I was amazed
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:36.280]   at the marketing money that's going into different banks, all doing their own ads saying, yay,
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.280]   we have Apple pay. It's kind of brilliant because I don't know whether Apple is kicking
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.480]   in or whether it's just the banks spending their own money, but there was a bank of America
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.040]   ad there was a chase. Do you think that's Apple co-op marketing?
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.040]   My guess is no. My guess is that the banks all want to be seen with Apple. But isn't that
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:58.320]   amazing that there are at least three unique spots including the NFL, who's saying, oh,
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.880]   we take Apple pay at our stadiums. Just following over themselves to say it. I know
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.640]   that every time one of those ads runs somebody who has an Android phone that has been doing
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.880]   energy payments all along, it's like, why are they doing it? But the banks are very excited
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.600]   to be working with Apple on Apple pay. I mean, and they're spending money marketing it.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.040]   It's pretty crazy. Thank you, Jason, for trying to bring some relevance to this show.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.800]   Just trying. Let's have a poll across the panel. Talk about the last time you used Apple pay
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:34.920]   and if either level two where the clerk registered surprise that you were using it or level one
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:40.560]   in which you had to explain to the clerk how Apple pay works. Last time I used it, I was
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:48.400]   at a Panera and I did have to say, oh, well, it's a phone payment system. The reason why
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.600]   I just pressed the button on your register and it'll accept.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.840]   Wow, that's interesting. Even though they had it.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.320]   Even though they had it. They had it but it's trained in it or?
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.200]   Well, I think it's more of a case of just people not really using it. It's like, I use
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.520]   it all the time at like at a certain different stores and chances are at least two out of
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.120]   three that I will have I will be introducing the concept of these payments to somebody
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.440]   during the transaction. That might give light of the fact to the idea that lots of people
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:20.480]   are using Apple pay. I know my my whole foods, they don't even blink anymore. No, yeah,
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.280]   I've used it. Yeah, whole foods. Although the flow there is pretty direct. I mean, if I
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.800]   don't if I don't slide my card and tap, you know, it's a payment is registered and for
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.000]   them just move on to the next step. But I do that all the time. I'm still eagerly awaiting
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.640]   the arrival of pay pal and pay. Sorry, Apple pay in my great country to the north here.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.920]   Hopefully this spring fingers crossed for the spring. Everything comes late to Canada.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.160]   It's just how it is.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:56.720]   Okay, here's a story about Apple pay Apple patents. I don't do patents normally because
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:03.280]   like Apple patents, everything. They have an idea. They fart. They patent it. And that
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:09.480]   so a patent does not in contrary to what every tech blog was equally suffering for
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.760]   lack of news might indicate an Apple a Apple patent does not indicate any future plans.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.600]   It is not a forward looking statement. It's just like, well, we ought to patent this.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:24.440]   However, I'm desperate. The US patent trademark office on Thursday published an Apple patent
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:33.040]   application. By the way, application not they got it for an iCloud based touch ID sinking
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.680]   fingerprint protected Apple pay terminal. I thought you were going to do the stylus
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:44.360]   patent Leo. I will do that. That's coming up. It's going to be all. That's coming up.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.440]   The GoPro one. I got it all. I got a mug of doing it all because we're basically this
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:56.000]   weekend Apple patents. Yeah, we're we're stuck. We got some great stuff. Come on. We'll have
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.040]   a dramatic reading award. He card information from all our different
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.880]   Iowa's devices. Actually, Jason, I did something we may resort to later on, which was a dramatic
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.840]   reading of the chat room. Oh, yeah. Oh, man. That was fun. That was that was comedy gold,
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.640]   my friends. We'd be a chat room as a teleprompter. Yeah, there's going to be a show in that.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.680]   It was good. Some time. Apple ranks only 11s and patents according to the chat room. IBM
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:24.000]   number one, Samsung number two. But Apple's trying to catch up. Remember, IBM's added
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.320]   a bit of this a little bit longer. So you'd expect them to be number one. Samsung, who
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.200]   knows? I don't know why they have so many patents because they're either because they're
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.000]   conglomerate. Scared of Apple rigs and yeah, toilet seats and sorts of things and scared
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.040]   of Apple. So this could do away with the manual touch ID setup and power. The next generation
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:51.240]   of Apple pay enabled POS terminals or not. It might not. It might not be anything. Finger
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.440]   biometric sensor data synchronization via cloud computing device and related methods.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.800]   So you call that collects your fingerprint on a primary device. And then is up later
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.640]   the iCloud. I think this is the whole thing that everybody was worried about with fingerprint
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:11.120]   touch ID was it's going to be uploaded iCloud. Nobody wants this. So Apple's patenting it.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.640]   But I think people will be very nervous about the idea that your fingerprint might be stored
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.640]   on the cloud as opposed to just on the device. That doesn't the iPhone doesn't even store
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:24.040]   your fingerprint stores. Metadata. There's some data in that secure enclave. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.360]   Yeah. And the chip. I mean, this is this is where we're also we're also supposed to
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.880]   every time you use an ATM that we don't absolutely even even the bank ATM you're supposed to just
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.040]   give that card skimmer a little bit of a tug to make sure that it looks like it's actually
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.200]   built into the machine. Really? If I wow. Oh, yeah. No, there you haven't heard of these
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.720]   things where there are people sort of break in and stick fake ones on top of it. And so
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.880]   they're just basically you're just handing over your credit card information and just
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.720]   of course the ATM doesn't work. They have their card information. And if I'm not skimmer,
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:57.160]   I'm not a skimmer. Yeah, exactly. And I'm not sure if I'd be really comfortable with using
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.840]   my using my fingerprint to register at an actual point of sale term. I as opposed to
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.960]   I this is my phone. I own this phone. I know the technology behind the fingerprint scanner
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:12.080]   here. And I know that whatever data constitutes equating this with my identity is not going
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.520]   to leave this device. I'm not sure if I would do that at any of their store. Have any of
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.520]   you encountered I've started to hear about this lately using Apple Pay and then being
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:25.120]   asked to sign? Yeah, it's their option. They can choose whether they want you to sign or
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.640]   not. Yeah. Yeah. All sorts of some of the excitement out of it. I think it's going to
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:34.280]   change over time. My understanding is it's a store policy thing and it's usually a large
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:40.800]   price. Some of that comes with the idea that if you just tap an NFC card, you could have
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.320]   stolen the card. Right. And so they want a second factor. They want a second bid of
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:51.560]   identification. Now with with Apple Pay, there's touch ID. So there is a second factor. So
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.720]   theoretically down the road, they could say, Oh, well, if you're paying with Apple Pay,
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.120]   we don't want to sign. But a lot of times the scripts are in place in the business.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.440]   Right. You're not going to say, look, it's over $100 or over $50. We want you to sign
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:09.200]   anyway. We've done because necessary our NSC is on a card, not on phones and there's
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.800]   no second of your authentication. So most retailers here do have an arbitrary amount
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.600]   that they'll no longer allow the tap for like some at 30 bucks, some 50, some 90. The interface
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.040]   doesn't change. So you're still asked to tap it and then you hit it several times frustrated
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.000]   before the clerk says, Oh, no, no, sorry. After 50 bucks, you've got to use the pit and
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.520]   chip. But everyone has those kinds of safeguards and Canada. Sorry. And here in the States,
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.840]   in October, we're going to be chip and sign. Yeah. Well, optionally or chip and pin, you
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:40.320]   can do either one, but the pin is mandatory. You do sign. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a it's
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.040]   it's we're halfway there. I have that now at my whole foods I can spend up to I think
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.600]   it's 30 or $40 and with a credit card, they won't ask me to sign below that point. They're
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.720]   like, you know, they don't care. I would like to see this every year. I'm just thinking
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:59.520]   about signing. I often get a large dollar figure shipments from UPS and others. And they say
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.400]   you somebody's going to Apple says, if somebody's gonna have to sign before you can will leave
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:08.720]   this Mac book be great. If they started if people like UPS started using Apple Pay, you
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.120]   can just tap and be more it'd be real. Oh, but wait a minute. There's a problem there
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.360]   like it because it wouldn't be you. It could be anybody, right? But at least they know,
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.840]   well, accepted the shipment. I think the biggest problem is that UPS is at the is at
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.240]   the level of efficiency where they know exactly how many seconds it takes to get from the
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.880]   truck to the front door and how quick they can get that. And so if they they know the
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.480]   people if they ask them to sign something, it's one question, one answer, it will definitely
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.520]   work if it's tap and pay and that loses them eight seconds per transaction. That's a deal
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.680]   break. That's a good point. Although I would think it'd be faster. I think it'd be the
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.960]   opposite, wouldn't it? Also, also how many how many people like walk to the door with their
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:49.320]   phones to sign for package? So many people put on their pants before they walk to the
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.920]   door. That's my question. Well, if you pass guys and wearing pants either, he's wearing
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:59.560]   shorts. He does halfway. I can't wear my boxers. It's okay. I just I just wave at them through
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:10.240]   the bars when they when they I swear my cousin Eddie's 40 bathrobe. Oh, somebody was saying
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.840]   at Walgreens, they require his apple pay plus pin. So that must be another option.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.280]   Yeah, I think there's this validation. All right. Step. I think second factor's fine.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.480]   Yeah, I think we'll get there is because it's a fingerprint plus the
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.320]   phone. Yeah, that's that's the idea is like at some point it to just be like if it's apple
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:33.160]   pay, we know that the second factor was applied. Now you're doing a pen or a signature. Because
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.680]   to me, the big win isn't just the convenience of hey, all I got to do is tap my thumb and
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.760]   it goes through the real can the real factor for me is that this store never sees my bank
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.040]   or my credit card information. They just get a little magic bean that says give them the
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.320]   shoes. And that's even if it even if it was a signature and a pen every single time, I
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.840]   would probably still do that just for that alone. Yeah. The other thing is signing doesn't
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:00.560]   seem to be very significant in terms of identification because well, I learned this from Lisa because
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.600]   I was always signing my name. And she says, Oh, you don't have to sign your name. Just
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.120]   go boopie loop. Yeah, she does that it works. Doesn't you could write Mickey Mouse? You could
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:13.280]   put an X that they're not matching it to anything. They're just saying, Oh, you signed. Yeah,
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.640]   it's not it's a custom and they can look at it later. If you dispute it, they can write
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.920]   your sex is I don't know. Yeah. So as long as it's not what you the America make, but
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.320]   so long as it's a consistent mark. Like my sin, my signature is just muscle memory at
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.160]   this point doesn't seem to have to even be consistent. It's not for not for credit cards
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.680]   because they're not they're not matching it. I think that's true for for things like signing
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:41.760]   a check maybe or signing a check. But I'm saying it the boat is able to make any shape
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.240]   you want. And nobody checks it in the car. The car charge goes through. I draw a little
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:52.320]   fishies. What I'm saying is that if so if you dispute a $580 Xbox one purchase on your
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.960]   credit card, right, and they they show you a signature that looks absolutely nothing like
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.560]   the attention signatures before or after it. They're definitely not going to give you a
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.800]   problem about it. But if so, but if you if you're if your signature is a happy face and two
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.200]   dots and a smile, you're going to have a hard time proving that yeah, I know that this time
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.440]   was a flower and the next time was a happy face the time before that was a shoe. But trust
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.920]   me, I would definitely definitely not have done a wristwatch as a signature thing.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.640]   That reminds me of the things that bank do the the picture that you're supposed to see.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.520]   I never really understood how that is in any way more secure. So I have like a picture
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.400]   of a high boy, some piece of furniture. Oh, yeah. Don't give it away. That's your secret
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:36.040]   code. It's not. It's meaning. It's a piece of furniture. They say now attach a phrase
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:41.440]   to this. And if you don't see the high boy and your phrase and usually my my phrase has
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:48.040]   been stupid effing picture code. It's it's the it's the other way around this. It's it's
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:53.160]   not there to verify you. It's there to verify the actual bag. If I don't see this the high
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.440]   and also and also me you you log into these things like probably once a day or once every
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.360]   other day just make sure you're on top of your balances and your activity. And that's
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:07.320]   the most direct and absolute way to not to get you from from yellow alert to red alert
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.120]   that oh this doesn't look the same way it does every single day. So I understand that
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.880]   but I just think that it's an anti fishing measure. I understand that but there's it's
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.800]   a flawed any fishing measure because first of all if somebody's fishing you they could
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.520]   capture that image and put it there. Well most likely just not put it there. Are you
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.520]   going to stop because oh thank gosh they don't do the site key. I could skip that today.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.600]   You're not going to go wait a minute. This couldn't be my member. Where's my high boy.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.120]   You could also. Okay but to that effect you could also just like to make sure you always
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.480]   have money for the tolls and money for for for lunch. You could just like have a milk
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.360]   crate outside your door and just keep it filled with money. I do grab a hand. It's in
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.360]   my mattress. Yeah with with the with the understanding that perhaps other people will
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.720]   be taking your money away from you. It's an honor system. Most people. Exactly. We've
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.840]   lost all the records from the back we move but this sounds like a big problem but really
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.400]   it isn't. This is the right and tell us how much you have with us. This is the very little
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.880]   secret of the banking system. It's it's an honor system. Well it really is. I mean the
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:08.320]   big the big failure of security is that they've sort of trained every consumer to not really
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.000]   care that much about the security of their own credit card information because every
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.320]   time you have a dispute it's like okay great we'll take that off your card fraud fraud fraud.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.480]   It's much it's that's it's so much less expensive to simply write off five hundred and thirty one
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:25.600]   dollars. Right. Against your card then to put in all the infrastructure to make it really really
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.720]   difficult for anybody to do a fraudulent transaction and that's why we're in the
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.640]   situation we're in right now. I agree as long as they make the money back with with the fee.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.800]   I remember I was getting royalty payments from Hong Kong and it cost almost 80% of the
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.880]   royalty payment to get it accepted at my bank and I said don't you just process all this in the
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.560]   same branch in New York anyway and they said sure but we get to charge you a big fee for doing it here.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:50.160]   So I mean they get off crazy. You may remember the antitrust
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:59.040]   lawsuit that went on for a long time against Apple Google and a law are a lot of other large
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.360]   Silicon Valley companies. They had made agreements which is illegal with each other not to poach
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:08.880]   each other's employees. It's it's actually protected with antitrust law and they lost in court. They
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:15.840]   have now settled Apple and Google settled for four hundred and fifteen million dollars. That
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:22.480]   money doesn't go to Apple or Google it goes to the tech workers who accused the firms of conspiring
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:29.840]   to avoid poaching each other's employees and the smoking gun was pretty was still pretty hot. The
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:36.000]   barrel is hot to the touch and they deserve to lose this case and I presume they've stopped doing
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.760]   that. Four hundred fifteen million though for Google and Apple is like a big deal.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.960]   That's really bad news for these employees because from now on you know that if you're not
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.760]   getting head hunted by the competition it's because you're really not.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:57.280]   You just suck no one wants you. All right we're talking about Apple News it's kind of crumbs
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.200]   but it's not going to be a crummy show. There's lots there's you know if you have
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   Jason Snell if you have Renee Richie if you have Andy Inaco we could talk about anything and it
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:14.000]   would be entertaining and we may and I think that's what's coming in next on the program just
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.320]   show about nothing. Show about nothing. I showed today brought to you by Fresh
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:25.600]   Books. This was you know I'm thinking probably the first web 2.0 site I ever used back in 2004.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:31.600]   I was a suffering freelancer never got it together to send out my invoices at the end of the month
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.760]   and subsequently never got paid and when I found out about Fresh Books there's actually Amber McArthur
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.240]   told me about it. I was going up to Canada once a month and I had to build them not only for my
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.360]   my time and hours but also for my expenses they had a payment and Fresh Books just solved this.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:52.240]   I mean it really took the paperwork out of it. It's accounting made for you the non-account
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:58.400]   five million people now use Fresh Books inside us discovered it 10 years ago. It is fantastic.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:05.360]   If you're still using Word or Excel or I don't know Google Docs geez people use Google Docs to
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.080]   create an invoice and then share it with your client that's not do that. Fresh Books is the
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.280]   best way to create professional looking invoices in minutes. They have a big pay button on each
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.440]   invoice by the way which makes it very easy for your clients to pay you and it turns out
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.720]   your clients do want to pay you. They're just like you they're putting it off make it easy for them.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:33.520]   For on average Fresh Books users get paid five days faster. That's what I mean that's fantastic
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:38.480]   and apparently I don't know how this correlates. On average Fresh Book customers double their
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.560]   revenue in the first two years. I think it's just because they're smart people. If you're using Fresh
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.760]   Books you pay an attention. Fresh Books integrates with your apps like Google Apps Paypal, Stripe,
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:54.000]   MailChimp, FundBox, ZenPayroll. It accepts all the top credit cards and other online payment
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.880]   systems your clients happy. It's also built for growing businesses obviously and that's because
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.760]   it scales. You can add clients and projects and staff very easily. You'll spend less time on
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.520]   paperwork. You'll get paid faster and you can actually use the Fresh Books app to put time in
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.000]   hours. They have an iPhone and Android app that put time in hours right into the invoices to take
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.720]   pictures of receipts so you get paid back. I just think this is such a great solution and boy your

[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:25.680]   time to thank. I don't want to. In the show. In the show now it's under development. Two interesting
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.400]   things related to making money on the app store. I loved this Monument Valley infographic. Is that
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.640]   the one you're talking about? Yeah that and Marco Arment disclosed his 2014 Overcast sales
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.840]   numbers which is interesting too. It's people saying look this is how much money I made on the
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.600]   app store. You know I'm a fan of transparency. We're very transparent about our business and I
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:46.160]   what that's nice about that is if you're interested you're thinking do I want to
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.960]   you know be an app developer what is it going to cost what is the return likely now we have to point
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:56.320]   out Monument Valley was the game of 2014 and we all played it. We all loved it but for them to say
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.440]   here's the numbers I think that's fantastic. It's a small team. There's eight folks in London
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:06.480]   that do this. They show the sales by country. They show the development costs which that's one
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:11.520]   of the things that's kind of unheard of. It cost for the original Monument Valley which doesn't
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:17.680]   have that many levels but it took them 52 weeks 55 weeks I'm sorry. $852,000 that's how much it
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:22.720]   costs. Then they did remember the forgotten shores pack which was more puzzles. That took them another
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:30.160]   29 weeks and cost another $549,000. So the total costs here about $1.4 million but the revenue
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.840]   at 5.8 million. So this shows you it's not a great business but it's a good business.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.000]   It's pretty good. It's okay. I mean there's a lot over it.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.640]   You want percent iOS. Now that's interesting. This is the paid
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:49.120]   story here. iOS they sold the total sales are 2.4 million. They sold 1.7 million half
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.160]   more than half of that to iOS. Only about 300,000 to Android.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:59.440]   That's surprising. They had a big day when Amazon gave it away for free. I guess I don't know if that
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:05.440]   was more than a day. They had a lot of downloads. Not a lot of revenue. 407,000 downloads though.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:10.640]   More than the total Android downloads by a significant number. Now they say it's installed.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.280]   They sold 2.4 million but it's installed on 10 million devices. Now that's not necessarily piracy
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:21.280]   and I'm an example. I bought it on my iPad but I put it on my iPhone. That's the thing.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.480]   That doesn't mean. But they do say there's a lot of piracy. They think there was a significant
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:32.960]   amount of unauthorized download. This point is two big problems about targeting Android and why
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.360]   somebody developers don't mess with it until after they've made their nut off iOS.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.480]   Because you're not going to get the same numbers because you can only really target people who
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:48.400]   are running Android 4.0 and probably only 4.2 or 3. That's just a really small
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.320]   wedge of the pie right now because of carriers not updating their phones frequently enough.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:58.400]   Another bullet point from that piece was how much piracy there is on Android.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:04.080]   Strictly, not necessarily because it's not a safe platform but you can just go into settings,
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:08.480]   flip a switch and say yes, I will run any software from any source whatsoever.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:13.920]   Even this year file that I'm providing to you, whereas almost nobody these days is going to
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.480]   jailbreak a phone unless they're doing it with intent so to speak.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:22.480]   50% of the players who started the game, how many of you here finished Monument Valley?
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.600]   I finished the original. I'm still slowly working through the
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.560]   forgotten chores because I don't want it to end.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.200]   I know.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.480]   In fact, if there's the only complaint about Monument Valley, anybody has this too short.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:40.560]   Sure. It's not particularly replayable. It's not particularly hard to solve the puzzles.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.200]   Compared to a movie price or something, I'm fine with it.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.720]   How much is it? $3.99?
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:51.600]   It really is listening to a song where you're meant to listen to it and get to the end of it
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.240]   and then enjoy this piece of art that you're experiencing.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.600]   By the way, the music, it is kind of listening to the song because the music is beautiful.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.040]   It's very soothing. You put on your headphones and there's no timer.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.400]   You could take your time.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.720]   It looks great. The graphics are fantastic.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:10.240]   50% finished it. I'm one of the people who did not, but all the rest of the panel did.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.720]   75% of the panel.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.840]   Oh, you did not? So it's 50%.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:20.800]   It's kind of like what Jason said. I was just enjoying the colors and the sounds and just twirling
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.120]   things around more than, "Okay, I got to finish this level."
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.160]   I'm not a hurry.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:24.560]   Exactly.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:31.360]   Yeah. It's so weird in that, yes, there are specific goals, but I've never once been the
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:36.480]   slightest bit frustrated in trying to get the game to work or, "Oh, man, I got died again."
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:41.040]   It's like, "No, you're just enjoying it." It's like a Rubik's Cube can be a very meditative thing
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.720]   just to hold in your hands and tumble even if you have never actually solved it.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.960]   I think this is why some of the criticism of the game is kind of crazy because people do say,
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.600]   "Oh, it's not a very hard puzzle and I solved it really fast."
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.560]   I think that's perfect.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.640]   This is not that kind of game. I keep telling people I hate this because it sounds so
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.840]   cliché to say, "It's an experience," but it's an experience.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:04.880]   It's fun to be playing the game and that's sort of the point of it.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.960]   As I'm saying, too few notes in this song.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.280]   I have to say, though, as good as the revenue was,
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:15.360]   it probably would have been significantly higher had a bit of freemium product, right?
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:20.080]   That seems low compared to even something like Flappy Bird, which is advertising only.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.040]   I think that was always one of the debates about Monument Valley is whether they should
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:27.040]   have done the free-to-play where they gave you a level or two and then you bought the rest of it.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:33.200]   They decided not to do that. It's gone okay for them. I don't think they're kicking themselves,
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.080]   but you do one.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.840]   Plus, there's a thing, though, that there's different models for the freemium.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.960]   Paying for levels, paying for moving ads has not been very successful.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.560]   People just, they'll put up with ads and they'll play a couple levels and they'll go to the next
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.480]   free game. It's only when you get into things like in-game consumables that you make a lot of money
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.480]   and I don't really realize the idea of having to walk around there paying for crow-jumping
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.760]   points or something.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.880]   Yeah, that's what I was going to say. What are you going to do for Monument Valley?
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.680]   For $10, you can buy a ladder that you can just bridge things with and climb over things with.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:07.600]   In part of it is, again, that meditative process where you just simply spend some time and
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.280]   flip things around. If at any point it gives you a decision point where you want to buy something
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:16.080]   or you want to keep playing the game, that would have disrupted just this wonderful mental flow
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:21.600]   that you're in. I would not talk to the developers, but I wouldn't be surprised if that was an
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.280]   aesthetic choice as much as anything else.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:30.320]   And now let's move to Marco. Overcast, which is Marco Arment. Marco Arment doesn't need the money.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.280]   I'm presuming.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:33.440]   I know about that.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.960]   Well, I shouldn't say that. He's very young. He's got children.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:43.120]   But he was one of the original Tumblr folks and I'm sure made a little money there. He also
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.720]   created InstaPaper, which was a great success. He's since sold it.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:53.520]   I get the feeling that Overcast, which is his podcast app, was a labor of love more than...
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.720]   But I don't know. You know them.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.440]   Yeah. I think he got some money, obviously, from the Tumblr sale, but he's a developer.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:03.840]   And I think he gave him the freedom to explore what he wanted to do and work on.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.600]   And work on an app that the audio engine took him probably a year to build.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.240]   And he had the freedom to do that. But still, he wants to work on something sustainable,
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:18.160]   something that brings enough money that he can support his family, ideally, on that.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.960]   And what's interesting here is that this is a niche, right?
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.120]   Just podcasting apps alone. It's a niche.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.480]   Well, Apple makes money for free.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:33.120]   And what's interesting is he did a free app with a single in-app purchase to unlock all of the
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.760]   kind of premium features. So it is a free-to-play kind of approach with the unlock.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.800]   That's a shareware kind of thing. I think that's really cool.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.080]   What's interesting about the numbers is we all knew there would be a big bump when it was first
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:49.200]   launched. But it looks like it settled down to a reasonable amount of new purchases every week.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.920]   And that's kind of encouraging as a renewable resource for Apple.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:32:00.800]   He's currently at $20,000 a month, which is a good profit. He says that's before taxes and costs.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.880]   He does call it profit.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.920]   And don't forget Apple's 30%, which I am amused by that.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:10.160]   You hear about Apple's 30%, but then when you see the specific number that
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.720]   overcast made Apple $70,000 last year, it's like, wow, 30%, that's kind of a lot.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:23.040]   Yeah. He says, "Total revenue was $164,000 for 2014, $164,000 after Apple, but before taxes and
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:30.480]   six expenses." The only reason I mention he doesn't need the money is maybe that it makes sense
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:36.640]   that it's a free app with a single in-app purchase of $5 to unlock everything. Probably,
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.560]   I would guess, I don't actually, let's see. He explored a lot of different models. He was
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:46.240]   initially thinking of doing some very different things with it and decided that you had to be
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:51.200]   free in the App Store to be tried. Yeah. I think this is the ethical way to do it.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.960]   It's not expensive. It's free to try. The paid tier is not necessary. In fact,
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:04.720]   it looks like only 14.7% of his downloads paid, which might be a little disheartening. He says,
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:10.960]   "200,000 people launched the app and created an account out of 318,000 downloads." You could
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:16.400]   see you get a lot of downloads. You get fewer people, considerably fewer, actually setting it up.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:21.680]   Then far fewer actually buying it, only $46,000. I'm sorry, people bought it.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:28.720]   Although, not bad revenue. He only pays, this is interesting, $750 a month for his server.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.480]   Servers are so cheap, it's crazy. That's really important if you want to be an
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:38.240]   indie app developer. What are my ongoing costs? He says it's half my family's health insurance.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:43.040]   Listen to his show. He talks about how he's learning Go now to try and optimize it further.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:51.120]   Go is specifically a multi-threaded language from Google that it really is about server side.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:55.200]   He wouldn't write the app and go, but he would write the server side and go.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.760]   I think one of the reasons maybe his revenue is going okay now is because you can start as a
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:04.960]   free user and use it for a while and then say, "Oh, now I do want to add those features and convert."
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.240]   From talking to Phil Leiben over at Evernote, that seems to be
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:13.600]   whatever note strategy is. They always have given away Evernote and they have a premium
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.800]   yearly subscription, which is a little different than pay one's thing, but still similar enough.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.600]   I think the conversion rate is similar and he's very happy.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:27.520]   Amazing thing about overcast is I was just looking. He gives you some of the stats inside
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:31.840]   the preferences screen. I only listen to a pod. I work at home, so I don't have time to listen
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.840]   to a lot of podcasts when I used to listen to them all the time when I commute. Even on my schedule,
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:40.800]   it saved me seven hours in the last two months, not by artificially accelerating what people say,
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.280]   but giving you a perfectly listenable podcast and just trimming down the excess amounts of blank
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.120]   area. That, to me, is incredibly valuable at seven more shows that I managed to fit in that I
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:53.440]   wouldn't have otherwise. It's also a feature that you don't see in the other podcast apps,
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:58.800]   which sets it apart. What I loved about the graphs that he was showing was that it's not one of
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:05.280]   these apps that made a lot of money off of its initial publicity and then it started tailing off,
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:10.240]   and now it's just sort of at some sort of a nominal event. It seems to have really become part of the
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:16.560]   vocabulary of the App Store right now. It's a really good choice of an app, too, because people get
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:21.840]   tired of a game, but once you get a sort of a pantry staple app like a podcast app, where this
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.400]   is something that almost everybody is going to want to try and almost everybody is going to see the
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.840]   advantages of, that's the sort of thing where it can continue to sell at a good, sustainable rate
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:38.560]   month after month after month. I think a nice $10,000 a month average income. I think for a lot of
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.040]   developers, it'd be very happy with that. And keep in mind, Marco is the only one who works on this.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.400]   He doesn't have people doing his support for him. He doesn't have other programmers working for him.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:52.160]   So really, the premise here is can one person build an app and have that income be enough
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.880]   that that's their salary? Yeah. And now, Marco also has a podcast, so he's got two salaries,
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:02.480]   so he's half podcast or half developer. But these numbers seem like they would support a single
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:08.640]   developer pretty well. And I like that. But the big thing is that I wouldn't jump on the, oh,
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:14.800]   Marco, Marco doesn't need the money. But it really does point to this and the
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:21.680]   with Monument value, Valley, this really isn't a quit your job and start developing apps sort of job.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:27.360]   This is a have a steady source of income that you can live on while you're developing this app
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:31.040]   in whatever time you have, and whatever the attempts you can pay to it, because
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.120]   this wasn't something he just batted out in a few weeks. This was something he'd been thinking about
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:41.600]   for a long time and then developing for what a year and a half. And if he was in that time,
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:48.480]   that app is not generating any revenue. So it's helpful that he everyone I know who's a successful
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:53.440]   app developer were able was able to do that in the essentially by giving up all of their free time
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:58.880]   for a good solid year to get that first app out the door. There's no gold rush. It really is about
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:04.800]   working hard, being very, very meticulous, having a game plan and having really not just having a
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.520]   creative game plan, but having a business plan for how am I going to get this developed and how much
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.960]   how much time can I afford to put into this before I release it? You do have to point out that because
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.640]   of his well known name, because of his podcast, he probably has a little marketing advantage. Oh,
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:22.080]   yeah. When they were overcast came out with everybody, we everybody reported that here's a new podcast
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.240]   app from Marco Arment. But that that carries on. You know, that's part of being an indie developer
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:31.280]   as you've got to market yourself. And that because your audience is going to be the people you can
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:37.200]   market your products to Marco writes overall, I'm very satisfied with overcast finances so far.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:41.760]   I'm not it's not setting the world on fire, but it's making good money for most people. The app
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:47.200]   store won't be a lottery windfall. Making a decent living is within reach for many. And
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:52.960]   he also points out that after the self employment penalties in taxes and benefits,
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.640]   that's one way to look at it's not exactly a penalty. If you had an employer, they'd pay half of it.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:04.480]   But I'm probably coming in under what I could get at a full time job in the city. And that's the
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:09.360]   point is that as a self employed person, anybody's been self employed knows this. It certainly in
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:14.240]   the States anyway, you pay a higher self employment taxes and you have to buy your own benefits and
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.480]   all that. He says, but I don't have to actually work for someone else and something I don't care
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:24.960]   about. I can work in my nice home office, drink my fussy coffee, take a nap after lunch if I want to
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.680]   and be present for my family as my kid grows up. And actually, as as a parent, I think that that
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:34.560]   may be the single most important value for all of this is we're all looking for ways to be
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:40.320]   you know, the traditional model, of course, let's say working at Apple, developing the iPhone is,
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:44.480]   you don't see your family for years. And I think we're all looking for a more general
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:52.080]   sustainable way of living. And so I had a really, I had a really good job in product marketing for
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:56.560]   enterprise. And I went to do I'm more and I have I get to work at home, I get to see my friends,
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.440]   I get to see my God children. And I haven't regretted it a day. Yeah. Yeah. One of the many
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.960]   wise things that one of my best friends used to say all the time is that, you know, you're going to
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:09.440]   be working for whatever job you do, you're going to be doing that for about 50 years. That's a long
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:13.600]   time to spend doing something you hate. Actually, where I come to think of it, all four of us yourself
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:19.280]   employed Jason, yes, recently in the, yeah, no, what Mark, what Mark said totally resonates with me.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.200]   I totally, you have to see where he's coming from. Yeah, I drink tea instead of coffee. Otherwise,
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.720]   I'm right there with him. So we're all we're all sitting down someplace with two hours in the
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:33.360]   middle of the afternoon. Yeah, we're taking naps. Anybody could take a nap. That's it.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:38.000]   That's it. I can't do it. I'm not an average. I just am not interested in it. But you could
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.200]   have wanted to. I guess, yeah. To me, the interesting thing is people like Marco, people like Lauren
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:47.840]   Richter, the people who can make an app on their own can just utilize this platform to do the entire
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:52.000]   thing. That's what's really remarkable. That's right. I mean, the reason overcast has been so
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.920]   successful too is because Marco put in a year trying to figure out some pretty radical things
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.240]   with audio. Most podcast apps use the basic audio functions that are available in the system.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.920]   Why did he do that? What's wrong with core audio? Well, because he decided, I mean,
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:11.200]   it's the reasons I think that it's been successful. He decided that he wanted a podcast app where,
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:17.440]   when you make it run at 1.2x or 1.4x, you don't get the little clicking sound that core audio does
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.720]   when you ask for. It sounds smooth. He had this idea for SmartSpeed where it's analyzing for
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:28.320]   gaps, for silence gaps, like what radio stations do to squeeze the silence out. And he wanted that
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.880]   in a podcast app because he wanted to be able to listen to more podcasts. And core audio just
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:38.960]   didn't, on its own, the audio stuff didn't do it. He needed to go one layer deeper. And that,
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:43.120]   you know, he, he's scratching his own itch there, right? With that's part of it. And then he's a
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:48.720]   programmer. He has the ability to build those tools. And as a result, he's built a tool that's
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.640]   got some features that will be very hard for his competitors to replicate, even though now they
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:56.720]   know what they are. And that, you know, that's one of the reasons it's been successful. And that
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:01.200]   does go back to him spending a lot of time on the technical side of this. I have never listened to
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:06.800]   our shows on Overcast. Anybody do that? What does it sound like? Is it a lot faster? And the thing
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:11.040]   that's nice is the audio boost also will equalize sounds of different podcasts or different volumes.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:14.480]   And sometimes they are audio groups to make sure that, yeah, you can hear them no matter what sort
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:18.720]   of traffic or road. And one of the things I did very early on when we started to it, and I was
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:23.040]   the guy doing the engineering was make sure we heavily compressed audio so that it would exact
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.960]   that's exactly right. Yeah, very little dynamic range. But some podcasts don't do a very good job
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:32.480]   of that. And the truth is, the funny thing is when I gave up that responsibility, we've slowly
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:37.760]   slipped back to a full dynamic range podcast. But I don't like it. But I can't convince anybody
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.480]   that compressed the hell out of it. In some scenarios, a dynamic podcast can sound really good. But
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:48.160]   then in other scenarios, it doesn't. And so Marco's voice boost. It's actually smart. Just just does
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.520]   that. Yeah, I think I'm gonna have to recommend people start using. What happens though is then
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:56.080]   somebody talks to you live, and they think that you may be drunk because why aren't you talking
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.000]   faster? And then you they realize halfway through the conversation, Oh, I'm used to listening to you
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:07.040]   at two weeks. I like a couple features that really set it apart. Yeah, yeah. I like overcast. But
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.320]   there are a couple of shows where I kind of like the way that the speaker has a ton of voice where
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:17.440]   they can like they will pause judiciously like I can't I can't use overcast with the Stephen
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:23.040]   Tubblowski files. Well, you can because it's got a per show setting. So you can just turn those off.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:28.400]   Cool. Cool. And the the implication of that statement was that on they featured not on the
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:33.200]   on overcast. There are there are the things that that I wouldn't say that I don't like about
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:38.160]   overcast. It's just that it's a different it. It doesn't it's not a podcast player for the way
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:45.600]   that I listen to podcasts. Interesting. But like the the podcast catcher that that I use all the time,
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:50.560]   it's has a horrible interface, but everything I want to do it's there in the interface somewhere.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:56.800]   So once I set it, I can easily get it. I'm talking about an Android app, but it's but I use a
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:03.600]   for media. I use iOS almost as much as I use my Android phone, but I don't find it as a fault
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:09.840]   in overcast. I think that I love I like the simplicity of it. I like the fact that it really is a a
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:15.120]   a let's do these hands. These features extremely well and let's make it as good an experience as
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:21.680]   possible. But the whole thing really does point to how the user never gets to see how much work
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:28.080]   even the simplest things can be. Because that I think is the signature difference between developing
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:34.160]   for iOS and developing for other mobile operating systems that I've we've all spoken to so many
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:39.920]   different mobile developers. And as much grip griping as there is about Xcode and about how Apple
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:45.840]   runs developer relations, nobody says that that iOS isn't the easiest, the less at least hassle-free
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:54.160]   thing to develop for simple things like making sure that an audio that if one app wants the audio
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.960]   audio channel that another audio that another app has, how difficult is it to make an app that
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:06.480]   behaves properly in Android versus how easy is it to do in iOS. So I think that every time that you
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:11.440]   see these screaming complaints, oh, this 99th century, this is $5, it should be free. You don't
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:16.000]   know how hard it is to do even some simple things in so many different apps. Well, and here's something
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.880]   I didn't know. Marco says the biggest expense in 2014 was a trademark agreement. He had to pay,
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:28.880]   I guess somebody else owned the name overcast. And Marco said my other name sucked. So he paid
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:35.680]   $12,000 for the right to use the name overcast into trade market. Yeah, coexistence agreement.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:40.880]   Yeah, I don't know who else overcast is. He also spent some money on trademarking. He trademarked
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:46.480]   not only overcast, but smart speed and voice boost. He says anybody is welcome to copy those features,
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:52.160]   but you can't call them that. I was kind of interesting. I love it. Marco says, you may think
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:56.160]   I'm a jerk for writing this. I don't know who would think he's a jerk for writing this. He says he
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.960]   was inspired by not only Monument Valley, but Unread and Dash from a couple of other apps were
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:06.800]   revenue numbers are posted. I think this is what I love about the internet economy, this idea that
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:12.400]   you know, it's not going to hurt me until the internet. Everybody kept all this stuff very
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:16.080]   hush hush. Unless you were publicly traded company, it was one of the real arguments against
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:21.280]   being a public traded company. Yeah, it's my boss and insists on putting our reader number at the
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.760]   bottom of every page. And he's like, if it goes down, you know, it's your fault. So why who cares
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:30.000]   if we put the number up there? Yeah, you go. I think it's I think it's eminently healthy for any
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.960]   company to be more transparent about how they operate if because it gives your customers a
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:40.240]   little bit more of understanding and ownership over what you do. And also, they might hesitate
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:45.600]   just a little bit before saying that this person just doesn't get it. I can't tell you about times
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.680]   I've had a conversation with developers where in the back of my mind, I'm saying, gee, I can't
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.840]   believe that you don't have a preset for this and ask them about it. And they say, well, here's why
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.280]   we don't have a preset for that because here's what we'd have to do in order to make it work.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:02.160]   I think that if if Apple's been getting, you know, the a few brick bats in the past
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.840]   couple weeks about how all things used to just work and how they don't work anymore,
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.200]   mostly it's because people forget about the times that Apple things didn't work. But I think
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:14.400]   it's largely because you don't Apple will never do we're thinking about doing an eyeglass wearable
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.480]   computer. We're going to make about 10,000 of these and sell them to people who are really eager
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.400]   to try them out. Maybe we'll make them into a product. Maybe we won't say, okay, year later,
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:26.720]   we're not going to continue to do this. Apple never does that. They always present the big dog
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.320]   and pony show. We've been working on this for three years and now it's perfect. Now it's wonderful.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:35.120]   And now you're welcome because here's our latest perfect product. I think that I think that people
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:40.080]   would have a better opinion of Apple if they understand just how much they work to decide that
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:43.840]   no, we're not going to have a home button and then something else next to it. It's just going to be
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:51.200]   the home button on this device. And that's it. In other related developer news, Apple's Swift
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:47:00.080]   is apparently getting some traction. Red Monk does a language ranking out of a stack overflow
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:06.000]   and each, I guess it's been two quarters. So maybe each half year, they tell you which programming
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:12.480]   languages are most popular on GitHub and stack overflow. Two of the most used programmer sites
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:17.520]   stack overflow is where programmers gather to talk. And of course, GitHub is where they gather to
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:23.440]   store their stuff. Here's a fabulous chart, which you probably can't see.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:30.960]   But Swift is, huh? This looks like a magic quadrant. Magic quadrant. It looks like an XKCD cartoon.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:38.400]   Holy cow. So the X is popularity on GitHub by number of projects. The Y is popularity on stack
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:44.320]   overflow by number of tags. And you could see, you know, the most popular on both is Java, I'm sad
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:51.440]   to say Nimrod seems to be one of the least popular languages familiar with that. But Java JavaScript
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:57.680]   C plus C sharp brother, PHP Python, C++ CSS objective, which isn't really a language, but we'll leave
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:02.640]   it in there objective CC and Ruby. But Swift is coming on. What are you laughing at?
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:07.600]   No, I just I can't help but look from like my favorite language, Apple script. And then I can
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:13.600]   see where Fortran is way, way above that on both. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:14.040]   Oh, dear.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:20.080]   Oh, tran, or tran who's using that anymore. Swift is right here kind of high up on the
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:25.280]   graph right next to groovy closure action script and assembly language. Thank you.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:29.920]   And MATLAB MATLAB is pretty popular among the stack overflow folks.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:36.960]   Common list is kind of an outlier there popular on GitHub, but you know, you don't see a lot of
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:43.440]   people talking about it on stack overflow. Don't know why I can't see logo. Where's logo logo?
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:49.280]   I just got a robot that I can that I can program. It has a pen. It's just kind of like turtle
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:55.760]   graphics all over again, but you have to do it in C plus plus. It's like what? What? Nevertheless,
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:02.560]   Swift has apparently been coming on strong, which is which is good news. So is so are Julia and Rust.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:06.560]   So it jumped like 46 places, I think. Yeah. The last. Yeah.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:13.120]   Find that fascinating. Congrats to Chris Latner and the compiler team. During our last ranking
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:18.640]   which was listed as the language to watch an obvious choice given status as the Apple and
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:27.520]   money successor to the number 10 language on our list Objective C. But yeah, it's 46 spots. It went
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:37.280]   from 68 to 22 on the list. Now one spot behind coffee script and just ahead of Lua. And if you
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:42.480]   not a programmer, you must just be laughing right now at the names the programmers choose for those
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:49.440]   languages. Coffee script actually is going down, which is interesting. It was a JavaScript
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:50:00.080]   kind of compiler alternative created JavaScript. And Google's App Store, the Google Play Store,
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:08.080]   and developer community has also been growing. In fact, in 2014, according to app figures grew
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:16.960]   faster than Apple. That's for the for the, uh, exceeds the developer community for Google Play,
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:22.240]   exceeded apples for the third year in a row, 388,000 different developers. Now the number of
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:27.360]   developers, I don't know if that's a meaningful stat, but it is a larger raw number.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:33.520]   Overall app development is also on the rise with all three app stores growing by at least 50%
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:38.240]   last year. But through the three are Apple, Google and Amazon.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:46.640]   Okay. Apple, Google and Amazon. And actually, you know, even Amazon's beating the app store in terms
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:52.320]   of growth. Well, growth is an acceleration measure though. If you have a small percentage
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:56.960]   and you grow them, yeah, that's right. If you want to hear the total number of developers by
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:05.280]   app store, blue is iOS, green is Google Play, orange is Amazon. You could see the shift
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:09.440]   happened in 2012. That's when Google for the first time started beating iOS.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.880]   We used to joke about this that, you know, people said there was, there has to be a third
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.240]   ecosystem. It's going to be Windows. It's going to be Blackberry. And the joke was,
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:20.720]   it's going to be other Amazon. And whether you talk about devices and you have a Chinese
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:24.160]   Android and regular Android, we talk about app stores and you have Google Play and Amazon,
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:28.160]   it turns out Android really is the third ecosystem as well as the system.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:33.600]   Yeah. It's amazing that there that Windows is doing such a bad job of getting developers to
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:38.800]   embrace multi-touch. There, there's still, again, wonderful desktop apps, but you get out of Surface
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:43.120]   3 and you're like, great, I'm using all these Windows apps. Now let's look at these wonderful
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:48.080]   multi-touch things that I can run. I'm like, oh, there's, there's a text editor. Okay.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:54.320]   It's just, it's not like this has been a new phenomenon. Like the modern interface has
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.520]   been around for a couple of years now. And you would have thought that there'd be some sort of
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:03.040]   uptake, but nothing now. I confess, it's a little frustrating. You know, this, I have a Nokia
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:08.160]   Lumia 1520 in my hand and it's actually a really six inch phone, right? They're great. They're
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:15.680]   great phones. I love the UI. I think that they know how to, this interface is better suited for
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:22.240]   handheld use than I think any other UI that's out there in terms of, gimme, I'm going to wake
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:26.320]   this thing up. I want to get something done in five to 10 seconds and then put it back down again.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:30.320]   I don't think that you're going to do better than what they've got there, but the apps just
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:34.560]   aren't there. And part of it is big, small part of it is because Google just says we're not going
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.160]   to build anything native for it, but not ever thought, not the whole world is Google native apps.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:44.000]   If they can't get developers to really embrace this, it has, it certainly has to do with something
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.320]   with maybe the two to five percent market share, depending on how you calculate it. But man,
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:52.640]   they're just not getting that those, what you, what you, I would have expected to see is, I guess
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:58.000]   what I'm getting at is that I would have expected to see one of those. Here's the crazy one sort of
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.400]   developers that this operating system just completely speaks to them and they're going to do something
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:06.640]   great. They're going to make a monument valley sort of thing, whether it's a product, a gamer
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:11.680]   productivity app, and even that is so hard to find on Windows Phone. There's two things for that.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:15.360]   Like on one hand, Blackberry, they had a very small market share too. And instead of fighting
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:20.080]   for BB10, they just added the Amazon App Store now. So there's a tiny little amount of that Amazon
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:24.320]   App Store stuff that's probably Blackberry. But also, I think all those artisanal developers,
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:28.080]   like the Lauren Brickers and like the Markowar months, they were historically Mac developers and
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:33.280]   they naturally gravitated towards iOS, where the Windows install base was enterprise or people
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:37.920]   making a lot of different kinds of apps that didn't lend themselves that sort of artisanal
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.280]   popular support of a new platform from that same company.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:46.640]   You know, we have actually, I think, two different Twit Apps on here, Dimitri Leolens,
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:52.800]   Twit, and then there's something called Twit Radio. Twit now, actually there's three,
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.840]   four, compulsive technologies, Twit 5, Twit View,
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:02.080]   six, Twit.tv. So there are quite a few, interestingly, quite a few Twit Apps on here.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:10.960]   And I think that's because it isn't hard to develop for. But I think if you're running for the larger
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:16.800]   market, you consider the number of units sold, which is very small. The focus Microsoft's made
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:21.840]   on not growing in the premium end. They're not, they haven't, this is the last high end phone they
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:27.040]   released. It's a year old. Most of the new phones, all the new phones are aimed at the third world
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:31.520]   at developing nations at markets where there's not a lot of money to be made in app development.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:35.280]   Their community is amazingly like there's that many Twit Apps because of Windows weekly and
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.480]   people love when they weekly they make Twitter. We have a Windows Central app. We have a,
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:42.960]   we have a, if they can put up a post about a Facebook bug update on Windows Central and 800
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:47.520]   people will comment in five minutes. I've never seen a community like that, but it is exactly what
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:50.480]   you said. It's not a community that's being targeted by traditional developers.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:58.560]   Also Microsoft has, frankly, pissed off developers over time by adding APIs, changing APIs, changing,
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:04.560]   their strategy. It's, I think a number, I won't speak to developers, but I think a number,
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:08.880]   I would guess a number of developers are a little cheesed off at Microsoft and said,
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:14.000]   I want to go somewhere where A, I can make money, but B, I don't have to relearn everything every year.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:20.160]   I don't know. I think it's the third platform problem here, which is,
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:24.720]   costs a lot of money to develop apps. If you're a business that's targeting a broad,
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.000]   a broad audience and you're like, all right, well, we're going to go on the iPhone first.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.360]   We're going to go iOS first. Most businesses make that decision. All right, but we've got to do
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:37.520]   Android. There are lots of Android devices out there. So we've got to do that next. So now we're
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:41.360]   going to do that. And then you get to the point where you say, all right, now what do we spend our
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:46.560]   money on? Do we go back to iOS? Do we maintain iOS and Android or do we go and develop a Windows
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:51.200]   phone app? And I think in a lot of those cases, they're just saying we would rather put more money
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:56.160]   into our iOS and Android apps because we have to be there and we've gotten along with our
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:01.680]   Windows phone for now. It's not that big an audience. And it's a tough place to be, to be number three.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:07.520]   There's Windows 10 event day too, which is ironic. Yeah, tomorrow. Well, and that's kind of where
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:13.920]   I'm seguing tomorrow, Windows 10, the consumer preview will be announced and there's a full day
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:20.080]   of stuff. We'll be covering it live starting a little before 9 a.m. Pacific 12 noon Eastern time.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:27.920]   And then TNT will probably continue running the coverage because normally Windows weekly it'd be
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:36.160]   11 a.m. our time. But both Paul Thorett and Mary Jafoli are in Redmond for that announcement and
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:39.680]   are going to be getting briefed in the afternoon and private briefings. There will be a live stream
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:44.160]   from Microsoft in the morning and we'll come on. We'll do a Windows weekly right after T&2 at about
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:51.520]   4 30 p.m. Pacific 730 Eastern time 2430 UTC tomorrow. So we will be talking about Windows 10 and presumably
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:56.560]   we'll see. But presumably Microsoft talk about another very important part of their strategy,
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:03.360]   which is to eliminate kind of or merge Windows RT, which was their very strange arm based version
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:08.240]   of Windows 8. That's the version that doesn't run anything. And it was just weird and then merge
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:12.480]   that with Windows phone and then going forward and Satya Nadella said this a number of times
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:17.840]   there'll be one Windows. And so I think it's going to be very interesting to see that strategy.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:24.080]   It may be that mobile is over for Microsoft in that way. If an Apple strategy. Yeah, I know the
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:30.240]   opposite. But they, you know, but Apple doesn't have what Microsoft has that they do have a design
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:34.960]   language that really is portable across multiple size screens. Google has the same. But that's what
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:40.240]   that's exactly what Microsoft's now trying to do, aren't they? Yeah, but it's I think that maybe
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:43.840]   they're trying to make a play where they're not going to try to get I think they're trying to get
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:51.520]   Windows users to buy Windows phones, not because they not be not to traditionally we think about
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:55.680]   phones as a totally separate entity from the desktop experience or even our tablet experience.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:58.960]   I think that they're really trying to sell hard the fact that no, you have one device that runs
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:02.080]   one operating system. Why would you not want to have a phone that runs the exact same thing as
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:09.920]   your desktop does? And if they can do if if if they can do one experience that seamlessly transcends
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:14.720]   every single piece of hardware better than Apple does, maybe the maybe Windows users who still are
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:19.600]   predominantly the most significant users on the planet right now. The next time they want to buy
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:25.520]   a phone when they're in that AT&T or Verizon store, they see, wow, this Android phone and this iOS device
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:30.400]   can't do what this Windows phone can do. This will solve a problem in my life. And since I'm not,
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:34.480]   I just came I just came in with a blank slate wanting to spend $200 on a phone because my old
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:39.440]   one is broken. Maybe that's their way in if they do it well. It's not a car. It's not a truck. It's
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:46.000]   a minivan. Yeah. But but look what a great job. This is a I just think for Apple users who have never
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.040]   seen a Windows phone, just looking at the front page where there's live tiles, which give you a
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:57.200]   lot of information is kind of a mix between Apple's static icons and Google's widgets. No,
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:01.040]   they're beautiful. It's beautiful. And then if you go to the Twitter app on here,
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:07.600]   Dimitri has done a great job of making a native Windows phone app that that just does a beautiful
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:14.560]   job of showing off our stuff. I mean, it really is gorgeous. And I it would be a shame. I feel the
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:20.240]   same way about BOS. It's something great. And look at that. Look at that right edge. That's what I
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:24.480]   love about that interface. The idea that it's just quietly showing you, oh, by the way, there's more
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:29.120]   content off to the right if you want to flip over that way. So if you never lost in the sense of
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:33.840]   where have I just been and where do I next go from looking for something? Right. That's why I have
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:39.840]   so much respect for this operating system. It's a little bit heartbreaking that it hasn't become
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:44.880]   even a double digit percentage of the user space out there. I mean, if you
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:50.400]   would understand if if Lumia 1020 had a much better operating system, I'd be because I like
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:56.240]   camera. So great. And this is 1520. But of course, the 1020 is even better. So have the 1020.
[00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.560]   I do understand the like I do understand. And I do like the criticism for Windows phone. For
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:04.400]   example, some people just don't like that those live tiles move. They're used to icons being static
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.320]   because you can immediately recognize them. And if someone's picture changes in their contact,
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:12.320]   and they can't find the person that annoys them and the information density is low and they're
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:16.160]   used to having lines and lines of text and they have to page around a lot. Sure. There's going to be
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.680]   lights. I understand that. Yeah. So it's not for everybody, but for people who do like that
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.600]   displays. And I like the fact that it's different. It really is truly a different take on mobile
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:30.160]   operating systems. It's interesting that Apple has really put their investment in the right
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:34.240]   place about making sure that everybody's first experience with their new piece of hardware is
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:39.840]   the best experience possible. And you can't get any simpler. You can't get any more idiot proof.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.400]   Then here is a grid of icons that represent your apps. Keep scrolling. You will find the app that
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.680]   you want to tap it in order to launch it. And I think that someone who hasn't used Windows
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.040]   phone before will look at that screen and say, Oh my God, it's such confusing mess. I want to
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.560]   have that little grid of icons that I'm familiar with. You get used to it really quickly. But
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:59.920]   and that's the point. I mean, Apple Apple makes sure that the demo experience in your first week
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:03.600]   is going to be great. But an experience like this is after about a month,
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:08.080]   once you get the it's like, Oh, I'm getting so much more done with just a glance than I could.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:11.600]   If this was just a grid of icons from my point of view, the really what killed
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:18.320]   Windows phone is Google by their lack of support for it. They have effectively killed it only because
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:22.240]   I live in the Google interview. They're the everyone company. Oh, they wouldn't do that. Yeah,
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:29.280]   I don't have to wonder. Well, okay. So by the way, now I can with thanks to Microsoft's
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:35.040]   improvements, I can at least get my Google calendar in the calendar, my Google context in the context.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:40.880]   But I use Google voice and Hangouts as my SMS, because I use multiple phones. And it won't support
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:45.360]   that there's no way to support that. So that's extraordinarily frustrating. It means I would use
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:51.360]   this phone as a daily driver, but I can't do you use Cortana. Yeah, Cortana is great. Yeah. And I
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.440]   think that's that's my favorite voice actually. That's the secret. My favorite voice interface
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:00.720]   ever. Yeah, because not not only is it more powerful than Siri, I mean, not only can you do more things
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:06.000]   with it, but also you really they really put a lot more work into developing the character
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.040]   than Apple. Well, they started because she's a halo character. They started with an actual
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:16.400]   character. Right. Siri was ended up at an hour. And this is not the Windows phone show, but
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:22.320]   we bring it up because the distinction is so interesting. And I think it's so telling and it
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.520]   shows how you don't have to be the best or to dominate as an old time Mac user. I listen to
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.760]   you talk about Windows phone. And I think these are the same complaints we always felt about the Mac
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:37.520]   like the 90s. It's like I can't do all these things that my IT people want me to have access to,
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.920]   but I can't do it on my Mac or I can't do it really well. Apple's tried to do something to work
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:45.840]   around it, but there are these pieces that don't aren't supported. And it's so much better than
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:51.520]   the alternative. And yet why is nobody using it? And it's really it's frankly not Microsoft's
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.040]   fault in this case. It sounds like the old Amiga story that I yeah. Yeah, that's true.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:58.880]   Yeah, that's true in there, haven't we? Yeah. Yeah. When you mentioned BOS, which was beautiful
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.920]   too. And it just didn't make it. We're going to take a break. We'll come back lots more Jason Snell
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:15.200]   from six colors dot com. Okay. I got the com which is a great, you know, mixed now of both a personal
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:22.000]   blog, but also you increasingly journalistic coverage of night. Yeah, it's good. Thank you.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   You're doing such a great job. And of course, there's a bunch of podcasts there. I highly recommend
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:32.720]   you click the podcast tab there because you're doing network now. You've got to have many podcasts.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:37.520]   And so and frankly, so does Renee Richie. He does. I don't know why I have these competitors on the
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:43.760]   show. You must leave now and he keep doing the good work. Stop doing don't do any. Wait, he's also
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.600]   doing you also has a podcast. You would factor us Leo. You made us a podcast so much.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:52.320]   Podcasts are great. Renee from imore.com. And of course, they have the great debug podcast among
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:59.920]   others and and Andy in not co of the Chicago Sun times and Andy's all manac on the five by five.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:06.800]   Dan does a great job with that. We had yesterday we had one of the Apple founders on triangulation
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:12.720]   yesterday. It was so much fun. You remember Ron Wayne? People are going, who? Well, there was Steve
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:18.480]   Wozniak. Steve Jobs in runway. Right. Yeah. Everybody knows that. He he's he's actually great. He lives
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:26.000]   in a in a double wide in Parump, Nevada. Sure. Just down the dirt road from Art Bell. And he
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.440]   was adult supervision work with Steve Jobs at Atari. He has some stories about Steve at Atari.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:36.800]   And Jobs and Wozniak had created the Apple one and they said, we need somebody who can do an
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:41.280]   inventory control system, for instance, who can be adult supervision. Ron, you want to participate?
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.960]   Yeah, sure. What the heck? They forwarded the Apple Compute, formed the Apple Computer Company
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:52.880]   and made he drew he was a draftsman. That beautiful Newton, Isaac Newton, Apple logo that Apple never
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:59.920]   used or actually used only for the Apple one. Yeah, that's the the one that's so detailed that
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:04.000]   you would never make a corporate logo. That's what he said is it's it would be a terrible choice
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.800]   for a modern computer, you know, modern computer company. But and what I said to Ron yesterday is
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:18.320]   but it this reflected the kind of quirky position that the computer industry was in at this time.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:22.320]   This was the kind of stuff you'd get. And I think it's quite beautiful. I think he did a
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:26.080]   beautiful job with that. Anyway, Ron Lane, if you haven't heard the triangulation from yesterday,
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:33.120]   he's a gentleman, a smart fellow in his in his 80s now, and sold his stake. He got out. He said,
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:37.840]   I you know, you guys, first of all, it's not a he didn't they didn't incorporate they formed a
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:43.760]   company. So all three members were liable if they got sued. And he says the only one with any assets.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:51.360]   I don't come down on my head if these guys screwed up. So he sold his 10% in Apple back to Steve Jobs
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:58.320]   and Steve was there for 800 bucks. And then later another 1500 bucks giving up all claims on Apple.
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:02.880]   He probably have a little bit of money if he hadn't. But you know what? He's a happy guy.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:07.760]   He said, you know, you make you make your decisions. And he said, I made the best decision I could
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:12.080]   based on the information. Wasn't he always also burned once? And he had done it. He had
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:17.280]   had experience before and it wasn't just yeah. I don't feel he he has many patents. He was
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:23.840]   talking about this. And he did a slot machine company and got ripped off mightily. And he said
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:31.200]   never again. So he he had been burned exactly. And you know what? That's fine. He's a watch the
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:34.000]   interview. I think you'll enjoy it. He was it was really a fun guy.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:40.080]   Our show today brought that's a triangulation and it's available at tb slash tri if you want to get
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:44.800]   our show today brought to you by Squarespace. We love squarespace.com. They just launched version
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:52.240]   seven Squarespace seven completely redesigned interface. So for you as a as the blogger or the
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:57.600]   content creator as the person the photographer the person using Squarespace, you're going to
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:02.240]   love it because it's so easy to create your own professional looking website or online portfolio.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:06.800]   Things like live editing on a single screen. So there's no more you know go back and forth
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:10.800]   toggling with the site manager in the preview mode. You could see exactly how your changes
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:15.200]   will look immediately not just on your screen but on tablets and mobile devices. That's one
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:20.160]   thing Squarespace does so well. Something that that is called mobile responsive design.
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:23.840]   Every site looks great no matter what size screen. This is the way we have to do it now.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:28.000]   No more simple no more separate mobile sites. You got you just got to look good on every
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.080]   size screen. They've added 14 new designs that now you choose from over 30 including templates
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:41.520]   designed for specific professions. So they have a musicians template. They have an artist
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:47.200]   template architects template restaurants e-commerce. They've got one called Fulton that
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.680]   features long scrolling pages with big background images. That's the new style. I think they call
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:58.400]   it parallax in general web designers full with galleries and albums. They're portfolio but if
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:03.440]   you're a photographer they've got a portfolio app that you use in the iPad that pulls images
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:09.440]   from your site for client approval. They also have a note app a metric app that you know not only
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:14.800]   measures visits but also social media follows. The blog app which is available on both iOS and
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:19.760]   Android lets you post content. These guys are knocking it out of the park. If you're a developer
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:25.600]   you'll love the developer platform. It's what Squarespace uses itself. The same coding platform
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:30.800]   that they use internally. That means a lot of agencies use this in the resale Squarespace sites.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:36.160]   Access to Getty Images $10 each pick from thousands of professional Getty Images for your site.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:41.920]   e-commerce of course at all plan levels. Social media it's easy to use and you know it starts at

[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:47.600]   OK more patents. All right all right back to patents. Apple Apple what was the what was it Timothy
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:54.400]   van patent now. Yeah which one 10 squares under appreciated. What was the one that hit the GoPro
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:10:00.800]   stock Apple patented some sort of camera. Yeah sports camera sports camera right again I got a
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:08.160]   point out doesn't mean they're gonna do it. But stock market went whoa. People can make money on
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:15.760]   the news and the rumors Leo. That's right. Yeah. According to fortune Apple's new video camera
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:25.760]   patent sends GoPro share it's into a tail spin 13%. That's not a tail spin. Midday training down
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:33.280]   of 49 45 their lowest level in four months. USPTO published a list of 34 total newly granted patents
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:40.480]   for Apple including one for a wearable video camera that could be hooked up to helmets or scuba masks
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.440]   kind of similar to GoPro. You know what this is the problem. You know I don't know stock market
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.760]   just woke up. But this is the problem with GoPro anybody can make a GoPro GoPro succeeds because
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.680]   they have brilliant marketing. But there's not a product you're a feature right. Right.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:11:01.840]   They do have a significant revenue a billion dollar revenue in 2014 which means I would imagine
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.880]   there are other companies looking at getting in the business. 20 Fidelity runs drop cam now too.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:10.960]   He can he can stay good. Do it. Glass and yeah. He's like Google Glass and drop cam now.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.720]   Do you like them stock. Yeah. We talked about how Marco was smart and put some secret sauce
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:20.160]   in his app overcast. I don't think there's any secret sauce on what GoPro's doing. I mean
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.880]   I've seen dozens of similar things. It's really all about what a great marketing. I do worry
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:30.560]   that GoPro could end up like like the flip right. Right. Which was a huge product and it got
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:34.000]   bought out and died because it was really something that was kind of rupple with the
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.200]   app and other technology. This is I recommended this last week on the show. This is the HTC
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:45.440]   RE which is basically the flip phone or the flip camera camera. Yeah. Reinvented as a periscope.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:51.200]   I'm going to review it on before you buy today. Actually I it's a little overpriced. It's like
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:56.400]   179 bucks. It could be used kind of like a GoPro. But what's cool about it and they just added
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:01.600]   this feature is you can stream live to YouTube so I can push a button right now. See it on my
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:07.600]   phone and literally we'd be live on YouTube right now. You can stream the stream Leo. I can
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:12.000]   stream the stream. I've done that actually. If you go to youtube.com/leolaport I think that's the
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.080]   name of it. I think that's my YouTube personal YouTube channel. It is a bit of a creepy looking
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.720]   form factor though. Well it kind of says I'm a camera. I'm looking at you. Well it kind of looks
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:26.320]   like an inhaler. It could be an inhaler. It's like that's what I think. Yeah. Sirreptitious.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:31.600]   Yeah. And then like we're around a little bit. We're the thing that Indiana Jones
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:38.400]   hidden in the Bantu win with the Nazis. Exactly. There it is. That's me streaming some other
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:43.600]   show quality video. Actually this show last week. But it's really intriguing. And the audio is good.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:46.800]   It's a little it's very wide but that makes it easy to aim because there's no viewfinder.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.640]   Going back to GoPro. It's interesting how much the cache matters. Like beats is just a headphone
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.400]   company. But it had all the cache of beats. And so that's worth billions of dollars. That's a
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:01.280]   perfect example actually. Yeah. There's no special technology in any of these things.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:06.720]   Well there's also the reliability that people associate. If I'm going to be putting this camera
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:10.800]   in a really really dangerous situation. We know the track record of this company. I don't think
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:15.440]   it's necessarily the same category of as flip either because remember that phones took out
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.800]   every code. I was in that space. Every single I can't list how many companies were making these
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:25.520]   like flip kind of knockoffs. And the phones just took out all of them. Right. But there's but there's
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.920]   still the need for I want a camera that will just simply work that can bolt it. I'm not going to
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:36.000]   bolt your phone to the side of a car. You're not going to carry a you're not going to let your
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:43.280]   phone let go go kayaking with you. You see that great video of the rate of control glider that
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:48.640]   crashes into a reef. And before they record destroyed the entire plane but the camera was running. So
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:52.720]   you just see all these turtles just sort of investigating the camera and swimming off. And
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:57.280]   that's every time that something like that gets posted some things. Oh, such a nearly $50. Maybe
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:02.160]   I should buy one of those. Yeah. Such good advertising. Maybe they should have done that with a flip
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:09.280]   camera. They would have they would have survived. So patent to I don't know if it's a patent.
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:15.680]   Apple likely to launch a simple stylus. Do they have a patent for it to for this is this would be
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:23.760]   for the rumored 12.9 inch iPad. This is this is everything Steve Jobs said. They were going to
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:33.280]   a giant iPad pro industry analyst with a strong track record says that there is a apple patent
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:41.120]   filing. There will be a stylus for it. This is a Ming chi quo. We've talked about Ming chi quo
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:49.200]   a lot of KGI securities said that the recent numerous recent patents filed by apple and his own
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:55.280]   research lead him to believe there will be a stylus launched with a iPad pro. We've talked
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:00.400]   before we've given you the Renee Richie disclaimer that analysts have a different constituency than
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:04.880]   actual journalists. But this is credible yesterday.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:09.840]   Ming chi quo has got an interesting track record when it comes to things in supply chain he has
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.000]   very good information when it comes to things that are obvious. He has incredibly good information
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.200]   when it comes to stuff that's speculative. He's hit or missed as anybody else. But I think Apple
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.360]   did patent the stuff and there's an argument to me that people are using styluses. Why wouldn't
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:28.320]   they use an apple stylus? And the thing with Steve Jobs is it's more to remember that he's talking
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:33.680]   as a master marketer. He's not talking to somebody who's disclosing product information. And when Apple
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:36.960]   makes something it's the same way they don't have arrow keys on the original Mac. They don't want
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:42.160]   people porting CLI apps, command line apps over to the Mac. They want them to rethink it. And so when
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:47.280]   you make a multi-touch device you don't allow multi-window apps. You don't allow styluses. You
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:52.400]   promote the finger and people using apps that make the finger. But then it's absolute use the finger.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:56.480]   But then at a certain point you get to the you make a larger screen device and you want to appeal
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:00.160]   to artists or to people who take handwritten notes. And you can do that with third party
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:04.560]   styluses. But the thing about Apple frameworks is they always work best when it's Apple people
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:09.440]   who hit the bugs first and Apple people who have to ship a product first. And so if Apple starts
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:13.840]   making an Apple pen so to speak, that'll benefit everybody in the stylus community.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:21.200]   And there are a lot of stuff there are according to this Apple and Center article dozens. And I
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:26.320]   think that's probably accurate of Apple stylus third party styluses. This is clearly a market
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:31.280]   that's it's it's it's been a damn shame that the iPad has not had one because I mean the
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:36.080]   the the the surface three tablet but the surface one was not a fantastic
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:41.760]   fantastic computer but the fact that it had a you know 1024 pressure sensitive wing
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:47.520]   compatible stylus to it meant that how many artists bought their first Windows machines because
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:52.320]   I have this portable drawing drawing unit. So that's something the iPads never been which is
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:57.360]   pressure sensitive. You can think about if you think that the pro will be. I think that I think
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:00.320]   that I think they're missing it. I think they're missing a trick if they don't make this a
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:04.800]   creation tool that people can actually draw with. Also they're starting to run out of ways in which
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:11.120]   to make these larger sized iPads emphatically the right choice for a certain group of people
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:14.880]   because most people are using them in ways where they much rather have something that's smaller
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:19.440]   and more compact competitors are making tablets that are smaller and more compact and having a
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:24.400]   lot more a lot more use out of them. And if you want to continue to sell a multi touch device like
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:28.320]   that with a larger form factor you have to say here's why you want to have the 10 inch version
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:32.720]   or the 13 inch version because there are things you can do with a pen creatively that you cannot
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:39.360]   do with your mere fingers. That said the the big advantage of the iPad is always going to be the
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:44.480]   Apple library and so long as that never changes there's not a whole lot of rush for Apple to keep
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:48.160]   reinventing this thing. Oh but it's interesting to me because my background is an art and I used
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:52.640]   Wacom tablets for years when I worked in design and there's just no equivalent it's why the Galaxy
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.880]   Note is so good. It's the world's smallest Wacom tablet that you can fit in your pocket.
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:00.960]   They're actually using Wacom digitized. They are and the digitizer is what makes the difference.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:04.480]   At 10 one and a donnet and those companies have done a really good job using Bluetooth and
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.040]   Palm rejection and trying to fake it but you can tell it's just not the same. So whether Apple
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.960]   Apple if they're going to do a pen I really hope they either do a digitizer or they have some new
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.120]   technology that she uses the same results as a digitizer because that Tandy's point that really
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:21.920]   does separate it again. It's not about a big phone or a small tablet. It's about a big canvas. It's
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.560]   something that I can use a laptop but I'm an artist or someone who takes notes in a boardroom.
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:31.040]   Neil Seibert who used to be Sammy the walrus on Twitter. He's a cell site analyst. I believe
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:34.720]   it was a cell site analyst. He made a great comment about how useful it would be in enterprise and
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:39.120]   in education and in creative industries. I was talking to somebody in the medical industry who
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:42.880]   said how much they would love to be able to use because they all have like their hospital is
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:46.400]   just filled with iPads. Everyone gets issued an iPad and if they could have a really good
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:50.640]   stylus with it too it'd be super useful for marking up all the different medical stuff that they look
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.800]   at. It seems like there's a lot of used people could get out of that sort of technology.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:19:00.320]   And the software's already there. That's the beauty of it. The apps are already there
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:04.160]   that would take advantage of it instantaneously. It's just an issue of you want,
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:08.720]   you don't want to be drawing on a device. Up to now you're drawing on a device that's made for
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:12.480]   fingers and the pens are just acting like fingers and that's not good enough.
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:18.320]   Would Apple have to do some sort of pressure sensitive library and then these apps would
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:21.440]   have to be updated with it? I'd hope so just because it would make it easier for the developers.
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:29.920]   All it's really about is palm rejection. You can draw on a fingertip but the thing is like
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:38.480]   this is a bit more precise than this other thing. The amount of times that I've sketched on my iPad
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:44.800]   and it's like the time you have to basically say I'm going to have to do a Zoom action just to put
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:49.600]   this one piece of detail in exactly the place I wanted. That sort of takes you off of the
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:54.880]   go-gone by the stream with this little watercolor pad image that you really want to have when you're
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:20:01.360]   sort of in that kind of zone. I just think it's for Apple not to have a pen digitizer.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:03.360]   I really think they're leaving money on the off the table.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:08.240]   Technologically what's interesting is that multi-touch is not too dimensional.
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:12.960]   Multi-touch is a radiant field and there is some three-dimensionality to it. Some companies like
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:18.160]   Nokia use it or Samsung use it to let you do hover gestures or to use it when there's gloves on
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:23.200]   because it can tell fingers at a distance. Apple has used it before to determine what finger you're
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:27.520]   using. It can tell that your one finger is touching the screen but the other three are folded back
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:32.240]   behind it. So it's most likely your index finger or your ring finger and they've used it for palm.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.680]   There's a whole bunch of stuff they use it for algorithmically to make the multi-touch experience
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:39.760]   better but when you have that sort of, it makes you wonder what else they can do with this if you
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:45.040]   start combining it with the force press technology in the watch or there's different things that
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.800]   can do a lot of interesting things if they start to broaden out what multi-touch does.
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:52.880]   I didn't realize that. So Samsung when it's doing that hover pen thing that's just part of a
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:57.760]   multi-touch digitizer. It's a choice of what you want to interpret and how you want to interpret
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:01.360]   it. Same with the Nokia. You can wear gloves on your touchscreen thing.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:07.200]   It'd be great to have context-sensitive, context menus and context help just by simply hovering
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:13.920]   over a button. That's still one of the limitations but one of the things that makes
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:18.400]   phones a little bit more difficult to use because you cannot get a hint on what something does
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:23.440]   until you actually activate this whole layer of help annotations or just press the button and hope
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:27.600]   that it doesn't do anything that you're going to regret. The hover stuff is weird because
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:31.360]   Fitts' law for multi-touch is that when you hit a glass surface that's the easiest gesture and if
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:35.120]   you have to hold your finger off it kind of vibrates a little bit and you're too close or you're too
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:41.680]   far. But if you the watch again you do a force press and it gives you what's in essence of a
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:45.680]   right mouse click context menu. So there's all sorts of ways to implement that. That's interesting.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:52.480]   We've all heard the rumors that Apple might be thinking about going to arm for Macintosh or at
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:57.520]   least doing some arm-based Macintosh. This apparently so has the CEO of Intel Brian Krasnich was
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:06.080]   interviewed on CNBC on Friday and the host said or asked whether he thought Apple might eventually
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:13.600]   drop Intel chips from the Mac in favor of its own arm-based processors. Krasnich said I just
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:21.600]   hear the same rumors. Wow that's unusually uh that's right. Our relationship with Apple is strong.
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:25.920]   Their products are great. Apple's always going to choose the supplier who can provide them the
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.600]   most amount of capability and innovation for them to build on for them to innovate.
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:37.360]   They're a company based on innovation. Our job is to continue to deliver parts that have that
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.880]   capability to give them that and that are better than our competitors and then they want to use
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:45.760]   our parts. So I wake up every morning making sure that across the board whether it's Apple or
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:50.320]   Lenovo or Dell or any of our customers we have to provide the most competitive part.
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:58.480]   He's not exactly shaking in his boots. Well I mean he's one of the few people who knows.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:03.040]   Do you think he actually knows like Apple go uh Tim Cook calls him up and says
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:06.560]   hey by the way just want to let you know in 2015 no more Intel. There's no there's a
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.160]   heart there's a lot to decompress in this because Apple again Apple's a company that
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:13.680]   has prototyped almost anything you could think of. Anyone on the web has says
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:17.520]   Apple should do this. Apple has likely done this had a bunch of people try it out and made an
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:21.920]   informed opinion about whether it's a prototype or whether it should be a product and that includes
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.400]   ARM our max especially low like things like a MacBook Air running ARM running iOS all these
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:31.520]   different things but you know make designing a chip is one thing getting these chips produced
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:35.840]   in mass quantity is another thing that Apple's not a fab their design company and producing
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:40.480]   millions and millions of chips as we saw like one of the rumors is that we don't have an iPad
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:45.760]   mini 3 with the same specs as an iPad Air 2 is because they simply couldn't make enough Apple
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:50.080]   A.H. chips this year to satisfy all those devices and we started adding max into it could they
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:55.120]   produce enough high-end ARM chips to supply iOS devices and you know do they want to become a
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:00.960]   foundry how would they handle compatibility with Windows apps with it's a really huge question
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:06.480]   but I don't put it past Apple to say hey you know Intel how are those Broadwell chips doing is it
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:10.320]   going to be another few months to late because we've got this stuff in the lab and man is it
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:14.560]   power efficient and boy is it getting powerful oh we'll be ready next month thank you well that's
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:20.800]   one question I have because I did just buy the new Broadwell based Dell which is very much like
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:26.960]   a MacBook Air it's very light great battery life etc etc and it's unusual for and we mentioned
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:31.600]   this last week it's unusual for somebody besides Apple to have the first shipment of chips and make
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:37.760]   the first notebooks based on a new Intel platform and Apple has not I in you told me Renee I bought
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:41.760]   the Dell because you told me don't wait for Apple to do a Broadwell based MacBook Air
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:47.760]   well not this month I meant what it'll be this year I thought you meant like next
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:52.480]   real person time Lio la port time is going to be forever forever I can't wait
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:57.840]   well yeah and I do want to review the Broadwell you platform and all of that stuff and this is not
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:03.600]   a faster chip it's just but more efficient chip I do I so you feel like there will be see what's
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:06.880]   interesting about this Dell and I'll we'll do a review as soon as it comes but what is interesting
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:12.160]   about the Dell is it's a retinitis play basically in a MacBook Air form factor it is a
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:19.840]   13 inch display the thing is as small as your 11 inch MacBook Air and and lighter so the whole
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:24.320]   thing is quite intriguing and that's the rumor about that 12 inch MacBook Air right that looks
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:28.400]   very much like that same kind of product concept picture of the MacBook Air you know
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:33.840]   of course the thing that was most interesting about the MacBook Air and we talked about that also
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:40.480]   on a show this week but I can't remember is this new USB port the single port on the MacBook Air
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:45.600]   when were we talking about that was that which show was that this show last last week maybe was it
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:51.440]   like well I know we talked about last week somebody talked about the idea that this made sense
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:56.640]   that we were rapidly moving into I guess it was on Twitter on Sunday it was probably Ben Thompson
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:01.920]   of stratecary stratecary that would made sense for Apple not it contrary to our reaction which is
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:09.760]   what there's one port for power for USB for Thunderbolt for monitor one port on on the whole thing
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.240]   there's not even a separate power port one port and he said no this makes a lot of sense because
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:18.160]   what we're doing is we're moving away from the notion that the computer is a hub it doesn't
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:23.440]   it isn't a hub anymore it's one of many devices that you have and Apple's very good at being
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:29.680]   aggressive at pushing toward where it's going even though it may not be quite there yet yeah yeah
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:36.640]   I don't know it's like maybe maybe the computer isn't a hub but people still need to occasionally
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.760]   put a camera card into something or not allowed no more it's it's I don't know it's
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:48.240]   that's well that's that's exactly what I was saying it makes sense as your lightweight accessory
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:53.520]   that it's it makes sense if you anticipate that this user is never going to want to plug
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:59.200]   attach anything to this whatsoever that they aren't even going to be really that interested in finding
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:03.280]   a power port in the middle of the day because whatever the battery life is going to be for this
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.320]   they're not going to be sitting down to use this for six or seven hours straight
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:10.800]   and that's that's why I go back to what I've been saying from the beginning which is
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:15.840]   as I keep looking at this holds up in my own mind that for 500 bucks this is a hell of a product at
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:23.760]   $600 it's an interesting product at $900 it's what's the point yeah I definitely I definitely
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:29.200]   don't agree with that um this feels to me this rumored 12 inch MacBook Air feels to me like a
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:34.640]   it is a thousand dollar or $1,100 product and I think I mean if it's retinue this is very yeah
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.560]   and this is a very with the cramped keyboard and with all the other crap they put into this but
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:43.200]   you know you you're talking to a guy who's using the lemon inch MacBook yeah so so this is but
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.200]   it has but it has but it's good oh well so this is a very apples sort of thing to do I think
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:52.320]   what if there's no bezels on this screen it were a retina to screen and went all the way to the
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:56.560]   edge and it was 13 inches in the same form factor people have said they've who've held the del
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:00.960]   it's so light it feels like there's nothing it's crap that there's nothing in it and I mean I
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:05.280]   guess my argument might be in hand on your 11 that's fine okay you're gentle um the
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:12.880]   the argument is that apple apple is always going with the air if you think about the original air
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:19.360]   it was pushing it too hard right it was not ready it was too thin it was it was that also an 11
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:24.240]   it dropped at one USB port now it was 13 but it dropped it dropped down to one USB port which
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:30.960]   was painful but I feel like the MacBook Air now is so fully functional that um apple if this
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:34.880]   and then we've gone through wireless in so many ways exactly your iPhone used to have to be
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:39.920]   connected to iTunes via USB cable so I don't disagree with Andy in saying perhaps you would
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:44.480]   want to plug in a USB device perhaps you would want to plug in a card but I can also see apple
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:48.400]   saying ah you're gonna just take pictures with your iPhone right you don't need it it'll sync
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:53.280]   in through the cloud and and that leads you to an interesting place where that product is a
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:59.520]   super portable thing the first generation everybody kind of groans about it but then by the second
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.600]   or third generation everybody's like oh actually this is great that's what that product feels like
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:08.320]   to me and it does feel like well that they'll keep the other air's around and drop their prices and
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:14.240]   let this one kind of settle in as a retina device on uh i mean i'll have a hundred or something i
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:17.840]   can certainly agree with that also we forgetting that the first MacBook Air was like eight it's
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:21.440]   eighteen hundred dollars was it eighteen hundred dollars and then an extra thousand if you wanted
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:27.920]   the SSD yes wow and it was just it was just i forgot that it was just it was just for a 60
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:32.880]   gig SSD but then i'm sure i bought it immediately right but the thing is it's like um people
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:39.280]   people often laugh at apples competitors because you know they got into they see the
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.520]   thing is that's what apple does so well they don't get into the market when the market is not ready
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:46.960]   for something they do they they make sure they got this thing right they'll get they won't get
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:51.040]   their first but they'll get there with the right product the macbook air is one of those
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:55.280]   counter examples it says no it was a crappy computer it was it was not that they it's not
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:59.360]   that they took them two years to refine it it's because that they released it two years too early
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:05.200]   they were selling these things to people who were really really desperate for something that
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:10.320]   thin and light because there was so much pain associated with that when i look at the and again
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:16.480]   we are of course in my in my column about this i were i i refer to this as the hypo mac just to
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:20.400]   make sure that people realize we're talking about a hypothetical device and not something that
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:25.360]   you know and saying every when i when i look at all those specs i also say that so i'm going to
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:32.640]   spend $1,200 on a machine that has a cramped like subsized keyboard too and you go through the
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:38.800]   list of all the things that they that being described by uh by mark german and you're saying so not only
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:43.600]   do i not going to have ports i can get around i can i can live in a world in which i don't have i don't
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:48.640]   use those ports but the trackpad is not going to have a click response so it's just going to be
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:53.120]   nothing but touch and the number two that's a little weird isn't it that's a little weird
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:57.600]   yes this this just again i'm not i'm not reviewing a product i haven't tried this is not even this
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:02.640]   doesn't exist a rumor rumor rumor but this sounds like a real piece of crap and this is the thing
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:06.960]   where andy and i actually are in agreement because i think what what what i'm saying is i totally
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:11.280]   see this as a product apple would make and andy saying yeah but it doesn't sound very good and
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:15.920]   it'll take them two years to get it right and i think maybe that's all true i think maybe that's
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:21.120]   yeah we're we're up for another macbook air that's like super aggressive like we're going to be as
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:25.680]   thin and light as possible and it's only going to have one port and you'll like it and and that
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:29.680]   you're one thing about the macbook air originally although it took two years to get there they weren't
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:35.200]   wrong about the decisions they made they were too early and i feel like this may be that again too
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:39.760]   which is ports yeah who needs them and the macbook pro has ports if you want well on that on that
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:44.400]   same basis windows phone is also the right decision and now the iphone is wrong just microsoft has got
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:51.120]   there early i mean the difference is the macbook air became successful at the end of the day i'm
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:56.080]   recommending real things for people who might actually spend real money to use it and i'm all
[01:31:56.080 --> 01:32:01.600]   i'm saying is that the hypo mac describes the machine that i'd say if you're super rich and
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:06.720]   twelve hundred dollars is the same as five hundred dollars to you i am sure that this as a really
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:12.960]   super lightweight computer for the times when the 13 inch macbook air is just too much of a burden
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:21.120]   oh my god the 13th let my people go 13th it does sound like not your primary machine but a
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:25.040]   secondary machine unless you're unless you're somebody who is but you're using who is not not
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:29.200]   particularly i mean they're going to be users for whom it's a perfectly good system i but i agree
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:32.880]   with andy it's going to be like that original macbook air it's going to be weird and they're
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:36.480]   gonna be people who would be like this is just not for me are you gonna get a doc
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:42.080]   yeah i was just gonna connect to that new u_s_ which may be part of the story we don't know i do
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:46.640]   wonder if there's a whole other shoe to drop here i wrote a piece about this on six colors and i
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:52.720]   said and i made up the specs but i could i can hear somebody at apple saying oh but we've we've
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:57.920]   engineered the most amazing power maybe it's johnny i'm almost doing it his accent with the most
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:04.000]   amazing power adapter ever it's also a doc and or for fifty dollars you can get could be which it
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.200]   could be there may be a more to the story but i don't think i like that i'm also i'm also i'm also
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:12.560]   i'm also agree with you there too that's that's the other thing the other thing i talk about in this
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:17.680]   column which is that you don't you can't really understand a lot of art when you take it out of
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:22.720]   its context yeah exactly and so it's not until apples not it's it's this would make sense if this
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:28.160]   is and here the here's another service we're releasing uh to the side of this or here is that
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:33.120]   here is that it's designed so that your iphone is still maybe your primary device but this is
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:38.240]   designed because we're putting in ios 8 and uh and you know somebody so many great features for
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:42.160]   making this a seamless experience we don't need to have as many features so again it'll
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:50.320]   folio reboard apple tat tells a story and what mar german reports and he's usually right
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:55.280]   are he's reporting specs he's reporting details but apple is going when they release a product
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:59.040]   because they tell a story and there's probably other parts of the story there's the context you
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:03.840]   nailed it Andy absolutely one thing that's interesting to me is i switched to a mac book i was using
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:07.680]   the macbook air and i switched to a macbook pro because when i traveled i just didn't have enough
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:12.800]   video processing power but it was so hard to make a choice because they were they'd become so close
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:17.600]   together those two systems and the idea behind this and again this is just one prototype and marks
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:21.520]   very clear about this they could go ahead with a different prototype for this device uh is that
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:26.400]   it returns to the roots of the macbook that steve jobs pulled out of that envelope they're trying
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:32.160]   to get into a smaller envelope but it is still much much more different than much different than the
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:36.800]   ipad the macbook pro has become and there's a great comic that rich demons did for us and i'm
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:42.960]   more today um it's on the front page now where it kind of paints that traditional apple dilemma
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:45.920]   and i think absolutely this is going to be a product that evolves over the years but if apple
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:50.000]   doesn't do these sorts of products sometimes they move the industry with them and the price is that
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.240]   you're an early adopter for a few years you're a geek for a few years and then you get the mainstream
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:58.960]   version of the product but it is one of those categories where they can again push push forward
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:02.720]   and when you have handoff and you have extensibility and you have everything that's happening i think
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:08.480]   this product makes a lot more sense is it a cop-out because i love your idea to put to have the power
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:14.720]   brick have usb ports have the ethernet port have a breakaway a magsafe breakaway under the
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:20.400]   display that i love the idea that you just had a power brick that also because that's how you'll
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.880]   connect the power brick is on a seaport right or it's the additional apple pro power brick that's
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.800]   available for an additional 79 dollars it's a cop-out but on the other hand you don't carry it with
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:33.360]   you necessarily and it gives you it could have an SD card reader in it and this is this is the
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:38.000]   difference between i the the language that andy is speaking and i'm speaking which is i'm i'm trying
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.800]   to figure out is this a product and would apple make it and andy's saying like well if they make it
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:46.640]   i don't think anybody should get it and those are not mutually exclusive
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:51.120]   apple apple can do all kinds of crazy stuff i mean there's there's no
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:56.080]   put some of the stuff some of the stuff they do is legitimately bonkers i i still think that the
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:36:02.640]   macbook pro is not one of the best it's certainly the best macbook pro they're making in 2014 but
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:08.400]   it's not a particularly it's a it's a mid-range it's it's a mislabeled mid-range machine i just
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:13.280]   don't know why they i just don't know why they are so fixated on making things smaller and thinner
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:20.400]   as opposed to what if we make this more pleasant to use what if we what if we uh so so again my
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:27.280]   fixation tends to be on okay apple you gotten rid of the the bezel completely you have shrunk
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:31.440]   down that keyboard so it doesn't match the other keyboards this user is going to use
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:37.360]   what are you giving the user that is a practical thing and if you tell me well you know those
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:43.280]   bags that are just too small to hold a 13 inch or an 11 inch air well there you go like
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:47.840]   what i don't know of those well you're welcome i don't see you're welcome i said but Andy you
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:51.680]   could put it in upside down or right side up it could go either way had about now how much would
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:56.720]   you pay i forget who said it but something to really good point like i was walking around ces all week
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:01.440]   with a 13 inch macbook pro on my back and it doesn't sound like much but when you're walking for 12
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:06.720]   hours a day and it's the same thing when you went from the ipad to the ipad air it doesn't seem like
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:11.040]   a big difference but as you hold it up more and when you're reading with it more the difference
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:16.160]   is becomes palpable and there are a certain class of people or certain class of use cases
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:20.880]   and i'm not suggesting it's network like at least at all in any way shape or form but when it gets
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:25.440]   beyond a certain threshold where it will be absolutely and again i forget who said this earlier in the
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:30.400]   week it'll be absolutely invisible in your bag it'll be absolutely invisible on an airplane it'll just
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:35.040]   it'll just feel like you have almost like an ipad with a keyboard with you where you're going
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:41.120]   but running os 10 wasn't it was it steven levi who accidentally recycled his macbook air by putting
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:46.160]   it out with the sun in new york times yeah i think it was yeah i think it was a little bit over
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.040]   melton almost threw it over his head the first time he picked up the prototype because he wasn't
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:54.400]   expecting it to be that light yeah the actually this new del is about it's 2.6 pounds compared to
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:58.720]   2.9 six pounds we thought yes it looks fantastic yeah and he made another point there that i think
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:04.560]   is really valuable which is mark german um or maybe it was rene but you guys are both great uh
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:09.040]   mark german is reporting on what they're working on it may not be what they ship
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:13.440]   yeah that that also even marx says this all the time you know just because this exists doesn't
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:19.760]   mean it's a product lots of rumor reports that end up wrong quote unquote right were accurate to the
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:23.840]   point when they were reported and then things change because things change all the time it'll be
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:28.880]   fascinating to see i i love i mean i think andi would agree with me on this point is fascinating to
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:34.400]   see bonkers things that apple does yeah and this is one of those uh little mental exercises of
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:39.920]   is this so bonkers that they're not going to do i want it or are they going to do it i would buy
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:43.520]   it so fast in fact that's why but the del because i didn't think apple is going to do this too soon
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:48.960]   yeah and i i think i i think that once they have a really cool vision once they have a really firm
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:53.760]   and confident vision of here's what we're going to be doing in 2016 2017 they don't lose any time
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:39:00.640]   enrolling out the hardware they're going to need to make that happen um if if there there's some red
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:11.920]   flag phrases that sometimes i like to argue against and that's so i i i i i i i'm gonna swallow my words
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:15.280]   because i don't want to start an argument not with you people but like with like in other places it's
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:21.920]   like so i've been talking for 30 minutes and remember how just 20 minutes ago you said that android is
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:25.680]   crap because they shipped they shipped a half-baked product that didn't really work they took them
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:30.720]   four revisions to finally get to really works but you were defending this other apple product that
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:35.520]   was also crap for the first three versions and in that case it's because no no they were they
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:39.600]   were they're futurists they're building the future and everybody was catching up to them no they built
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:44.960]   scrap that made a bad bad life for the people who bought it to the poor bastards who spent money
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:51.200]   for this early version of this thing that caught on fire and just insulted their hair and stuff
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:55.920]   like that but we'd be saying hindsight is part of that we'd be saying that about the macbook air now
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:01.360]   if they hadn't it turned out to be a successful product but if it had just flopped and that first
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:05.280]   edition would be what we would remember we'd be saying it was obvious this this couldn't possibly
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:09.360]   have worked with the stakes that i i would never have approved if i were the head of the company when
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:14.080]   yeah we're gonna take a break come back with your picks of the week my friends but first a word
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:20.160]   well snack time snacks snacks snack time how'd you know that Andy you could tell i was looking in snacks

[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:27.760]   Jason's gonna be quiet for a little bit we thank nature box for their support of
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:34.560]   Mac break weekly so Andy and i coke gives us his pick of the week i have an audio related pick i
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:39.600]   have bluetooth headphones have been off my radar pretty much forever because i tried the first
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:43.120]   generation that came out i thought okay that's kind of nice but i don't really need them
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:49.280]   and so i when i started to get back into realizing that you know it's it's winter and i've got a
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:54.800]   coat i've got a scarf and i've got like my my ipad or my laptop bag sling song over my
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:59.360]   my shoulder and i also maybe have a camera around my neck and i've just been over the past years
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:03.520]   just been beaten down to the idea of of well of course i'm just gonna have to like pull everything
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:09.760]   off of my head and then just like cut my headphones free from that tangle but i finally found a
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:13.760]   pair of bluetooth headphones i really really like they're from lg they're called the tone pro
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:18.320]   they make two or three different ones in the line these are like medium kind of grade and
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:23.280]   these cost about the list price is 69 bucks what i love about them is the design where all the
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:28.880]   electronics and all of the batteries are in this in this little collar that you just wear around
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:32.320]   your neck just like that and you don't have to have it above your clothes you have it underneath
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:37.840]   your clothes and when you just want to listen you just pop these earbuds free they're held in place
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:42.080]   by magnets and you can have just one in your ear if you're just listening to something mono you
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:46.960]   want to listen to traffic while you walk you can have both of them in and listen to stereo there are
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:52.560]   also push buttons here for like answering or rejecting a call but next track volume stuff like this
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:58.720]   and when you're not using it like these just click into the magnets and you just don't even
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:04.000]   notice that you're wearing these when i got these last week the week before the second day like i
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.480]   didn't realize that i have been wearing them for 13 hours until at the end of the day i was getting
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:11.600]   ready for bed and i you know pulled off my sweater and this thing just sort of clacked
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:16.480]   onto the floor because it was just so light and even though i said i was i was i was getting them
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:22.240]   they sound very very good about they're these are 70 dollar headphones list price they they probably
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:27.120]   because they're bluetooth and because they're earbuds they sound about as good as maybe 30 or
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:34.720]   40 dollar wired headphones but that's nothing compared to how well the battery will last
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:38.960]   a good i'm getting a good eight or nine hours per charge and it recharges in right about an
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:44.000]   hour or two and they've really made me into a convert and the other thing i should mention is that
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.600]   you know i'm wearing a ball cap now but you know i often wear like a hat with a brim and i can't wear
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:53.520]   like over the head headphones while i'm walking because it doesn't fit under the hat and i can't
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:57.760]   also there's also the other popular design is the kind where there's like like a band that goes
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:02.800]   like across the bottom the back of your skull into the front and because like i had like a big melon
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:07.760]   like it's it's perfectly comfortable so long as i like walk like this but as soon as i lift my
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:13.680]   head up it's like cuts into my ears right these would be good for working out too right yeah i mean i
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:19.040]   just love them now the now i should i have to give a couple of warnings though there is an
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:26.400]   absolutely perfect uh chinese knockoff of these headphones and there are a lot of counterfeits
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:34.240]   on amazon as a matter of fact the first i first discovered this style by buying a 15 dollar pair
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:38.240]   of like knockoffs it wasn't even like labeled as lg or anything like that i didn't i wasn't even
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:42.560]   aware that lg had made these i just thought that oh somebody like imported a bunch of these and
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:48.480]   like i'll come in a ziplock baggie when i found when i recommended them uh elsewhere and someone's
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:53.280]   hey you know oh so those are just knockoffs of the lg tones oh they are oh goodness so i really want
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:56.960]   to buy like the legitimate ones because they're gonna sound a lot better than and they absolutely
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:02.880]   did but it was so confusing because they're like a bunch of sellers working through amazon that
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:08.400]   they have like rip off of the packaging they have a rip off of everything else and so you get these
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:13.360]   explains why the reviews of these headphones are like so across the board like there'll be like a
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:17.440]   four four or five star views oh wow though the sound is really great it's like there's a lot of base
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:21.680]   there's a lot of trouble you know it's the battery lasts a long time but then like one star it just
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:25.520]   sounds like i'm underwater with these things the battery lasted two hours and it wouldn't
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:31.360]   refuse to pair so i actually wound up because it was so hard to find a seller that was
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:38.400]   definitely going to be selling me the legitimate ones for god's sakes i got into the car i drove to
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:45.600]   for god's sakes a best buy i went to a brick and mortar store i paid full retail i paid sales tax
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:53.600]   leo i paid sales tax that's how far i went exactly so but i wound up getting what was absolutely
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:59.920]   you know full full on complete with the uh with the uh with the uh the hologram embossed on the box
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:04.480]   everything like that and i couldn't be happy with these and they're very lightweight i gotta say
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:09.920]   very nice exactly it's it's like again i was just testing these out or the the the original like
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:14.400]   fifteen dollar knockoff pair i bought and it's like again i just okay that that sounds good i just
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:18.800]   pulled the things out of my ears and this went out my way and it really truly was not until like
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:25.040]   ten hours later that i oh i've been wearing these all day long okay that's a that's a vote in favor
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:29.680]   and they and they do like they stay they stay on like they're nicely contoured so it's not like
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:35.200]   i don't feel like i'm in danger of these just like falling off and just dropping them on the sidewalk
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:45.920]   so nice the lg tone pro bluetooth stereo had sent uh so that so we we should mention before the show
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:51.280]   we realized there was a little conflict yes a little conflict worked it out but you guys have
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:57.360]   clearly worked it out so Jason you you got custody of the uh yeah and he wanted to pick this too although
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:02.800]   i'm glad he got his own pick i had nothing else if i didn't show shall shall shall shall i shall i say
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:09.040]   that i happened i was the person who claimed it first on the show notes this is true by so by
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:15.120]   divine and providence domain and i say ground rules like ground rules but but but clearly clearly
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:19.600]   uh Jason had a lot more experience and expertise about this and so i will fully seated yes you
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:26.240]   use step to side i appreciate it you're picking the week uh audio hijack three from rogue amoeba
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:31.680]   the last time audio hijack was really updated was about ten years ago it's an audio utility
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:37.040]   for the mac but i've used it for years the audio utility for the mac and it's it looks completely
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:44.480]   different from ever before uh chris demergan uh did a complete redesign of it and it's gorgeous it
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:51.040]   is all laid out through flow charts anything you can think of basically uh involving your mac's
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:57.600]   audio you can do with audio hijack three um it is the solution to numerous podcasting problems
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:02.080]   that i've had over the years in terms of i want to record this from over here i want to simplify
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:07.200]   a recording of a multi-track scenario at at my old office we had a multi-track recorder and i
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:11.680]   wanted to provide uh the just everybody in the office with the ability to record a podcast by
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:17.120]   pressing a button couldn't do it everything had to go through a multi-track recorder audio hijack
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:21.840]   does it uh you you can record multiple things you can mix things you can send things to different
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:27.040]   outputs from different inputs and it's all easy to use because you just drop down these little blocks
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:32.000]   and say here's an application and then recorded at this format and then sent it to this speaker
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.400]   this is a significant improvement in the ui it was always very hard to figure out it was a
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:41.360]   weird grid and it was powerful it's got more features now more power and it's easier to use
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:45.760]   you can figure it out just by looking and it's it comes with a whole bunch of filters and it
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:50.640]   supports audio units so that if you've got other plugins you can use those and when you play it's
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:55.600]   got this amazing animation when you play you can actually see the little links in the flow chart
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:02.080]   light up as it's recording and it's a real it's a real vu when it makes noise it actually flickers
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:08.160]   so you know what you're getting um as you're recording and it solves no more mystery pretty much
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:12.960]   every i i think maybe there's like one obscure thing that i need another utility for but essentially
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:16.720]   this solves all of my needs so whether you're somebody who just wants to record something you
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:22.320]   found on the internet uh or your somebody who was doing podcasting or audio some other audio or video
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:27.680]   production and you need to control what happens on your mac because the os10 based system does not
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:32.240]   do a very good job of routing audio around you can sort of set an input and an output and some apps
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:37.680]   will let you set a custom input or output this will let you do sort of anything you can think of just
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:42.640]   by laying down these blocks so my face and great power is this uh how does this compare to audacity
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:46.880]   it's completely different yeah this is not this is not an editor this works with audacity this is a
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:51.520]   recorder so in the end it'll route sound so if you want that microphone to be routed to those
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:57.520]   headphones but that app to be routed to those speakers and record them together and separately
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:51:03.040]   for editing later you can do that you just press the button and and go a lot of premium
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:09.440]   who use Skype for instance can't record both ends of a Skype conversation natively right so you use
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:15.040]   audio hijack pro and you can mix your voice and your Skype caller's voice together to your recorder
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:18.880]   right in fact you could you could set it up so that you've got uh this is one of the things i
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:22.880]   actually have it set up to do is it's recording Skype it's recording my voice and it's recording
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:28.320]   an app that i run that plays sound effects and it's also routing the sound effect app through with
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:33.840]   my voice to Skype so that i can uh so they can hear the sound effects right playing and i can
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:39.520]   hear them and believe it or not without a lot of extra software um that was pretty much impossible
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:44.000]   to do now i've used sound flower which is kind of a lower level thing and i think i even think i
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:49.120]   use sound flower with the old and that's the one piece of the the audio hijack doesn't really do
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:54.240]   right now is that uh sort of virtual input does sound flower still work with core audio it does and
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:59.200]   there's also a great utility called sound siphon that does basically the same thing and has a nicer
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:03.200]   interface but you have to pay for that one and sound flower still sort of works but the interface
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:08.080]   is terrible no this does pretty much anything else you can think of in terms of recording things
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:13.360]   on your mac or even not recording things just things like taking audio from iTunes and processing it
[01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:19.200]   to make it have you know be more compressed or be more bassy or anything like that you can set that
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:24.640]   up too and and press the button you can send iTunes to one set of speakers and some other app you
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:28.320]   know your web browser to a different set of speakers and it'll do that too oh that's kind of cool
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:32.880]   it's amazing the the different features and it does do recording it does flak or a ac recording
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:38.400]   yeah you've got granular levels of detail of what you want to record um where those files get saved
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:43.280]   and what format they're in and then you can throw in an EQ I mean it really it goes on and on and on
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:47.840]   it's it's pretty amazing there's great company I like there's a one i want to go ahead all i would
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:52.480]   have added is that i love the fact that you can essentially build a machine for recording the thing
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:56.960]   that you record a lot and that's the one time you have to build it and then you're done it's just a
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:01.280]   click one button and then this complicated thing that would have been several steps or really
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:08.000]   complicated is just click done each of these flow charts is its own um its own document in the
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:14.000]   documents window or they call it like a like a settings window or a sessions window
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.560]   and so once you make it it's there and then you just open it again and press record and then you
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:23.120]   can actually go to the recordings tab and see all of the recordings you made using that preset so
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:27.120]   it's very easy to to get access to it thanks it's just a great great not for everybody but if
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:30.960]   you're watching this and going oh i need that that's for you forty nine dollars forty nine dollars and
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:35.840]   if you've ever bought anything called audio hijack any of the previous versions it's twenty five
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:40.480]   dollars that's a good deal that's actually a great deal thank you Jason Snell Renee Richie your pick
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:45.520]   of the week i'm going to echo Jason and Andy just at first i was in the mobile nations chat room
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:50.640]   this morning and everyone's going bot bot bot bot bot so it's it's something that a lot of us
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:56.560]   depend on all the time for everything very timely just came out today i was at ces and i saw
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:02.800]   srenity called while using this widget on her notification center called clips and i was immediately
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:07.920]   very happy with it because all it does is take the clipboard from your iphone and add it to the
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:12.720]   widget space in notification center and if you start copying more things it adds more lines
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:16.560]   so often with the iphone you copy something and you want to use it but then you go copy something
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:20.960]   else you forget about it you can't go back you've got to go find it again this just lets you have
[01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:26.320]   a history of the stuff that you've copied and for many many activities that it just it makes it so
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:31.680]   much easier to get actual work done on iOS devices especially on an iphone when you're mobile when
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:37.040]   you're moving around show floors things like that so the app is called clips the app actually does
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:40.960]   you know do this kind of stuff but having things in notification center means that no matter what
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:45.600]   app i'm in i'm only ever once swipe away from having access to that data i don't have to go
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:50.000]   looking around for it hunting for the icon opening the app doing a bunch of stuff i'm in the app i
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:55.280]   want to use i pull it down i get the clipboard that i want i close it i paste it down and i'm back
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:00.960]   to work and that kind of convenience and time saving is just super invaluable to me i just wanted
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:05.600]   to make a note that for the i think everybody watching this show probably knows about Last Pass
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:10.640]   many of you already probably use Last Pass but Joseph Seagrest who created Last Pass has for the
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:15.440]   first time ever put it in the Mac App Store which i think will make it a lot more accessible for a
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:21.760]   lot of less sophisticated users Last Pass is as far as i'm concerned the password manager it works
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:27.920]   across all devices including mobile it has all the features you want it trusts no one encryption
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:33.840]   which means no one can see your passwords not even Last Pass just you you remember one password and
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:39.680]   it gives you fill-ins and logins for every website many apps it's a really great application and now
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:44.800]   that it's available in the App Store you can tell your less sophisticated friends just to get it
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:50.480]   and they'll know oh it's i see it in the App Store there free to free to use there is a premium
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:55.360]   version which adds unlimited mobile access and a family folders which is very nice
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:00.720]   additional multi-factor authentication options it is cheap it's one buck a month
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:06.080]   twelve dollars a year for the full features we actually use Last Pass enterprise at
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:11.200]   TWIT for all of our very very super secret super secure logins for things like servers and stuff
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:18.160]   and it it's just great well that concludes this episode of Mac Break Weekly i want to thank Andy

[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:31.920]   like Nighthawks at the IBM diner it's like behind you you know back back in the late 50s early 60s
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:36.080]   you just little kids and Christmas time would just press their noses against the IBM data
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:41.040]   server window and just dream that Santa Claus would bring them an accumulator or sort of
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:48.000]   door-caped drive just on Christmas morning and all I got was this lousy patent thank you Andy
