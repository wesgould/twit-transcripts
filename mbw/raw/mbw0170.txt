[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.600]   I'm Leo LaPorte joining me.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.920]   I'm so happy to say back from his exile in Montana.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.240]   So nice to see him.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.640]   I'm going to kiss you, man.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.800]   Scott Boor.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.760]   Oh, Scott, we've missed you.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.840]   Well, I figured everybody needs a break from me sometimes.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.360]   It wasn't. You didn't flee from the trolls.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.840]   I know.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.840]   I just had stuff to do.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.560]   I just had stuff to do.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.160]   You have some business you want to take care of.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.080]   So I understand that.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.360]   I work for a living.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.280]   Unlike us.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.440]   Unlike the Twitcottage people that party all day,
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.120]   and call it a job.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.400]   All right, so thank you for being here.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.920]   I'm so glad to be back.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.560]   We missed you.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.040]   We hope you will not continue to be a stranger.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.120]   And what have you been up to?
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.760]   You still do photofocus.com, I see.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.880]   Photofocus.com is keeping me very busy.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.960]   And I'm happy to say that today's iTunes shows
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.400]   the Photo Focus podcast at number two in tech
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.560]   and number 30 overall.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.240]   Thank you very much.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.640]   Holy cow.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.320]   And we're still doing the Twitter thing.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.160]   I'm still nowhere near you, but I'm at 51,000.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.240]   That's awesome.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.240]   And that is at Scott Boor.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.840]   Scott Boor.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.840]   And then I'm giving stuff away.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.400]   I've given away $75,000 with a camera gear on Twitter.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.200]   Keeping that going.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.560]   Wow, you're still doing that.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.320]   How can you only have 50,000 followers
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.760]   if you're giving all that crap away?
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.160]   Because I block all the spam bots, the drill.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.840]   Oh, you have real followers.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.960]   Yeah, these are real followers.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.840]   Yeah, see, I don't understand.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.040]   We just in fact, this weekend, we blocked 650 bots.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.400]   How do you do that?
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.880]   Well, like an idiot, I went through a--
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.200]   by hand, until somebody said, Scott, there's a--
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.480]   there's like a thing called Twit Block you could use.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.560]   So I use Twit Block, which goes in it.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.320]   It evaluates whether or not the people are real.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.480]   And then you still have to make a real world decision.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.600]   And they encourage you to not block too quickly.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.120]   And I don't.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.080]   But if you can see that it's the same tweet to 5,000 people,
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.320]   and it links to a porn site, it's probably not real.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.960]   Yeah, pretty safe.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.560]   Also with us, Mr. Andy, and not co.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.920]   Good to see you again, Andy.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.480]   Is it snowing in your neck of the woods?
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.200]   It did snow three days ago.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.480]   But since I'm a lonely shut-in, who fears humanity
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.000]   that I affected my life for a little?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.040]   Let the sun do the work.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.320]   I'm a big advocate of solar power when it comes to shoveling.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.600]   Why shovel?
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.000]   You don't want anybody to come visit anyway.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.920]   It's not like there's anything out there that
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.360]   isn't scary and threatening.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.120]   Yeah, it keeps people away.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.720]   Also, by examining the snowfall outside your driveway,
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.760]   you could see if there's been any burglars, pirates,
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.240]   or ne'er-do-wells approaching your house.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.200]   And are there?
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.680]   None that I can see, which is a good idea,
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.840]   because it means that this ongoing policy I've had
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.920]   for most of my adult life of being so
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.040]   brusque and careless with my emotions to shun
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.200]   a human contact is working, a-okay.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.760]   I'm going to write a book about it.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.600]   I'm sure it's going to sell eight copies.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.000]   My goal is five, but eight.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.960]   We owe them the most.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.280]   Well, it's great to get you together.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.120]   I almost don't even want to do any news,
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.400]   but there is quite a bit of Mac news, which we'll talk about.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.680]   Alex Lindsey's not here today.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.440]   He is off on assignment.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.480]   That's what they say in the--
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.680]   You see that on nightly news.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.800]   He's off on assignment.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.800]   It really means he's in reading.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.520]   W-O-R-T-V reporter, Alex.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.040]   Let's see is off on assignment.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.880]   I'm the OLP.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.200]   And strange enough that assignment's going to last 28 days,
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.760]   and when he comes back, he's going to be
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.360]   tear stained and shaky.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.920]   No, Alex is--
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.680]   Tear stained and shaky.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:07.960]   Alex is not in rehab, contrary to a rumor that I just started.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.160]   It's a butt lift.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.720]   We can just--
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.720]   It's a heart ride, I admit.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.400]   When you lose 45 pounds--
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.120]   But we're hoping it goes better than it did since he's off.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.120]   He's on his working out so well for him.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.120]   [HONKING]
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.080]   You know, losing weight just creates excess skin.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.280]   It does.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.560]   Let's be honest here.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.120]   We can look forward to a new line of iPhone cases
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.080]   and holders from Rounsel and Z.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.880]   From the Bifjurki collection.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.440]   An extremely limited line.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.400]   Oh, my god.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.320]   Desiccated.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.440]   Let's see some stories.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.000]   A big story this week.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.800]   And I think it has now been confirmed by the New York
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.960]   Times that Apple buys La La.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.520]   I just like the name.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.440]   La La.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.640]   Have you used La La Andy?
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.640]   Do you know what La La is?
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.040]   Yeah, it's essentially a streaming service for music.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.240]   I used it very briefly, just long enough
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.040]   to sort of remind myself that I don't really
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.880]   like that kind of a streaming service.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.520]   Is it like Rhapsody or Pandora or At Last FM?
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.520]   What is the--
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.440]   They had it in--
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.120]   They had an interesting--
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.160]   it was one of those topics where it's an interesting legal
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.520]   idea, whereas what it would do is it would scan your iTunes
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.960]   library, find music that it already has the rights to.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.840]   It wouldn't simply let you upload your library to a cloud
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.160]   that you could then access from wherever you are.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.600]   It has licenses to all the music catalogs, everybody else
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.800]   has.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.280]   It just simply says, oh, OK.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.120]   I see that you have rock blocks here by the B52s.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.280]   We have that in our library.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.720]   And we can let you access that from wherever you are,
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.520]   f for a license fee of $0.10 per song.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.200]   At one point, it was $0.10 per song.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.000]   I'm not the biggest expert on La La,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.800]   but I know that their list of services and their terms of use
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.720]   tended to change as they kept working out new agreements
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.440]   with the music publishers.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.280]   It was a great idea.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.400]   I think that--
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.120]   I agree with a lot of the other covers
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.840]   that I've been reading, that it seems more like the Apple
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.640]   wanted all the talent that was inside this company rather
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.120]   than they wanted to incorporate La La into iTunes, for instance,
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.880]   because they had a lot of really cool ideas.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.360]   They're a real bunch of creative thinkers.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.880]   So why did Apple get them?
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.400]   For the creative thinkers, that's kind of the consensus now.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.080]   That's one theory.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.480]   The other theory is that there's some core technology
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.760]   that underlies their product that Apple needed.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.760]   This is similar to way, way, way back a billion years ago
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.800]   when I got involved in the acquisition of Vivo, which
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.920]   had about eight lines of code that real audio didn't.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.080]   But it was for those eight lines of code?
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.280]   It was for those eight lines of code.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.160]   So the initial reports were $80 million for La La.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.240]   That's a 10 million per line of code.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.120]   But in fact--
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.760]   That was for-- I was mentioning an older--
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.240]   I know.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.680]   I think it's kind of a half and half.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.120]   I think Andy's half right.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.640]   And I'm half right.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.480]   I think it's half because they wanted the talent.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.520]   But I do have several reasons to believe
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.200]   that it's the underlying technology
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.840]   that they wanted a piece of.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.040]   And doesn't mean that we'll see a La La service on--
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.800]   Well, yeah, that's the question, isn't it?
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.280]   It means that we'll see them somehow implement that technology
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.680]   to make iTunes better.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.320]   La La lets you, in effect, put your--
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.520]   it's amazing that it's legal.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.520]   It lets you, in effect, put your library up online.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.720]   Well, now that Apple's bought it,
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.760]   let's watch and see how quickly the RIAA gets excited.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.960]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.080]   According to a tech crunch today, Mike Harrington
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.960]   says that $80 million is not the deal.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.560]   Mike says the deal is $17 million.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.680]   He says, now-- so you're going to take this with a great salt
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.600]   because he says, according to our sources,
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.880]   with indirect knowledge of the deal.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.920]   That's not a good source.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.960]   But anyway, they say $17 million.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.480]   And the company supposedly had $14 million cash in the bank.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.480]   So that's a good deal.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.000]   Well, another--
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.080]   I almost could have afforded that.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.200]   Yeah, another report I read said that they simply
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.440]   bought the assets, which doesn't exclude the cash on hand.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.360]   But it could also mean just the technology as well, I see.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.120]   And also, if you--
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.000]   that's why I put on my special speculation cap for this joke.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.720]   I was wondering, what is that?
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.320]   Well, this is my official flying car
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.440]   Mossoff Brothers stupid hat.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.800]   Exactly the exact same make and model of hat
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.480]   that they use in their stage shows.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.160]   I love that.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.240]   And did you get that at a flying car Mossoff Brothers
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:33.920]   stage show?
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.120]   Or--
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.840]   I did not have my headphones on,
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.560]   and I missed the last sentence that you just--
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.280]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.840]   What is that?
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.800]   Did you get that at the--
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:44.800]   Yes.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.000]   I am fluting ask at my dash notes.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Did you get that at a FKB show?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.920]   It was a gift from one of the flying car Mossoff brothers
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.280]   himself.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.320]   You know the flying car Mossoff brothers?
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.120]   Indeed I do.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.680]   They're fantastic.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.080]   You are hooked up, Andy.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.320]   Hey, I got the--
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.920]   again, I've been a shut-in for so many years.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.920]   I don't know what to put you.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.560]   I got the--
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.640]   Whatever they're saying.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.600]   They call that whatever the kids call it today.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.960]   Mojo Voodoo.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.760]   I got this hat from Johnny Cash.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.800]   Johnny Cash.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.640]   At the fact of the view.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.040]   That would have been awesome.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:15.920]   Oh, whiskey water.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.880]   I bought it from his store that Johnny Cash was in once.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.160]   You know, we interviewed Johnny Cash on the screen savers.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.040]   He came with his bus, honey suckle rose.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.120]   I got to go take a tour of the bus.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.480]   I have to say, it's as bad as you have heard.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.480]   We're going out.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.920]   The bus is parked out behind the screen savers.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.800]   The door opens and smoke literally pours down the steps.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.560]   I mean, it's like--
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.560]   Awesome.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.560]   So he's into sauna.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.560]   That's great.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.400]   That's sauna you're saying?
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.240]   And then I go in there and Willie's in there.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.680]   Did I say Johnny Cash?
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.680]   I meant Willie Nelson.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.280]   Oh, they're almost the same.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.280]   That's close.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.840]   Willie, Johnny, Waylon.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.120]   I'm sure by the time he got too long, full, you're seeing the white rabbit from--
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.120]   From a foul, some money.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:03.200]   I have no idea what Johnny Cash was smoking, but I do know that Willie was in sconced,
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.720]   like the Caterpillar in Alice in Wonderland.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:13.880]   And he gave me a bottle of old whiskey river, autographed by Willie Nelson, a bandana, red
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.800]   bandana, autographed by Willie Nelson.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.960]   So those are precious items in my collection.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.960]   That's quite awesome.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.600]   I would love to have a Johnny Cash hat though.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.600]   Is it too late?
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.600]   It's too late.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:32.080]   Well, I'm not sure how well guarded the mausoleum is, but I bet they buried him in something
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.080]   cool.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.080]   Black, no doubt.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.800]   Great man in black.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.160]   I do like you look good in a cowboy hat, actually.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.160]   That's a--
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.960]   That's a flattering look, Mr. Mornin.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.080]   Well, see, Tommy Bahamas in the summer, the straw hat and then the winner, it's the cowboy
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.080]   hat.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.880]   Somebody saying that your hat, Andy and I go looks like what Robert Conrad used in the
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.520]   mini-series Centennial.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.520]   Bob Conrad?
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.520]   Bob Conrad?
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.000]   Bob Conrad, one of the greatest tough guys of the '70s.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   I'll take that compliment.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.240]   I have a Bob Conrad story too.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.240]   I interviewed him.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.240]   He's a little squatty now.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.080]   I was like, this is-- when did this turn in the decavino?
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.080]   No, I'm done.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.720]   I was having lunch with Woody and I was talking about my intro children.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.440]   By the way, Leo's Tommy Bahama shirt, $39 from Roolalah.com.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.680]   Okay, let's continue on.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.680]   I'm sure--
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.480]   Yes, lala.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.480]   Lala.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.840]   So, engineering talent, possibly, technology, possibly.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.840]   Maybe--
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.040]   I remember what I was going to say.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.560]   It's hard not to think of-- in the last month of 2009, it's hard not to think of almost
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.800]   every single decision that every major tech company is making, Apple at the top of the
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.040]   list, within the prism of the idea of Apple is going to be coming out with a big tablet
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.440]   sometime in 2010.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:51.600]   So, you start to wonder if you have a tablet computer with limited onboard resources, wouldn't
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.160]   it be pretty awesome for it to be able to locate your iTunes library and stream all
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:01.120]   that content without having to take up a 4050 gigabyte ram drive?
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.120]   As long as we're talking about Lala, did you see Juju?
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.120]   Lala Juju.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.120]   Lala Juju.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:14.280]   So, the Crunchpad, we talked about the drama last week of the Crunchpad.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:22.080]   And now, whatever they're called, Rogue River, or the company that kind of walked off with
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.520]   the Crunchpad last week had their first showing of the pad.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.920]   They've renamed Juju, which I think-- I don't know, I think they're going to have to change
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.920]   the name.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.600]   Now, didn't you do the demo with that just a little while ago?
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.760]   I just played it on the air.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.760]   It looks pretty impressive.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.400]   They're going to charge it.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   They say $500.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.560]   They say they'll have it in a couple of weeks.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.960]   And this means Arrington won't be involved with it.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.760]   I guess could only imagine what the lawsuits are going to look like.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.240]   But Arrington won't be involved with it.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.640]   Well, no, it doesn't look like it.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.120]   Chandra didn't-- I'll buy it then.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.760]   Oh, I see.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.760]   That's a precondition.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.760]   Yeah, I said that.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.760]   I said that.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:06.160]   I'll buy it as long as Michael Arrington isn't involved in it.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:13.560]   It says, according to PCMag, that Arrington and Ratha Krishnan, the guy who's fusion garage,
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.840]   guy who's got it now, Chandra Ratha Krishnan, only had verbal agreements.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.080]   So you've got no more than I about these kinds of things.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.920]   Hey, Arrington's going to sue everybody because that's what he does.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.920]   He's a lawyer, too.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.520]   He can sue anybody he wants doesn't mean he's going to win.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.800]   I feel kind of bad, to be honest.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.440]   Well, have we discussed what Chandra is saying with the relationship with Arrington's group
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.440]   was?
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.440]   No.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.440]   What does he say?
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:48.520]   His side of it is that he essentially had this tablet designed an honest way towards
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.160]   being prototyped and built.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.240]   He saw a lot of intersection between what his group was trying to do and what Arrington
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:00.720]   wanted to do, that he's approached Arrington saying, look, you're really great at design.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.400]   You're really great at raising money.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.920]   Why don't we partner up?
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.720]   We'll build the thing.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.560]   And maybe one day you'll buy our company and you'll help make us incredibly rich and
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.040]   successful.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:19.200]   What he is claiming is that Arrington, this desired relationship never bore fruit, that
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:24.480]   the tablet is, in fact, the, and, apparently, the design of his group and that, therefore,
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.280]   he has the ability to simply take all the stuff that he designed according to him and
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.280]   now sell it under his own logo type.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.400]   He says, "Tech Crunch didn't contribute a single line of code.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.280]   It was fusion garage that brought the device from the dead."
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.480]   He said, "Arrington was going to make the deals.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.480]   Never did."
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.760]   Arrington out got $3 million in funding from Fusion Garage's shareholders.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.120]   They offered Arrington the possibility of working with us without a controlling interest
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.280]   airing to turn them down.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.840]   This all makes a little more sense than Mike's side of the story.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.840]   It makes just a whole bunch of sense to me.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.760]   I think we're hearing something that sounds that rings a little true.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:05.760]   Thank you for bringing that point up, Bandi, because I think that's huge.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.600]   This is where it stings.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:13.160]   Chandra says, "He's not worried about marketing the device without Arrington's help.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.080]   Tech Crunch's marketing capability is resigned."
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.080]   "Don't do it."
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.080]   "Oh, danger, danger."
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.080]   "Stop it."
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.080]   "I'm going ahead of you."
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.080]   "Stop it."
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.080]   "I do not care what you say."
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.960]   "Okay, Leo Laporte, this is Andy Anastko telling Leo Laporte to do what he wants because
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.760]   this is Andy Anastko.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.240]   Recognize this voice as not the one who's--"
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.360]   "And this is God-born also not Leo Laporte."
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.600]   "As a matter of fact, I'm going to be drinking water so you can know that I'm not speaking."
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.600]   "He too."
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.600]   "Go ahead, Leo."
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.360]   "Tech Crunch's marketing capability is resigned to a blog.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.960]   With the partners we have aligned, we have a broader spectrum of marketing capabilities."
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.120]   When asked how the juju--"You can't call it the juju."
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.720]   "It's just like a word."
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.480]   "You can't call it the juju."
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.320]   "I would like to nominate woo woo."
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.360]   "Woo woo is okay."
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.960]   "Jooju is not good."
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:08.360]   When asked how the juju compares to the Chrome OS with net plus netbooks, Rothakrishnan said,
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.960]   "Both projects have a similar vision but fusion garage does not view netbooks as a best form
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.960]   factor."
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.080]   Now, he was playing back on the video that I saw on Engadget today.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.600]   1080p video very smoothly.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.680]   Now, it is an atom processor but it's got to be an ion chipset from Envidia.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:27.720]   There's no way that the atoms with the Intel videographers could play back 1080p video smoothly.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.520]   So this is maybe an impressive device.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.320]   He says, "It could be available in 18-10 weeks."
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.440]   "I'm sorry.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.440]   That wasn't--"
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.440]   "Any wasn't--"
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   "They didn't do that.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.440]   I did that."
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.880]   "Five hundred bucks.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.520]   Is that a price point that will attract people?"
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.040]   Well, especially if, you know, Apple's got something coming out.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.320]   Apple's going to be more though.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.840]   Apple's going to be seven on it.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.840]   Yeah, right?
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.840]   Well, it's going to be more but once you get above, I think, the $200, $300 maximum price
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.600]   point, you start to--the range of expectations that the user is going to have starts to increase
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.480]   logarithmically.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.200]   Once you get above that price point, you have to give me more than a thin client.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.720]   You have to give me more than a web browser with an electronic wrapper around it.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:17.120]   This is why I think that they've got a hard row to hoe if they're going to try to sell
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.400]   this for 500 bucks because if Apple tries to sell their tablet for, let's say, $650
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.880]   and all of their marketing is not based on it.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.840]   It's a simple machine that doesn't run any software, it runs on websites only, and it
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.560]   doesn't really have anything by way of storage, it'll stream everything via Wi-Fi.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:40.240]   If Apple simply says, "It's a $650 device," it comes with an entire infrastructure for
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.480]   delivering content to the device.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.880]   No matter what it is, it's--
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.880]   That's huge.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.440]   --you want to consume the terms of media, we will deliver to you with one, maybe two, taps
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.440]   maximums.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.680]   Oh, and by the way, where else--remember how well we did in preview the biggest and best
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.600]   software library available for a mobile phone, we're putting that same machinery towards
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.200]   giving you the best mobile library for a tablet device.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.800]   I think we're realizing now that that's the secret sauce.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   Anybody can make a tablet.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.000]   Look at the Arkos is already out.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.720]   You love the Arkos.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.720]   I think it's a very good.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.720]   I think it's a very solid device.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.080]   But it doesn't have the end-to-end content.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.640]   It doesn't have end-to-end content, but it's also 200 bucks.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.680]   Ken Sheperton's pointing out in our friend feed room, and I think he's absolutely right.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:23.280]   He says, "In six months, there will be dozens of three sub-300 dollar tablet devices out
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.360]   there based on Chrome OS."
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.000]   What is this going to do to things like the Kindle?
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   That's interesting, too.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.840]   If the nook is out now and people are starting to see the nook, have you got a nook yet, Andy?
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.200]   I do not have a nook yet.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.640]   You have a cranny.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.080]   Okay, hold the glom.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.960]   There are places we can go with that.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:51.920]   See, that's why you need my special no mug.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.360]   I'm just going to brush that double entendre on it.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.920]   I want to point out that I have friends listening to the show for the first time who think it's
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.160]   about Macintosh.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.160]   Sorry.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:08.080]   I also would like to point out that people have seen the video with Chandra.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.720]   He does not look like that.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.320]   I just want to say, no, I wasn't attempting to imitate him.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.320]   That was...
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.880]   You're trying to make fun of him.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.880]   Okay.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.400]   That was making fun of the guy after making fun of him for using a name that made fun of
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   and that certainly caused your fun of him.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.400]   Yeah, the Juju.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   I'm not making fun of him.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.000]   It's the pad for the chosen people.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   That's all I want to say.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.280]   Oh, no, no.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.720]   Are you lost in wandering in the wilderness?
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.040]   The Juju has GPS.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.960]   Andy, how did we get into this?
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.360]   You can't call something called the Juju a tablet.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.680]   We're running.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.840]   We're running out of words.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.960]   There's going to be a time when we attempt to speak and nothing that's quite noise and
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.200]   static is going to come out because we've used every word that is possible to be invented
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.200]   and used.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   Oh my goodness.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.200]   You did Juju tablets.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.200]   When is wrong with you?
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:06.480]   Are we coming close to a time when the next time there's a really cool cutting edge device,
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.520]   it's just going to ship with a barcode on the front of it because...
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.800]   Well now you know why the company is the only thing that hasn't been trademarked yet.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.280]   Well now you know why companies like Lenovo, it's the X200.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.280]   They don't...
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.280]   There you go.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.280]   There you go.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.280]   There's numbers, baby.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.480]   But no, I do not have a nook.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.000]   I'm looking forward to getting a nook.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.280]   The devices like the Kindle in the nook really show the power of potentially an Apple tablet
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:34.760]   because out of the box it's not the most remarkable device in the world, but the fact
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:39.200]   is that it's connected to a huge library of really valuable content that you can get
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.200]   with just a couple of taps because it's connected to a free 3G network.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.120]   I really like Sony's readers.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.560]   I think that they have very much the right idea of their developing...
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.560]   They're beautiful.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.840]   They're developing ebooks that are not just a delivery system for an online store.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.920]   Their idea is always, we don't care where you get your content from, we will just help
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.320]   you to read it.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.680]   And that's a very important thing as we're getting into digital distribution of just
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.000]   about everything.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   But the whole point of having a Kindle is that you just tap a couple buttons and you
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.160]   can get the latest bestseller or even a book that was hot three years ago.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.320]   Well, you know, the thing with the Kindle that surprised me, we were actually invited
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.120]   to be one of the first blogs, if not the first blog, and certainly the first photography
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.800]   blog on the Kindle.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.480]   And we have quite a few Kindle subscribers.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.480]   Do you make money on it?
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.480]   Do we make it?
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.320]   I keep getting this checked every once in a while ago.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.320]   What's this for?
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.320]   Oh, yeah, the Kindle.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.240]   What do they charge like five bucks a month, right?
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.240]   It's something like that.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.240]   I can't understand.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.320]   I mean, you can just go to the web for free.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.840]   You could even use the Kindle's own experimental browser for free.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.760]   I think there's a certain convenience.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.320]   Convenience factor that people are willing to pay for because the check we get is a lot
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.480]   bigger than I thought it would be.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.600]   That goes back to underscore what you've been saying, which is you can make a tablet.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.920]   But it's point of access.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.440]   It's convenience is the ease over which you feel the whole iPod conversation.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.640]   The iPod is successful because of iTunes and that's why Apple's tablet will beat the crap
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.160]   out of everybody else's tablet because they'll do that part right.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.640]   That's what they do.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.640]   All right.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.720]   We're going to take a break, come back.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.160]   By the way, Mike Harrington's last word on this was yesterday on Twitter.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.400]   He says, "It's in the lawyer's hands now.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.000]   We're not going to have no more blogs about this.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.800]   We'll see in court."
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.760]   But I have to say that Chandra's story makes sense.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.120]   I think that that might really be what's going on here.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.120]   It's fantastic.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:33.400]   It's also a who cares product at this point because there's going to be a lot of these
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.400]   guys.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.480]   There's going to be a lot of them.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.400]   That's always the tough thing in the tech industry.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.800]   It seems that these ideas when they happen, everybody gets them at the same time.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.200]   Everybody rushes to market at the same time.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.640]   It's going to end up being, as it always is, the person who could provide the best customer
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.240]   experience, the best end-to-end solution and who else but Apple on this one.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.200]   Will Apple have it in the next quarter?
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.960]   Will it be late next year?
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.040]   That's how long we're going to have to wait.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.040]   Who knows?
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.480]   You think it was going to be anywhere close to first quarter.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.000]   They would have made it done for Christmas.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   I'd be surprised.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:14.720]   It's probably going to be a Mac world or a later announcement, delivery in the fourth
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.800]   quarter.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   That's a really good point.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.800]   If they could have, they would have.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.200]   So do it for Keith at Christmas next year.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.400]   Isn't Steve still on record as saying no?
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.400]   Oh, you know.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.040]   He said right to the bitter end, nobody's going to watch video on a portable device.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.680]   I know, but I'm just keeping and making sure I'm up on the news.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.680]   I don't know.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   He said no.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.320]   Last I heard he was said, there's no such thing we're not working on it.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.320]   We don't care.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.320]   Really?
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.880]   That's the last I heard.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.400]   Well, that's hard to believe.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.720]   If I would like to ask anybody in the chat room whenever if they can produce solid evidence
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.920]   of anything different, I'll link a reference to a quote.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.160]   He said we're going to work on it.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.160]   It's okay.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.600]   Let me use the Google.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.200]   See if I can find something because I don't remember him saying we're not doing it.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.360]   I mean, either.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:09.120]   Well, I mean, he used his typical lingo to say we're not doing it.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:13.960]   Oh, I just did a Google on Steve Jobs tablet and the stories are jobs back at Apple.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.200]   It focuses on the new tablet Wall Street Journal.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.400]   Jobs concentrating on tablets seen at news.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:23.280]   Steve Jobs almost entirely focused on tablet project Mac rumors.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.280]   Is that from the rate of common wisdom or is that actual information?
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.160]   Steve, I'm just talking about what he said.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.240]   The reason I asked the question is I just if he had actually said something publicly that
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:39.920]   says you were working on a tablet, that would change my opinion about when we might hear
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.920]   it.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.760]   He wouldn't, would he?
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:47.320]   But the thing that's most compelling to me about that makes me a pretty certain as
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.480]   certain as I can be that this is a real project is the way that other vice presidents keep
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.760]   talking around the tablet.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.360]   I think it's pretty glaring the way the language that they use when they talk about
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.360]   apples when they're asked direct questions about it from analysts and stockholders about
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.600]   their plans to compete in the netbook space.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:08.720]   They keep talking around the idea of a tablet without acknowledging it or denying it.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.920]   I'm going to give credit to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.120]   When the Wall Street Journal isn't going to be so out front on something like this unless
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.720]   they have a source and I've thought for some time that their source is actually within
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:22.840]   Apple that the Apple has started using the journal as a way to launch travelers and they
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.800]   are saying over and over again since back in August, that's what Steve Jobs is working
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.800]   on.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:34.600]   Well, I hope it's true because I want to buy one, you know, who doesn't?
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.560]   I'm using the exact same policy I used when the announced the iPhone where I quite literally
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:45.560]   have $600 in a cash in an envelope that is actually set aside to really that I will have
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.480]   money to buy a tablet when it first comes out.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.440]   And I quite literally have $6,000 sitting in an envelope to buy 10 of them when they come
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.440]   out.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.000]   Oh, I've got my envelopes or bills.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.200]   I don't know how much money is actually inside the band of that hat right now.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.200]   Look at that hat.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.200]   You could tell it's loaded with money.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.760]   I'm guessing you at least got tow truck money like $300.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:11.760]   You're stuck in Omaha with tow truck money and you need a hotel room and drinking money.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.760]   It's tow truck money.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.920]   I'll trade you this hat to get me out of Dodge.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.640]   Hey, before we go on, there's a lot more to talk about.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.400]   But I do want to talk about our friends at Citrix and the great product we call GoToMeeting
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.400]   based on Citrix's, you know, backbone product, which is their incredible remote access.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.000]   They're famous for remote access for Windows.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.720]   They do it for Mac to go to meeting is now a Mac product as well.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.720]   And let me tell you, if you are stuck with a conference calls, if you're stuck with traveling
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:43.120]   to meet with clients or colleagues, GoToMeeting is a life changing product.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:48.720]   I mean, I don't think I'm overselling it when I say, you know, if you're, it's conference
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.080]   calls are horrible.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.440]   I mean, they're painful and business travel.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.640]   Not, I mean, it's expensive.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.360]   It's stress inducing.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.880]   Just try GoToMeeting for free right now.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.880]   Go to go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.800]   You could try it 30 days, unlimited use as many meetings as you want as long as you want
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.280]   to really get an experience.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:09.320]   If you've ever been on a phone call where you're saying, I wish I could show you the
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.560]   power point of those keynote presentation or the drawings, the things we're collaborating
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.560]   on.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.160]   I wish we could edit a document together.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.640]   This is the way to do it.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.280]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.600]   You could schedule your meetings in advance around the fly.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.200]   Everybody sees your computer desktop on their computer screen.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.120]   Even if you're using Windows and they're using Mac or using Mac and they're using Windows.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   They could follow along.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:36.640]   They can work with you for sales presentations, for product demos, training sessions, collaboration.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.000]   There's just nothing better from the folks at Citrix.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.280]   It's 100% secure using 128-bit end-to-end encryption.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.160]   Installation is a snap.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.560]   If you start now, you'll be done long before I'm done talking.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.440]   Just takes a couple of minutes and is free for 30 days.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.440]   Do yourself a favor.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.080]   You might even get a raise for this one.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.960]   Certainly a pat on the back from the boss.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.960]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.880]   We thank them so much for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.480]   Moving along, story number, whatever.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.760]   I'm not even keeping track of it.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.000]   We're on two, by the way.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   I know.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.160]   Hey, you forgot how we do this thing.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.080]   Oh, I know I was looking forward to this part.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.400]   Did you see the AT&T self-service?
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.440]   This shouldn't even be a news story.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:26.000]   Is last in customer satisfaction, according to consumer reports?
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Really?
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.480]   It's a shocker.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.440]   How could that be?
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.280]   They surveyed 50,000 readers.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.680]   This is a good survey, 26 US cities.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.680]   Lowest customer satisfaction in 19 of the city surveyed.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.680]   Verizon was the highest.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:49.520]   AT&T did last in New York, San Francisco.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.520]   New Yorkers carped about dropping AT&T calls.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.960]   Of course, everybody in the Bay Area knows how bad it is.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.160]   I think some of this is just because these are areas where an iPhone is popular.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:04.360]   Don't you blame the iPhone a little bit for the problems that AT&T has?
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.760]   If it weren't for the iPhone, there'd be 37 AT&T users.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.000]   That's a good point.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.480]   Who would go with AT&T if they didn't have an exclusive?
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.480]   That's a real question.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:18.560]   AT&T's response, by the way, and I mentioned this on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.640]   We appreciate-- and this is probably your friend Sig.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.640]   What's his name?
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.640]   Sig Sigler?
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.640]   Sig Sig?
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.640]   Sig?
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.640]   The guy with the flashcards?
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.800]   Yeah, Mr. flashcard.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:33.360]   But imagine, if you will, I'm holding flashcards and reading my response.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.920]   We appreciate and value all customer feedback.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.040]   Even if you say we suck.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:44.280]   We learn from it, and it helps us serve our customers better.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.200]   They don't learn much.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.800]   Leo, I've got AT&T on the phone.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   Hang on.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.800]   What's the true?
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.800]   The true?
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.600]   Oh, your new motto is, "We're not happy till you're not happy."
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.600]   Thank you.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.240]   We don't care.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.240]   We don't have to.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.560]   We're the phone company.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.560]   We learn from it.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.440]   We help us serve our customers better without question.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:13.360]   The surest indication of customer satisfaction is churn or turnover.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:18.200]   For the last quarter, our post-paid churn was just 1.117%.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.640]   Take that, consumer of arts.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:25.480]   I've always been curious as to how the carrier affects purchases of the actual phone.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:31.920]   Most people, the carrier is not the most important part of the buying decision.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:37.720]   I was about to say, I would buy the iPhone, even if it were attached to the worst data
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.120]   network in the entire country.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:43.360]   It actually looks like we are.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:48.360]   I think that I would not buy a droid simply because it's hooked up to the best data network
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:52.960]   in the world, excuse me, in the country.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:32:00.720]   Could you be willing to use a 1997 era Nokia N4 phone just because you know that you will
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.920]   get fewer drop calls on average over the course of the year?
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.600]   Of course, churn will go down once somebody else gets the iPhone.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.640]   There's no churn because nobody wants to abandon their iPhone.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.120]   AT&T on Monday released a new application.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.120]   Yes, this one's good.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   This one's good.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.760]   Sounds like a joke.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.320]   It's absolutely serious.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:27.440]   It's called Mark the Spot, which lets iPhone users submit complaints about dropped calls,
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.240]   poor service coverage, and less than perfect voice quality.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:35.280]   The idea is instead of throwing your phone out the window, you launch the application
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.920]   and you try to get banned with.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:41.240]   Yes, you try to get online and say, "How can you mark the spot if it's not working?"
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.080]   No, it can get the GPS coordinates.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.240]   The sidelines will be working.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.840]   Then it will send the report when you do have coverage.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:53.120]   Once the application is launched, users have several complaint options.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.320]   They will see a screen.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.080]   No, it sounds like a joke, doesn't it?
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.080]   It's spin.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.560]   That's number one.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.200]   Number two, file 13.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.200]   And number three.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.200]   Please listen for the entire menu.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.720]   We have number four.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.760]   Both of our customer service agents are busy.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.080]   Please call back.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.160]   Which member of AT&T would you like us to go screw?
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:24.080]   A, me, B, the horse I rode into town on, C, anyone who looks like me, D, any horse that
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.520]   looks like the horse I rode into town on.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.520]   Oh, dear.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.520]   Oh, dear.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.520]   You know, this is the-- here's the application.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.520]   Look at this.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.400]   Did you just experience a problem?
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.400]   Yes.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:38.320]   Somebody tweeted me and wanted to know if we made this up.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.320]   Nope.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.320]   Nope.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.320]   I'm all-- this is the iTunes Store.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.320]   Did you experience a problem?
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.920]   Use this application to submit the details to AT&T's network operations, location, current
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.120]   location, and then here's the menu.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.720]   Dropped call, failed call, no coverage, data failure, poor voice quality.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.840]   Once seldom often always--
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.960]   I heard bucks are the first guy that hacks that and puts you suck in there for me.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.480]   Well, I think if you just click, you know, all of the above always and submit, you know,
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.480]   a message will be sent.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.400]   By the way, this is free.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.200]   To be fair, up here in the Seattle area, I don't have any problems with them.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.200]   Really?
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.200]   And I imagine--
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.200]   Well, you know why?
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.760]   Because everybody's using Windows mobile phones up there.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.000]   I don't have any problems with AT&T here.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.040]   And you know, I've been some very odd places like on top of the mountain in Crater Lake
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.080]   National Park where it works.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:31.480]   It's-- you know, but then in Packwood, Washington, where the cabin is that I have, it doesn't
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.480]   work there.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.480]   So--
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.920]   I'm going to defend them a little bit.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:38.360]   I really do think a lot of this is just because so many people have iPhones and iPhone users
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:43.200]   are far more data intensive than other users.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.680]   They just use a lot more.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:47.240]   So the solution is I have a Verizon phone, too.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.240]   Right.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.280]   Well, I'm sitting in front of three phones.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.120]   In fact, I just got-- and we're going to do a little unboxing after the show, the Nokia
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.800]   N900, which is going to run on a T-Mobile network because it's unlocked.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.760]   I've got the Droid, which I very much like.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.560]   And I think it's Droid phone should I get.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:05.920]   Well, you know, if you want a real keyboard, I think the Droid, but a lot of people love
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:06.920]   the Airs.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.040]   It doesn't have a keyboard, so it's a little slimmer.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.920]   Because of us use iPhones, I think are comfortable with on-screen keyboards, frankly.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.400]   Can you try it any, Andy?
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:20.520]   I tried the first Motorola Droid, liked it a lot, hate the keyboard.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.560]   It's just useless.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.560]   I think-- yeah.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:28.280]   It's not even as-- I've always-- I've found it really curious that the best mechanical
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:32.400]   keyboards on phones are the ones that come with these little $40, $50 or free-with-contract
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.720]   phones, where they just say, we're just going to do a keyboard that's just for texting.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.640]   We're not going to try to manipulate an entire user interface with it.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:44.400]   We want to make sure that kids who are 10 and 11 years old can type a type in text to
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.160]   40 words from it, which is their usual speech.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.160]   And they can't do that with a Droid phone.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.480]   But yeah, if I were to buy a Droid, it would be one without a keyboard.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.680]   I think the-- and the--
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.680]   And the-- and--
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.840]   And Android's predictive text is excellent.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.160]   I think it's better than the apples.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.160]   I don't think so.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.160]   But it was doing some weird things.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:07.840]   For the first week, Apple's predictive text usually gets-- when it gets it wrong, it's
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.640]   totally inside the ballpark.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.640]   It's never done something like-- I'm making up this example, but it's the sort of thing
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:13.640]   that it would do.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:20.560]   If I type-- I mean to type A and D, and I type A and-- I don't know-- E. And it'll
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.560]   change it to anti-diluvian.
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.360]   Like, no, no, no, no.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.440]   That's way too many letters.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.440]   Why are you guessing an 8/11 letter word based on three?
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.760]   That just seems wrong, Andrew.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.400]   Well, it keeps doing it.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.440]   So you add another letter, it's going to guess again, right?
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.160]   Well, but sometimes-- like, what if you were just trying to type a three-letter word to
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.160]   begin with?
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.880]   As soon as you hit space, it's predicting anti-diluvian and as soon as you type space,
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.760]   it thinks you said, OK, that-- I guess that is right.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.760]   Great.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.840]   I'm trying to show this, but you can't really see it on the screen.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.160]   But what happens is you start typing, there's a bar above the keyboard.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.680]   This I like better than the apple.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.120]   There's a bar of the keyboard that-- I just typed TH.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:59.800]   It gives you theater, the, that, this, and more choices.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.800]   Quite a few more choices.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.160]   That one is-- This is the droid.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.160]   That's the droid.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.240]   But the heiress will do the same thing.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.720]   That's the same.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.520]   Once you can upgrade the heiress to 2.0, and apparently that's imminent.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:15.720]   So I can start typing now, I type TH, but let me type an I, and now it reduces it to--
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:20.280]   actually, it doesn't, because it thinks maybe I made a mistake with the I.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:25.000]   So I give you more choices, gives you full words that you can tap.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.600]   It's more like T9, but with a large selection of choices.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.040]   I think it's-- I prefer this.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:35.200]   And I'm certainly as accurate with this, because it does pretty much the same thing, you know,
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:39.960]   makes-- when you type a key, it pops up a big version of the key.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:44.480]   And also, if you keep holding it, it gives you the diacritical remarks.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.880]   I think it's as good as the iPhone.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.880]   I really do.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.880]   That's made by Motorola.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.880]   This is the droid.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:53.360]   Now, the heiress is exactly the same, except that the heiress as shipping has the earlier
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.520]   version of the Android operating system, 1.6.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.560]   But my context at Verizon-- you know, I have context now.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.360]   Scott, when you left, I had to get some context.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.360]   Quick.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:09.120]   And the context of Verizon tell me that it will have 2.0 imminently.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.520]   When that happens, I think the heiress is going to be the one you want.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.320]   My sister got an heiress and loves it.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.720]   Anyway, I don't know.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.720]   That's off the point.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.440]   But people are getting upset because we're talking about Android, but this is the competition,
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.440]   right?
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:26.600]   This is-- you can't ignore the competition.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.600]   Maybe you can.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.080]   Maybe they just would prefer we don't talk about anything else.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.040]   Do you see Dragon Dictate for the iPhone?
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.400]   I did indeed.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.320]   Did you try it?
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.320]   I tried it.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:44.040]   I downloaded it and I kind of gave it the big fail stamp just out of a case of peak.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:47.960]   Now, to give you some background, it's not like the desktop edition where you can just
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.240]   simply talk and talk and talk and let you dictate an entire document.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.000]   That would be substantially awesome for an iPhone app to do.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.040]   It really is only for doing text messages, brief emails.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.840]   You can speak about a couple of sentences before it has to stop and start percolating
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.120]   what you said.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:09.920]   Also the code for interpreting-- turning your text-- your speech into text is not inside
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.880]   the software-- the iPhone app.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:17.560]   What it does is it sends an audio recording to a central server from nuance and does all
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.360]   the transmogrification on that server.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:23.520]   Then the server sends back its best guess as to the actual text.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:28.800]   It does a very, very good job of turning a spoken text into printed text.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:35.640]   It does something really, really-- that it has two things that will give people pause.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:40.520]   If you read the terms of use, it says, oh, by the way, we're going to be sending all
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.640]   of your contact names to our central database.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.360]   And a lot of people are thinking, well, what does it need all my email addresses and phone
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.360]   numbers for?
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.600]   Well, that's a tough thing on principle, but it's not sending all that information.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:55.080]   It's just sending proper names so they can do a better job of recognizing the names that
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.040]   you're likely to say.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   So that's step one.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.520]   You can sort of get past that.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.560]   My problem is that it censors what you say.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:08.680]   Now, this is going to be difficult for me to speak like this because this podcast is
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.840]   not intended to have the explicit tag.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:16.800]   But I read the first page of "Fear and Loe the In Los Vegas," and it had a problem with
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.600]   the word "God damn."
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:24.320]   So it interpreted correctly, but it appeared as text as G*D-D-A-M-N.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.320]   You're kidding!
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.920]   It had no problem with the cocaine use, had no problem with the giant spiders, but it
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.920]   has to be solved.
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:34.840]   So, of course, I had to go and get a copy of George Carlin's famous--
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.840]   Oh, oh.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.840]   --somewhere to the same television.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.840]   And, of course, every single naughty word was replaced by a word that was not-- either
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.720]   it couldn't understand it or it would censor it.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.160]   And there are so many words that I absolutely cannot say.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.360]   I want you to imagine me at three in the morning last night patiently.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:58.960]   Let's say that one of these words was "cup."
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:03.600]   Now, I want you to imagine me saying "cup" over and over again.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.600]   Period.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.600]   Nope.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.600]   "cup."
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.600]   Period.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.600]   "cup."
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.600]   Period.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.600]   "cup."
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.600]   Period.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.600]   "cup."
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.600]   Period.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.600]   "cup."
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.600]   Period.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:20.120]   My home is not being bugged by the FBI because if ever a law enforcement agency needed an
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:24.520]   excuse to just come crashing through the window and take me down, said, "I don't know.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.480]   We have no evidence this guy's done anything but anybody who spends that much time saying
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:34.480]   that word over and over again with such care caution and passion, he's got to have something
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:37.240]   in the basement that we need to know about."
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:41.840]   And every single time would either get that word wrong no matter how clearly I enunciated
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.280]   it or it would simply censor it with asterisks.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:51.320]   And now, I mean, I don't think that this company or a bunch of evil jerks, you can take a guess
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.800]   that they did this.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:57.280]   T, either A, make sure that the app wouldn't get banned by the app store or B, to make sure
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:01.800]   that it just simply wouldn't get an explicit tag because if you say a certain word, if you
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:06.120]   say, if you were to say a certain word incorrectly and it said back, "Oh, you meant motherdinger."
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.120]   No, I didn't.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.120]   And that's really not what I said.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.120]   Dragon.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.520]   It's an interesting choice that they made.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.520]   You know what?
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.720]   Oh, I know why they did that.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.920]   App Store approval process.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.720]   That's what that's why I'm saying.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:24.040]   Either just to get it approved or to get it so that make sure it would not get an explicit
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.640]   tag attached to it.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.800]   But still I just don't...
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:31.400]   You know the Apple guy sits there going, "Let's see what happens when I say cup."
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:36.960]   Yeah, but it's such a deal-breaking thing for me that if I were to... if I try to write
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:42.240]   a certain word and you know that that word is, but it's just a word that you think is
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:46.280]   naughty for whatever legal reason or innocent reason, you have an obligation to give me the
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.120]   word that I tried to write.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.720]   And it's a simple thing to simply go.
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:55.720]   It will not prevent you from going back from replacing the asterisk with, I don't know,
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.720]   vowels.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:02.400]   But it's just on top of the fact that it's not a profoundly useful utility.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.120]   I've found it very easy to delete it.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.120]   And once it's transmog...
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.600]   And you can keep speaking.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:12.440]   You can say, "Dear Leo, I just wanted to tell you that I will not be appearing on the
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.960]   show next week, period.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:18.200]   I feel as though by trying to say all these naughty words, I have demoralized the show
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.800]   and made it impossible to continue, period.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.760]   Let it interpret things when it sends out of time.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.720]   Once you've got all that stuff, you can... so you can't string together a long email.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:31.240]   Then once you're done with it, you can either copy it to a clipboard or send it as an email
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.400]   or send it as a text message.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.720]   I would think it would be really, really great if they came out with a word processor for
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.920]   the iPhone that worked that way.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:44.160]   But I shall look forward to Dragon's future career with considerable interest.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.680]   But for now, it's like, "Okay, nice little toy.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.320]   It's free, so okay, go ahead and download it."
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.320]   I just didn't like it.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.800]   Yeah, it won't be free forever.
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:58.080]   But I think we've learned now that if you... from people like Madomie and Shazam, if an
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.760]   application is free, get it.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.560]   Oh, we already know that if it's been approved, get it.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:10.440]   Right, but actually good point.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.840]   As long as we're talking about App Store, let's talk about this story.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:17.960]   Phil Schiller has taken... this is according to Mac Rumors, has taken the action based
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:22.560]   on a complaint that one App Store developer was raising or boosting their apps ratings.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.240]   This happens, I'm sure, all the time with fake reviews.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.640]   Now there's a quote in here and I guess this is from Phil.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.840]   I'm not sure, Arnold Kim wrote it.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:35.520]   "Please investigate for I have just looked at 44 of the reviewers who posted reviews for
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:41.120]   this Mollinker Inc. App, Nightcam Pro, and every review except two of the 44 Plus are
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.640]   all fake five-star reviews."
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.520]   I guess that customer sent that in.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:56.320]   And the customer emailed Schiller, which resulted in removal of 1900 applications made by Molicker.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.820]   Oops.
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.820]   You don't want to piss off the Schiller.
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.020]   Well, again, there's the irony of it.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.820]   His first words being "chill."
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:05.820]   So...
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:06.820]   Wow.
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:08.740]   I mean, that's harsh punishment.
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:09.740]   But appropriate.
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:10.740]   That's...
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:11.740]   I think totally...
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:12.740]   It totally...
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:13.740]   It totally protects you.
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:14.740]   It's true.
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:18.460]   But, you know, my gosh, what if they're by some weird, you know...
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.780]   What if people actually liked the application?
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:21.780]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.980]   I mean, what if we said, well, you know, that Mac Break Weekly got an awful lot of positive
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.660]   reviews over there on iTunes.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:28.660]   So...
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:33.260]   I was thinking that if we want to take down an NPR show, we can just start flooding it
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.660]   with incredibly positive reviews from the same items.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:36.660]   Exactly.
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:37.660]   And the same thing...
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.780]   I think the entire iTunes TV system needs to be revamped.
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:50.100]   Hey, speaking of iTunes, two shows on iTunes released its rewind, which is the best podcast
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:51.340]   of 2009.
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:53.180]   This show is not on it.
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:46:00.380]   However, oddly enough, I'm not sure why, in the classic video section, Mac Break Video...
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:01.380]   is up there.
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.380]   I'm not sure.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.380]   I don't really understand.
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:04.380]   Is that up there now?
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:05.380]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:06.380]   This is...
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:09.580]   If you go to iTunes, you go to the iTunes Store, you can see the best of 2009 in audio...
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:11.580]   Well, I mean, the 2008 best of...
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:12.780]   Yeah, I think this must be...
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.180]   I don't know what it is.
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:15.180]   Oh, I guess there's...
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.180]   We're in classic.
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.180]   I get it.
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.180]   Okay.
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.980]   So there's new for this year.
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:24.060]   And of course, we only have a few new shows, one of which is in there, which is this week
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.060]   in fun.
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.620]   Congratulations to Sarah and Marty.
[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:33.220]   And then, Twit is in the classic audio category.
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:37.340]   I don't see Mac Break Weekly really should be in the classic audio category, but...
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.300]   Hey, we can't tell them what to say.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.340]   And Mac Break Video...
[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:43.820]   Maybe they thought, "Well, we're putting...
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:44.820]   Maybe it's a...
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:45.820]   I don't know.
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:46.820]   Maybe we confuse them."
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.740]   But Mac Break Video is in the classic video category.
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.300]   Hey, I'm happy.
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.860]   We got three shows out of there.
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:53.860]   That's fine.
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:57.460]   The useful thing, though, to know about, if you go to the iTunes Store, you can look
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:01.860]   at the Rewind and see which podcasts did well in iTunes.
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:06.860]   Well, yeah, it's the best 2009 podcast.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.460]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:13.580]   The classics are one's released pre-2009 and the 2009 podcast are the ones that were released
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:14.580]   this year.
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.980]   It started prior to 2009.
[00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:19.300]   Exactly.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.300]   So, Sue Zorman is number one in video.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.820]   The Sue Zorman show.
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:24.900]   And Adam Corolla's podcast is number one in audio.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.420]   And I know he started his this year in 2009.
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:31.980]   And actually, kind of appropriate, old Jews telling jokes from Jetpack Media is number
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.620]   two in video.
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:37.820]   I don't know why I said that, but it's true.
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:41.420]   Didn't even get a laugh.
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.500]   It's interesting what's in here.
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:45.500]   Steve Dolls show.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.660]   Good for you, Steve.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:51.140]   It's funny, you know, most of the new stuff is mainstream media, most of the new stuff
[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:52.140]   that's being launched.
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:53.140]   Yeah.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.140]   And I guess that's not surprising.
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:57.660]   It's just another corporate takeover.
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:58.940]   Let us take a break.
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:02.700]   Speaking of corporate takeovers and give forward a chance to talk, but we'll be back with
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:05.900]   more stories and, of course, your picks of the week coming up in just a bit.
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.140]   Good news for Apple in retail.
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:13.500]   And I didn't want to tell you this because I was afraid Scott would run out the door.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.260]   The Mac Pros have been updated.
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:16.260]   Details.
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.260]   I got one.
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:18.260]   Oh, all right.
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:19.260]   Good.
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.900]   Well, you're fast on the boom.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.780]   I got one.
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:24.620]   I bought it.
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:26.380]   But first I want to tell you about the great Ford Sync.
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.660]   Do you have you ever driven a Ford Scott?
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:30.820]   Is that believe that I have driven a Ford before?
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:31.820]   You got to try the new Ford's.
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:37.180]   I am in love with them and I'm especially in love with the Ford Flex a couple of weeks
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.180]   ago.
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:39.900]   Oh, what do you think that has sync in it?
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.020]   It is an amazing vehicle.
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:45.580]   It's not exactly designed for horizontally challenged drivers.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:46.580]   Oh, really?
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:47.580]   Oh, interesting.
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:52.740]   We were going to get a flex for our trip to CES because it's kind of a it's a weird
[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.300]   hybrid vehicles like huge.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:58.780]   It's kind of like a suburban sort of like suburban like it's not as tall.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:48:59.780]   Right.
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:00.780]   I loved it.
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:01.780]   It's got tons of cool technology.
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:02.780]   It'll park itself.
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:03.780]   Right.
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:04.780]   Isn't that wild?
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:05.780]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.940]   And it has the Ford Sync.
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:09.220]   I don't know if you got a chance to play with it.
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:13.380]   This is the voice activated hands free stuff from Ford that is.
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:19.740]   In fact, JD power just rated it number one in customer satisfaction among all automotive
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:22.020]   GPS devices.
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:25.260]   So that's I mean, it's I've been telling you how good it is.
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:27.580]   Now we got proof.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.860]   It is GPS.
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:33.380]   Even if you didn't buy the screen GPS, it's voice activated.
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:37.500]   You say destination, it goes bunk and you say Scott Born's place and it'll take you
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:38.500]   there.
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:39.900]   It'll monitor traffic.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:43.540]   Scott this new serious, what's it called?
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:47.980]   Traffic link that it'll monitor the traffic and route you around traffic.
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:52.140]   If there are problems or warn you that there's traffic ahead.
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.380]   Of course, it works with all your phones.
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:57.660]   I'll be trying it later in the day with the Nokia, but I know it'll have no problem with
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.580]   all the Bluetooth phones.
[00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.060]   It reads in your address book.
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.060]   So it tells you who's calling.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:05.140]   You can tell it to call people by name.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:06.780]   So this has something to do with your new Mustang.
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:07.780]   I take it.
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:09.620]   This is why I bought a Mustang.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:13.220]   You know what happened is I went into the Ford dealer to look at sync because I knew they
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.300]   were going to be buying ads and I played with it for a while.
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.540]   Then I thought, well, we should test drive.
[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:19.980]   So I tried the SHO, which is the new Taurus, which is incredible.
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.260]   That EcoBoost engine is amazing.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:27.860]   And then Lisa, my COO says, Lisa, I made the mistake.
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:30.340]   I went with Lisa and Tony and calling.
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:36.100]   I got three car fans in the office and they said, well, let's drive the Mustang.
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:40.060]   They won't let you drive the Cobra because you can't, they're afraid you'll take off.
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:42.020]   They'll let you drive it after you pay for it.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.660]   You have to buy it.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:49.980]   So I drove the GTO premium and I fell in love and I said, well, I asked Lisa, can I buy
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:50.980]   it?
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.660]   She said, well, I guess so I bought it.
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:57.540]   But I love this car and it has the Ford sync in it.
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:58.820]   You can tell it play the Beatles.
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:00.160]   It'll play the Beatles.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.540]   You could tell it play Mac Break Weekly 170.
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:03.540]   It will find it and play it.
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:05.700]   I do it with my books on tape, the audio books.
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:10.220]   Actually, what I started doing, I used to, you can connect devices via Bluetooth.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:11.460]   It'll play the audio via Bluetooth.
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:16.580]   So when I get in the car, it'll play stuff from my iPhone or my Droid or my Nokia or
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.540]   anything else that has MP3s on it.
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:21.420]   But you can also, it's got a USB port.
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:22.980]   So I leave an iPod.
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:27.940]   I have an 80 gig iPod that I leave in there that's got all my music, all my audio books
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:28.940]   on it.
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:29.940]   It indexed them.
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.220]   It took about 30 seconds to index the whole thing.
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:37.020]   And it's funny because when you look at the iPod, it actually says, "Ford" on the iPod
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:38.020]   now.
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:40.100]   So it somehow knows and it's talking to the iPod.
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:43.260]   It also, as I said, says automotive computing or something like that.
[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.260]   So it's really cool.
[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:46.340]   And now I could call for songs.
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:47.860]   My name, I could say, oh, this worked great.
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:48.860]   I was listening to a song.
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:49.860]   I loved it.
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:50.860]   I said, "Play similar."
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:53.660]   And I don't know how, but it made a playlist of similar songs.
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:55.420]   It was awesome.
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.420]   I want you to check it out.
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:57.420]   There's a couple of things you could do.

[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.540]   Go to afford Lincoln or Mercury dealer.
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:33.940]   I see you, Scott Born, in that new Lincoln MKS.
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:35.820]   Is that the one that's like the edge?
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:36.820]   It's beautiful.
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:37.820]   That's the Lincoln version of the edge.
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.620]   Yeah, it's just gorgeous.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:43.820]   You know, I actually tell you, I test drove an edge last year.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:45.460]   And I was actually pretty surprised.
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.460]   I mean, for the money, it's an amazing vehicle.
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:50.460]   Of course, I ended up with the Benz, but it's...
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.660]   I'm thinking that you...
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:54.020]   The Benz lease is up.
[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.860]   So, you know, we got a Ford in your future.
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:59.860]   There could be... or there could be a new Camaro in my future.
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:00.860]   Those new Camaro's...
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:01.860]   Yeah, see, but people are...
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:07.180]   I think that's more the Megan Fox effect than an actual car.
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.820]   That's the only excuse I need.
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:11.660]   I got bad news for you.
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:12.660]   Yeah.
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.100]   The Camaro does not come with Megan Fox.
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:15.100]   Oh, wait!
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.500]   Andy, is that true?
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:19.700]   I hear all these people talking about the new Camaro.
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:23.500]   And I think, you know, it's just because of Transformers.
[00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.140]   And you need to research this.
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:28.020]   I'm of the belief that Megan Fox comes with the Camaro.
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.580]   No, she does not.
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:31.940]   Buy American, buy Ford.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.660]   And once again, we're flirting with the explicit tag
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:36.140]   because I have a joke that says...
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:37.820]   All you gotta do is change one corner of the world.
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:39.460]   Don't make that joke.
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.620]   Boy, do we have a hook.
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:42.940]   Don't make...
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:45.740]   It's the 11 PM show after the strip opens it down.
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:46.740]   Yeah, that...
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.580]   But you know what would really attract a large audience?
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:49.580]   What's that?
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.500]   Is if you and I went down to Laguna Seica
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.780]   and I took the Camaro and he took the Ford and...
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:54.780]   I'll beat you.
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:56.380]   I'll just see what I love it.
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:59.100]   I haven't had stick vehicle in a long, long time
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:00.700]   and it's so much fun.
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:02.260]   I just...
[00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:03.380]   I haven't had so much fun driving.
[00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:04.380]   And I have to say...
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:05.980]   What did you get?
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:10.740]   I got the top GTO premium engine that you can get, the 8V8.
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:11.740]   Cool.
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:12.740]   Not the Cobra.
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:14.140]   You know, the Cobra, I was really tempted,
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:15.140]   but it's too much attention.
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:17.060]   How much different would it have been to get the Cobra?
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:18.340]   15 grand more for the Cobra.
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:20.020]   And I didn't need all that horsepower.
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:21.940]   I really didn't.
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:23.740]   It was so tempting, though.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.740]   I have to go test drive it just for fun.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:26.740]   There's so much...
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:29.540]   You know, they are so solid now.
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:30.540]   They feel so...
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:33.500]   I really think this company is an amazing company.
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.460]   I had a green 67.
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:37.140]   You did?
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.980]   Look at the new styling too of the 2010s.
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:41.060]   Although you might want to get the cost in 1967.
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.300]   No, you don't even tell me.
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:43.300]   How much?
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.300]   $2,200 bucks.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:45.300]   Science yield and deliverance.
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.660]   That's about the same if you adjust for inflation.
[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:50.700]   That's more than I've ever spent on a car in my life.
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:53.700]   He walks.
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.700]   I am a freelancer.
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.700]   Yes.
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:55:02.700]   No, you know, the 2011 Mustang, they got a new engine they're putting in that sucker.
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:06.060]   But you're not in a fuel economy.
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.860]   So I would go with the 2010s.
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:10.180]   I take umbrage with that statement.
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:15.620]   In the work truck, I've got the new Chevy engine that does the four cylinder thing when
[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:16.980]   you don't need all eight.
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:17.980]   There you go.
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:18.980]   Well, that's what this is.
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:19.980]   This is a V6.
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:23.660]   That's what's in the Taurus as well as a V6 with performance like a V8.
[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:24.660]   But the EcoBoost engine.
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:27.100]   And it's the same thing, Shavis.
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:30.900]   And when I got the Benz, I got the V6 instead of the V8 trying to save.
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:31.900]   Good for you.
[00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:32.900]   I'm impressed.
[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:33.900]   I got the V8.
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:34.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:36.620]   And I love it.
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:39.140]   And I got the special pack racing package.
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:41.540]   So I got the limited slip differential and all that stuff.
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:42.540]   It's fun.
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:43.780]   I'm going to go test drive it because of you.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:44.780]   I'm going to tell him.
[00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:45.780]   You come.
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:46.780]   You come.
[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:48.060]   You do that and look at the sink more importantly.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:50.460]   But also you come down here and you could borrow the four.
[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:52.460]   You could drive back to Gig Harbor and come back.
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:54.460]   It'll take you about 10 minutes.
[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:55.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:58.460]   Sink my right podcast.com.
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:06.460]   OK, the sink has support for multiple phones up to 12.
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:07.860]   Now I thought it was 25.
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:10.660]   Hey, how many phones do you need?
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:14.340]   It attempts connection with the primary phone and switches to another linked phone as needed.
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:18.420]   Oh, and the other thing that's cool, it has a 911 assist.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:21.980]   So if your airbags deploy, it uses your phone to call 911, feeds them.
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:25.300]   The GPS coordinates and then lets you take over.
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.460]   Hey, let's move on.
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:27.780]   Big story.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:31.580]   Apple Cupertino Campus gets green light for expansion.
[00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:37.580]   Steve Jobs talking in front of the Cupertino Planning Commission or something like that.
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:38.580]   I don't know.
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:39.580]   I don't know who it is.
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:46.740]   It's our honor to have the Apple seal Mr. Jobs to be here and sharing the information
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:48.700]   with us at Valkom Mr. Job.
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.980]   She doesn't even know his name, Mr. Job.
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:54.780]   You can use any one of my phone there.
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:55.780]   Steve Jobs testifying.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.780]   All right.
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:00.780]   The planning commission said a very light agenda tonight just to.
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:01.780]   Just to be clear.
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:04.980]   I don't have much of a presentation.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:12.260]   I mostly just came down to tell you something and get your feedback on it.
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:16.260]   When you know we started Apple and my parents garage three years ago.
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:17.660]   Can I say something?
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:18.660]   He looks great.
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:19.660]   Hey guys.
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:21.660]   He just looks great.
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:24.420]   Also we started on April 5th.
[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:28.500]   By the way, as Ken Shepardson's pointing out, jeans and black turtleneck.
[00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:29.500]   There you go.
[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:30.860]   He's back the way he started.
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:32.860]   I just came down to tell you something.
[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:33.860]   Yeah.
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:36.860]   When we started our garage, how humble can you get?
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:41.900]   After about a year, we moved to Cupertino.
[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:46.140]   We've been here for almost 30 years.
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:49.580]   And been here ever since.
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:56.300]   What's happened to Apple is that our business has basically tripled in the last five or six
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:57.300]   years.
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:58.300]   Gosh.
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.300]   Wait a minute.
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.300]   They're saying this is a few years old.
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:02.300]   20 years old.
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:03.300]   This is a recent sales basically.
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:04.700]   Hey man, I have to look.
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:08.580]   And this is him asking in 2000.
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:10.740]   No one looks so good.
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.220]   This is him asking in 2006.
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:13.220]   It's like a Kim Jong-il.
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.340]   It's the Mac Break Weekly version of Breaking News.
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.700]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:20.300]   So that's him asking now three years later, they got it.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:21.300]   Okay.
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:25.020]   So things move swiftly there in Cupertino.
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:31.660]   You'd think having Steve Job come talk to them would have helped them move it along.
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:34.700]   He does mention that Apple's the largest local tax player pair.
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:40.860]   But so it's a 7.78 acre property.
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:41.860]   Nearly eight acres.
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:42.980]   They're going to expand the campus there.
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:49.700]   The buildings are currently occupied by Apple employees.
[00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:50.700]   They're tilt ups.
[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:54.260]   The city rezoned the site to residential.
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:59:01.300]   But they've I guess allowed now allowed Apple to occupy this and expand into it.
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:02.940]   Triple in size.
[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:04.700]   So shoot, I thought that was recent.
[00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:05.700]   I'm disappointed.
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:07.980]   I thought that was a thank you for correcting me folks.
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:10.340]   Are we going to talk about the new Mac Pro?
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.340]   Oh, you.
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:12.340]   Yes.
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:13.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:14.340]   I'm going to talk about it.

[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:12.340]   I'm going to talk about it.

[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:49.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:50.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:51.340]   I'm going to talk about it.

[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:54.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:55.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:56.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:58.340]   I'm going to talk about it.

[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:09.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:10.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:11.340]   I'm going to talk about it.

[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:13.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:14.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:15.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:16.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:17.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:19.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:20.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:22.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:23.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:24.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:27.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:28.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:29.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:31.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:32.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:33.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:34.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:35.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:36.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:37.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:39.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:40.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:41.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:42.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:43.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:44.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:45.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:46.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:47.340]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:54.340]   In light of that, we often like to recommend a book for your reading pleasure.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:59.340]   I'm just now reading the second of the two big Jerry Pournell Larry Niven books.
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:02.340]   I'm really enjoying the Moten God's Eye.
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:05.340]   I just finished Lucifer's Hammer, which is incredible.
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:08.340]   So many good books at Audible, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:11.340]   It's fun to browse.
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:16.340]   If you love books, Audible's great because I know none of us have the time we'd like
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:17.340]   to have for reading.
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:20.340]   Audible's good because you get in the car and you can listen.
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:21.340]   You're at the gym.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:22.340]   You can listen.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:25.340]   Even just washing dishes or walking the dog.
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:27.340]   It's a great way to get more reading done.
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:31.340]   Anytime you can't hold a book in your hands, you can listen to a book from Audible.com.
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:33.340]   With their unabridged books, you get every word.
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:35.340]   In fact, I think you absorb it even better.
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.340]   Andy, you have a pick.
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:41.340]   I don't want to always put you on the spot, but your picks have been so great.
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:43.340]   I hate to, you know.
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:46.340]   And I have a really great one.
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:50.840]   Sometimes my own Audible books get kind of backed up because sometimes all the week where
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:55.140]   you'll get through the entire book in one week of hellaciously bad traffic and sometimes
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:56.340]   it takes a couple of weeks.
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:03.440]   I might even skip, take a break from the San Matevis Jr. biography to move on to this one
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.940]   because I'm really excited.
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:07.140]   As soon as I encountered it, I got really excited about it.
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:13.140]   It's called Reading the O-E-D, One Man, One Year, 21,730 pages.
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:14.140]   My wife just read that.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:15.140]   She said I would love it.
[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:17.140]   It's full of words.
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:22.740]   Yeah, it's about, it takes a really complicated and maybe even boring subject and finds a
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:24.740]   way into it that makes it fascinating.
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:28.140]   The author is a big fan, a big devotee of dictionaries.
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:30.140]   You know, it's a thousand dictionaries.
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:37.140]   So, he sets himself the task to spend an entire year reading every single page of the Oxford
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.140]   English Dictionary.
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:41.140]   I gotta say that's about, I have it here and I'm looking at it.
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:42.140]   It's about six feet.
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:43.740]   It's like 30 volumes.
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:44.740]   This is a lot.
[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:45.740]   Right.
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:48.660]   And so, it's every single thing that you could think of that would be great about a book
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:49.660]   like that.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:50.660]   It delivers.
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:54.740]   Not only the problems, the simple mechanical and physical exhaustion you get by reading
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:59.980]   all that tiny type for eight to ten hours a day, every day, all year long.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:02.340]   I've been reading like multiple reviews of it.
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:07.620]   I downloaded the digital edition and have read the first couple of parts of it.
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:11.980]   Just the problems of where can, I need to go somewhere where I'm not distracted by, when
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:15.020]   he starts off, he gets distracted by finding a word in the OED.
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:18.780]   I'm wondering, Gia, I wonder how this is defined by my other dictionaries and that slows
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:19.780]   him down.
[01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:22.620]   Then he needs to find places where he can read without distraction.
[01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:26.700]   He finally finds a French library where there's nothing in that library that interests him
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:28.260]   in any way.
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:32.140]   You've heard of the phenomenon of having Tetris-ized, where you play Tetris for so long when you
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:35.820]   close your eyes, you see nothing but Tetris blocks tumbling down.
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:41.780]   He had the same vision problems just by staring at these white pages day after day after day.
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:45.500]   It's presented in the form of 26 chapters, one for each letter.
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:49.340]   Not only are we hearing the story of how difficult it is to achieve this and how other
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:54.100]   people, even other people who are lexicographers, not understanding why he's doing this, but
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:57.660]   also every chapter contains several of the best.
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:02.700]   Every time he encounters a really cool word, he has to write it down for his own edification.
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:06.660]   We're presented with lists of really cool words from the OED.
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:10.700]   Some of them from reviews that I've really had to write down, there is actually a word
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.500]   for the fear of dinner parties.
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.220]   That's dengnophobia.
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:20.420]   To be small, something is to splatter it with your own saliva.
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:26.900]   The acnesis is the part of an animal's back that the animal can't reach to scratch.
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:31.060]   Every single, I fell in love with this just by the topic itself because I'm already a
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:35.860]   fan of these books where the author just decides to take upon a challenge that only makes sense
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:38.860]   to himself and actually sees it through the end.
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:43.460]   But every description that I read about this book and then hitting the guy's site just
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:45.660]   made me fall more and more in love with this book.
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:49.060]   I really think I'm going to have to just skip to this audiobook because I can't wait to
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:50.580]   start getting into it.
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:51.620]   I can't wait to.
[01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:55.020]   My wife loved it.
[01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:56.020]   Reading the OED.
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:17:01.300]   One man, one year, 21,730 pages by Ammon Shea.
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:05.140]   Now one of the things you could do with the Audible site is you can get excerpts of every
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:06.220]   book and listen.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:08.100]   So you can hear what the reader is going to sound like.
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:09.660]   This is a short book, five hours.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:11.700]   It's almost like an hors d'oeuvre.
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:14.860]   Listen, you get it done in a week.
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:15.860]   It's not a bridge.
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:17.780]   It's probably the perfect length for an audiobook.
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:18.780]   Yeah.
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:21.380]   You know, for your first audiobook maybe, you don't...
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:22.380]   I don't know.
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.540]   It depends on the person.
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:28.300]   Sometimes I like the idea of long books because you get so immersed and you get into
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:29.460]   the world and it's...
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:33.660]   I'm reading, still reading this song of what is Ice and Fire.
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:37.820]   George RR Martin's amazing quadrilogy, quintology.
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:39.740]   It's five books I think now.
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:40.980]   And I think more to come.
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:42.580]   I think six total.
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:47.060]   And it's wonderful to get immersed in that world or chantarram which I know you recommended
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.260]   some time ago.
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:50.620]   But sometimes you just want a little hors d'oeuvre.
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:52.780]   Maybe this is your first Audible book.
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:53.780]   Give it a try.
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:55.820]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:57.420]   Your first book's free.
[01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:58.980]   You get it to keep it no matter what.
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:02.540]   But I have a feeling you'll be back for more because Audible is just wonderful.
[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:05.260]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:07.740]   We thank them for their support.
[01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:12.300]   So you're the guy that just came back, Mr. Scott Borne.
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:16.420]   I think you should start us off because you've been so excited about your pick.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:20.500]   Alright, this is less than an Alex.
[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.260]   That's not saying much.
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:26.260]   However, it's very expensive for what it is but I love it.
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:29.940]   I'm about to write more about this on photofocus.com.
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:33.020]   I've already reviewed it but I've got a couple other things to say about it.
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:39.100]   If we can get this on camera, this is the Zicudo Z-finder.
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:41.460]   What the hell is that?
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:42.660]   I'll show you.
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:49.260]   Now, if you're over 40, you can't read anything unless you put it out at arm's length.
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:50.260]   Right?
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:51.260]   Right.
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:52.260]   We all know this.
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:56.500]   Well, how do you then use a camera that has live view on the back?
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.420]   Well, with a Zicudo Ziba Dimer.
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:00.420]   Of course.
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:01.420]   You use the Zicudo Z-finder.
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:02.740]   So let me show you how this works.
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:05.620]   This works on any camera with a 3-inch LCD.
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:09.980]   It's actually designed to help people who use video on these new cameras because, you
[01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:12.300]   know, the 5D Mark II, 7D, I need this.
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:13.780]   I need all the rate.
[01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:14.780]   Yeah, no, I need this.
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:17.380]   And you can't really watch the LCD camera.
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:18.380]   You can't.
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:19.380]   Yeah.
[01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:22.580]   So you take, now I happen to have here the cute little Olympus pen EP1.
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:23.580]   What do you think of that?
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:25.820]   I have one too and I really enjoy that camera.
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:27.380]   Well, it's good with the pancake lens.
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:28.380]   I like the pancake lens.
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:29.380]   That's right.
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:30.380]   I got the 17M millimeter pencil.
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:36.060]   So there's a little frame that you just glued to the back and it comes right off if you want
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:37.060]   to take it off.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.060]   It's no big deal.
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.780]   And then this mounts to that.
[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:44.420]   And so now you've got this.
[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:48.940]   Now I realize this defeats the purpose on this camera.
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:52.260]   Yeah, I bought a small camera so I could put a Zicudo on it.
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:57.700]   Right now the Olympus designer who decided that really sexy slim-spelt camera, he's
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:20:00.700]   throwing the rope over the rafter, he's climbing up with the pencil.
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:01.700]   You guys!
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:02.700]   Why do I bother?
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:06.060]   I just thought this would be easier to get on camera than to hook up my big camera.
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.060]   No, I understand.
[01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:12.460]   But these cameras, all these little compact camera shoot video, which means live view.
[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:16.300]   And so the advantage of this is you have a point of contact with this rubber man.
[01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:17.300]   I think that's a good idea.
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:18.300]   That's a great idea.
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:19.300]   And so that's going to keep it steady.
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:21.620]   You look like a freaking idiot, but that's a great idea.
[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:22.620]   You know what?
[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:26.180]   I gave up worried about how I look a long time ago if you didn't notice.
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:29.180]   Anyway, and it comes right off.
[01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:30.180]   So it's not perfect.
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:31.620]   You don't have to have it on there.
[01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:34.580]   How much is this going to cost me back though?
[01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:37.180]   Well I'm kind of trying to delay that information.
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:38.180]   Oh boy.
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:39.780]   Let me continue to build value here.
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:41.620]   Build value in the Zicudo Z Finder.
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:43.260]   It's 400 bucks.
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:45.300]   Oh yeah, that's more than the camera almost.
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:46.780]   It's a Schneider optic.
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:47.780]   Oh, okay.
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:48.820]   Which is not cheap glass.
[01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:50.980]   Does it magnify?
[01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:52.580]   It magnifies 3X.
[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:54.420]   Okay, okay.
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:59.220]   And there's this little knob here, this red knob, that allows you to fine tune the focus.
[01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:01.020]   Oh you didn't mention the red knob.
[01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:02.020]   Oh wow.
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:03.020]   The red knob.
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:05.180]   And you rotate the eye cup left or right.
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:06.180]   Okay.
[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:09.060]   Now, I will say this.
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:10.180]   There are cheaper solutions.
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:12.100]   They don't work very well in my opinion.
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:13.660]   And yes, this is too expensive.
[01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:18.140]   However, apparently not that much too expensive given the fact that every time they make a
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:20.780]   batch of thousands of these they sell out in a few minutes.
[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:21.780]   It says right.
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:24.820]   But on the site, due to high demand, the Z Finder is currently back ordered.
[01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:28.060]   All orders from November 9th and before have been shipped.
[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:29.900]   We won't get them till December 18th.
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:30.900]   If you order that.
[01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:31.900]   That's the way it worked.
[01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:35.820]   They sell, they have no problem selling them and they're not sponsoring me.
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:37.100]   I get paid to say this.
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:40.100]   Will this work on a D3 or a 5D Mark II or?
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:41.100]   Absolutely.
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:42.100]   Okay.
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:43.100]   Absolutely.
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:43.900]   And here's the cool thing for six bucks.
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:45.700]   You can buy these little frames.
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:48.660]   Oh so you get the frame that matches the camera.
[01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:50.740]   Well, no, there's only one size.
[01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:51.740]   Okay.
[01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:55.580]   So the thing you have to keep in mind is this only works on LCDs that are around three inches
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:56.580]   inside.
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:57.580]   You have to double check.
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:00.100]   They have a list, I believe, on their website of what's applicable.
[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:04.900]   But I bought a bunch of these frames and so I have a frame on every camera.
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:09.220]   So I just need one Z Finder that depending on whichever camera I'm using, I can connect
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:11.740]   it and disconnect it.
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:12.740]   So so that's my.
[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:14.220]   I wish it weren't so expensive.
[01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:15.980]   I would love to have that for my EP.
[01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:20.060]   Well, they are developing a little less expensive model that will have.
[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:21.060]   Sounds good.
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:23.300]   You want to focus, but this is the one you want.
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:27.540]   And the reason it's part of the reason you're paying so much is Schneider optics.
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:30.460]   That's, you know, that's the best.
[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:31.460]   Okay.
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:33.460]   It is less than an Alex.
[01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:35.180]   It's less than an Alex.
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:36.180]   That's my pick.
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:40.940]   The ZFinder and the Enoco, your pick of the week.
[01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:45.540]   Mine is a really cool little utility called airlock.
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:50.460]   It's there's there's I've always I've always really hoped that computers would become a
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:55.180]   little bit more agile at figuring out what situation I'm in right now and what's the
[01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:57.700]   best thing for it to do in that situation.
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:02.060]   I've all meaning that it should realize that, okay, well, no one's in the room right now,
[01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:03.780]   so I can probably do maintenance right now, right?
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:08.100]   I can probably finish that download that got interrupted a while ago.
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:12.860]   At the same time, now that so many of us have these iPhones, I've always thought that,
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:17.500]   well, here's a great opportunity for, and for the Macintosh to sort of sense that if I
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:21.020]   keep the Bluetooth turned on, it has a way of figuring out that, well, Andy's actually
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:22.460]   very, very close by.
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:26.420]   So let's act as though Andy's very close by or Andy's in the room, but he's 10 feet away.
[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:29.660]   So let me change the user interface so it works differently.
[01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:33.820]   Airlock is the first utility that really tries to do a solution like this.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:35.820]   Its core feature is very, very simple.
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:42.060]   You you set it up to recognize the ID of your iPhone and then you simply the its core feature
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:45.860]   is that when you step away from your machine, it will lock the machine.
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:49.900]   Oh, that's when you when you and so anybody who's still in the office can't get access
[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:51.580]   to anything that's on your machine.
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:54.780]   When you get closer to your machine, it automatically unlocks itself.
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:56.140]   You don't have to type in passwords.
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:57.220]   You don't have to do anything.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:03.340]   The fear your the the presence of your iPhone near your machine identifies you and unlocks
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:04.340]   the machine.
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:06.660]   And there's a way to get around it in just in case you left your your your your your
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:07.660]   iPhone in the car.
[01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:10.420]   You still unlock the desktop.
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:13.620]   That's the core feature and it's already pretty darn cool, especially if you work in a big
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:14.620]   office.
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:19.420]   The other the feature that gets it makes it so fascinating to me is that you can also
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:24.620]   configure it with actions that every time your iPhone goes out of range, just like you
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:29.020]   can set startup items by simply clicking on a plus tag and just dragging things into a
[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:30.020]   list.
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:32.700]   It will open all the things you'll drag into that list.
[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:36.380]   You can have another set of actions for what happens whenever your phone comes back into
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:37.380]   range.
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:41.860]   So you can do things like every time that I walk away from my my Mac, I want you to do
[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:45.020]   a system backup because I'm probably going to be gone for about 10 or 15 minutes.
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:49.660]   So it's a good time to do things that would sort of sap the machine.
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:54.580]   Whenever I come back into range, I want you to make mail the front most application and
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:59.900]   I want you to run this automated action that reorganizes my window so that the most recently
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:02.220]   updated window is now front most.
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:07.060]   All this kind of cool stuff that you can now do and make your Macintosh simply respond
[01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:10.980]   to the fact that I am close to my computer or I'm far away from the computer.
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:12.620]   It's got a lot of potential.
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:15.300]   It's version 1.01 right now.
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:16.300]   It's only $7.77.
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:21.340]   I bet there's a story behind that, but let's not go into that.
[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:24.140]   It only has one drawback right now.
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:28.340]   The developer claims that there's a bug with a Mac OS so that if you're trying to use it
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:33.260]   with a Bluetooth keyboard or Bluetooth mouse, including the Magic Mouse, that might interfere
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:36.900]   with some of the special mojo that the app has going on.
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:39.260]   But if you don't have the sort of thing, then it works really wonderfully.
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:43.580]   I've been playing with it for the past three or four days and I'm liking it more and more.
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:47.020]   Of course, you can disable it if you're not nearby.
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:48.740]   You lose your phone and you can't get it.
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:49.740]   Of course, right.
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:54.380]   As a matter of fact, the most comical part of the setup instructions are, here's the check
[01:25:54.380 --> 01:26:00.580]   boxes you should not check if you ever lose your iPhone because you can set it up so that
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:05.460]   you can simply commit suicide by iPhone where you walk away and you toss your iPhone into
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:08.460]   a wood chipper and congratulations, you will never get access to your app.
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:09.460]   That would be bad.
[01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:11.060]   So it is possible to set it up that way.
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:12.820]   Well, it means that not desirable.
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:16.220]   Not in a self-destruct sort of way.
[01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:21.020]   It's sort of like, you know, what it does is it avoids making it avoids allowing you
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:24.940]   to say have a lock box and then putting the key to the lock box inside the lock box then
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:26.580]   locking it.
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:30.700]   So it would be an easy mistake to make but did not say, oh, by the way, if you check this
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:36.460]   box, please don't be an idiot because idiots will not prosper in this work environment.
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:42.060]   You know, we need more opportunity for Darwin to take effect in this modern society.
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:47.500]   Too many of the morons are coddled, protected and isolated from the consequences of their
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:48.500]   stupidity.
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:50.180]   I think this is a good thing.
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:52.660]   You mean everybody doesn't get a plaque?
[01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:55.020]   Yes, everybody gets a plaque.
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:58.060]   That's exactly what I mean.
[01:26:58.060 --> 01:26:59.060]   Yeah.
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:04.700]   There are times when I fantasize about a system that says, I'm sorry, we've danged you not
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:07.020]   smart enough to operate a person in the computer.
[01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:10.380]   But then that's the time when I'd have to go back to a manual typewriter probably.
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:11.380]   No Andrew.
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:13.900]   No, no, that's not true.
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:15.140]   Thank you for the pick.
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:18.460]   You could find that online at is it L.A. LHA?
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:19.460]   What is the website?
[01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:20.460]   MHA?
[01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:22.460]   It's them ha.com.
[01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:23.460]   Them.
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:24.460]   The MHA.com.
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:27.460]   We're running out of URLs.
[01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:31.860]   We're running out of names for things that wall of white noise is getting closer and closer
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:34.580]   with each new get day and each new patent filing.
[01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:35.780]   So it's not really them ha.
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:39.180]   Although that does scan better than the MHA.
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:40.980]   Which is what it really is.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:41.980]   Them ha.
[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:42.980]   Ha!
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:44.820]   Maybe that was their intent.
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:45.820]   Is it free?
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:46.820]   Ha!
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:47.820]   Oh no, it's not free.
[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:48.820]   I know.
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:49.820]   It's $7.77.
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:54.500]   I think in the sense even in this economy, spend one day at the park collecting deposit cans.
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:57.300]   You got yourself a free copy.
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:58.300]   My pick is free.
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:27:59.300]   I'm glad to say.
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:01.060]   Finally, I can save you some money.
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:02.860]   Of course it is the new Google Chrome.
[01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:04.420]   You mentioned it a little bit earlier.
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:07.900]   Finally out today for the Mac.
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:11.740]   And some of you with sharp eyes watching the video today might have noticed that in fact
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:15.860]   all of my browsing, all of my links have been on Google Chrome.
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:17.100]   I haven't had a crash.
[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:20.100]   Oh look, Google's got a Popeye logo on the...
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:21.100]   Okay.
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:28.140]   So Google Chrome is now finally officially available.
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:31.100]   A lot of people have been using the Chromium build.
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:32.860]   And this doesn't seem so very much different.
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:37.500]   It also, I have to say, doesn't seem so very much faster.
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:44.140]   In fact, I would say, you know, WebKit or even Safari 4 is probably just about as fast.
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:46.340]   Especially if you're going to sites like Twitter.
[01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:47.660]   Geez.
[01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:52.140]   Twitter down again.
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:55.580]   You can get Google Chrome for the Mac just by going to google.com/chrome.
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:57.540]   It'll see you're on a Macintosh.
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:29:04.060]   And it will say new for Mac OS 10, by the way, 10.5 only.
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:08.740]   Or later you got to have not snow leopard, but leopard.
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:10.860]   And Intel only.
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:14.420]   If you want to play with the newest little toy from Google, what do you think Andy?
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:21.460]   Do you think people it's worth having Chrome as, you know, in addition to Firefox and Safari?
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:26.860]   I think that it's a good idea to have more than one browser chiefly because one of them
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:29.980]   is going to get pranked up and you're going to need to launch something because dang it,
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:32.300]   you just need to check your Gmail.
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:35.380]   And you don't care that it's locked up in some sort of JavaScript or some sort of Flash
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:36.380]   plugin.
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:42.780]   What I'm most curious to find out, I downloaded it just last night or just yesterday myself.
[01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:46.460]   What I'm most excited and interested in finding out about it is that if it is more stable
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:52.020]   and faster than competing browsers, the big deal about the Chrome browser has always been
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:59.020]   sandboxing, right?
[01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:25.020]   They're all separate.
[01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:28.280]   We have about six or seven hours now, so I really can't tell.
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:33.380]   But if it's just provide some more stable and a faster experience, if it means that
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:38.480]   so many times when I start this podcast, the step number one is to shut down everything
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:43.620]   because I've got two different browsers open, and the system performance is down so badly
[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:47.980]   that I can't even just click on anything without having to wait three minutes contemplating
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:50.300]   the serenity of the beach ball cursor.
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:54.140]   If it gives me that kind of a freedom, then yeah, I'll switch to it, but Safari will always
[01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:55.140]   be on my desktop.
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:56.140]   Yeah, I'm liking it.
[01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:59.260]   Of course, you're going to have to enter all your passwords again.
[01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:01.860]   I don't think one password has Chrome support yet.
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:02.860]   Yeah.
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:03.860]   I'm curious to see.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:07.100]   There are a couple of things that are grayed out that it doesn't have the full screen
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:10.220]   mode is in the menu bar for view, but it's grayed out.
[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:17.540]   The feature for building and turning a web app into an app is also grayed out.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:20.900]   It's turning like, for instance, Google Reader into an application.
[01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:23.900]   Let's go back because I really like that.
[01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:28.340]   I use Fluid app was great, and I like that feature on Windows for the Chrome.
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:35.180]   It did import all of my Safari bookmarks perfectly, so I was able to get Safari into.
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:39.620]   It was auto-completing all the stuff that you normally do in Safari, so it was a very
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:40.620]   easy transition.
[01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:42.340]   Just re-enter a lot of your passwords.
[01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:45.660]   It does not import your passwords, so you have to re-enter those.
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:48.660]   Available from google.com/chrome, and it is absolutely free.
[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:54.740]   We have mentioned some other applications that are free, including drag and dictate for
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:55.740]   the iPhone.
[01:31:55.740 --> 01:32:01.380]   The new AT&T USUCK application available everywhere.
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:04.780]   I'd like to invite you to do a couple of things if you don't mind.
[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:06.940]   First of all, we are doing a survey.
[01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:12.180]   It helps us we do this every year or so to get an idea of who listens to our shows, and
[01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:13.180]   we use it.
[01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:14.780]   I'll be frank to sell advertising.
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:16.060]   I'm not going to sell your name.
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:20.820]   I'm not going to use your email address, but the aggregate demographic information about
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:25.780]   men, women, income, locations is very helpful in selling advertising.
[01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:28.700]   If you'd help us, you can go to survey.twit.tv.
[01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:30.740]   I'll tell you, there's a few questions.
[01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:33.500]   It takes some time, but it's very helpful to us.
[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:36.100]   If you feel like doing that, I'd really appreciate it if you did.
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:40.900]   Also, I should announce, as I have on all the shows this week, if you look at my blog
[01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:46.540]   post at Twitter.tv or leoville.com, that I am no longer getting paid by Twitter.
[01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:50.580]   I've decided to sever my relationship with Twitter entirely and walk out.
[01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:55.060]   No, no, I've severed my financial relationship with Twitter, even though I own the business,
[01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:59.100]   because we were taking contributions and it didn't make sense that we were taking contributions.
[01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:01.140]   It's like, "Well, you're getting, you have advertising.
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:02.980]   What do you need contributions for?"
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:05.740]   The advertising supports, of course, our hosts.
[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:12.820]   It supports our staff and our extensive capital expenditures, as well as rent and server space
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:14.820]   and all of that.
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:15.820]   It's really important.
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:20.860]   We couldn't do it without our support of our advertisers, but your contributions go directly
[01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:22.780]   to me.
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:24.100]   That's something new we're doing.
[01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:29.140]   We've changed the contribution on the Twitter.tv to say, "Tip Leo."
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:32.900]   What I thought is, this is a way you could signal your approval or disapproval in a very
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:35.580]   direct way.
[01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:39.620]   If you don't like the shows, if you have a beef with them, cancel your subscription.
[01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:41.340]   If you like them, subscribe.
[01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:45.260]   $2 a month is, I think, is all I ask and is very fair.
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:47.820]   I really appreciate the support people have given us all along.
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:48.820]   We couldn't have started Twitter.
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:52.940]   In fact, for the first two years, Twitter ran on contributions, but now that we have
[01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:56.420]   advertising, I think this is a good way to keep those contributions alive and give you
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:34:00.100]   a direct feedback loop into Twitter.
[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:03.660]   Please remember, I'm counting on you.
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:04.660]   No.
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:09.100]   In fact, what I said in the blog post is, I have the radio job and I can live off of that,
[01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:11.580]   but Twitter is more than half my income.
[01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:18.100]   You have a fairly significant vote in how it's doing.
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:19.340]   Scott Bourne, you're the best.
[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:21.020]   Tell us about Photo Focus.
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:22.620]   Thank you, sir.
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:27.260]   Photo Focus is my online site where I help people learn more about photography every day.
[01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:32.020]   We have the Photo Focus Podcast, the 15th and the 25th of the month, and yes, we will
[01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:34.500]   have a show on Christmas Day.
[01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:35.500]   You're crazy.
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:36.500]   You're crazy, man.
[01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:38.380]   We don't stop for anything.
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:40.020]   And on Twitter, I just say for us.
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:43.660]   I get stuff away and I'm still alive.
[01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:44.660]   That's the news.
[01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:46.660]   Yeah, we're really glad to see that.
[01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:47.660]   That's great.
[01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:48.660]   You're feeling okay?
[01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:51.620]   I'm feeling okay for an old guy.
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:52.900]   I say that every day.
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:54.700]   Now my horse, not so much.
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:56.300]   Oh, what happened to your horse?
[01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:57.300]   I rode him.
[01:34:57.300 --> 01:35:04.260]   I walked right into that one, folks.
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:07.220]   Kitty Scott's horse.
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:08.220]   Photofocus.com.
[01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:12.060]   It's all about photography and Scott has many other sites as well, but I'm sure they're
[01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:14.340]   all linked off of Photo Focus, right?
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:17.620]   Well, I'm actually trying to streamline most stuff through there now.
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:18.620]   Great.
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:22.500]   We've got more than 1,000 how-to post on photography there since April.
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:23.500]   Oh, look.
[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:27.460]   There's a picture of Scott with his iPhone vest.
[01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:28.460]   That's a good picture.
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:29.460]   Look at that.
[01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:31.500]   That's me leading a photo walk at Pike Street Market.
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:32.500]   Oh, how fun.
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:35.540]   I'm seeing those photos of workshops, right, all over the country.
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:41.180]   I just finished an 18-day trip to New Mexico last month.
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:46.420]   And I have 17 workshops and I'm wintering in Florida this year, so I have 17 workshops
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:48.940]   in Fort Myers Beach starting in January.
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:49.940]   Oh, fun.
[01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:50.940]   Right.
[01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:54.020]   Well, I hang with Pride in the studio right here, the incredible cranes in the fire mist
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:57.620]   photo, and people come in here and they go, "Oh, is that Scott's picture?"
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:58.620]   And I say yes.
[01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:00.340]   Well, thank you so much.
[01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:06.020]   And by the way, should either of you gents want to be in warmer climbs during the January
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:07.180]   February March, let me know.
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:09.300]   You're welcome to come hang out at Fort Myers Beach.
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:11.740]   Can we find out more at photofocus.com?
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:15.860]   Actually, all the workshops are sold out, but you guys can come.
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:18.060]   Oh, man, you're popular.
[01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:23.500]   Now, would Fort Myers Beach be colder or warmer than New England during the winter?
[01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.940]   A whole bunch warmer.
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:30.180]   About 45 to 65 degrees warmer each day.
[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:31.180]   Interesting.
[01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:34.900]   That just changed my budgeting for that.
[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:36.100]   You might not have to wear that hat.
[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:38.100]   You might want to dig into that envelope.
[01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:41.740]   You might have to bring the sunglasses in a straw hat, Andy.
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:46.620]   Andy Inaco is, of course, the great writer for the Chicago Sun Times and his website
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:49.460]   is www.cwob.
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:53.980]   They sell us your ways to bandwidth.com and check it out.
[01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:54.980]   It's great.
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:55.980]   Andy's the greatest.
[01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:56.980]   His book.
[01:36:56.980 --> 01:37:01.020]   Is it iPhone?
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:06.100]   It just started shipping out last week and it contains information that is so fresh that
[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:10.700]   I can all these great here is right here or due to the freshness of the information.
[01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:12.340]   That's how fresh it is.
[01:37:12.340 --> 01:37:15.980]   I swear to God, I was the drop deadline.
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:20.380]   The last moment where I could update stuff was on a Saturday and I was doing a CBS show
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:22.180]   that morning in New York.
[01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:27.740]   I spent 48 hours in my hotel room working on the book that I would rush to be on national
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:32.300]   television and rush back to the hotel room still on my makeup to spend four more hours
[01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:33.660]   updating the book.
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:35.500]   This man typed in makeup.
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.500]   So you get the book.
[01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:40.980]   I look like Murph Griffin, but you know what?
[01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:43.540]   Nothing is too good for my readers.
[01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:46.380]   Just take those little pieces of tissue paper they put in your collar out because that's
[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:47.380]   really looks storky.
[01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:48.980]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:49.980]   We really appreciate it.
[01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:51.580]   We are glad you listened to the show.
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:53.940]   You can also watch us do it live every Tuesday.
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:56.020]   We do it at 11 a.m. Pacific.
[01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:59.100]   That's 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:04.460]   And I'm thinking that is 1900 UTC, but you can correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:07.420]   At live.twit.tv.
[01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:10.460]   Now everybody you go get back to work because break time is over.
[01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:13.380]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:16.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:20.060]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:23.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:25.980]   (upbeat music)
