[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly so much to talk about.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.120]   Of course, the big story Mark Gurman's scoop that Apple might be abandoning Intel in a
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.280]   couple of years.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.280]   The panel has their thoughts on what a future would look like without Intel in the Apple
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.280]   camp.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.240]   We'll also talk about the new iPad, Renee and Annie both have their hands on review.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.240]   It's all coming up next.

[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.160]   Hello Andrew.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.120]   Thank you very much.

[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.080]   Renee Ritchie is joining us from Oddly Enough, not from Montreal, but from San Francisco.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.080]   Hi Renee.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.080]   Hi Leo.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.160]   Yeah, last minute travel, I'm hosting a party at the AT&T store about distracted driving
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.160]   awareness.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.000]   I had a link up earlier, hopefully.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.040]   Did you go home from Chicago and then come back to San Francisco?
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.040]   Yes.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.040]   It was unexpected.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.320]   I was supposed to do this party while I was, and then I had to go to Chicago so we delayed
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.440]   the party and now we're doing it this week.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.440]   Wow.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.440]   Wow, wow, wow.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   It's a good cause.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.440]   Welcome to San Francisco.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.440]   Thank you so much.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.040]   The wrong part of it, sadly, not really.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.400]   Hey, we're not that close.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   It's okay.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.800]   And joining us right next to me, Oddly Enough, Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   Hello, Alex.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   Hi.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   And I have a new show.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   What's your new show?
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.960]   It's called the Tear Down.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   You'll love it.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960]   Ooh.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.840]   It sounds like you're breaking it's on YouTube apart.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.160]   I, it's on our YouTube channel.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.280]   It is, I look at other people's broadcasts and I tear them down.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.280]   Yep.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.280]   I pick up them.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   Oh my God.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.280]   With a, with a telestra.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.280]   That's bold of you.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.280]   Yes.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.280]   The telestra.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.600]   You know, I think that might be an occupational hazard.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.720]   I was at the, I was at the barbershop yesterday.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.720]   I'm on the set around.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.720]   I just went straight for C&N.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.720]   Went to the CNN.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.000]   I was at the barbershop yesterday and we were watching ESPN and I, and I said, Lisa, that's
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.800]   a very poor green screen.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.440]   And I was showing her what was wrong with the key that they were using.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   Right.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.440]   Because they were at a desk.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.000]   Well, I want to be on your show.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.200]   They were at a desk and you know, you could have a real desk, but nowadays, you know, you
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.360]   just, you key the background.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.360]   Okay.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.360]   Expect that.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.360]   But they also key the desk.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.360]   So they have some generic white guys.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.360]   Oh, that's horrible.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.360]   The whole thing.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.280]   And, but the reason it was a dead giveaway is that had this ref, supposedly reflection
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.840]   of them going all the way down the front of the desk and I said, what angle would that
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.000]   work where you see his head here and then down there, reflection of his head.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Right.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.840]   And it's even looking at it bugs me.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.920]   It's nonsensical, but I guess they think it's slim.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.320]   And, you know, and what are you doing?
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.320]   Is that the kind of thing you're doing?
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.480]   So it's the, the, well, if you jump in a little bit more, this is like, like I, like I picked
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.480]   at this, the alias.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.480]   Oh, I have the alien.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.480]   I'll explain back video.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.480]   You're picking.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.480]   Oh, look at this.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.480]   I explained why they were having trouble with that.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.720]   Why that, that render isn't good.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.720]   Oh my God.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.920]   This is great stuff.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.920]   And I broke it.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.920]   I broke it.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.920]   I broke it.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.200]   You know, I break down like they're not the polygons aren't well formed and you know, you
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.800]   know, like, like, I'll be the only way to fix this is if you go back and re-fix it.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.880]   And then, you know, then I start, I talked here about mic placement.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.960]   And then the second one I do, I just, just talked about insert studios because insert
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.960]   studios drive me crazy.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   What's an insert studio?
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.320]   An insert studio is, I actually explain it in the show, but the insert studio is what
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.600]   everybody you see on CNN is in an insert studio, like when they're talking heads.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.720]   They're in a studio that they're sitting, basically when I'm, when I come in a Mac break
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.720]   for somewhere.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.260]   I'm in, I'm in our insert studio.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.420]   And so I show a picture of our insert studio, but then I start going from one insert studio
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.440]   to another and talking about the bad key, the background and the ones that are good.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.840]   I'm not just, just attacking things.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.720]   I'm, you know, pointing out, like this works or this doesn't work or, you know, that kind
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.720]   of thing.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.840]   I would imagine that this would be must CTV for the folks, the engineers at CNN and everywhere
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.840]   else, right?
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.400]   I think, unless they're offended, they might be offended.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.400]   Pretty, pretty.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.560]   producers or anything.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.560]   It's pretty rough and I have to admit, after the first two, I'm, I'm starting to get,
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.960]   starting to get my stride.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.960]   So just talking.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.040]   Like, so, so is it going to be like Mystery Science Theater 3000 with like a silhouette
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.800]   of you, like just making fun of like, we have Joe Harris at our big band.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.120]   Give the man a telestrator.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.120]   There's no look there.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.120]   That's an insert studio.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   That's my answer.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.760]   That's what you're looking at when you're joining us with the green screen behind it.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.920]   And then I'm just explaining the keys and the, you know, like what they're, you know,
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.920]   how they're doing each one of the.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.920]   So she's not in front of an actual, I think she's in front of a screen.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.920]   She's in front of a windscreen.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.920]   I think.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.920]   It's actually a pretty good, it's actually a pretty good key.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.920]   That's a good key.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.920]   Her hair looks really.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.920]   The problem really there was exposure, which I was talking about.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.920]   Yeah, she's way dark.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.960]   She's dark because that feed is really, really bright and it's just really hard to
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.560]   properly get blown out by the.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.280]   And then this one I was talking about the headroom, which is a little much.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.920]   And the fact that I just, I hope you never do our shows.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.920]   Oh my God.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.680]   And then they have, there's aliasing that's going down behind her, which is either a,
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.520]   a scrim that's too close or a monitor.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.920]   Oh, and I was talking a little bit about that.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   Oh, we're third.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.920]   And, and, oh, you're hysterical.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.120]   And, and then I, like this is the, you can see the scrim there, right?
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.920]   There's like a little texture there.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.920]   And she's too close to the scrim.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.920]   So it's not outside of the depth of field.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.920]   And so I'm explaining like, like what, what happened and how to.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.920]   At this point, I'd like to point out that I'm really am still setting up everything in
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.920]   this studio that the, that the, this background is going to be way.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.920]   There behind and there is right.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.920]   So I'm nearly as focused up as I'm going to have them.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.920]   Well, I was, I call it the teardown.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.920]   I was like, I'm not too rough.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.920]   It's a good name.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.920]   So one of the opposite you should call it the grim reaper.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.920]   I mean, just make, just make sure people know you talk about teardown people's self-esteem.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.920]   They're pride in their work.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.920]   And there's definitely ones.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.920]   I was working on one last night that I'm going to post later this week and I, and I, and I looked
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.920]   at the Al Jazeera set and it's all I'm talking about a ton, which I love it because this,
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.920]   it looks like a spaceship and it's got all this great stuff.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.920]   And I, but I explained what, what, what all the things are too.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.920]   So it's not just tearing something down.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.920]   It's also like, what works.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.920]   Like what works.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.920]   Let's look at this, uh, Bloomberg set.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.920]   By the way, this is a perfect example of, I'm going to go back a little bit of one of those
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.920]   fake keyed sets like that desk.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.920]   I can't stop it, unfortunately, but the desk there behind is obviously a fake desk, the
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.920]   whole thing.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.920]   What I'm talking about though is of great interest to us.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.920]   This is Mark Gurman's, uh, scoop apple plans to use its own chips in Macintosh.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.920]   Are we surprised?
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.920]   No, I guess this all makes sense.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.920]   Well, yes, in rumor, it's in 2021, 2011.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.920]   But rumor, yes, this is still a rumor.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.920]   We should point out this is not a new, this is maybe a more confirmed rumor.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.920]   And I think it does make sense now.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.920]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.920]   I mean, it makes perfect sense for a lot of reasons.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.920]   Apple obviously likes control.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.920]   They're frustrated with Intel's schedule.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:33.520]   They can't blame Intel for the lack of real updates for the Mac in forever, but they would
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.920]   also allow them to integrate everything together a lot better.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.320]   The reason why you get so much performance out of the iPad isn't necessarily just because
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:46.720]   of their A 10 X processor, but because of how well and tightly integrated it is with the
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.520]   operating system, the rest of the hardware, everything else.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:56.520]   And the only thing that kind of I disagree with, actually definitely disagree with, I
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:03.920]   don't think that Apple would plan to transition the entire Mac line over to their own designs
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:11.040]   unless they've got the Mojo to design something better than the arm platform, because I just
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.320]   don't see them spinning up enough experience to make something that could power an iMac
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:24.440]   Pro, something that could do film editing, something that could do special effects, machine
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.240]   learning models, VR stuff like that.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:33.640]   So I've actually just wrote something that might even be up on a fast company later today
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.840]   or right now.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:41.160]   I filed it like early this morning that basically made the idea that either they will use this
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.960]   that the biggest impact is going to be on the consumer level Macs like the MacBook Air,
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.840]   with the MacBook nothing, because it doesn't have a whole lot of demands.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.120]   It can benefit the most from custom CPUs.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.320]   It could even cut the price down so that they could finally start making some form of Macintosh
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.840]   notebook for less than $900 or $800.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:09.760]   Or if this is the way of sort of nudging the Macintosh out of the world and start getting
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.920]   people to transition from Mac OS to iOS by making the next version of Mac OS something
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.440]   that is a lot more like iOS rather than cross pollinating the two, which is something we've
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.200]   been talking about for a while.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.560]   So I just think we should really look at this Bloomberg set here, Alex.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.320]   Would you like to take the pen and comment on it?
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.000]   That's clearly a fake desk.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   It's got a lot of gloss on it.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.800]   I don't think it's a real desk, but I think that the problem that you usually get into
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.800]   with this stuff here is that-
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.800]   Shall I zoom in?
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.800]   Let me zoom in.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   You know what you need a Surface Studio to do this.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.800]   Well, I'm pretty- My setup is pretty-
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.800]   You got a pretty good one?
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.800]   Okay.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   I'm not surprised.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   The-
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.800]   No, no, no.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.800]   Enough.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.280]   You go watch Alex's thing.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.360]   I don't want to- This is Mac break weekly.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.640]   We got actual Apple news here.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:09.160]   Let's talk about- So what is the reason Renee that Apple- First of all, why is this such
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.360]   incredible rumor that the stock market believes it?
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.360]   Tanked Intel stock significantly.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.440]   Yeah, I mean, stock market is ridiculous because Apple's 5% of Intel's business.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.080]   And even if they moved on, they like to tell me at this point, I said, even if they moved
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.720]   off the Intel platform, they're not going to make chips for anybody else.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.920]   Everyone else will still be buying Intel.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.920]   So that's just emotional- Right.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.920]   You know, typical stock market stuff.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.480]   But the- So I think past is prologue here.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.920]   And what we saw with Marklar, which was the Intel transition, they named it after the
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.720]   alien species from South Park, which I still love to this day.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.560]   They had the Intel Macs running in the closet, like in the lab for a long time because they
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.840]   had to get Mac OS ported, they had to get Safari ported, they had to get all the major
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.840]   stuff ported.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.240]   And they were just there in case.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.960]   In case at some point they made the decision that based on power PC's roadmap, they needed
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.960]   to change direction.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.960]   And that happened.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.960]   And Jeff McLaren reminded me this morning that PA Sammy was all set to start making
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.880]   power PC chips for the Mac when the jobs changed his mind and went Intel and then later bought
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:09.000]   that PA Sammy and that entire team became the Apple A series team that makes the chips
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   now.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.800]   And those are- And those are ARM platform-based chips.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.320]   Would the Mac chip- Power ARM, power ARM, because it's a little power, a little bit of
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:23.920]   power, a little bit of arm, would they be using that same chip family for Macintosh
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.920]   as well?
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.840]   And then what would that mean for Mac OS?
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.400]   So I think in general, I mean, they've had Mac ARM, it had Mac running on ARM for years.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.160]   People have had it in the closet because you have to be ready.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.760]   And Intel has had an incredibly hard time going to 10 nanometer.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.840]   They went from their TikTok cycle to TikTok, TikTok, TikTok, TikTok.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.400]   I mean, every three minutes I turn around and they're announcing an interim architecture
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.400]   change.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.400]   Just to that, by the way, they just do it.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.400]   Just to listen to them.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.400]   And this one.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.400]   Another one.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.800]   And their roadmap right now is probably every bit as dicey to Apple as power PC's was when
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.800]   they made that transition.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.720]   So that has to be ready to go.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.280]   And Apple had an intern do some of the reporting and he published his paper years ago about
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.280]   getting Mac from ARM.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.880]   But I have to say, I am running Windows on ARM right now.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:13.320]   And it is not a pleasant experience because it only does right now, Windows 32 bit and
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.000]   it runs like a dog on a Snapdragon 835.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.120]   But one of the advantages Apple would have designing its own silicon is they could make,
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.240]   I guess I presume they could make it be more responsive.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.320]   Well, they could do several things like we saw last year and this year, like Samsung
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.560]   is probably one of the best fabs in the world and their generation or two generations behind
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.240]   what Apple's doing with silicon.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.160]   Like the series chip right just best in industry now.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.800]   But also Apple has had years to make Mac run when well on ARM.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.240]   They've also had years to make specific arm ships to run Mac.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.240]   That's what they want to do.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:50.000]   There's always a potential they could somehow get AMD to make X86 or licensed X86 chips
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.760]   to them to make their own custom X86 chips.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.440]   There's hybrid solutions like they're doing now with some part of it run with an arm chip
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.720]   and some part of it run with X86.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.200]   And there's also like they did previously interpreters which aren't great either and
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.560]   usually impact the same high performance software.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.200]   That's the only reason you want the X86.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:11.640]   So you're saying then that this wouldn't, this doesn't anyway necessarily mean the end
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.200]   of Mac OS.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   Oh, but at all.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.720]   But I look at this and I worry that that's what is going on here.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:24.640]   Now, we've talked before about Marzipan, which besides being a lovely almond treat is the
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:30.720]   kind of unified software platform that would allow iPhone iPads, iOS stuff to run on Macs,
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   right?
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.720]   Yeah, it would share the logic.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.720]   Sorry?
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.720]   Is that a relation?
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.720]   Is that a related?
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.920]   I think it's like when you see like Apple announced size classes and there was no real
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.920]   reason to announce them.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.280]   And then you got bigger iPad side by side apps and bigger iPhones.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.200]   So you've always looked to what Apple is going to announce and it might be Marzipan.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.600]   It might be something that does similar.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.280]   But the idea there is just because there's so much iOS stuff like people are complaining.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.280]   There won't be any games on Mac.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:59.960]   If you can run iOS games on the Mac, you've solved a problem for 80% of the gaming market.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.680]   I don't think Apple would do this transition without being carefully planned.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:10.560]   Well, and interestingly, both Fortnite and PUBG, which are PC games running on iOS right
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.560]   now.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.560]   And by the way, running really nicely on iOS.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.880]   Well, I think that one of the things that this one of the advantages this gives Apple
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.520]   is that you have Intel making chips that have to cater to everybody.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.680]   People being a small percentage of that everybody.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.560]   You have Windows being written.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.480]   Yeah, Apple doesn't like that.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.720]   They don't like to be 5% of the market.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.720]   Exactly.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.520]   And then you have Windows, which is written for lots of different platforms.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.280]   So both of them are kind of generalized.
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.120]   They're not specialized to what Apple necessarily wants.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.000]   So by controlling their own chipsets, and I think that they will start with the consumer
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.560]   ones and eventually move towards professional jobs.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.040]   Well, you got to make hardware and software.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.920]   Well, and the more they make their own hardware and the more they make their own software,
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.280]   number one is they're not underwriting everybody else's development.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.920]   Number two is that they're not, because that's what I mean with Samsung, even the stuff
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.320]   that they buy from Samsung.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.280]   I'm not saying they're doing it immediately, but I think that Apple, there's this slow churning
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.600]   of Apple wanting to take over most of the key components of their own.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.920]   I like to get everybody out of that.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.200]   Yeah, and maybe they still have Foxconn assembly.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.560]   Well, but they also, I don't think Apple wants to make accelerometers or I mean, they
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.200]   don't want those little bits of people.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.920]   No, no, it's the same thing that everybody wants.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.720]   You basically want to control the things that make you different.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:23.360]   You want to commoditize the things that don't make you different, that are kind of done.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.480]   So commoditize all those things.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.400]   But like for instance, I think that eventually Apple will want to do its own displays because
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.400]   that makes them different.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.560]   Well, and that's another rumor we've talked about already, which is that they have a fairly
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:42.200]   advanced R&D project working on this new micro LED technology that Samsung showed at CES.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.680]   And Apple apparently has a 35,000 square foot factory down in Cupertino where they're or
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.880]   Sunnyvale where they're, you can imagine them starting with the watch for something like
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.000]   this, but eventually moving to their phones.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.720]   And again, if Apple's able to build all of those things, they have a unique advantage
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.280]   as far as how fast they can innovate.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.320]   And they're already out in happening Intel, right?
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.720]   So we're seeing that already.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.840]   They also solve their supply chain problems, right?
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.840]   Because they're just and leaks and leaks and Eddie, you don't think it's a good, they're
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.200]   teaching Samsung how to do things that Samsung then uses on their own phones.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.960]   Are you worried about performance, Sandy?
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.840]   You think that I'm not scooping Intel at this point?
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.480]   I don't think they're outperforming Intel.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.880]   I think that Intel is the business of making CPUs.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.960]   Apple is in the business of making entire pieces of hardware.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.600]   So those are different opportunities to get not just to performance enhancements, but
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.240]   battery enhancements.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:37.040]   And Microsoft and Intel, they work, they do work very intimately together to make sure
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.400]   that Intel is building chips that are in line with Microsoft strategies for Windows.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:48.680]   All I'm saying is when I was speaking earlier before, all I was saying is that I don't
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:54.880]   see Apple being able to dump Intel the way that they were able to dump PowerPC.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.760]   I mean, it was immediately, it's like a switch was turned.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:03.840]   There is going to be an emulation layer, Rosetta, for people who were stuck with old
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.320]   machines, but the future is entirely Intel.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:12.920]   I don't think they're in a position to again, make a workstation class computer with their
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.240]   own chip technology yet that might change in five years.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:21.400]   But that's also enough time for Apple to come up with something beyond Macintosh for their
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.400]   future.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.040]   And as I keep saying, I hope it doesn't sound like a broken record, but it is something
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:31.960]   that I sincerely believe Apple just has not shown enough enthusiasm for the Mac to make
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.520]   me take off the table, the idea that Apple has an end of life already planned for the
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.520]   Mac.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.520]   I'm not predicting it.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:44.040]   I'm not saying that it's already there, but I absolutely, any time I think about or speculate
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.400]   about the future of the Mac, it has to include the possibility that Apple has already picked
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.680]   a data circle on the calendar.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:55.320]   And here is their plan for transitioning all the Mac users either onto iOS or to whatever
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.160]   workstation class computing that they feel comes after Mac OS.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:05.360]   A guy named Andy Inako wrote a really interesting article in a fast company called the Fifth
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:10.040]   Age of Macintosh, What Happens If Apple Dumps Intel?
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.720]   As you point out, only Apple knows what it's planning.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:20.560]   We've said before that as long as you have to use a Mac to write software for iOS, Apple
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.080]   can't kill Mac OS.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:27.680]   You see them playing, I think that Swift Playgrounds is Apple slowly moving towards the process.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.600]   The story made me think of that is, "Oh, well, if they get everybody right in Swift, then
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:37.000]   it's a simple switch in the compiler, not that a developer could just recompile, and
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.240]   suddenly it's native, I don't even want to say arm, it's native processor."
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:50.000]   I think if Apple is planning to making any plans that are contingent on getting Mac developers
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.280]   to switch to Swift, I think that is about as likely as them getting into the cookie business.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.280]   Really?
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.240]   You're not going to get to...
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:04.200]   Apple has enough problems trying to get Mac developers to simply support the APIs that
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.160]   they're requiring them to make.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:11.600]   They're getting enough pushback on just getting them to keep their apps on the app store.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.600]   I mean, there is...
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.720]   Well, Andy, that's one of the arguments that they kill Mac OS is that people develop for
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:22.000]   iOS regardless of what tools or technologies are required, because they can make a ton
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.880]   of money on iOS.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:31.040]   But if they can't persuade them to use technologies, they want them to use on Mac OS, because there's
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.760]   not as much money to be made then.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.320]   There's two separate things there too, is that one is that it's not just Swift.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.320]   They can recompile...
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.000]   James Thompson was talking from Peacock, was talking about this in the morning.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.360]   Except for things that are really down lower levels of abstraction.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.360]   Yeah, it's a switch in Xcode for any project no matter what you're writing it in.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.360]   Absolutely.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.360]   Absolutely.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.640]   And if they do project like Marzipan, then they have a wealth of iOS apps that they
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.000]   would need to completely new interfaces, but they would still have all the logic and all
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   the data models and everything.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.160]   That's much easier to bring to the Mac.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:05.160]   Well, and also, when those iOS, I think for Mac developers, the thing is when the iOS app
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:10.120]   suddenly become available on the Mac, there's a whole new layer of competition from those
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.120]   pieces.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.760]   And the thing to look at is how not over how do we convert developers over the next year
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.760]   or two.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.760]   It's how do we...
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.600]   They're working obviously based on last week from high school, from grade school to
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.480]   happy people learning how to write Swift.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:32.000]   That's a 10-year plan to move a certain kind of programmer to a point where they're generating
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   revenue on the platform.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.800]   There's another data point in this, which is that even Microsoft seems to be moving away
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.800]   from Windows.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.880]   And I think one of the reasons Intel's stock took such a hit is that there was also a story
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.600]   that week that Terry Meyerson, who's run Windows at Microsoft for almost a decade is
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.600]   out.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.440]   He's not even working at the company anymore.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.680]   And at Microsoft, what was the headline?
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.560]   I was a great headline I read somewhere.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:02.360]   Microsoft is effectively demoting Windows and saying services are our future.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:07.000]   And if that's the case, then they just as soon develop for Macintosh or iOS, whatever
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.240]   the platform is.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.280]   And in fact, that's exactly what Microsoft has done.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.960]   They make really good iOS stuff.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.440]   I don't know about that.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:19.400]   I mean, the first thing that when Steve Ballmer left, the very first thing that was that
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:29.280]   the new CEO did was take office for Mac for the cloud for the iPad and immediately take
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.680]   it from something they've got in their back pocket, something they put in the front burner.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:41.160]   The thing about that reorganization is that yes, they did sort of demote Windows status
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:47.200]   from sort of a secretary cabinet level position to part of a larger box.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.640]   But the thing is, as far as I know, they haven't let go a lot of engineers from the Windows
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.320]   team, which means that I don't think that they think that they're going to need a need
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.880]   less development for Windows.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.000]   I think the problem is, and this is very, very relevant for Apple, is that, and this
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.720]   is something that I put in that Fast Company article, the model of screen keyboard pointing
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.640]   device isn't going anywhere.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.800]   No one has come up with anything that can do this thing that only this model can do and
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.640]   continues to be important.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:21.520]   The effect that's taking place now, though, is that all the stuff that you don't necessarily
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:26.920]   need a notebook for or desktop for is being bled off by tablets and by phones.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.040]   So Apple is going to find itself in a position.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.320]   If that's true, I think that Apple is going to find itself in a position where it's going
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:39.760]   to be harder and harder to maintain the consumer Mac book market because you're not people
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.000]   don't, because of the cloud, people don't need to upgrade nearly as often as they have
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.960]   to because now used to buy a new computer because you need more CPU, you need more storage,
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.960]   you need more memory.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.320]   Now you're essentially renting that off of a server, so that's not quite so important.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.280]   And now that there are a few people who are upgrading, fewer people who are necessarily
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.560]   buying, and you're still competing with really, really good Windows machines, this might be
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:09.920]   my, this might be a case of my selection bias, I freely admit, but I can imagine Apple thinking
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.760]   that this is not a, this is not a, people are buying lots and lots and lots of Macbooks,
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.680]   but they're mostly buying MacBook Pros.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:22.400]   I don't think the mark that the shipments of MacBook Airs and MacBook Nothing's is really,
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.800]   really setting burn, setting the barn burning.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.560]   I think that they're, I imagine that they're thinking about the MacBooks, the consumer level
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:33.760]   Macs the same way that they used to think about the iPod's where we're making money with
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.760]   them.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:40.800]   However, this isn't going to continue to grow the way that the business, our business would
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.400]   grow if we took those iPod users and move them on to iOS devices.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:50.160]   So that's why I can easily imagine Apple saying, let's try, let's figure out a way to take
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:56.120]   consumer MacBook users and move them on to iOS devices, even if that means making a more
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:02.280]   powerful version of iOS and making hardware that is a little bit closer to a MacBook than
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.280]   an iPad.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:08.800]   I think for 90% of the MacBook users, if you gave us, you know, if we had the experience
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.480]   of a keyboard and, you know, things like that and we add a touchscreen, if you mix those
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.320]   two things together and made it an iOS thing, most of us would use it.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.320]   I mean, the problem-
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.320]   Is that what Apple's going to do?
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.320]   I think eventually.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   I mean, I think-
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.320]   Hybrid.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.320]   I think we're going to see a hybrid.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.320]   I think that's how you convert people over.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.320]   That's how you convert me.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.960]   Like, you know, there's, I'm not quite ready to, you know, I still a lot of-
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.360]   More of it looks to Windows yet.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.360]   Like everybody else.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.360]   I've not moved to Windows.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.360]   I still-
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.320]   I've moved up to the- I haven't moved up to the newer Mac.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.320]   No, me neither.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.320]   I'm still like you using a 15-inch 2015.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.120]   I mean, there is a real problem with Intel.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.960]   Like, as much as- whether you like the new MacBook Pros or you don't, they shipped really
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.000]   late because Intel just didn't have-
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   That's another process.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   That Apple needed.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.680]   They also- they've pushed DisplayPort-
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.680]   But does that explain-
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.400]   Because we're going to be behind on DisplayPort.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.800]   Does that explain why the Mac or any-
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:54.880]   Has it been updated?
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.880]   That's not Intel's fault.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.040]   No, I mean, Apple could throw whatever process are they want in there.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.040]   But the- when computers they do want to ship are also delayed because they're way-
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.480]   They're totally dependent on Intel's roadmap.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.560]   And that roadmap has significantly hurt their features.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.120]   Like they wanted to have the low power ram and much higher configurations than they couldn't.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.400]   They wanted to have- the all these things that would have made those computers more powerful
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.800]   and probably gotten them less deep from pro-level developers.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.400]   They just simply wasn't ready on time.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.360]   So Mark says this is as soon as 2020.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.360]   That's two years off.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.360]   Tell us-
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.360]   As soon as.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.360]   As soon as.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.720]   But tell me what- well, two things.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:32.880]   First of all, this is going to be a really interesting May and June because we're going
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.280]   to have Microsoft's build conference where we're going to, I think, get an idea of what
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.280]   Microsoft's seeing is the future.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.640]   And it may be progressive web apps which would solve this problem, right?
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.840]   Because those run on anything.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.920]   Then we're going to see Apple and Google in June.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:48.920]   And I think it's going to be-
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.920]   And Google does not use Intel.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.360]   Like Google's making a ton of computers that do not use Intel.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.360]   Right.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.240]   Well, actually they make the Pixelbook does use Intel.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.240]   But you're right.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.240]   That's a-
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.240]   I mean, they're-
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.240]   That's a minor.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.240]   So we can heavily announce it.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.840]   So I think this is going to be, I would be very interesting.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.400]   And we will cover heavily the keynotes at all three events.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.720]   And this will be a very interesting couple of events and a couple of months where we
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.760]   might get a better insight into how this landscape is changing.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.560]   It's been changing all along, right?
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.120]   How people use computers.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.720]   But so now, here's the question I want for all three of you.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.880]   Let's say it happens in 2020 or 2021.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.880]   What's that going to look like?
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.880]   What is this?
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.880]   What is-
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.320]   Well, the iPad still be here, the iPhone obviously still be here.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.640]   What will the Mac look like?
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.640]   Go ahead, Renee.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.280]   You start and then we'll- each of you get a chance.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.880]   What is it going to look like?
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.120]   I think the simplest answer is Apple just transitions the entry level.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.280]   Computers are lower power.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.400]   Computers are more portable and mobile computer aligned to an ARM-based platform.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.400]   The MacBook.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.400]   The MacBook goes on.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.400]   The way they do Mac OS are-
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.720]   Are they do a hybrid tablet like the Surface Pro where you have a detachable keyboard?
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.800]   Or do they do a standard laptop?
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.240]   I just made a whole video asking for that.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.360]   So I'm obviously biased in my wishes.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.640]   But I think that would be a fantastic product that a lot of people would just love, especially
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.080]   in education and other environments.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.840]   And then you- it's the same time that you're doing now.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.600]   You bring the MacBook more towards the iPad, the iPad more towards the MacBook, and those
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.360]   two computers fight it out to be the best possible solution.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.360]   Okay.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   How about you, Alex?
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.360]   What do you expect?
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.360]   2021, the new world-
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:24.320]   I think between now and then- I agree with Renee that it's going to be-
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.320]   You start with the basic stuff because-
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.120]   You still need an iMac Pro, you still need a Mac Pro.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.120]   I think so.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.320]   I think there's still a group of people that still need the faster processors.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.360]   And I'm just going to set around for it though.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.960]   I think it'd be five or ten years.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.600]   I think that there's a lot of work there that I think is going to be difficult to do
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.760]   without Intel for a while.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.560]   Because a lot of the code is really written to that hardware.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.000]   And I think that it's not going to be trivial to move Maya, for instance, or something else
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.720]   over, or big computational stuff.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.600]   So I think that's going to take some time.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:01.520]   I think that in between now and 2020, I think we see this year or next year, we see an iPad
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.640]   Pro that really starts to bridge that it doesn't-
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.080]   You don't have to put ARM on the base laptop.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.440]   You can make the iPad Pro a little more powerful.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.440]   If it really feels like-
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.680]   For instance, if you gave me an iPad Pro where it was easy to use a mouse and it came with
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:22.680]   a keyboard and I could lock it in and pull it out, I might cut my CPU time into half.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:27.360]   It's just that there's this funny thing where it's very inefficient to only use a keyboard
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.760]   and a trackpad and it's very inefficient to only use your fingers.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.840]   There's this hybrid that Apple hasn't been able to really, in my opinion, cross very
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.840]   well.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.680]   There's a lot of things like using Omni Grafel or even Keynote.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.320]   Those things are just painful on the iPad in my opinion because they're trying to make
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.320]   that work look like it.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.880]   I think video is easier with touch, to be honest with you, and music.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.920]   It's hard to be precise.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.600]   I find it easier to throw things together, but really hard to have those precise edits
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.120]   that I'm used to.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.840]   That's where touch doesn't isn't as powerful, in my opinion.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:05.720]   I think that there is this hybrid that Apple could do with the iPads before they did anything
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:10.680]   with the Mac that would get a lot of us just starting to use that a lot more if they just
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.680]   gave us that kind of in-between.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.080]   I think the danger is, of course, is suddenly you have iPad apps that are really expecting
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.840]   you to have other interfaces.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.480]   That's something that Apple doesn't necessarily want other than the pencil.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:26.360]   Yeah, I mean, the early warning system would be developers because this is going to take
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:31.800]   a lot of change in development and the way developers think about user interfaces and
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   screens.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.920]   We'll get an early warning system.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.800]   As you point out, Renee, let's find out about this stuff with developers first.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.160]   Andy, what do you think?
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:48.360]   Whether it happens in 2020, 2022, I think that what happens is consumer Macs, as we recognize
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.040]   them now, disappear.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:56.080]   That iOS sort of expands to become capable of doing the stuff that a MacBook Air or a
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.840]   MacBook Nothing does today.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.120]   Hopefully, you'll beat through an entirely new interface.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:06.680]   It would also open up Apple to create really interesting devices like the one that you've
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:14.360]   got in front of you right now, like imagine the analog to an iMac being a 24-inch touchscreen
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:20.440]   tablet that can be flat on a desktop or a setup like an easel.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:25.440]   Just as you say, I do prefer editing video via touch because it's just faster and more
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.960]   intuitive, but yet you can also put it up right and then have a keyboard and some sort
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.520]   of point device with it.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:40.480]   And then I think that Mac OS remains as there's a Mac Pro line that has something that is
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.440]   more conventional windowing mouse pointer-e sort of interface.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:51.280]   I can't imagine Apple wanting to get rid of the high ground of creation by sticking totally
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.200]   to consumer level devices.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.320]   But the thing is their love is for iOS.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.560]   They don't hate Mac OS, they don't resent it, they don't want it to die.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:06.800]   But whether it's the stuff that they actually put in the Apple store, the stuff they say
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:13.160]   during keynotes or just conversations I have with current people who work for Apple and
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:19.920]   people who have recently left Apple, I feel as though their real love, their real passion
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.080]   is for iOS.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:25.960]   And whenever they think about the future of Apple, they're not really thinking, they're
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:30.400]   thanking the Mac very much for its service, just like you have an employee who's 65,
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.560]   66, 67 years old.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.280]   You know that you can probably get another five good years out of them, but you may as
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:40.400]   well cut them loose now and give his office space and his budget to someone who grew up
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.480]   with multi-touch.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.200]   So that's what I think is going to happen.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:48.080]   I think you're exactly right, Andy, and I don't base it on any logic, but simply on
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.240]   the evidence from Apple.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:55.160]   Last week's education event where they're talking to young people, this is what we want
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.160]   young people to use.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.440]   They did not mention Macintosh at all.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.440]   If you look at where the money's going, where the R&D's going, where the heart and soul
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:08.120]   of Apple is going, in every case, follow the money.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.120]   It's iOS.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.680]   This is, this is, I think all Apple's doing at this point is trying to figure out what's
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.920]   keeping that from happening and how do we solve it.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.400]   Number one is development.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.800]   And do they care about professionals?
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.800]   Maybe not.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:26.360]   I know they do the iMac Pro, but the Mac Pro is three years old.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.840]   I feel like professionals, they're willing to cut off that group.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.680]   All they really need to solve is how do we get people to develop for the, for the, I
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.480]   don't think, I think it would break Apple's heart if the reference platform for developing
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.320]   iOS apps were a Windows machine.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.320]   So I don't think so.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.320]   No, I agree.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.320]   They need to solve that.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.200]   But that's where all of their attention is focused right now is how they're not saying
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.960]   how do, what do we do with the Mac?
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.000]   They're saying, how do we get rid of the Mac?
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.640]   How do we solve the pain points of getting rid of the Mac?
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.720]   And one, and probably the only one is how do we get development moved over?
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:00.600]   And there's lots of ways to do that that don't necessarily require a desktop computing
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.600]   environment.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:07.240]   All I want to say quickly, I'll let everyone else get in, is that last week's education
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.040]   event was so significant.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.560]   A, because I thought I think they have a wonderful plan for education.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.640]   They really, they really landed all their points.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:17.360]   Well, they really addressed the complaints that I've been hearing teachers making.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.600]   But it's another example, just like the Apple Watch of here is what Apple can do.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:27.080]   They can accomplish when they are highly motivated and excited about succeeding in a certain
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.080]   space.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:33.800]   This is how big they went, even though they're strategy for the iPads and education, more
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.200]   or less failed.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.840]   They can fail as much as any Apple product can.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:43.160]   However, rather than leave the market and just sort of let it tail off, they decide, nope,
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.160]   we are going to listen.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:51.560]   We're going to make an entirely new generation of software, of lesson plans, of social software.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.960]   A whole new development system.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:35:00.640]   We're also going to hold our nose, take a good shot of whiskey and make a fantastic
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:05.160]   computer that costs $299 or $329.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.600]   If they were as passionate about, I just feel like if they were as passionate about the
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.680]   Mac, they could have said, you know what, we're going to start making Macs that are really,
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.920]   really inexpensive because we are tired of kids not wanting to.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.440]   We're tired of seeing kids with Windows machines.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:28.520]   If they believe in desktop, they would counter the Chromebook with something like a Chromebook.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.520]   They're not.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.520]   They don't believe in the desktop.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.520]   They believe in touch.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.520]   They believe in iOS.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.520]   That's the future.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.080]   And in 10 years, we're going to be talking about how they're transitioning from the iPad
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:40.320]   to the AR, you know, like where it's all virtual and we're not and we're not touching any
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.320]   kind of screen between years.
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.320]   We'll start seeing the transition.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.840]   I'm going to focus around with that app.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.480]   But I think that they're, you know, they're spending as much money on that as well.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:51.360]   And I do, I think that the time, the reality is as someone who is a power user who uses
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.840]   apps that would never run on an iPad right now, I mean, I can see that 80% of my time
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.760]   though is still spent in areas that I could use my iPad.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.760]   The interface isn't quite right.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:03.040]   The internet is a franchise group by this future that we're talking about.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.200]   I think that, you know, I think that the big thing that Apple could, again, and I've
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.000]   said this before, that the kick in the teeth that Apple could do on the way out, you know,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.040]   this is how you leave the house and burn it to the ground is you get, once you get everybody
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:20.880]   over to the iOS, you just open source Mac OS and or make it free.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.080]   And it was just kind of like, it was just kind of burn every, like anything that was
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.080]   left behind them, though, we just kind of burn it all up.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.080]   Like here you go.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.080]   Here you guys, you guys can have all of this.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.880]   Orpez reached the new low.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.880]   He cut it, but shut fire.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.280]   That's how you leave the house and burn it down.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.280]   I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.280]   I'll tell you what, I think that there's a couple of issues with that.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:41.560]   First of all, there's IP problems with releasing it to open source that are probably in time.
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.760]   I don't know about open source, but free.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.920]   Like you just let, you know, like the other issue is the security.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:46.920]   Liability.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:53.200]   As soon as a company says, okay, it's yours, but they're now not doing security patches
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.720]   for it in this day and age.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.840]   I think that's a real problem.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:01.360]   I don't think they give, I would love them to do this, but I think that they're just
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.440]   tactical issues that are going to keep them from doing it.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.800]   They're going to bury Mac OS and it'll be bye bye.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   And frankly, if I were a developer today and looking for a fertile territory that maybe
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:16.080]   in five years, I'd be starting to work on an operating system that could take over for
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.080]   those people who I still think there's going to be a market for desktops.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.240]   Renee, final thoughts that we're going to move on.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.600]   Yeah, I think Apple doesn't do everything.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.680]   I think all of us would like Apple to do everything and Apple can't even do the stuff
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   that they are doing now.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.640]   Like you looked at, Andy is right about the education event, but as much as it was good,
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:40.000]   we also saw iBooks, we also saw pages take over for the languishing iBooks author.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.360]   We saw the first update to iWorks in years and they have two dedicated teams on that product.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.880]   You go back to the Mac Mini, Apple is already doing so much that it can't keep up with the
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.080]   stuff it's doing.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.360]   So I think it's going to have to make a lot of quite choices and they historically do
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.080]   not do things like netbooks, which would be analogous to low entry Chromebooks.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:02.160]   They're going to want to do things that allow them to be as efficient as possible.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.880]   And I think that is moving to efficient possible and to control the technology that allowed
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.720]   them to create differentiated experiences.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:11.680]   And I think this makes, when you look at where Intel is now and where PowerPC was then, I
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.320]   think our Macs were a stick they hit Intel with for years and now it's a blade they're
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.960]   just cutting loose with.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:23.560]   I think Bingo and I think the real disconnect here is there is what we as users want and
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.240]   hope for.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.440]   And I think Apple has done exactly what you just described Renee, which has said we can't
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.280]   do everything.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.680]   We don't need to be a computing company.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:36.840]   We have a product that is killer.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:37.840]   We're very happy.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.000]   We're the one of the most valuable companies in history.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   We're doing fine.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.680]   Let's just double down on that.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.600]   They have mentally cut loose.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.880]   Something that we as users are very reluctant to cut loose.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.600]   And from a business point of view makes perfect sense.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.680]   From a global point of view, it's like, well, who's going to do Mac?
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:39:01.440]   But they have a very serious problem coming up and that is like our existing computer
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.440]   model.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.880]   It's not going to be here forever.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.680]   And there are other companies that are really like imagine like the iPhone 20 is a marble
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:11.760]   in your pocket that does local biometric authentication, cloud connectivity, and then
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:16.600]   takes over any AR or piece of glass screen opportunistically as needed.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.600]   Can Apple deliver that?
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:23.720]   I mean, they have so much work to do on Siri on AI on AR that investing heavily in what
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:28.400]   will eventually be a product of the past makes less sense and Apple being Apple and working
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.520]   towards fixing all the things they need to get to where the next hockey puck is going.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.520]   Really great conversation.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.520]   Thank you, everybody.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.680]   We'll have more in just a bit.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:42.320]   Our show today brought to you by the bad news that next week your taxes are due.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.480]   Oh, I love my wife.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.480]   Is it in Canada?
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.480]   Isn't it?
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.480]   It's over in Canada, right?
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.480]   Renee or no?
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:52.480]   It's it's either April 30th or May.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.760]   You get more time.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.760]   We get less time.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.360]   But Leo, the taxes hurt more.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.600]   In two weeks, your taxes will be done.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.920]   That's the good news.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.480]   The bad news is you have to do them in the next two weeks.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:09.000]   That's why I want to tell you about TurboTax Live, the fastest, easiest, most accurate way
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.200]   to do your taxes.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:15.520]   And now even more confidence that your taxes are correct because with TurboTax Live, you

[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:47.000]   And by the way, the questions you might want to ask, what about next tax time?
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.800]   What should I be doing now to prepare for a very new world with taxes?
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.080]   And they're up on the new tax law 100%.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:01.560]   And of course, as with everything, everything TurboTax does, it's backed with a 100% accuracy
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.560]   guarantee.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.920]   This is how I do my mom's taxes.
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:09.520]   I wish I could do our business taxes this way because it costs us a lot.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.800]   Maybe we can now that we got a CPA or EA on the other side of the screen, connect with
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:19.720]   a TurboTax Live expert today at TurboTax Live.com/MacBreak.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.080]   This is the last piece of the puzzle.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:23.840]   TurboTax has always been the easiest, fastest way to do your taxes.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.240]   And now you get the reassurance of an expert.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:31.120]   It is fantastic.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:36.760]   My plan is, because I do my mom's taxes since last year, it's really easy in TurboTax because
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.440]   it imports everything from her Schwab account and everything just automatically.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.440]   So it really is 15 minutes to do the whole thing.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:49.640]   But then what takes it a long time is mom, bless your soul, calls me and says, "Well,
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.640]   what about this?
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.640]   What about that?
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.640]   Did you think about this?
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.640]   What about that?"
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.640]   And now I can just connect with a TurboTax expert and say, "Mom."
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.160]   Because she says things like, "I don't trust you.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.960]   What does Lisa say?"
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.560]   Because Lisa doesn't know all about this stuff.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   What does Lisa say?
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.720]   So now I'm just going to say, "Well, mom, here's a good news.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.240]   We got TurboTax Live.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.240]   Here's the person.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.240]   Just talk to her."
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.240]   And I'm done.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:16.040]   TurboTax Live.com/MacBreak for real peace of mind.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.040]   It's only two weeks.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.040]   Nice to deal with you.
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.040]   I know.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.080]   She was paying 500 bucks every year.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.120]   She's got the simplest taxes ever.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.400]   I mean, I can't do it easy with her.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.760]   She's got some stuff that makes it a little bit more complicated, but it's so easy with
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:30.760]   TurboTax Live.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.480]   Very good, son.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.200]   Well, I felt, you know, I also took over her investments.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.600]   That's been a little more challenging because every...
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.080]   She watches cable news.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:45.360]   And every time the market goes down, cable news goes crazy.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.360]   And she says, "Sell my stocks."
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.000]   And I said, "No, mom.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.160]   You sell them when they're high, not low.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.640]   Wait, it's going back up."
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.840]   Then they'll go back up and she says, "Oh, okay, you're right."
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:54.840]   And then, "Sell my stocks."
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:55.840]   Ask Lisa.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.840]   Ask Lisa.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.840]   She says, "She really does."
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:02.560]   She says, "You kind of need to put a post it next to the screen saying, 'Do not buy gold
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:05.120]   or food buckets.'
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.560]   Neither are important or necessary."
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.960]   She's not quite to the point of burying gold in the backyard, but she's doing, by the way,
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:13.960]   she's doing great.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.320]   I'm glad to hear your mom.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.560]   Your mom is pretty damn adorable.
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.560]   Isn't she a sweetie?
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.560]   And she's...
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:24.080]   It's funny because she acts like she's got no money.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.480]   And she's got a significant nest.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   We're not a generation.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.480]   We're not a generation.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.480]   We're not a generation always thought about it.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.480]   It's totally the generation.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:37.320]   She says, "Well, I've been buying her food delivery Uber."
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.280]   She says, "Well, I can't fix the plumbing.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.840]   I don't have any money, so I pay for that."
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.040]   And then I see what she's got.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   It's like, "Mom, you should be giving me money."
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.040]   No, no, no.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.160]   I'm glad she has money.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.440]   That's awesome.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.600]   So you're telling me my iMac Pro is not going to be obsolete next year?
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.600]   No.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.600]   I really...
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.600]   10-clock is not going to come to your house and take it away.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.280]   Do you not love your iMac Pro, Renee?
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.280]   Do you not miss it?
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.280]   No, I love it.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.280]   Now that you're on the road, you miss it, don't you?
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.680]   While people are walking by in the education event, I kept going, "I'm Mac Book Pro.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.680]   I'm MacBook Pro.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.680]   I'm too used to it.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.080]   I need to take it on the road now."
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.080]   I know.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.080]   I know.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.080]   I love my iMac Pro.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.080]   I really do.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.080]   Has any...
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.080]   Have you tried...
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.080]   You only knew 2018...
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.080]   What is it?
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.080]   8th generation?
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.240]   What generation iPad is it?
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.240]   6th generation.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.240]   6th generation.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.240]   Yes.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.240]   I review one up yesterday morning.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.200]   Tell me about it.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.200]   It's really good.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.920]   I mean, last year the argument was that it was the best tablet for the price.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:35.080]   That's sort of damningly praised because no other company has really done much in the
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:38.120]   pure-play tablet space.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:40.160]   Recently, Google's getting into it with Chrome.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.160]   We'll see what happens.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.720]   But it's a really good value.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.040]   What they've done is they've kept it essentially the same, but they've made...
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.920]   Too small and too large changes.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.640]   One is the LTE is now twice as fast if you want that option.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:58.160]   Also the gold is kind of fleshy, rosy, coppery gold now, which means that either you love
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.960]   it or you can't match your other gold products.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:00.960]   No, either way.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.960]   But the two big changes.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.360]   One is it's gone to the A10 processor, the A10 Fusion.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.440]   That has the high efficiency cores and the high performance cores.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.600]   It's about one and a half times faster.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.960]   Especially on the low demand hardware that is the iPad.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:14.960]   It just flies.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.920]   It's silly, silly fast.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.400]   They've added Apple Pencil support.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:24.320]   Now, previously, if you wanted to get an Apple Pencil, you had to buy an iPad Pro.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:28.160]   My takeaway from the review was you're literally getting half the Pro for just about half the
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.160]   price.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.160]   Don't get a smart connector.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.320]   You don't get the fancy display.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.520]   You don't get a bunch of the bells and whistles of four speakers at some.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:38.520]   But you get a really good entry-level tablet with a really good pencil experience.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:42.560]   Logitech is going to make a crayon for education that has the same pencil technology, just
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:46.440]   no pressure, sensitivity for 50 bucks and a very easy way for teachers to just throw
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:49.160]   them out there and not care who's fairing with which ones.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:53.680]   One complaint or one thing, not the complaint, but one thing people mentioned is that because
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.280]   the screen isn't what is it?
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.280]   Lamanated like the iPad.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.280]   It's not laminated.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.200]   It's like the original iPad Air.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.680]   It bothers me a lot.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.040]   But I gave it to a bunch of my friends.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.560]   My God kids actually are in the video review talking about it.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.560]   They don't notice.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.560]   It drives me crazy.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.560]   But they don't want to.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.560]   So funny.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.560]   You can see it.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.200]   It makes my eyes bleed.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:18.600]   Well, no, I can see the exact same use to wake up and I've used to air gaps and I can
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:19.600]   see the difference in glare.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.760]   But my mom for a long time went from an iPad 2 to an iPad Pro and back and she was just
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.480]   like, whichever one is charged at the time.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.680]   And my God, since in the video, they're like, which one is iPad Pro?
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:29.680]   Oh, I know.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.680]   Is it this one?
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.680]   Is it that?
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:33.680]   The resolution.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.680]   Is the same.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.680]   Right?
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.680]   It's the between sides of the bit smaller.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:41.360]   It's that there's, can you see a gap between the glass and the screen or what?
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.680]   It's a little bit more reflective.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.280]   It's almost like the best analogy I can give it.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:48.040]   It's like old school cell animation where the paint is on the bottom of the glass rather
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.360]   than being inside the glass.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.360]   That's what we're used to with laminated display.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.840]   It doesn't do anything for me either.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:55.320]   How about with the pencil?
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.840]   Some people have said that, well, you said that when you see video of the pencil, you're
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.600]   going to see more lag, even though that's not what you see in real person in real life.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:06.920]   No, I mean, the pencil is the same pencil system as the 9.7 inch iPad Pro and it feels
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.440]   about the same as drawing on the original iPad Pro.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:13.920]   There is the air gap, which, you know, I used Wacom for years and it had an air gap and
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.360]   it didn't bother me until I started using the iPad Pro.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:20.400]   And then I'm like, whoo, no air gap, no ridicule, not all of these things.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.480]   So I don't like it as much.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.800]   But again, other people who aren't as fussy as me don't care.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:29.520]   And it doesn't have a pro motion display, so it doesn't ramp up to 120 Hertz.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:34.480]   So you don't get the absolute close to zero latency, but it's still as good as the iPad
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.640]   Pro was before last June, which is remarkable for $329.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.840]   And most people wouldn't notice the difference problem.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.920]   No, I mean, it kills me that they don't fit it.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:46.880]   One benefit I fixed it mentioned this in Scooter X is reminding me in the chatroom that it
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:51.360]   does mean you can separate the digitizer from the display and fix one or the other.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.120]   So it makes for it actually improves repairability.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.120]   Not laminating them.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:58.280]   You don't have to replace the whole thing at once.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:02.080]   So what did your nephews think about the overall experience?
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.560]   They seem to be very happy in this video.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:05.560]   They loved it.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:08.520]   I mean, they have Chromebooks at school and they were like, all this is off the cup.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.520]   I didn't ask them to say anything.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.040]   If I'm be as critical as they wanted.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.240]   And they're like, oh, my God, my Chromebooks are so slow.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.880]   And this thing just went on and drawn it.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.760]   Like it takes like three seconds for the line.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.920]   They exaggerate because they're kids.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.840]   Like it takes 10 seconds to boot up an app.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.280]   It takes three seconds to draw a line.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.480]   And they really liked it.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.680]   And they love the ability and I work.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:27.240]   Like they just go, wait a minute, you don't just draw on it.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.480]   You can draw like on top of your text and it's day to day.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.040]   And they started making all these stories that immediately.
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:37.000]   I do like that feature that that's really kind of cool.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.200]   You didn't know you were missing it until you got it.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.200]   And then you went, oh.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.800]   And it's like obvious in hindsight, right?
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.800]   I never even thought of it.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.040]   But yeah, that's cool.
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.000]   It goes with the annotation goes with the text.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.240]   So who should buy this iPad, this new iPad?
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.240]   Who is this for?
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:56.200]   I mean, it's for people who've been waiting to upgrade from the iPad 2 or the iPad, you
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.960]   know, because that was a hugely popular tablet, the original iPad Airs.
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:03.040]   If you have an iPad Air 2, you might see the gap, the air gap.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.040]   I don't know if it'll bother you.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.520]   Not most people it won't.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:09.280]   If you've been really wanting an iPad Pro, like just to use Apple Pencil, but you didn't
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.240]   want to spend iPad Pro money, you get almost the same experience here for literally half
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.080]   the cash.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:20.240]   I think that for 90 to 95% of people who buy iPads, this is the right one.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.240]   This is the right one.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.440]   There's a handful of people that want to push it a little harder.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.400]   But I don't, I think that it's a very, very small number.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.680]   This is really the right, the right one for most people.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.680]   I agree.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:35.440]   I haven't had as long as as as Renee has, but during the half hour, 45 minutes, I have
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.960]   one in my hands during the event.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.560]   I was not paying attention to whatever is being told to do.
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.560]   I was trying, I was pinching and squeezing.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:45.600]   I was, I was, I was, I was wishing pictures all over the place.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:50.680]   I was trying to get it to drop frames or in any way, but trade the fact that it is the
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.160]   least expensive computer that Apple makes.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.360]   And none of that happened.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:58.480]   It was a full, it was, it was the full boat experience.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:04.760]   And I, I will wish that Apple still made really good iPad mini's because I love that
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:11.240]   form factor, but it is tiny enough for any, any, any situation which you just, we want
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.560]   a minimalist computer.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:16.480]   I really think anybody, anybody who's been looking at a, at a Chromebook and thinking
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.680]   that, gee, that's really attractive.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:22.800]   It's a really nice computer, well built, a good experience for just $300 or so.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.760]   Definitely should look at the iPad.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:27.560]   Cause it's not, it's not, it's not just this hardware and it's not just the ability to
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.600]   spend another hundred bucks and get an Apple pencil.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.720]   Although these are really big deals.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:38.520]   It's the fact that iOS still has the most impressive library of productivity and professional
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:39.920]   software for it.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:45.880]   One might even say that outside of like Adobe cloud and Microsoft cloud, it really is the
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:50.720]   only machine that has a really impressive library of third party productivity apps for
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.720]   it.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.720]   It, of course, only comes with 32 gigs of storage for a lot of people.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.360]   That isn't going to be an issue.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:02.120]   429 if you want more storage, it goes, really there's only two choices, which is 32 and
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.800]   128 gigs.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.320]   And then if you want cellular at another $120 to that.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:12.920]   So with cellular and 128 gigs of storage, you're talking 560 bucks, which is an Apple
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:13.920]   pencil.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:14.920]   You're talking 660.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:17.920]   And they smart keyboard.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:18.920]   Well, you can't get the smart keyboard.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:19.920]   You have to get like a Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:20.920]   Oh.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:21.920]   You have to get a Bluetooth.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:22.920]   That's right.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:25.920]   No smart connector.
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.120]   I mean, but I think you're right.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:33.200]   I mean, every iPad pro, it has the same kind of markup as you go higher up in line two.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.640]   That for most people, what did you say?
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.560]   80% 90% most people, this is the right iPad, right?
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:45.160]   Whether you decide what you need at 560 or whatever it is or the 329, depending on what
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.160]   you think you need.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:50.200]   I think that this obviously the 329 is how low can we go to make sure that the folks can
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.200]   get in?
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.120]   32 gigs is enough for people who just want to run apps, right?
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.120]   It's enough.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.880]   You just want to play them fine.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:01.640]   I mean, you need more if you're going to put your music collection on it or you want to
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.560]   shoot and edit video.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.560]   Even not even so much anymore because a lot of that stuff is now near line where they
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:10.840]   keep most frequently accessed and most recent stuff on the device and they offload everything
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.920]   else to the cloud and then just think it back and forth.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:16.880]   So I think it's unless you really want to keep a bunch of stuff on there all the time,
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.920]   like download stuff to watch offline and do those kinds of things.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.360]   You can need enough editing for most kids and most casually.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.360]   That's a really good point.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:29.200]   Apple's been preparing for this low memory iPad for a while by having all of these optimization
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.400]   features and photos.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.200]   So that you don't really have to worry so much about how much storage you have.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:38.400]   Let's be honest, 32 gigs is actually a ton of storage.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.400]   It's just not.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:44.280]   And I think that Apple Apple's found that people either get the base model or they get
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.280]   the big model.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.760]   They don't really do the whole in between thing.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:52.200]   I'm sure that that's driven from experience on Apple.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.160]   We don't make a 64 gig because that's there's no market for that.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.520]   It's probably a very small percentage.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:00.280]   I mean, I know I just get that funny because that 64 seems like the sweet spot, but you're
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.280]   right.
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.280]   I always buy the highest.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.280]   Right.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:06.240]   So I think some people buy the most cheapest or they buy the most biggest one because they're
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.440]   going to use it all the time, but they don't really I bet you the middle parts don't get
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:10.440]   used very often.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:15.200]   I actually wondering how much of the iPad pro I have.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.480]   When are we going to see a new iPad pro?
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.680]   That's the easiest.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.680]   You get the earliest.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:20.680]   Not June.
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.440]   I mean, it could be dubbed up.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.080]   That's when they did last year, but they don't do iPads every year.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.200]   They do them every between every year and every 18 months.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.200]   I think they did it the last two years in a row, didn't they?
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.880]   I mean, they had because they did a long time.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.920]   I thought they did a 13 inch.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.920]   They did the 13 inch.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:39.960]   It's September 2015, the 9.7 inch in spring of 2016.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:44.320]   Both of them got updated in the summer of 2017.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.160]   And now our next window is summer 2018 or fall 2018.
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.080]   So that's supposed to be the bigger be design.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:53.800]   I don't know what I've got on here, but this is a 256 gig iPad pro because like you, I
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.960]   just want whatever is the best.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.280]   And then I've only I haven't used more.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:00.400]   I have 144 gigs free.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:06.880]   So I think once I once I hit 256, I have now not not really had a lot of stress, you know,
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:10.840]   about I only have 300 songs on here, 300 videos.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.120]   I don't know what's taken up all that space pictures.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:17.960]   You know what I I find that takes up mind maybe, but for me, it's comics the comics
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:18.960]   all the way to the technology.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.720]   I actually just let just last week when I couldn't put a movie I wanted to watch on
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:26.600]   a flight, I just decided I'm going to have to simply delete the comics all the G app
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:31.880]   and reinstall it and any comic or graphic novel that I can think of, I will reinstall
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:38.400]   for me one for me 128 is the level at which if I exceed that, then that's a lack of self
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.680]   discipline and I'm willing to invest in it.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:44.760]   But 3032 is fine for if you're if you're willing to manage things a little bit.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.560]   Yeah, I could have bought a 28.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:49.000]   I haven't I've only used 111 on this one.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.640]   It's also because they'll take advantage of space.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.360]   So if they find this free space, they'll keep more of your photos locally and they'll
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:00.240]   keep more music locally and then ditch them again when you need space.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:04.360]   So it's hard to measure what you have on there as what you can actually put on there
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:05.360]   now.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.840]   This I might have done just fine with 64, right?
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:12.680]   So like, oh, Lightroom has a bunch of 20 gigs of storage is used by Lightroom.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:16.600]   Audible my audible books, 16 gigs photos, 15 gigs.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.280]   Yeah, and Netflix 15 gigs.
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.800]   Yeah, but I wouldn't be using all that stuff.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:24.000]   Certainly the photos would be offloaded.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.640]   And I'm messaged can be big if your friends keep sending you all sorts of animated gifts.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.880]   My kids are obsessed.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.880]   You're constant.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:34.880]   All right.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:35.880]   All right.
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:38.920]   Thank you for the review, gentlemen.
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:41.880]   And I do hope we can see a new what will a new iPad Pro?
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.720]   It'll have a face recognition.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:48.040]   It'll have someone's a 11 class processor.
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:49.040]   Faster processor.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.680]   I think it's time for a better camera to now that it's being looked at as an acquisition
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:58.920]   device, not just not just as a always is when it be nice to be able to do chat and take
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:55:59.920]   pictures of fruit.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:02.360]   I'm really going to two cameras on it.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.360]   That'd be interesting.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.360]   Like the.
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.360]   Oh, why not?
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:06.840]   Why not make it as good as the iPhone 10?
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:07.840]   Why not?
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:08.840]   That'd be interesting.
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:13.560]   I wonder what if you really wanted to throw a bone to the camera team, what if you told
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:17.280]   them that let's we will give you there's a lot more space inside the iPad Pro.
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:22.360]   We will give you the space that you keep asking for for the iPhones, but never get show really
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:28.760]   break our hearts with with the best mobile camera hands down, even beating the iPhone
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:29.760]   10.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.280]   I don't think that'll happen because people aren't clamoring for it in the prices high
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:33.280]   enough as it is.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:38.040]   But I would love to see what the camera group could do with as much space as they wanted
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.040]   and as much battery as they wanted.
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:44.880]   I think it would be pretty amazing to see like a two thirds inch chip with a with a yeah,
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.440]   but not changing the resolution.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:48.440]   You'd suddenly have to have the room in you.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.680]   It would just be that would be insane.
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:54.160]   That'd be kind of like that to add on camera that you use.
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.160]   Yeah, it'd be.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.160]   It'd also have get.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:01.640]   Given the size of the device, you'd also have room for one really wonderful separation
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.840]   for 3D scanning.
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:03.840]   Yes.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:07.600]   So as opposed to kind of kind of getting it right just being able to capture stuff from
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:13.520]   the desktop is like I would love to be able to just randomly say, I want I want a 3D model
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:16.760]   of this because I want to use because I'm doing something professionally or just because
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:19.560]   I want it to have to Lucy Bellwood.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:24.120]   I just got this from a Kickstarter project that I'm so happy I paid for.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:29.800]   But it's if I would also allow people to just explore 3D modeling and VR and AR in ways
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:34.800]   that it's a stumbling block if they don't have the ability to create their own 3D models
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.040]   very easily and do capture.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:40.640]   Well, and I think that also even if you if you just set the distance so that it was the
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:45.120]   same as the interocular distance is the same as the human eye, you could take some great
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:47.600]   stereo pictures and you know, have it.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.920]   Yeah, there really is a lot of.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:50.560]   You know, there's a, you know, that would be so much.
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:53.400]   How much room is there in a 10 and a half inch iPad?
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:54.400]   There seems like there's enough.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.400]   It's mostly speaker now.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:58.160]   So they because you can't put too much lithium ion or you're going to love flying or
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:59.480]   hitting it and that's a good drag.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.560]   So they put it the big speaker system in there.
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:03.200]   In other words, they got a lot of space in there.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:04.360]   That'd be kind of cool for it.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:05.880]   Go for it.
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:08.680]   I'm so close to being able to just take.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:09.840]   We're going to Japan for two weeks.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:11.640]   I could almost take just my iPad.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:13.000]   I would love to just take my.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   I think about it.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   I think about it too.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.800]   I haven't gotten there yet.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:19.800]   I want to.
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:21.800]   Because for me, a lot of it's security too when I'm traveling.
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:26.000]   I feel much more secure with my iPad than I, you know, like it's easier to wait.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:31.080]   The only thing and I really probably don't even would be to bring.
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.840]   Well, there's two things.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:38.160]   One is completely, you know, idiosyncratic has nothing to do with any normal person.
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:42.280]   But I just have a programming book I'm working on and I'd like to have my programming language
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.320]   which is not available on that.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.480]   So that's not.
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.480]   But it's photos.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.480]   It's photography.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:50.120]   And I could, I'm going to bring a Sony A9.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:55.120]   I could easily use the Sony software to put the, you know, the jpegs of it.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.760]   The ros would have to stay on my.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.360]   I don't want to read that in, isn't it?
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:00.360]   You can read the ros.
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:03.040]   I mean, I guess I have enough storage.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.040]   I probably could.
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.040]   Why not?
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.040]   Just copy them over.
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:09.640]   That main reason I do copy them over is that more for backup than because I want to edit
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:10.640]   those images.
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:12.480]   I want to edit those till I get home.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:18.520]   But with Lightroom, I could actually do a lot of triage on the iPad.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.080]   Pick the pictures I want to save.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:21.440]   Do some basic edits.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.760]   Those get copied to the desktop.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:27.720]   And then when I get the raw file in the desktop, those modifications would apply immediately
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.720]   to the raw file.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:33.960]   Maybe, you know what, maybe should I, should I be a guinea pig for this trip and just take
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:34.960]   a look at it.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:35.960]   I don't know if I get to do it.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.600]   I think there'll be a lot of Alex said to do this.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:41.840]   And the next thing is not to bring like Sony at all, but take all the pictures with the
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:42.840]   iPad.
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:43.840]   I had the DX on.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:44.840]   No.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:49.880]   When you give the laptop and the camera Lisa and then she holds the.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.880]   Time me to the mask Lisa.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:57.320]   What no matter what I say, don't leave me the camera or the eye for the.
[00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:02.880]   Well, actually, actually, you know, I take that back because you are not if you do not
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:07.520]   get into an Instagram fight for good photos with Lisa, Lisa will win.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:12.080]   So you may as well say that you may as well say, Oh, I have as though this mobile device,
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.520]   I don't have the really lovely professional equipment that Lisa is armed with there.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.000]   That gives me a good excuse.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   Thank you.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   The only thing you'll get.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.640]   The only thing I keep wanting to remind people is that phone cameras are really, really
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.640]   great.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.880]   All cameras are all these cameras are wonderful on Instagram.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.720]   It's when you actually have them blown up on a screen.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.760]   You can actually see people's eyes realize that, Oh, this real camera took a much better
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.320]   photo, even though it's just a 400 dollar pocket camera.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.760]   So think about that when you're attending when you're attending the first viewing of
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.080]   your brand new grandchild.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.520]   Maybe you do want to have a good camera.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.080]   The good news is you're going to Japan, which means that if you find that you needed that
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.120]   camera, go to Bashi camera.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.080]   Go to Bashi camera is on is on the is it the cheap line?
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.960]   You're you're you're tempting me now.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.200]   See you can you can all and you'll find cameras there that that don't exist.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.200]   Don't exist here.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.800]   You know, like you'll be like, that's amazing.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:05.040]   You know, it takes a picture of me while I'm taking a picture of it.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.760]   And it takes it takes three other pictures from from four feet away.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:11.320]   You know, it's going to bring I'm going to bring a pixel to Excel and I'll have an iPhone
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320]   can.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.960]   I have it's just an opportunity to go research Akihabra.
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.120]   That's a big leap.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.960]   No, I think I don't know.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:20.960]   I don't know.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:21.960]   I haven't decided yet.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.760]   You felt good on when I went to the Caribbean, I did not bring a computer and I didn't need
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.760]   anything more than the iPad Pro.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:35.960]   I have to be I think about like I plan a shoot if I'm taking my SLR now 90.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.200]   I would say 99% of the photos I take now are all my iPhone.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.400]   Have you noticed how fresh the years in our studio these days?
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.760]   It smells so nice.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.760]   I can smell it.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.560]   Even across the internet.
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.600]   Like early morning do on a golf course.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.720]   We used to have a problem in here with paint smells.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.200]   Remember the fires in Sonoma County was smoking here.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.760]   We could barely work in here.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.160]   Now we have a molecule in here.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.880]   I've I feel like go ahead, tar the roof.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.000]   Go ahead.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.640]   We won't even notice it because we have the world's best air purifier molecules.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:16.320]   The world's first molecular air purifier for you know, the HEPA filter technology you
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:20.360]   probably think is a good air purifier was invented in the 40s.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.840]   And there really hadn't been any improvements since then.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:28.920]   It was just a filter and it couldn't filter stuff too small.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.280]   You wouldn't get any air through it.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:38.600]   Molecule uses photo electrochemical oxidation or Pico to go beyond the HEPA filter to capture
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.200]   and eliminate the tiny particles.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:49.480]   The HEPA filter doesn't even know about allergens, mold, bacteria, viruses, even airborne chemicals
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:52.040]   like VOCs from paint.
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:59.360]   All of them pollutants up to 1000 times smaller than those a HEPA filter can catch.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:04.640]   So we got it first got it for a home because Lisa was getting headaches and stuffed up
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:07.520]   nose every morning and we realized, yeah, we're living in the country.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.440]   It's allergies.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.600]   She has not had a headache.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:15.760]   In fact, the one time we were out of town and her nephew stayed in our bedroom and turned
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.880]   off the for some reason.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.040]   I don't know why.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.280]   Turned off the molecule.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.560]   The next day when we came home, she had a headache the next morning.
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.160]   She said, I don't know what's going on.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.840]   Oh, the molecule's been off.
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.680]   That was a blind test that really proved it to me.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:33.000]   Molecule makes it easier to cope with asthma and allergies significantly reduces systems.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.760]   Since then, we bought one for the studio and one for Michael's room.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.920]   One customer reportedly said after using molecules, she was able to breathe through her
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.440]   nose for the first time in 15 years.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.960]   And this is technology, the real technology, not some imagine.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:52.160]   This is funded by the EPA, extensively tested not only by real people like me and Lisa,
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:59.000]   but university laboratories like the University of South Florida's Center for Biological Defense,
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.880]   the University of Minnesota's Particle Calibration Laboratory.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:07.080]   This really works easy to use as a clean sleek design.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.080]   Looks good.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.960]   It's kind of the apple of air purifiers, that aluminum unibody shell.
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:15.120]   And one of the things you can do, you don't have to, you can operate it from the top.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.120]   It's got buttons.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:20.760]   If you pair it to your phone, you can operate it over the internet as well as at home from
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.640]   your phone via wifi.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:27.000]   And one reason you might want to do that is because then you can get filters sent to
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.440]   you, it knows, and they send you filters when you need them when it's starting to run low.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:34.160]   We only have changed the filters once in about eight months.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:38.440]   So it's not a whole lot, but it's still nice to get that filter subscription service.
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.520]   You can connect Molecule to the wifi, control it remotely.
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.560]   You can turn off Bluetooth and wifi as well.
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.640]   So you get the choice for $75 off your first order.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:57.720]   Go to MOLEKULE, MoleculeWithAK.com, and use our promo code MACBreak.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:01.920]   Molecule, I mean, I just, all I can say is it's worth it.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.920]   It works.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:08.280]   It really, excuse me, really, really works to the point where if we don't have it on,
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.840]   we really notice it.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:17.520]   You can do that, and if you're a developer, you can do that, and then you can do that.
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.120]   And then you can do that.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.840]   And then you can do that.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.360]   And then you can do that.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.760]   And then you can do that.
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:24.840]   And then you can do that.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.200]   But then you can do that.
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.200]   So you can do that.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.200]   And you can do that.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.200]   And then you can do that.
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.200]   And then you can do that.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.200]   And then you can do that.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.200]   And then you can do that.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.200]   And then you can do that.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.200]   So you can do that.
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.200]   And then you can do that.
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.200]   And then you can do that.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.200]   And then you can do that.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.200]   So you can do that.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.800]   I guess my air system is next to the microwave.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:46.960]   The matter what is cooking in the kitchen, it goes...
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.120]   It's like they're pumping the air into my office.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.120]   Not here.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.120]   I was trying...
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.120]   Snipe again.
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.080]   All right.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.080]   We got iOS 11.3.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.080]   Okay.
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.080]   As far as I can tell, there's two things.
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:05.320]   I know there's more, but there's new Animoji.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.320]   There's like four Animoji.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.320]   There's a bear.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.440]   There's a lion.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:15.080]   There's a dragon, which is perfect for Chinese New Year.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:19.120]   And there's a scary skull.
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.120]   But I don't use the...
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:25.280]   I don't use the Animoji at all.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:28.280]   So I don't...
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.600]   There's the dragon.
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:32.600]   I do like the lion because the lion is me.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.600]   So...
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:37.040]   And the jungle, the lion, the lion.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.040]   Snipe stone.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.840]   But they're also grateful is that you can do...
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.240]   You don't have to do a bunch of talking stuff.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:46.400]   You can just make really weird facial expressions and use those as responses to messages.
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.400]   Like if someone says something out landing...
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.400]   Oh, I can just try that.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.600]   I do that all the time.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:50.600]   That's actually what I do.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.200]   I do that more than anything else.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.200]   So you said to be careful of what the background noise is.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.200]   Yes.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:57.200]   Very confusing.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.360]   'Cause you're in the background now.
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:01.040]   So I got to do it in silence.
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.040]   All right.
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.560]   So that's one new thing.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:09.120]   The other one, one we've been expecting and waiting for and are glad to get the new battery
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.640]   information.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.640]   And this doesn't matter to me.
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.240]   I'm on a new iPhone.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:19.560]   So it says my battery health is 100% perfect because it's relatively new.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.520]   But if you have an older phone, it will now tell you what your maximum capacity is.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:29.640]   And for the first time, give you a switch to disable that peak performance reducer.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:33.080]   It'll actually... it'll turn it off right away.
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:36.600]   As soon as you download 11.3, it'll turn off any performance wobbling that's already
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:37.600]   been applied to your phone.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.600]   Really?
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.600]   It'll clean slate.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.600]   Oh, it turns off immediately.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:44.320]   It turns it off and then it'll only turn it back on if you have another unexpected shutdown.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.880]   At which point, you can manually turn it off again.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:50.560]   You really shouldn't do that because it's like ganking an SD card out of your computer
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.080]   while it's reading and writing.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.640]   I mean, most of the time, it won't do any problems.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.000]   Sometimes you'll never be able to use an SD card again.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   Right.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.440]   These things are not designed for unexpected shutdowns, so you shouldn't be turning it
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.440]   off, but you can.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:05.520]   And it'll also tell you to go and have it serviced if you need it.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:16.560]   So by default, if you have had that slowdown turned on, iOS 11.3 will turn it off until
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:20.280]   you have one bad experience and then it'll turn it on again.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:23.120]   And then you can turn it off again, but it'll keep turning on every time you get an unexpected
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.120]   shutdown.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.120]   That's it.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.120]   So the default is to have it turned off.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.440]   I think that's actually a good response from Apple.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.680]   So you're going to get maximum performance until such time as you show that you can't
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:33.680]   handle the performance.
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:37.520]   I mean, it's a dangerous call because if your phone shuts down again, it could damage
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.720]   the memory on your phone and the content that you have on your phone.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:44.120]   It could also leave you without a phone in a really bad situation.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:48.080]   But when you don't let give people the choice, they don't really like, they think you're
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.080]   just screwing them.
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.320]   You're just making their life painful for no reason.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.320]   So it's a tough call.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:57.360]   So those are two big things, but people are saying 11.3 is a big update.
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.360]   So what else?
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.880]   I don't know.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.040]   I don't consider it a big update.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.800]   I think it's a typical spring update.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.760]   And the animals, you like the headline feature because that's what gets people to download.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.760]   There is a new business.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:09.920]   There's a lot of little things behind this thing.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.280]   Business chat and the iMessage.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.000]   I haven't experienced it yet.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.960]   This is for businesses to chat with you.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:16.960]   Yep.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.000]   So you and it's anonymous in the Apple tradition.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.520]   It's encrypted and anonymous and they don't give your information to the vendors.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.480]   Just a way for them to have a one-on-one conversation with you inside the app that you've probably
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:28.640]   been using anyway.
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.720]   So right now it works with Apple.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:31.720]   Discover cards.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:37.800]   Hilton, the Home Depot, Lowe's Marriott, International, Newegg, TD Ameritrade, Wells Fargo on 1800.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.800]   Flowers.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.440]   I do take that back though because ARKit 1.5 is in here.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:44.440]   And that's a pretty big update because instead of just having horizontal surfaces, it now
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:49.320]   does vertical and non-standardized surfaces too.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.840]   And they have some amazing apps like Apps.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.280]   I put museum like paintings on the wall and you can go up and look at them and walk around
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:57.520]   them and it understands all the vertical surfaces for the models.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.280]   And that's, we've got to see a couple of museum apps at the show and those are really
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.280]   well done.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.280]   Good.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:07.600]   Actually, one thing that the Business Chat does that, which I'm all for, is more, I
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:12.280]   hope more businesses will start using Apple Pay because that is a great experience buying
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:14.320]   stuff online or on the phone.
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.840]   I really like that.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:19.080]   So the Wall Street Journal was horribly annoyed that you get a notification if you haven't
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:22.240]   set up Apple Pay that they thought you couldn't turn off.
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:27.400]   But if you see the notification, just tap on it and then hit cancel and it will go away.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.480]   And you'll never see it again.
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:30.480]   Okay.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.760]   All right.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.400]   And so what app, what was the name of that painting app?
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.400]   Do you know that?
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.400]   Because I would like to try the--
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.400]   I'll let you call off that.
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.400]   It was a museum app.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.400]   I'll tell you.
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.400]   Okay, we'll find it.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.840]   So I would like to see some of the new stuff.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:46.840]   It was great.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:50.080]   Because it was a painting that had a lot of smaller paintings and you could blow up the
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.520]   smaller paintings, look at the paintings within the paintings and walk around it, period it
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:57.000]   closer than any museum guard would allow you to do in real life.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.080]   You can sort reviews in the app store by most helpful, most favorable, most critical or
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.080]   most recent.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:04.080]   That is a big help.
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.080]   I do that on Amazon.
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.080]   That really is a good way to get rid of the junk reviews and find the best reviews.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.080]   So that's good.
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:12.080]   ARKit15.
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:17.720]   We mentioned that iPad charge management.
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:23.760]   Hey, speaking of charges, where the hell is that pad they were going to release?
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:25.760]   Awkward.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:30.400]   It'll end up in a press release at some point when they're ready.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:35.200]   I know when I installed two warm and kitty cats wound up sleeping on your nightstand on
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.400]   top of it.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:42.040]   I know when I installed iOS 11.3, I got a-- and also the new Mac OS I got.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.280]   This too, I think.
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:46.880]   The new privacy warning.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.920]   And Megan-- let me see if I can find Megan's tweet about this.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.400]   She said, "Make a nice cake topper."
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:58.400]   For anybody who was interested.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:02.400]   It's a dark person shaking hands with a light person.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:06.360]   But I think it's not race they're talking about.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:10.000]   It's somebody whose privacy is-- here it is.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.160]   If you're getting married soon, says Megan, I encourage you to get a cake topper made
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:17.160]   of these two Apple privacy people.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.160]   So what--
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:23.360]   I'm taking back what I said about not being a big update because it also includes the GDPR,
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:28.600]   which is the general data protection regulation the EU is coming out and Apple is using that
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:31.560]   to sort of start-- they're going to start pushing this stuff out on the EU first because
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.560]   it kicks in May 25th.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.560]   But it's going to go globally.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:38.240]   And it's going to do things like you'll be able to-- like any Apple Apple give you that
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:42.080]   icon and ask your permission before it uses any app for Apple's purposes.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.960]   And then it will minimize any data collection.
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.800]   It'll give you transparent controls.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.040]   It'll process on the device instead of in the cloud whenever possible.
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.760]   And it'll use encryption for everything that it possibly can.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:54.120]   And they're going to give you some new services.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.960]   Mostly services you could do already, but they were scattered around different places.
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.880]   So you can get a copy of any data that Apple has.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:03.040]   You can request a correction to data if something is inaccurate.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.280]   You can deactivate your account.
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.280]   You can delete your account.
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.000]   That's all going to be super easy to get to.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.480]   And they're going to update all of that on apple.com/privacy.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.000]   And this whole issue of privacy is really playing directly into Apple's hands.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   Oh, it's so good for them.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.080]   Tim Cook knows it too.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:21.800]   When he was interviewed by Chris Hayes and Keras Swisher for a round table that they're
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:26.200]   going to have air on MSNBC April 6th.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:32.800]   And when they asked him about the Facebook controversy and what Tim Cook would do if
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:36.800]   he were in Facebook's shoes, he said, "I wouldn't be in this situation."
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.800]   And the crowd goes crazy.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:41.200]   So yeah, this is Apple's story.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.800]   It plays right in Apple's story.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.600]   And not a story that's new, a story that they've had for 10 years.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.600]   It's definitely the direct.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:54.880]   There was a conflation that companies were telling us that we were choosing to believe
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:59.360]   that them providing deep personal knowledge of us was synonymous with them, then using
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:03.920]   that knowledge to power advertising or marketing programs.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.360]   And they're two separate things.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:09.320]   You can, it's expensive to do, but you can acquire deeply personal data and use it just
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.960]   for the user and just on device if you have some other way to subsidize it.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.880]   If you don't, then it becomes the advertising model.
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:18.760]   And that's sort of the disconnect in Apple saying, "Since we're not using advertising,
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.960]   we're just charging you nice margins and all the products you buy, we'll do this sort
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:26.160]   of stuff and we won't also be using advertising or marketing on your data."
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:30.240]   And I think Zuckerberg's point was good that he said, "Well, you can't do that for, you
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.880]   know, if you want to make it available to everybody at all prices, you have to find other ways
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:34.880]   of monetizing."
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:39.360]   And I don't know what the answer is to that.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.400]   How you make sure it's available to everyone.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:46.080]   Also, although this, I agree with everything that Tim is saying there, I think that's a
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:50.400]   very strong card for Apple to play and I think that they should continue to play it.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.840]   Every time that Tim makes the sort of strong statements against Google and Facebook, I
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:15:00.160]   really want to ask the follow-up question, "Yeah, but you don't really seem to care about
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:05.920]   privacy and security for your users when their users subject to a government that wants to
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:11.040]   use iPhones to keep them under the government's thumb a little bit tighter."
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:17.080]   I think that it continues to become more and more important that Apple, that Tim throw
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:22.240]   into the mix, ideally when he's not actually speaking at a conference in China supported
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:28.960]   by the government, that he at least nods to the fact that there is a line that Apple
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:34.360]   will not cross, that they will, of course, they're forced to comply with local laws and
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:38.440]   regulations regarding the user content, what people can do with their phones.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:42.440]   But nonetheless, if there is a line that they are not going to willing to cross with
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:47.480]   just any government, no matter how big the market is, I really, really, really need him
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:48.880]   to make a statement like that.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:54.800]   I'd say Mark Zuckerberg was obviously a little needled by Tim Cook's statement calling his
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.280]   criticism "extremely glib."
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.800]   It's easy for you, Tim.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.800]   You put yourself in my shows.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:06.320]   I can't tell if that was smart or not because on the smart side, it changes the copy of
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:09.480]   the conversation and makes it about Apple as much as Facebook, and that might be a good
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.480]   distraction.
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:14.600]   On the other side, he's busy doing the equivalent of the drunken, drug-y celebrity going on Oprah
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.640]   and being all contrite and crying, and it sort of ruins it in the ground and start middling
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.640]   Apple.
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:24.200]   I think it's the true mark coming out, but I also agree with his point.
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:30.440]   There's that cliche that you're the product, right?
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.200]   What is it if you're not paying for it?
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.200]   You're not paying for it.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.200]   You're the product.
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:37.680]   He says, "I find that argument if you're not paying that somehow we don't care about
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.000]   you to be extremely glib.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.600]   This is Zuckerberg and not at all aligned with the truth."
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:46.000]   As you pointed out, if you want to build a service that connects everyone, then there
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.240]   are a lot of people who can't afford to pay.
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.800]   We don't charge for our podcasts.
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:52.120]   We sell advertising against the podcast.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.680]   We don't collect information on you.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:57.160]   We do the yearly survey, but that's completely voluntary.
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:00.480]   We can get away with that because we're a niche service.
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:07.080]   By the virtue of what we content we put out, advertisers know who they're getting.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.080]   They're getting tech enthusiasts, geeks.
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:12.080]   If they want Mac enthusiasts, they advertise a Mac break weekly.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.080]   If they want Windows enthusiasts, that works well for us.
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:18.680]   There's also incredible incredible people who do that Facebook can't do that.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:21.880]   You're incredibly choosy about your advertisers and you put your audience first and you're
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:22.880]   doing it against Facebook.
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.520]   We don't have automated advertising either, right?
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:28.840]   The argument against Facebook is that they have often made decisions that works for the
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:36.360]   better of their bottom line and their advertising customers rather than their users.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:44.040]   Every time I talk to Facebook, I am taken by the impression that I don't think they're
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:49.600]   evil, but they really don't think that the privacy of their users are important.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:53.240]   If they believe that they're doing good with the work that they're doing in Facebook, they
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:59.480]   believe that by making it so easy for people to share information about themselves, they
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:04.640]   are uniting the planet, which is a very limited point of view.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:10.680]   Whereas when I talk to Google engineers, no one is under any misconceptions that so much
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:14.800]   of the company's money is made through advertising, targeted advertising.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.840]   But I also get the impression that, again, there's the line that they will not cross.
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:25.200]   They still believe that it's possible to have that business model without thinking of your
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:30.360]   users as sheep that in the best of times need to be sheared of their wool and the worst
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.880]   of their time need to be slaughtered for meat.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:40.680]   What I did, he did a little sharp elbow to Apple Zuckerberg quoted Jeff Bezos and old
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:44.480]   saying he said, "There are companies that work hard to charge you more."
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:49.840]   A.K. Apple, and there are companies that work hard to charge you less.
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:53.080]   He says, "It's important we don't all get Stockholm syndrome and let the companies that
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:58.080]   work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you."
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:00.120]   Because that sounds ridiculous to me.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.600]   That's a shot right at Apple.
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:05.920]   It's a good retort to that, though, where Amazon has the direct customer relationship
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.600]   the way Apple does in Facebook.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:11.200]   Their direct customer relationship is not with the people who are using their app.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:16.200]   They're charging you less.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.320]   That's a good point.
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:22.320]   When I think the people, what I think they underestimate with this whole process of what
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.800]   they get for free, whether it's Google or Facebook, the amount of money it takes to
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.800]   do what they do.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.960]   When you think about the fact that you can upload a video to YouTube and millions of
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:34.560]   people are going to watch it, I used to have to pay for that per gig.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:38.040]   We used to make things out of flash and I got really good at compression because I had to
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:42.680]   figure out a way to get every ounce because I was paying all that money.
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:47.600]   The idea that you can put up a 4K image, a 4K video, and that's all done for free, it's
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:48.600]   not free for everybody.
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:51.000]   It's not someone's paying for that.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.600]   That infrastructure that we get out of that, I think that when we have these conversations
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.680]   and we can theoretically talk about that, I think we underestimate the value that we
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.840]   are getting out of this relationship.
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:06.840]   I do think that we as personally need to be very careful about what we put online.
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:12.680]   I think that in every case, there never is any talk about what the responsibility of
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:14.120]   the user is.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.440]   It's always the company's responsibility.
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:19.600]   Frankly, if you don't share this stuff with Facebook, it doesn't know it.
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:20.840]   I've just quit Facebook.
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:21.840]   That was my way of...
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:24.440]   I don't quit Facebook.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:28.280]   That's very true, but also Facebook does a really good job of making it not...
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:29.280]   The trick to...
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:33.760]   Helping you not understand exactly what you're exactly sharing.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.680]   I think Google...
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:42.280]   If you're looking for it, but even there, people have to learn that this is the nature of the
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:43.280]   transaction.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:48.600]   Again, I do think that Google does it right the best way that this sort of thing can be
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.600]   done.
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:53.480]   Even if they're going to give people these great tools, people have to be educated that
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:58.320]   these tools exist and that there is a way to remove searches from their history and
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:02.760]   way to remove location tracking from their histories.
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:06.440]   Thanks to GDPR, every company is going to have a way to do that now.
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:11.080]   I think really we should thank the EU for giving us, at least giving us a choice.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.440]   As I look at where I'm already...
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:17.120]   My kids getting to the age where they're going to start posting things at some point.
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.520]   I'm really in the training process of...
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.020]   You're just training.
[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:25.480]   You are building from the day you make your first post, you are building a portfolio that
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:28.000]   people are going to look at and you're not going to...
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.680]   Maybe you can erase it, maybe you should, but you're nuts to think that you can.
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:35.360]   Furthermore, if you don't do that, somebody else will build that portfolio for you.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:40.000]   Actually, I always tell teenagers this, you should be creating a portfolio.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.400]   You should be creating an online persona, but make sure it's positive.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.800]   If you don't, then it's really a problem.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:51.680]   You have no reputation online.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:53.880]   Somebody make a reputation for you.
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:57.720]   When you're in a freshman in high school, there should be a class that is an entire
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:01.080]   room that is going to teach you what you should be thinking about when you're talking about
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:05.240]   social and it should be a required class of understanding because you're setting your
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:06.240]   whole life up.
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:08.680]   Those pictures are not coming back.
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:12.520]   I know we can talk about it, but there's no guarantee you should not be sending the
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.440]   kind of pictures that teenagers send to each other.
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:17.800]   You've lost control of that.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.800]   That's never going to be enough to protect you.
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.600]   You should be protecting yourself to some degree.
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.040]   I'm not saying that there shouldn't be regulation.
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:29.160]   I'm just saying that as an individual, you should also, I get that people are supposed
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:34.360]   to stop at the stop sign, but you still should look both ways before you cross the street.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.360]   Bingo.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.560]   Let's take a break.
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.320]   Then you're picks of the week, folks.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.320]   Get ready.
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:43.400]   But right now, I'm going to pick some wine.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:48.520]   I hope you're not listening to this too early in the day because it's time for wine.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:49.520]   It's five o'clock somewhere.
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.000]   There's a glass in here.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   I don't understand.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.440]   I had glasses out on the Twit yesterday and see how it is.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:59.360]   It was funny because I had two T-totlers on the show with me and Andy was remote.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:02.160]   Thank you, by the way, for being on the Twit Show on Sunday.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:05.160]   I love to get to do it more.
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:07.160]   It's nice to have a reason to be in on Sunday night.
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.000]   It was great to have you on.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.240]   We talked a little bit about Wink and if I could have shared some of this Wink with you,
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:17.400]   I would have, Andy, because I was drinking a Wink Pino that was so good.
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:21.480]   You described it so well that, yes, I did crack out my bottle of port.
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:22.480]   Oh, good.
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:23.880]   I had myself a tipple after a week.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:24.880]   Oh, good.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.120]   I'm really happy to hear that.
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:32.200]   Wink is, well, I guess it's maybe a short for wine club, I guess.
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:40.040]   W-I-N-C, it is a monthly wine shipment to you based on your taste.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:45.320]   In fact, when you go right now to trywink.com/macbreak, you'll go through the taste test.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.480]   How do you like your coffee?
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.480]   Strong and black?
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:49.920]   How do you feel about salt?
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:52.720]   I don't need it or I love it.
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:57.080]   Citrus, they ask you about umami, mushrooms, truffles.
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.000]   They ask you about berries.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000]   And then peppers.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.280]   They get a profile of your tastes.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:04.280]   And then you get to build your first box.
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.840]   You can choose how many reds and how many whites it could be.
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.840]   All red, all white or anything in between.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:12.000]   And you get your first box of Wink wines.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.560]   Now, Wink is a winemaker.
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:14.560]   This is very important.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:17.800]   This is not leftovers from some other winemakers.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.800]   Wink.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.120]   I'm a wet Winemaker and I was so inspired.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:25.920]   We had a little tasting down at the Wink headquarters a couple of weeks ago.
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:26.920]   This is my favorite one.
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:29.520]   This is the one we had.
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:31.320]   This is called Field Theory.
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:34.480]   Field Theory is one of their labels.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:38.040]   And this one is a Blau Frankish, which is a German-style wine.
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:42.400]   They also have a white field theory that's an Alberinio, an Italian-style wine.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:47.680]   These grapes, this says curious varietals from unfamiliar places.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.600]   These grapes are from Passo Robles, but they're picked at midnight.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.760]   They're picked in the dark.
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.480]   They don't pick them in the daytime.
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:59.000]   Their hand-picked, de-stemmed, fermented whole berry, aged eight months in natural...
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.040]   a neutral French oak.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:05.080]   This is my new favorite wine.
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:08.440]   But you don't have to do what I do.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:12.280]   You might prefer a little white Sauvignon Blanc from Santa Barbara County.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.640]   They have French wines.
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.680]   They have Argentinian wines.
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:18.480]   We had a wonderful mal back there.
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:21.640]   They have beautiful artist-designed labels.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:24.920]   This is a really interesting company.
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.160]   Here's a central coast Pino.
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:29.600]   I haven't tried this one called Folly of the Beast.
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.600]   Don't you love that?
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:32.160]   One of the things you'll like about this is...
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:37.360]   So it's four bottles a month, which is just about right for like one or two meals a week,
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.360]   maybe, or even a meal a week, and then a bottle to bring to friends.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:42.720]   I would bring this to friends because it would be so fun.
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:45.280]   It's got the whale tail on it, Folly of the Beast.
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:48.320]   One thing is you can do that with confidence because even those of these are affordable
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:52.560]   wines, they're always really, really good.
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.520]   People love Wink wines.
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:26:01.400]   In fact, as we get warmer weather, the insanely popular Summerwater Rose is a best-seller,
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:03.920]   and one you absolutely have to try.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:04.920]   Look at the funk zone.
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:07.000]   I love that label.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.680]   This way, you get to introduce new varietals, new styles.
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:16.480]   They work directly with winemakers and growers from all over the world to make all of their
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:17.480]   own wine.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:20.280]   Again, they are a winemaker.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.800]   No membership fees.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.840]   You can skip any month.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.360]   You can cancel anytime.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:26.120]   Shipping is covered.
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:30.120]   By the way, there's really no obligation because if you try something, you go, "Oh, this is
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:31.240]   not what I hoped for.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.240]   I don't like it."
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:35.280]   Then just send you another bottle of something you love.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.600]   Do me a favor to try the field theory, either the albirano or the...
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.320]   Whatever that is, the blancz, don't fisnaw.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:43.800]   It's really, really, really good.
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:47.520]   Why settle for the same bottle of wine you always get when you can discover new wines,
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:50.200]   great wines today?
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:51.200]   Just try it, please.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:52.200]   Do me a favor.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.200]   Try wink.com/macbreak.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:56.280]   $20 off your first shipment.
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:58.080]   t-r-y-w-i-n-c.com/macbreak.
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:00.800]   You can buy wines there.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.720]   I'll like card as well.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.800]   Use the special URL there so you get that $20 off.
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.560]   Try wink.
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:12.200]   t-r-y-w-i-n-c.com/macbreak.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.200]   Breaking news.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.200]   Oh, dear.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:17.720]   Is that possible shooting at YouTube headquarters?
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:18.960]   Is this just coming in?
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:22.400]   Let me take a look at this.
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:23.760]   This is from...
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.880]   You've got it in front of you, Alex.
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:26.880]   This is...
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:30.920]   Yeah, no one knows right now what's happening, but it looks like within the last couple
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:35.520]   minutes there's a lot of police action right now right outside the YouTube headquarters.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.320]   Oh, golly.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:40.480]   This is a little active shooter reported at the San Bruno headquarters.
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:41.480]   That's not the main headquarters.
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:43.000]   No, that is the first YouTube it is.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.680]   Oh, for YouTube it is.
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:45.680]   Okay.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:49.680]   All right, well, we'll keep an eye on that.
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:52.840]   That's terrible.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.000]   Always sees police activity.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.640]   Let's hope it's a false alarm.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:59.520]   All right, moving on.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:03.240]   I'm going to do this one because if I don't do it, I know Alex will steal it, but I think
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.640]   Alex will want to know about this.
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:09.520]   There is a group of people called Wonder Unit.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:10.960]   Have you ever heard of Wonder Unit?
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:12.040]   I have not.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.320]   They are...
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:15.320]   They're creators.
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:22.960]   They make film and they are offering a free storyboarding app for Mac, Windows, and Linux
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:26.400]   called Storyboarder and it's free free.
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:27.560]   There's no ads in it.
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.560]   There's no come on.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.920]   They said we developed it for ourselves and we liked it so much we thought we'd just make
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:33.920]   one for you.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.800]   Now, it's more than just filmmakers.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:45.960]   Anybody who has to plan a sequential story, you can print and import the paper.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:49.960]   If you draw in paper but you can't draw on an iPad, you can do that.
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:54.800]   You can export it to Premiere Final Cut Avid, PDF or animated GIF.
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:00.160]   It's really completely open in terms of what it can output to.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:03.800]   If you build...I use Storyboard apps a lot to build presentations.
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:04.800]   Yes, perfect.
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:07.200]   That's how I'm thinking through them and trying to figure out what I want to do.
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:09.760]   It's just way faster for me to sketch them all out.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:13.880]   Then I take that and I open it up in Keynote and then I actually build everything and it's
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:15.920]   like 10 times faster than trying to think about it.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:18.280]   You get too caught up in where this pixel is.
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:24.240]   If you're not a good drawer like I am, you can generate shots by typing female, medium
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:29.920]   over the shoulder and it will put in models that you can then change and customize.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:35.960]   You can actually do your own storyboarding by typing.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:36.960]   I love this feature.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.200]   It's called Sketch Sprint.
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:42.800]   They give you 20 minutes to do a Sketch Sprint at the end of the sprint that created an animated
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:45.600]   time-lapse GIF of your work.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.360]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.520]   It's free.
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:51.760]   This blew me away when I saw it.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:52.800]   I didn't even really get it.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.160]   I thought, "What?
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:55.160]   How?
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:56.160]   Why?"
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:59.000]   They answer the question in an interesting way.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000]   There's some profanity here which I won't say out loud, but if you're reading, just close
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.760]   your eyes if you don't like profanity.
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.120]   Storyboarder is niche software.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.480]   The market is tiny.
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:10.000]   There's an inverse relationship between the market size and price we have to charge to
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000]   make money.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.120]   We're building this tool for ourselves to make better movies.
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:16.160]   We make money making movies, not making software.
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:18.120]   We believe creative software should be free.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.720]   Let's be completely real.
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:23.320]   I've never known anyone working on dope ass stuff to be paying for the software they use
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:24.320]   anyway.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.320]   That's not true.
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:27.240]   But you pay for yourself.
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.800]   Storyboard Pro.
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.800]   Happy software that costs $1,000?
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:31.800]   Boards.
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:35.600]   Another online software that just allows you to order images and custom monthly fee?
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:37.680]   F those guys.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:42.560]   And that in little fine print, and I'm not really sure what the genesis of this is.
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:45.000]   And F Sony pictures, they make the worst Fing movies.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.080]   What does that have to do with free software?
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.080]   Not much.
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:50.960]   Maybe use free software to make great movies and don't waste money going to a Sony movie.
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:55.640]   And then for some reason, F Dave Morin and Gary Vaynerchuk.
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:59.880]   I guess if you give away really amazing software completely for free, you get to say things
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:00.880]   like that at the end.
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:02.760]   I have a feeling that they are.
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:03.760]   There's a story there.
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:04.760]   There's some bitterness.
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:05.760]   There's something.
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:06.760]   There's something.
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:07.760]   Wonder you.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:08.760]   They make dark movies.
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:13.000]   It's also open source on GitHub, which I even like more.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.840]   So I wonder, I don't know why this is free.
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:20.880]   I mean, even if you don't do storyboard and get it just for places to put ideas because
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:21.880]   it's free.
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:22.880]   Wonderunit.com/storyboard.
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:26.560]   But if you want to see more, a lot of times when people make something for free like this,
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:29.200]   they're thinking about something better that's on the other end of this.
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:33.120]   So your job is to go download it for free because it tells them, hey, there's an interest.
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.120]   There's an interest there.
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:35.120]   There are people who want to do it.
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:36.120]   So if you're at all interested at all.
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:37.440]   I notice you just downloaded it and installed it.
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:38.440]   So that's nice.
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:39.640]   I'll be curious what you think.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:44.120]   I mean, you know, probably your paid tool is better in some obscure way, but I don't
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:45.120]   know.
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:46.120]   This was pretty good.
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:47.120]   I mean, I wish-
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:48.120]   I would buy a storyboarding program because I don't make movies.
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:50.720]   But I had to admit that I just wish it was on an iPad.
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:51.720]   I know this belongs to my iPad.
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:54.400]   When I look at it, I thought when I first saw the interface, I was like, oh, this would
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:55.720]   be great on my iPad.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:57.840]   It's got drawing tools and all that stuff.
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:58.840]   I know it's got drawing tools.
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:00.200]   It's Windows, Mac, and Linux.
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.000]   That's the only thing I'm bummed about.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.840]   What do you got so good, Mr. Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Core?
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:06.840]   What's your pick of the week?
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:10.440]   I'm working on another video that's going to be kind of a follow up to some of the stuff
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:11.440]   I've been doing.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:12.440]   I really like those videos.
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:13.440]   What's it called?
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:14.440]   Trash talking?
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:15.440]   The tear down.
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:16.440]   The tear down.
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:17.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:20.040]   So what happened was I started doing the tear down and then people started asking me
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:22.160]   to do, well, how would you fix it?
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.800]   So I'm starting to work on that.
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:26.400]   And so I'm going to talk about green screen.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:29.840]   And one of the things I wanted to challenge myself is, can I pull a good green screen
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:30.840]   with an iPhone?
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:35.560]   You know, just shoot it on iPhone with some relatively cheap equipment.
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:37.520]   And one of the things I knew that, well, I'm going to find out.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:38.520]   I haven't done it yet.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:39.520]   Okay.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:40.520]   But I was starting with that, that'd be cool.
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:41.520]   I was starting to think through this process.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:46.760]   And I was like, I really need to use Adam Wilts' centimeter because that's how I even
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:50.520]   up my green screens, and so I'm going to show how to use it in the future.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:55.000]   But when I got back into it, I didn't, I didn't have a centimeter to load it in.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.560]   And I was like, this is great.
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:01.920]   So if you are, if you're doing anything that you really need to understand what's in front
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:07.400]   of you, a centimeter is a great way for you to measure, actually measure what the camera
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:08.400]   is getting.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:12.680]   And you know, you can, a lot of it is when you're dealing with lighting or if you're dealing
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:14.600]   with a green screen.
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:17.520]   And you, this is a key little operation that you can do.
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:21.000]   Now, of course, this isn't your camera, your actual camera that you're using.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.360]   Although I do believe it actually can interface to some degree.
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.360]   But, but.
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.280]   Well, this looks like it has some hardware that goes on top of the phone.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:30.800]   No, you can, it'll use a lux thing that goes on top.
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:32.840]   That's a little bit more accurate, right?
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:33.960]   For certain light measurements.
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:38.000]   I've always wondered how well a camera phone can do that kind of light metering.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.080]   Well, it's, it's, it's lightning metering for the phone.
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:43.040]   So if you're, if you're trying to set something up and you want to light meter how this phone
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:44.040]   is going to see that.
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:45.280]   That's what you should use it for.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:46.760]   Not a separate camera.
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:47.760]   Yeah.
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:50.640]   And if you're trying to even up a green screen, you can use it because you can.
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:51.640]   Right.
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:55.760]   Because the, it's not, you're not really looking at the quality of the green screen.
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:59.040]   At least at first, you're letting uniform lighting uniform lighting, which you can measure
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.440]   with a tool like this.
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:02.440]   And so I'm going to show how to do that the next couple of weeks.
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:03.440]   And I got any being as we do.
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:06.280]   And if that, if that's what you're looking for, even if you were using a camera phone
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:08.640]   to shoot it, the uniform lighting is uniform lighting.
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:09.960]   While you're setting it up, you could do it.
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:10.960]   You could do it this way.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:14.000]   I mean, you still, I mean, still, I'm trying to, I'm trying to challenge.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.320]   Myself to doing it with this.
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:21.080]   And, but it's incredible that you can get scopes that are accurate and really well thought
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:22.080]   out.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:24.680]   And I actually know, I mean, disclaimer, Adam, well, it's been an old friend of mine for
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:25.680]   15 years.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:28.440]   And he's probably one of the most brilliant video engineers I know.
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:32.680]   So, so he's, it's not just made by some guy that kind of read a book.
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:37.240]   This is a, it's a, it's a, it's got a fall, it's got a false color picture, color metering,
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:38.440]   a waveform monitor.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:39.440]   This is pretty sweet.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:43.080]   So it's, it's a really cool, cool app.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:47.320]   If you want some good technical information when you're prepping to shoot with your, with
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:48.720]   your iPhone and,
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:50.560]   Cinemeter, it's from Adam wit.com.
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:51.560]   Yeah.
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:56.160]   And, and just a reminder that we're finishing up our sale on the Pixel Core.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:57.160]   So we put left.
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:58.960]   There's more, we put more stuff up.
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:34:59.960]   We keep on adding stuff.
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:04.920]   So if you go to Pixel Core, if you go here and you sign up, I send out the emails to this,
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:05.920]   this list.
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:07.840]   I'm saying, Hey, we, every week we're adding stuff.
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:09.600]   We added a bunch of new cameras and everything else.
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:12.200]   So pixel core.com/sale.
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:16.480]   That's how you add into it to get, to get, and then all the mailing list and then on the
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:19.080]   email and listen, then all email you out saying, Hey, we put some new stuff up.
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.760]   I bought a Sony EX three for me.
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.720]   My son is out on his first shoot today.
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:23.720]   Nice.
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:24.720]   Nice.
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:25.720]   That's great.
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:26.720]   Absolutely.
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:28.360]   My, my, my, you gave me a great deal too, by the way.
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:30.600]   I know I have, um, do you regret it now?
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:31.600]   I got yelled at.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:32.600]   Really?
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:33.600]   No.
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:34.600]   I got, you want more?
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.400]   I'll give you some more money.
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:38.120]   But it was a, it was a,
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:40.840]   Henry's really, I got a little trouble for that one.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:41.840]   Really?
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:42.840]   We're, we're trying to thank you.
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:44.840]   My pleasure.
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:47.080]   It helped start my son in his career.
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:48.080]   That's great.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.080]   No, absolutely.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:50.080]   I appreciate it.
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:52.560]   Um, Andy and Eko, what do you got for us here?
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:57.160]   Uh, one of my favorite apps in the world, not just photo app, but favorite apps in the
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:58.160]   world.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.720]   Uh, Skylum software is noiseless CK.
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:05.520]   Uh, this is a standalone app for the Mac that will remove noise from photos.
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:09.960]   And we were talking earlier about how, uh, iPhones and other mobile devices take great
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:14.440]   pictures, but then when you, when you was not on Instagram, you just put them on your
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:15.440]   screen.
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:19.960]   You see all the ISO noise and all the clutter and all the crap, uh, that this tiny, tiny
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:23.400]   little, uh, little image image sensor puts on there.
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:24.760]   This will just simply remove it.
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:27.560]   And it's damn near magical.
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:31.160]   Uh, it's, you know, you think that, oh, well, it's going to make everything just too
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.800]   soft and remove all details.
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:39.200]   No, it is really good at figuring out what is ISO noise and what is actual picture data.
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:44.200]   Uh, and on top of that, uh, unlike the denoise filters that you might have in whatever photo
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:48.400]   editor that you're using right now, it lets you really play with this with a high level
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:49.560]   granularity.
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:51.360]   So it'll analyze your image.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:56.760]   It will suggest a method of, it'll suggest a level of denoise and let you preview it.
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:00.640]   It's easy to sort of like A, B, uh, through the changes to see what's happening.
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:05.640]   Uh, but then if you say, no, I want this more aggressive or I want you to use the, it's
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:11.400]   the easiest, the less just least disruptive denoising is at the top of the list.
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:16.200]   And then by the time you get to the bottom, you can get the full like real housewives
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:22.280]   of LA effect, just erasing every single crease, every single detail and make it look almost
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:24.720]   like a watercolor, but that won't be necessary.
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:29.760]   What I love about it is that, uh, it's, it will take whatever camera you have and trick
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.880]   people into thinking you have a much better camera.
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:38.320]   I used it on the, uh, in the, uh, the lighting inside the high school auditorium at the
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:43.040]   apple last apple event last week wasn't great because apple couldn't, I don't think apple
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:45.640]   could bring in the full rig of lighting that they usually bring.
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:51.160]   Uh, also my camera, I love it to death, uh, but it is a micro thirds micro four thirds
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:52.160]   camera.
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:54.800]   So it doesn't have that big sensor in the really, really good low light performance.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:38:00.360]   And thirdly, I am now kind of paranoid about using like slow shutter speeds on any human
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:03.560]   being that is not sitting on a chair posing for me.
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:08.160]   So I have to, I feel like I have to use a hot tissue to even to, even if someone is talking,
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:12.160]   if I wanted to be absolutely tech sharp, I need a high shutter speed, but knowing that
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:16.200]   I had noiseless CK on my Mac book back at the hotel, I didn't care.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:17.200]   I just shot away.
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:23.800]   Uh, the shots I got out of the camera didn't look all look fine, but noisy and the ones
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:29.400]   that came after just like 15 seconds of tweaking them with noiseless looks like I brought a
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:30.920]   much, much better camera.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:35.000]   I'm, uh, roller derby season starts on Saturday.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:41.960]   I'm shooting my first match once again, high speed, high speed sports inside a hockey arena.
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:46.600]   I'd be dead trying to, trying to just shoot it with whatever I've got handy.
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:50.720]   But again, with noiseless, I can crank up the eyeshows and know that I can basically make
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:53.960]   it look really, really good at the very, very, and so normally it's 60 bucks.
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:59.640]   It's only, it's down to, it's on sale for 20 through the Skylum website and can't recommend
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:01.440]   it highly enough no matter what camera you have.
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:03.040]   Skylum is the old Mac fun.
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:08.360]   They rebranded because they now do windows as well as Mac stuff and their stuff is really
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.360]   good.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:13.200]   I haven't tried noiseless, but that price makes me want it now.
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:14.200]   Thank you, Andrew.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:16.600]   Mr. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:17.600]   Yeah.
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:21.640]   So I know like all the fancy console games are coming to iOS, but I wanted to shout out
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:24.640]   to a mobile game and big surprise, it's Pokemon go again.
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:26.680]   We got another big one.
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:32.200]   I was hoping Fortnite or something, but no, like we're going to see a spate of these
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:33.200]   games.
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.160]   Like there's going to be the Harry Potter game and there's anyone with a lot of games.
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:37.160]   Are they still planning that?
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:38.640]   Because I really want that Harry Potter game.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.960]   That would, you know, like fantastic beast.
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:46.560]   So like, who knows, but what I like is like, like this was originally a really good mobile
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:47.840]   game because it used everything.
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:49.440]   It used screen that used data, used GPS.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:51.920]   You had to get out in the real world.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:55.360]   It encouraged extra like it was just everything that made mobile unique was present in this
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:56.360]   game.
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:57.360]   But how do you continue that?
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:00.720]   Like after you've caught up your Pokemon, you're bored and they did updates like they
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:04.560]   did a new gym system and they did raids and more recently they did weather.
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:07.880]   So now when it's raining outside, it's raining in the game and there's different characters
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.400]   and different powers and things that manifest.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:12.360]   And the latest one is called field research.
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:13.960]   And now you're given like little quests.
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:20.760]   You have anytime you spin, you get a small quest like catch 10 of catch 10 ground Pokemon
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:24.320]   or fight in a gym or do a raid or just a little task.
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:29.560]   But there's also like a story mode where this professor Willow character wants you to find
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:32.560]   the mythical Pokemon Mew who isn't in the game yet.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:35.840]   And you're given all these different tasks in different areas of the game.
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:39.440]   And some of them are really easy, you know, like spin five focused offs or catch five
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:40.600]   Pokemon.
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:43.760]   Some are really hard like Tatcha Ditto, which disguises like other Pokemon.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:48.840]   You got to catch tons of them just to find them or evolve a Gyarados or do 20.
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:51.520]   They're all different and you get rewards for doing each one.
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:55.360]   But at the end, you get a chance to catch this invisible mythical Pokemon.
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:41:00.080]   And it's just it's interesting to see how this technology is evolving because I expect
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:03.760]   nothing more than many, many clones of this game and games that are like this but go in
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:05.040]   all new directions.
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:08.320]   And you think they're going to have a short shelf life, but I'm enthused that Niantic
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:12.480]   is putting the effort into making new gameplay modes at least two, three times, four times
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:13.480]   a year.
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:16.200]   So if you haven't tried it lately, there's a whole there's a whole new game that you can
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:18.240]   play inside there now.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:20.840]   I'm going to have to pick it up again.
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.040]   I'm sorry to say.
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:25.640]   Hey, we have a visitor visiting from England.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:26.640]   Craig is here.
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:31.600]   He's a member of the London Mac user group and he says he's the first iPhone owner in
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:32.600]   the UK.
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:33.600]   Wow.
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:37.280]   Back in 2007, you must have been eight.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:38.280]   And he brought me.
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:39.280]   I love this.
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:46.120]   And the polo shirt from the London Mac user group, which has an apple with the London
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:50.920]   Eye big Ben and Saint Paul's dome on it.
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.600]   And I love that.
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.560]   So thank you so much, Craig.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:55.560]   It's nice to meet you.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:42:03.360]   Thanks for bringing this by and cheers to the the app, the London Mac users group.
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:04.440]   That's awesome.
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:06.680]   You still have that original iPhone?
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:07.680]   So do I.
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:08.680]   I am mine.
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:17.000]   Yeah, just to give you an update, I'm watching a feed from TikTok, Bloomberg of the situation
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.920]   at YouTube headquarters.
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:23.480]   It's sad to say one of those pictures we've seen an awful lot lately, people leaving the
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:27.920]   headquarters and being searched by police to make sure they're not one of the shooters.
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:29.640]   We did see an ambulance speed off.
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:33.960]   So I'm going to guess there might have been some injuries, but we don't have any details
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:39.080]   about what's going on with the situation.
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:45.480]   Hearts go out to everybody at YouTube in San Bruno and stay safe.
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:47.000]   Stay safe.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.120]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.120]   We appreciate it.
