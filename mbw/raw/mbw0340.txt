[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.320]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly the show where we cover the latest news from Cupertino
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.360]   I was in Cupertino last week and I'm here to report there's no news
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.160]   Mr. Andy Enoco is here. I like your backdrop from the Chicago Sun times
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.440]   What is that?
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.240]   Those are Pixar walking teapots and then you have actual teapots on the stool below
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.200]   Exactly they've been we sprayed for walking teapots last week
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.000]   But you know unless you cover up all the holes and start bagging on your rice
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.360]   They just keep coming right back. They smell the tea they keep coming back for the for the loose tea. I love that
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.440]   Wow, that's very cool. I got I got a care package from a very nice person from somebody who loves teapots
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.440]   Can you make tea in any of those?
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.000]   No, but you and what they do walk they do they do walk if you wind them up seven duxes
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.800]   Andy did you break your mousing finger are you okay sir?
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.000]   No, no, I just I was doing a he-manly
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   You stuck your finger in a dyke and it broke off
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.720]   But you do say Holland no no all I did all I did was I bruised my finger now a little bit
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.300]   Oh, and this is like this is just the equivalent of like that collar that you put around a dog
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.800]   So he doesn't like scratch it as yeah
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.220]   It's like I didn't realize how often like you just occasionally bump and graze your fingernail until like
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.200]   I'm like oh
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   Oh
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.400]   This sort of thing the drugs are cost only six dollars. It seems like it could save me a lot of pain
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.680]   I mean you know why they sell those I wonder if I could put one of those in my head
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.520]   I put one on my brain so every time I think thoughts are not gonna leave me any good
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.880]   He's even got a walking teapot hat on I just noticed you are really teapotting out again
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.800]   It was it was quite a nice little little
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.720]   impact is from awesome again someone very kind of at a company that
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.580]   Was had an affiliation with the owner of a certain fruit company located nearby?
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:32.520]   I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say it deduced all of that from something you and John Lasseter like this
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.200]   Also with this Renee Richie of I'm war and there's boy
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.440]   There's big rumors on I'm war today. I thought badly. Oh you didn't come back with any time
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.800]   I spent all night trying to find you some rumors. Yeah, you got rumors
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:53.200]   Some of them a little disturbing to be honest and we want to welcome speaking of disturbing a new guest on
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.320]   The show Joe kissle who is a blogger who lived in Paris for five years son of a gun
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.560]   Jealous yeah
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.560]   Tallis he wrote he wrote the take control ebook on passwords take control of your passwords
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.400]   And you couldn't be more aptly timed since we all now have to redo our Evernote
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.160]   Password yes, I think Evernote might have overreacted just the tiniest bit
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.200]   But maybe not maybe this is the thing to do Evernote on February 28th noted a break-in
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.720]   To their servers which they were quick to say
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.960]   Did not extend to anybody's personal notebooks on Evernote and we I mean a lot of people use Evernote everybody uses Evernote
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.600]   I do on every device and that's one of the reasons I use this completely cross-platform
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.280]   And I like many probably store credit card numbers in their social security numbers my drivers license my passport
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.520]   Really if you got my Evernote file, I'd be screwed. I
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.440]   Do use encryption in Evernote?
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.640]   Nevertheless, it's a little scary
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.600]   So it's an it's an online cloud-based notebook that has clients for Mac Windows
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.720]   iPhones Android phones even things like Windows phone and Blackberry
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.240]   Evernote kind of
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.280]   Was very forthright about in their blog about saying yes
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.640]   We got a break-in but nobody's purse as far as we can tell and this is there
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.520]   I guess that's kind of one of the keys as far as we can tell
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.080]   No personal information was revealed except for your login your email and your
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.840]   Salted and hashed password
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.440]   Joe is there cause for concern
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.160]   Well, I think Evernote did exactly the right thing
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.160]   I mean obviously there was something they did wrong because the the break-in happened in the first place
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160]   But I think they had exactly the right response
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.600]   The fact that they salted and hash the passwords means that whoever got this file
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.800]   It's it's encrypted and they might be able to decrypt it
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.120]   But it's probably gonna take them some time and so by issuing this system-wide password reset
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.920]   Evernote is banking on the fact that that it is going to take some time
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.720]   It might be you know hours or days or weeks
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.040]   But anyway if they force all their users to reset their passwords in the meantime
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.560]   That means that those salted and hashed you know those encrypted passwords won't do anybody any good
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.600]   So it's unfortunate that the break-in happened, but even though it seems like such a hassle
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.840]   For you know for all the users. I think from a security point of view that was exactly the right call
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.800]   You know if we've seen it before Twitter did it to the to when its recent break-in got the first 250,000 Twitter users
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.760]   information
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.680]   The this is kind of the state-of-the-art protection now though right salting and hashing
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.880]   So hashing is in is a form of encryption
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.800]   Hashing is is a one-way operation that
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.120]   It it encrypts your passwords so that you can you can't undo it
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.240]   so you take a word like baseball and you apply this mathematical function this hash and then it turns into
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.440]   gibberish and
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.880]   Every time you apply that function to that word you get the same results so that when you enter your password
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.920]   The company can check it against the hash that is stored and they can say oh yes that matches
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:13.240]   But nobody can take the hash and then undo the function return it back into your password and the company doesn't even know your real password
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.040]   They're just checking to see if it matches the once passed through the algorithm if it matches right
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:25.000]   And salting is is a way of making hashes more secure because that you know basically what what somebody will do is say
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.200]   well
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.520]   you know
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.960]   I'm just gonna take a list of ordinary English words or come in passwords and run them through run them through this hash
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.120]   Function and now I have my own list of hashes
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.520]   So when I see when I when I steal somebody's hash list and I see a match there
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.080]   I can cross-reference it to my own list and say oh well
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.000]   I see their password was baseball so salting a hash add some randomness to them so that it's much much more difficult
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.840]   To do that and so you know at least Evernote did the right thing by by encrypting them in that way these so-called
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:08:01.560]   Rainbow tables are really widespread exactly and it's it's fairly trivial. There's a secondary cause for concern though
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.600]   You know you can't use Evernote this actually you can use Evernote
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:12.080]   It's kind of weird because there's a token on most of your devices so you can continue to use your Evernote notebooks
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.360]   Even though you're now required to go to Evernote's web page and change the login
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.840]   They're pushing out updates to kind of force people to
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.280]   Re-do their client
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.640]   Right. I got I got updates and all my device already. Yeah, but but failing that
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:32.560]   You actually could continue to use your notebook until that token expired. I don't know how long the token lasts for
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.000]   Yeah, I don't know either
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.840]   This is this is actually a common problem with with lots of sites that that that store to I mean
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:46.480]   It's for your convenience during these tokens, but you can you know change your password on on the system
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.040]   But still be you know logged in on a certain device and still have access to all your data
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.400]   So if somebody happened to steal that device or get access to it or watch over your shoulder or something you could still be in trouble
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.120]   The other issue that nobody's really mentioned
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.880]   But I think it's very important if you use the same password on Evernote that you use on other sites
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.720]   You need now to go change those passwords as well. Nobody's gonna force you to do that
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:15.240]   Absolutely, that's that's sort of one of my one of my first rules is never ever reuse passwords
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:21.760]   It's I mean I understand why people do it because passwords are hard to come up with an hard remember and stuff unless you use a
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.320]   tool like last pass or one password, but
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.800]   But it's a really really bad idea to reuse passwords for exactly this problem
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:35.240]   I mean as you as you mentioned Twitter had a bunch of passwords stolen and Evernote and
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.520]   And a bunch of other companies linked in and Facebook, you know, it's it's unfortunately a very common problem
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:47.320]   So if somebody steals this massive list of thousands or millions of passwords and your password was was on that list
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:53.200]   It's not just that service, but you know, they couldn't get access to all of your accounts. So so never reuse passwords. Yeah
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.040]   And if you did you use your
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:03.400]   That's where some even want to change it now because even with hashing and salting it's conceivable as you mentioned that over at some point
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:10.200]   That some of these passwords could be could be cracked if they're good if they're good random password long random passwords
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.120]   Is there any likelihood of the hash being reversed? Well, you know
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:20.200]   Security people use this term called entropy to describe how how strong a password is in terms of how
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:25.440]   Unguessable it is and you know, there's always a chance that that some monkey could just you know
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.920]   Throw his fingers on a keyboard and randomly come up with your password
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:37.080]   So there's never a guarantee but basically the more entropy your password has which is sort of a combination of how long it is and what
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.600]   What different characters sets it has and how random it is and there are these sites where you can measure your passwords entropy, but
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:51.720]   Basically the more entropy a password has the less likely it is or the or the longer it will take on average for a brute force
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:58.440]   Search to discover it. So if you if you want to you just use a lot of characters
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.920]   That's a way of adding entropy to your password if you use
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:07.400]   Random characters as opposed to some sort of pattern that helps and ideally a combination of all those
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.520]   There's a
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.840]   And I don't know if this is something that came in the new we all have new ever-note clients and all of our
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.440]   Devices if you update any of your devices, you'll see a new ever-note client
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.440]   I don't know if they've implemented this but according to information week
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:27.080]   Ever-note says they're going to start doing two facts second factor authentication
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:33.240]   With ever-note an ever-note spokeswoman ronda scott said to told Matthew Schwartz an information week
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:39.640]   We were already planning to roll out optional two factor authentication to all of our users later this year. We're accelerating those plans
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.640]   Now
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.000]   Now maybe that's in these clients or maybe it'll be in the next update
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.040]   But that would be a big improvement as well because then even if somebody gets your password they'd need something else
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:54.200]   Such as a a one-time code from your phone to log in
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:59.880]   You know two factor authentication is is way way more secure. It's also more annoying
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.360]   I mean that yeah now you have to not just remember your password, but you have to do this other thing
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.560]   I mean sometimes you know different different companies do a different ways
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:13.400]   You know google has one version and dropbox has a version and last pass has a version and and sometimes it's like well
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.120]   They'll send you a code on your cell phone. You have to enter that code
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:23.160]   In addition to your password or sometimes you have a little you know a little device a little secure token or there are various other ways of doing it
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.840]   And and this is this is always the big trade-off whether you're just talking about passwords or whether you're talking about
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.400]   multi-factor authentication
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.480]   Everything that you can do to make to make the system more secure
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.040]   Also increases your inconvenience
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:46.040]   I mean there are a bunch of proposals on the table for systems that will get around that somehow that will will give you all the
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.080]   All the security as well as all the convenience, but right now
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.920]   Everything has certain trade-offs. Yeah
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.080]   And then do you know because
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.400]   Evernote has not said but there were some reports that Evernote was using a kind of
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.280]   crappy hash md5
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.880]   I don't know what they they haven't publicly stated what sort of hash they were using
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.440]   Of course they wouldn't because if you if you
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.480]   That would help
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.240]   Publicize what that is that only makes it that much easier for that hackers, right?
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.040]   Let's hope it wasn't md5 although
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.240]   Because you have to reset it probably all as well
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.120]   And now i'm going to try to decide whether I should keep all this
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:31.240]   Private info that I've been keeping it ever noticed sure may I'm convenient, but maybe I'll keep it in the last pass instead
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.880]   Where it does it does have a second factor authentication and so forth
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.880]   Um
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:43.800]   Thank you, Joe for that update. Joe is the author of take the take control book on passwords. This is called take control of your passwords
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:50.120]   Right. Exactly. And uh, so if you're interested, uh, you can go to take control books.com
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:56.840]   Uh, and it's nice because your your your books are right at the top adam. Yes, obviously realize this is a good time
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.640]   It's the newest one and uh, we got nitrous act and snaggy to do a
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:09.640]   A comic for the book. Oh, how fun and even a little portrait of me there. So we're we're trying to do some some new and cool things with it
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.800]   That's great. Uh, do you recommend one password? What do you recommend?
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.880]   I use one password myself
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:21.080]   I mean I I talk about a bunch of different password managers in the book and my real advice is use something, you know
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:28.040]   Don't don't bother like trying to come up with some complicated system for making your own passwords and remembering them and just just let a machine
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.480]   Do it for you because a machine can do a much better job. Um, I
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:38.040]   You know, I would say one password and last pass are the two I like the best of the ones I've looked like
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.560]   The ones I've looked at adam mangs is a real last pass
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:47.560]   Yeah, I've used it and it's it's okay personally for the way I work I prefer one password
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:54.440]   But they're both really really good tools and and and as you say last pass does offer two two factor authentication
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:00.280]   It's kind of weird two factor authentication you you get a little little grid that customize grid that you
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.000]   print out and keeping your wallet and and
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.360]   When you're logging into last pass on an unfamiliar machine you enter your password and it's a you know
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.600]   Do this sort of like battleship thing like, you know
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.760]   A5 and you enter you look at your grid and enter the the number and you do this a few times
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.280]   So it's it's different. It's kind of cool. You don't you don't have to do that. I should point out
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.280]   I use a google authenticator with last pass
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.080]   That also works and that means just your iPhone will have authenticator an application you have to
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:30.760]   Scan a barcode on last you know on your last pass settings to set up authenticator to get it going
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   And then you get these generated six digit one time passes and so the
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.400]   If you know it's not too onerous
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.680]   I have to say it's a lot easier than google's two step authentication because once a mission once you say this machine is trusted
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.680]   It's not going to ask you again. That's true
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:49.320]   You know what one or the other use use something that's for sure
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.880]   Andy, do you use a password?
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.920]   Storage program
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.920]   Yes, but it's i'm a little bit in the old ages
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:06.440]   In that i'm using an encrypted a very very secure encrypted system. That's on one machine. That's not connected to a network
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.320]   So that's a good idea. Yeah, I mean, there's I also use sort of a
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.400]   Sort of a manual a manual system that I have a lot of faith in
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:22.600]   Which is that I if ever I can't remember a password for one of the eight really really super important
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.240]   Things that require passwords. I can usually remember what the last
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.880]   Password change was because there's like a common theme to every
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:37.080]   Have a system every one of these. Yeah, so so so for instance for uh for like my amazon thing
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.080]   Uh, I might decide that okay
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.840]   It's movies of jean hackman and it's not even the titles of the movies, but it's
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:51.320]   It's I'm thinking okay. I think superman superman 2 was on cable. Oh that stupid curly wig
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:56.920]   I do something like that too and use the first letters or you use the whole that stupid curly wig
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:04.200]   My my brain will remember an entire sentence use a pass and i'll mix i'll mix it up so that you can't just throw it against
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:09.880]   Addictionary and find it. Uh, I also use a system where for things that are super super super secure
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.840]   Uh like bank passwords that is you would have to be inside my house
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:20.200]   You would have to choose the right book from a bookshelf that contains hundreds of books
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:29.560]   To the book that I use to seed passwords from and then keep turning random pages until a phrase sticks out to you that has stuck out to me
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:35.000]   Uh, I I agree that this is a very very antiquated system. It's really I like it
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.200]   It predates one password, but it's I think it shows you one of the problems that
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:45.000]   Uh is endemic to password selection that the only reason why I'm not using these password managers is that
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.640]   Uh, they are so my old method. I think works great
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:57.720]   And I haven't researched enough about one password to know that well what if how how strong how much do I trust one password?
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.080]   And now it's certainly popular enough that lots of people trusted how
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:07.240]   Careful do I have to be or how likely is it that by not knowing exactly how one password works
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.120]   I will do something to make it less secure than my old method
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:16.280]   But it really is about your level of paranoia and trying to manage that uh in the most accessible way possible
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.320]   Yeah, I love this comic from a nitrous ecken snake
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:26.760]   Where the different people who tried different password strategies and the little hacker man in the beanie who looks surprisingly like chris porello says
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:33.080]   Thanking you. That does it does. Doesn't it here's the piece of trivia. I used to live in the same building as chris porello
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.600]   And you knew that because you'd hear little pitter-pattering of feet at four in the morning all the time
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.880]   I'm up now. I'm ready to go. Give me
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.920]   Turn on the camera. Let's go. I love chris old friend
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:52.760]   Um, how about you any uh any last thoughts on passwords rene richy before we move on
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:57.640]   Uh, yeah, I mean I I am paranoid by nature, but I try to weigh it so right
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.880]   Is there something I have that the sum total of the nsa will spend years trying to crack
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:07.160]   And if not, I kind of lower my paranoia a little bit. So I just I use one password
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.560]   I use unique passwords. I use their generator to make them and to store them
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:18.280]   I did try to factor authentication with dropbox in google and I kept getting tokens that just kept saying they were invalid
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:23.160]   So I I turned it off because I couldn't get into my stuff. It was so secure. I couldn't breach it
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:28.520]   So now I just use strong passwords and I I hope and pray that nsa leaves me alone
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:33.080]   That's that's that's really that's that's exactly my worry about switching to a password manager
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.040]   Because everyone who manages it can tell you the story about how
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:42.360]   Their department decided to strengthen passwords to do something viable for the to enhance the security the entire network
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:46.040]   But the fact that you made it you changed someone's flow means that
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.320]   Great, they're a side of super secret password has changed every week
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.480]   But since it's so hard for them to remember they now write it on a post-it note and put it on their monitor
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.640]   Yeah, which is not an improvement. No
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.640]   And in fact it turns out social engineering anyway, it turns out that's well
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.920]   Of course matt hone and when he was hacked it was social engineering
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.080]   Not not a super strong password cracking technology
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.720]   And we just recently read and I've always thought this was a problem that the google too
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.680]   And notice they don't say second factor authentication. They say two step
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.640]   Not the same thing that google's two step authentication is actually
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.960]   Weakens your passwords in some way because that so-called application specific password isn't at all application specific
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:32.440]   And until google fixed it a few days ago could even be used to access your most super secret google stuff
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:38.600]   So oops, it is a reminder that sometimes when you go through you use so many different clients to use these services that you really should
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.840]   Go into your twitter settings go into your google security settings and you you might list oh
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:47.800]   There is a there is a password that I assigned to an app that I tested three years ago
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:53.720]   That's still active perhaps I should revoke that one. Yeah, and and slim it down to just devices that i'm actually using
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.760]   Yeah, and I want to put everybody in the points of music all the hackers on this
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.400]   I'm not using monkey one two three anymore. So you can stop
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.840]   Stop oh Brett Simmons had a great blog post on that last week because he fell for one of those fishing attacks on twitter
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:10.200]   And then he quickly changed his password and only then did he realize all the apps were still authenticated because of the tokens
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.680]   Yeah, so you have to go through the ball with that's still okay because you'd have to have that token on your machine
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.000]   So it's what I think that's okay
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.760]   And then that's the thing to tell people with ever note too that even though you can still get into your ever note on
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:26.360]   Authenticated machines. No bad guy can use your password to get onto it on a new machine
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.520]   So there's you know, you're still vulnerable if somebody gets physical access to your machine
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:35.560]   But that's all he was worried that someone had gotten his password and used it immediately and gotten a token
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.040]   Right and then so when he changed it that wouldn't stop that
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:43.080]   That's a good point. Yeah, you then go through twitter and you revoke everything. Yeah, which I've done
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.200]   Lots of fun. I had like 800
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.360]   800 apps
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.080]   Authenticated on twitter. Well, I like Andy's battle star Galactica approach
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:58.280]   He just ripped out all the hard lines and has that one machine. Yeah, it's a low incentive. Oh, that's right. That's why Galactica survived
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.360]   Yes, because captain adama was like Andy and that go
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.600]   Exactly
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.920]   Or maybe he's an admiral now. I don't know. Hey, we're gonna take a break
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.840]   We will talk about mac news
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.200]   And if you really are interested in passwords and what's salting and hashing and all of that
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.840]   We have covered it in great detail great geeky, you know, propeller had detail and security now
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.240]   So go back to some of those security now episodes and of course
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.440]   Joe kissle subbook take control of your passwords that take control books
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:27.560]   Dot com would be a less geeky somewhat more easy to understand and yet just as valid
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:32.040]   Uh primmer on how to protect yourself online
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:37.720]   Our show today brought to you by gazelle dot com. This is the time, you know gazelle gazelle loves
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.880]   loves these times when new stuff's coming out
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.240]   Because that's the time you start looking at your old stuff and think
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:52.920]   Hey might want to upgrade. We've got a new uh galaxy s4 coming out new htc1 and as we'll learn from ranae
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:59.480]   There might even be a new iphone in your future. So here's the deal go to gazelle.com. The nice thing about this
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.480]   This is not a commitment to sell it
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.800]   But you get a 30 day quote
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.000]   So let's say you're sitting on an iphone five and you're saying I just you know
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.320]   Let me get the quote lock it in for 30 days
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.960]   AT&T 64 gig
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.680]   Uh in good condition 380 bucks. That's nice. Now. I've let that lock for 30 days
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:23.240]   So if in within the next 30 days, I say, hey, yeah, I want to I want to sell this because i'm going to get the new iphone
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.920]   Bingo
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.720]   One of the nice things is you could put other stuff in that box
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:34.280]   They've got uh iphones cell phones too from apple blackberry htclg motor roller nokia and samsung
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.120]   All the various flavors of ipad and ipod apple computers
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.200]   apple desktops
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.640]   They'll buy it all for good cold hard american cash
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:49.240]   And uh, the 30 day quote is you know is is a great kind of guarantee that you can you know
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:54.520]   Think about it for 30 days or take the time to move stuff get the new thing move the stuff off the old thing and then send it in
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.840]   Their data experts will wipe it when they get it
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:02.680]   Uh, they'll actually pay the postage they'll send you a box with a paid postage on anything worth more than a dollar
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:08.200]   And then very quick turnaround. I know because we do this all the time you get a check a pay pal
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:15.240]   Payment or I like this and I recommend this if you do buy stuff on amazon the amazon gift card
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.280]   Is a great way to get paid because they'll bump at 5%
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:23.960]   So you get 5 more when you do an amazon gift card and so if you're going to buy that new phone on amazon as I often do
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:30.520]   That's that's the best way to do it gazel.com
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.600]   They have I have it here they have
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.280]   sent out
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:39.800]   Over 50 million dollars to over half a million customers over the last couple of years
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:46.120]   Fast processing free shipping and the best prices on your old gadgets gazelle dot com
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:51.640]   Moving on. Oh, let's do I should save the rumors if I were really a good
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:57.880]   Show host. I'd say well, we'll get to those rumors later, but first what about iron horn, but I can't do it
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.600]   Very the lead Leo. Very the lead. I can't bury the lead
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.160]   Is your lightning cable killing your children?
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:10.120]   Actually, well, that's at the end of the show, but before then your lightning cable is new watch band
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:15.240]   I'm really quick on those it turns out your lightning cable might be smart enough to do to do something
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.400]   I can't believe we did talk about this on twitter with the Horace dead of you of his simko
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:27.240]   The new av lightning adapter the one that converts lightning to hdmi right? Yep. Hey is a computer
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:33.480]   a tiny arm it's it's a arm system on a chip 256 megs of memory
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:39.000]   And maybe even an airplane decoder built into this the folks at panics software were testing
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.240]   To see if their new software works with this
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.000]   I guess they're doing some video thing because I mean I use their ftp client
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.960]   There was an update they there was someone from kupertino who wanted to remain name was added a comment to panics blog and said it's not airplay
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:57.400]   But because they have the h.264 stuff written for airplay already. They're using the same process
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:04.040]   And it actually there was a theory that it kind of spurts an iOS operating system into the cable
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:08.520]   Unfucked boot up and it looks a little it looks a little more complicated than that
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:14.040]   But basically lightning didn't have the video cabling that apple needed so they put everything off board
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.920]   And they said that this means it's even software updateable so that the big problem now is it's not 1080p
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.600]   It's some weird half breed resolution effectively. This is like a raspberry pie in your connector
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.720]   A little bit tiny hard-lined apple tv
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:34.840]   But the but the really cool thing is that the the bad news is that the connector is no longer outputting actual video
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:39.880]   It's just a really high-speed serial connector, but the good news and this is another part that that mysterious
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:46.280]   contributor from kupertino who nomously posted that thread was saying that the great thing is that it'll that the
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.600]   Lightning connector will support really anything
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.680]   Any sort of video because all you have to do is embed the controller in that connector
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.000]   And it will just take the take the job of taking whatever serial data is being squirted out
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.960]   Of the ipad and turn into whatever it is it's going to be useful
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:05.640]   So it reminded me a little bit about the about was designed for the just to controller where he decided to well
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:11.640]   We can really simplify this if we have the if if we do things in software that usually are supposed to be hardwired into
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:17.160]   The controller and because he offloaded that it led to a simpler system that could be a lot more flexible that
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.400]   People can hack into doing all kinds of cool things
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:25.400]   So here are the surprises panic lays out in its blog one as you mentioned or nay 1600 by 900
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:30.040]   despite the fact that the old dock connector gave you 1080p
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.400]   That's a bonner mpeg artifacts
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.280]   um
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.920]   Which is a little disappointing that could be from over compression of h.264
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.880]   um
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:48.680]   And we just love it that they tore it down and it's basically that's a little motherboard on that
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.480]   Who's gonna be the first to get a bun to running on it?
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:58.040]   To the do important is what i'm waiting for it says you would not believe how incredibly tiny those components are on the left
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.840]   You see the little ones in the lower left-hand corner. It's like a little town. It looks like core memory
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.400]   Yeah, it dies because it's tilted
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.800]   Uh smaller than anything we've seen electronics wise. What are all those resistors
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.160]   Or they really ruin this connector
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.000]   And how much are these they're not that expensive right they're 40 50 bucks
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.880]   What's because i'll get off them for that piece
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:28.120]   This anonymous comment i might as well. Uh, now do you believe do you i think it's credible that this comes from uh
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:33.960]   Somebody in the know right it's other people have said that it sounds right sounds credible. Yeah
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.960]   Yeah, oh, so that's very yeah, I love it
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.640]   The heck of an engineering solution to what used to be a very analog, you know connector
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.880]   You know what when i see that stuff like that i feel like apple's mojo is back
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.840]   If they're doing stuff like that
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.920]   Okay, they they got some stuff they got some skills with a z
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.480]   Well, the nice thing is that the old 30 pin connector
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:02.680]   It became such a dinosaur because it had firewire and they dropped that and they used some of the firewire pins for hdmi
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:07.400]   And they had serial pins and they had audio in and line in and line out and it was just it was such a
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:13.400]   A mishmash of things towards the end and lightning is so clean and they're going to keep it clean by breaking everything out
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:18.920]   Almost the way that thunderbolt breaks things out on the mac and I think that's a very forward-thinking solution
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:23.720]   Which is which is also why you're probably not going to get like really cool eight dollar cables
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.120]   You can buy at the drugstore for lightning anytime soon
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.080]   I'm on the plus side. You're not gonna have to buy a whole new
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.800]   A whole new ipad or a whole new phone
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:36.040]   Just because you want to get a new kind of audio output you want to get a new kind of video connector
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.040]   If you remember, I think it was a three-year that 3gs stopped charging over the
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:44.120]   Firewire pins so a lot of the cables just couldn't charge iPhones anymore
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.200]   That's the that's the only reason why I no longer use my ipad hi-fi
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.800]   No longer charge my new iphone
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:57.320]   Because it was because like like Steve said that really is the only hi-fi you need so only hi-fi has my house
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:06.120]   He got rid of all of his equipment. Here's a good one. Here's a good one from google introducing your youtube one channel and they show
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.840]   You know a sam-sung
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.840]   Chromebook they show a nexus
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:15.000]   Seven and an exes four but wait a minute. Let's zoom in a little bit on that
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.520]   That's it says sam-song on that chromebook. Let's zoom in a little wait a minute. It's running
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.320]   OS 10
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:27.480]   I think they think they used a macbook air and put the worst
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.360]   Samsung on it. That's an air
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.880]   Isn't it?
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.400]   It's the screenshot from a yeah
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:39.800]   Yeah, it's a screenshot from an air. Okay. Yeah, cuz the top three camera setup. That's not apple apple-ish
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:45.960]   This happened a lot. I mean phone carriers would often put iPhones screenshots on you know no matter what phone just in their advertising
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.240]   right
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.240]   Yeah
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:55.000]   You see it all the time. I I'll never forget the television ad. You know they have those really horrible ads for
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Your windows machine booting slowly clean up your machine. It'll work great
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.360]   And I can't remember you know some website where you go to but make my computer fast calm
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:08.200]   And uh, and then they show the happy people and they're all running iX
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.880]   That's fixed it
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:17.080]   Well, see if you're sophisticated enough to run bootcamp. I'm not sure if you need the service. Yes, exactly
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.600]   Wow, my computer's so much faster now
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.280]   I seem to be cursing a lot less
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.160]   barely legal teens
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:34.200]   I didn't hear what you said Leo. What was that?
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:38.840]   I sent you an email a full of barely legal teams. Did you get it? Apparently not
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:46.200]   Um apple is deleting iCloud emails that contain the phrase barely legal teens
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:53.080]   Not warning you not saying anything just they figure hey if it says barely legal teens is probably porn and we're not
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:58.440]   We're just gonna delete it doesn't even flag them or put them in a spam bucket. It just says but bye
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.400]   Steve told you android is for porn
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.440]   But what if i'm mailing this to an android user
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:09.720]   Well, the example they used first this problem is old like this this has happened
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.800]   I heard about this with dot mac was doing this already and it's been around for a long time and
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.560]   The article that a lot of these columns are citing was a couple of months old
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.920]   I forget the magazine that published it, but
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.000]   They use the example of barely legal teen drivers my son just got a license
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.680]   He's a barely legal teen driver and even that wouldn't be delivered
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.400]   And if you lex freeman and dan moron tested all sorts of permutations at mac world
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:39.320]   And if you were writing to complain about the phrase barely legal teens or to ask if it was being censored then that wouldn't arrive either
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:43.640]   So it was just a cauldron of craziness at the end. This is uh from an article
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.040]   Go ahead. I tried it. I tried it this morning and I was able to send emails back and forth
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:52.760]   So, okay, well, that's the some question about it's from an article in uh called the mac info
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.960]   Yeah, it was an info world writer the article i'm referring to is a by buster hyney
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:03.160]   In alt of mac so i'm wondering if there's a little april fools or a little early
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:10.760]   Maybe that's his name if it is i'm sorry buster may be barely legal teens is the codename for the new iwatch
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:15.640]   They're just clamping down on on on security. Yeah, it was a
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.160]   This was a guy who wrote to info world that he was trying to send a script
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:25.640]   Uh that had that phrase in it the director never got the script he sent it sent it sent it again finally took barely legal teens
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.240]   Actually, he went to some uh, acford he cut the script into pieces
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:34.360]   Seeing which part got blocked finally came down to barely legal teens in fact. He was
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:39.800]   This wasn't even text it was it was like a pdf that was attached and I think it was even zipped
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:47.560]   So apple is actually looking into you know multiple layers of of attachments to find these phrases and and it's not even just that one phrase
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.240]   I mean there
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:55.000]   I have I have had over over you know the the history of icloud and mobile me and so forth
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.280]   Lots of email messages that have not shown up in my inbox that I know for sure were sent
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.160]   Because apple found
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:09.720]   Something right jack shanable who knows and and it might be completely innocent just a particular sequence of of words
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:13.720]   Set off their spam filter and and this you know as a number of people have commented
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:18.760]   It's not it's not a problem that they're trying to filter spam that's great at their filtering spam
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.880]   But just put it in your junk folder. Don't delete it all together
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:28.680]   You know there there is such a thing as as a false positive. So let you know let people decide whether something really is spam or not
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.680]   Yeah
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:35.960]   And I I have had the same problem with gmail. I've even had chads emails disappear on me and never show up so
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.760]   It's a male problem as well
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.120]   Things are like ham radio connections. Sometimes things get lost
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:46.840]   Yeah, it used to be that it wasn't a credible excuse to say I never got your email
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:53.880]   Now you can use that even if you did just a note you can say hey, did you say barely legal teens?
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.040]   I'd never heard of it
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:00.920]   School into my knowledge never isn't supposed to delete email. It's supposed to move it into another folder, right?
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.600]   Or maybe not spam to spam. Does it delete spam?
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.160]   I don't know. I would be surprised if they have multiple layers
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:16.360]   You know like if there are if the most severely and obviously spammy messengers are just silently deleting
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.240]   Maybe they are
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.200]   It's pretty good about just putting it in your spam folder
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.880]   One of the things that works were so well on gmail is that it's called it's collaborative
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:28.200]   So if people start marking, you know, there's a human element which I think really is the great way to do that
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.200]   I don't know what iCloud does
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.480]   Um
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.000]   All right, let's get to the womb was actually let's take a break and get to the womb was
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.560]   [laughs]
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.560]   With barely legal zoom
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:47.000]   Uh, but we but you got some you got some rumors coming up some rename where that's going to be the very first thing after I mentioned legal zoom.com
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.600]   Now you probably heard me talk about legal zoom. I want to emphasize this. It's not a law firm
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:36:01.160]   Although you can talk to a lawyer legal zoom is self-help for getting basic legal stuff done affordable business
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.040]   and personal documents
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:08.440]   Um, I you know what you might say. Well gosh should I trust my come I did
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:13.400]   RLLC we're still operating on an LLC that was created at legal zoom.com
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.120]   It's fantastic uh, incorporation
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.560]   Here's a big one that maybe you hadn't thought about maybe you've got a blog
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:27.640]   Or a name that you use online that really is your brand you might want to trademark that protect it easy to do and very affordable
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:31.720]   With legal zoom.com. It's a step-by-step questionnaire. You walk right through it
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.360]   They can do last wills. They can do trusts
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.480]   uh trademarks ip patents
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:44.920]   And I'll tell you what legal zoom has this new feature which I really like if as you're going through the questionnaire or something you go
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.640]   Gosh, I'd love to ask a lawyer. I don't want to say hey, you know
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:52.440]   250 bucks an hour to ask a lawyer they have the they call it the legal zoom
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.160]   uh legal plan attorneys in almost every state
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:02.520]   You can pick an attorney based on price based on reviews unedited reviews from users
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:09.880]   Um and and get a very affordable answer for instance my I had a question which I just kind of made up the answer to I think I
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.440]   I asked the magic eight ball
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.200]   Should I do my LLC in california or Delaware?
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.880]   Now there are pros and cons to each and I wish in
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.480]   In hindsight, I wish I had gotten some advice. So you can now legal zoom

[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:32.040]   Break out the rumor hat this one. I'm a little uh worry. I'm dissap. I
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.880]   Apple sounds like they're going to be sending out new ipad soon
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:40.200]   Yeah, I spoke a bit a little bit about it last week, but I wasn't sure now
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.720]   I've heard it from multiple sources and it surprised me and I was
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:48.440]   Curious because I heard you know the ipad mini retina is not imminent
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:52.840]   You know that that technology is still I want it expensive and the battery life isn't good enough
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:59.160]   An apple won't release a mini that is higher priced or doesn't get the same battery life as the regular mini
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:04.040]   Right, but it sounds like we are going to get uh at least some form of new ipads
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:10.920]   April ish and iphone 5s in august which would be a change again from the last year and how uh
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.280]   How high is your confidence level in the uh source?
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:21.560]   I I did not believe the ipad part of it just because you know often you can look at technology and you can kind of think about what
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.120]   Apple is going to do next and how long it'll take to get there
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.920]   But I heard it from enough people that it sounds like
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:32.200]   Uh at least that date is being considered for new devices now if it's not retina
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:38.680]   I don't know if it's a spec bump or if there's some other differentiator the ipad 5 is supposed to get the same thinner
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.320]   design as the ipad mini
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:46.040]   Uh and we've seen case leaks for that now people are seeing those parts in the supply chain in china
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.680]   So that's probably a good indicator but the
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.800]   The mini stuff still isn't clear to me, but april's sounds
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:56.440]   Like it's at least a strong possibility and caffeine free dave says no truth to the rumor
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.160]   They're going back to the 30 pin connector. No, no
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:06.040]   The iphone is even more interesting to me because they originally had the iphone introductions at ww
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:10.200]   dc along with the beta for the new ios and then we would get the
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:16.840]   Sorry, they used to have beta with my was in april. Yeah, they had ios sdk events and then we'd get the phone
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:23.960]   In june and a launch late june early july, right and then with the iphone for s they made us wait 16 months in the phone
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.000]   ios debuted at ww dc and the phone debuted
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.280]   Uh in october and we thought that might be the new norm, right?
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.360]   Absolutely and then last year was september which is kind of close enough. Yeah
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:41.640]   Uh, but if they switch to august, um then it makes you wonder when is ios 7 going to go into beta
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.240]   Are they going to have an event for that again?
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.200]   Is that going to be part of the spring event with the ipads?
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:51.720]   It it raises a lot of questions and i think there's probably good reasons to start doing stuff like that
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:53.400]   What?
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.120]   Well
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.400]   One of the problems with the iphone five s is that apple has this tick tock cycle
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.920]   So you get the new design one year and then you get the spec bump the next year
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:07.160]   But that starts to be really easy to counter program a file with sam song and htc and rim and or sorry blackberry
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:10.760]   I would just wait for the five s model or the whatever the s model is year
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:16.520]   And I would hammer that as hard as I could with my best devices and best software and especially if it's at a predictable
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:22.440]   Cycle, it's easy to you know, we've already seen the htc one. We're going to see the galaxy for s next month
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.320]   That's a very good way to counter program apple
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:29.480]   But if they start mixing up the dates and if they eventually go to multiple models throughout the year
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:33.880]   Or they start releasing more than once a year like they're doing with the ipads it becomes much harder
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:37.000]   They become a much faster moving target for any competition
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.960]   Um, is it possible that this iphone this this august iphone could be the cheap iph or the
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:50.440]   Less expensive plastic iphone that we've been hearing about for the china and other markets
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.160]   And they'll still do one in the fall
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.840]   They could do that as well. I heard specifically it was a five s for august
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:02.680]   I I don't know if the cheaper one would come along with that the cheaper one basically fixes two problems for them
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.680]   It gets them a phone that you can sell in
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:09.080]   Off-contract markets like india or if china mobile ever gets on with apple
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:15.640]   It makes them much more affordable phone because even the the free iphone four is still 450 bucks off-contract
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.160]   And that's a non-starter
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:22.520]   But also if you look at the sales now the sales of the iphone four and the iphone four s are phenomenal
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:27.320]   And that might start eating into the average sales price of the iphone because it becomes good enough
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:31.320]   This year the iphone five goes down if they keep the same pattern to a hundred dollars
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:36.280]   Next year free and an iphone five at a hundred bucks are free is a phenomenal phone
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:41.960]   But if you start having a different phone at the cheap end then you you have a solution for low-cost buyers
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:47.240]   But you also have a much better premium product and you kind of deconfuse that product line. Yeah
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.760]   And uh, yeah
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:57.480]   Already kind of screwed up the ipad release cycles by releasing the ipad four only eight months after the ipad three
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:00.600]   Yeah, and of course the mini was announced at the same time
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:07.320]   Uh, and one of the things I think apple was doing right and really from the point of view of of the average consumer was
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:12.200]   Was kind of a relief is they weren't kind of in lockstep every year
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:16.120]   And and I think people really got that in their head. No, no, they'll be one every year
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.160]   And so if I buy one when it's released I got a year
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:25.640]   Yeah, um, and so I think there's a risk to sta I understand from a competitive point of view it might be a good idea
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:28.120]   but from the point of view of the
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.600]   the kind of normal consumer I think
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:34.200]   Uh, the muddies the water a little bit. Isn't it a risk?
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.840]   It is if you go back two years they had the ipad event in the spring
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.680]   They had the iphone event in the summer and they had the ipad touch event in fall
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:48.360]   And there was either a new version of the software or an update a pretty good update of the software at each of those events
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:56.520]   So it was more of a process where last year you had the ipad and the apple tv in the spring and then you had almost everything again in the fall
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.760]   And putting everything the fall I think is
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:03.080]   It's it's good for the consumer if you have that yearly cycle, but it's better for apple
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:09.080]   If they do a combination of both if they start having more than one product so maybe a mini early an ipad
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:14.520]   You know full size ipad later or if they have a cheaper iphone or a bigger screen iphone
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:19.000]   And those are sort of like how sam slung does it or how almost any other manufacturer does it where they have
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.560]   Releases throughout the year it ends up being good for the consumer because they can pick the one they want
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:28.760]   Buy it and enjoy it and good for the company because they have a steady stream of products throughout the year
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:34.840]   Uh abc news is saying that the iphone five s
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:38.920]   To be released in august will be fiberglass with plastic screen
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.440]   Are they I mean they're not the first people I go to for
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.520]   iPhone
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:51.000]   Reports it's you five s has the the same it's the same pattern as before yeah, it's another iphone five with more features
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.560]   Yeah, that's how they get the prices lowers the economy of scales the more of those things they can churn out the lower
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:01.000]   It's like that old line from the west wing. You know the second one costs two dollars the first one cost a billion dollars
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.920]   Right first the only way they can yeah
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:06.920]   They can make sense out of that is to produce those over a long period of time right
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.040]   That's actually and that's a sensible cycle
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:14.760]   I think because at least in the u.s. It's not true in the rest of the world but least in the u.s
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.200]   Uh most of us are under two-year contracts with our phone company
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:22.360]   So three years, but that's how well that's yeah, so canada's three
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:27.880]   Yeah, uh, and I know many european nations is either none or three or five. I don't know what it is
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:34.360]   Um one and a half one some weird number but in the friends I was able to choose between a one-year or two-year contract
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.600]   So I always up it for the one year
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.400]   Did it cost more for the phone if you got a one-year
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:46.680]   Yes, they would they would charge a little bit more for the phone and of course as you know as here you you could buy an off-contract phone for
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:55.320]   Full retail price. Right. Um france has much more generous rules than the u.s. Currently has about unlocking phones. Yeah, we just we just changed that didn't we?
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.720]   Yes, maybe maybe illegal
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:06.600]   And hope there's you know, there's some there's a movement now to to uh make it legal again, uh, but uh, it's uh, I think europe is
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.480]   It tends to be a lot more enlightened in that regard, right?
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:15.320]   As it should be. I mean, I understand that if you're buying a phone subsidized you can even at a really low cost
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:21.080]   That the carrier has a right to kind of lock you in for a while, but once you're out of once you're out of contract
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:29.240]   Like sprint just said today. I thought this was good that they're gonna support bring your own device because it's good for the ecology for the landfills
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:35.880]   Because people are just taking so they're saying when you if you go to a sprint based mvno like ting our sponsor or
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.960]   virgin or
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:46.200]   Boost that you could take an old out of contract sprint device and move it over to those new mvno services. That's not quite unlocking
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:51.800]   But I think it's a step forward and yeah, the white house there was a petition got garnered a lot of signatures
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.360]   Honestly as much as a death star. Yeah
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.800]   Yeah, that and the white house actually responded
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:03.880]   Uh and said yeah, we agree it's there's something wrong with uh making it illegal to unlock
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:07.160]   um
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:12.360]   And high score is saying well if you're paying an early termination fee then what what then they're getting their money back
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:15.080]   So shouldn't you just be able to unlock it anytime?
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:21.240]   That's a good point. What's what is it? What happens in canada with locking unlocking you can call up?
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:25.800]   Uh rogers if you're off contract you can call up and for $50 they will
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:31.160]   Yeah, you can for $50 use your hardware in any way you choose
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:36.120]   That's just bad this year. I didn't realize it when I you almost always buy an unlocked iphone
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:41.320]   But this year to try to cut down on scalping they didn't sell the unlocked ones at retail only online
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.600]   And I was already in the lineup and I'd been there 12 hours
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.560]   I wasn't about to go home and order one and wait four weeks
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:51.240]   So I ended up buying full price but locked and then I had to call oh
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:58.280]   Hey, 50 bucks to have it on that sucks. Yes, you do qualify for an unlocking hold on will transfer you to our unlocking department
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.440]   Get your credit card out. Yeah
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.880]   Uh david edelman or david edelman writing from the white house
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.040]   Uh, he's
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:10.360]   Atlantic monthly said six years out of college this kid, but he's writing for the white house
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:15.320]   Says it's time to illegal. This is on the white house. I've time to legalize cell phone unlocking
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:19.320]   It's a little weird if you're not in the u.s. Uh to understand why the white house
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.120]   Has no nothing to say about this
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:28.680]   Um, it's because of the digital millennium copyright act. It's actually the librarian of congress
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:33.160]   Who determines what is legal and league illegal under the copyright act
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:40.120]   And the librarian of congress issued a ruling that uh while it's legal to jailbreak, it's illegal to unlock
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:47.160]   That makes it the law unless the legislative branch overturns it the president has nothing to say about
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:52.840]   But it's I think it raises the issue 114,000 petition
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.800]   signers on the
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.120]   Site and this article saying yes, it's time to unleash
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:05.080]   Unlock does or legalize unlocking does I think perhaps give some strength to a legislative
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.240]   amendment
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.080]   We shall see
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.160]   Seems like they might have some other things to do too, but
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:16.120]   Um, all right, so anything else in the rumor mill
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:22.040]   No, I mean, I there obviously though there will be some sort of os 10 and ios
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:26.440]   News at some point this year. We're on yearly cycles ros 10. So that's not that's just a given
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:34.920]   Yeah from mountain lion 2. What's the cat's name? I'm hoping for saber tooth. I like it. Although wasn't the original
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:39.480]   Oh, I would have been good. They had the saber tooth
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.280]   With a link should have been the first one
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:45.720]   All right
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:51.480]   No, it's do you do you think that sometimes they wonder about oh let let's let's like naming a kid and trying to find out
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.960]   Does this name rhyme with any rude words?
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:50:01.320]   The thinking let's let's let's let's have a list of every stupid tech pundit like, okay, okay

[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:11.000]   Okay, we can't use that damn. Let's not go gonna spin this on us this time
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:17.560]   No, only thing I've ever heard was the voice of reason that not goes this is the light in the shines and causes everything to grow
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.360]   That's the only thing I've heard is links which rhymes with thinks
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:23.960]   So I don't know is there an ocelot yet
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.840]   Um, no, we could do ocelot
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.280]   Which rhymes happy cam a lot
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.440]   How about cat woman
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:36.440]   How about scarred at joe hand no no never mind, uh, sorry

[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:44.200]   Um
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.200]   Is there really nothing else?
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.200]   There's plenty i like talking about this set
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.040]   How about OS 10 liger
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.640]   God
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:59.560]   It's like when you get ios ios plus a desktop OS
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:07.080]   Funny when any funny if they named it liger i would just i just would laugh i would be happy i would make me happy
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:10.440]   um
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.840]   So andi
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:14.120]   darling
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.320]   Sweetheart
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.680]   You my friend you have admitted now publicly
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.320]   Something that i've suspected for some time
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.280]   You no longer use the iphone as your day-to-day
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:27.800]   telephone
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:34.040]   Uh, I I got a quote nathan laine here. Uh, I didn't feel as though I need to have any sort of dramatic coming out
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:39.000]   Uh, I feel that people sort of assumed well. He's male. He's single
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.200]   He likes to like to customize and modify electronics. I mean he just makes sense doesn't it?
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:49.080]   And he does have an awfully colorful house
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:51.080]   um
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:55.000]   So you uh, you wrote an article for tech hive.com
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:03.400]   And which you say i've given up the iphone and I I am now a samsung galaxy s3 user
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:08.840]   Yeah, and it's uh, it's a piece i've been writing for like believe it or not like three or four weeks now
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:12.200]   Uh, this is part part one. It's it's gonna. It's gonna be in three parts
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.840]   Arriving every morning on tech hive in mac world
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:18.840]   Uh sort of it's and as I said like in the very very introduction
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:26.440]   Hoping that people would actually read past like the first paragraph of it that this isn't a piece about why anybody should switch from the iphone
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:33.880]   This is not definitely not a piece about like what apple is doing wrong. It's just a piece about a guy who got a phone
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:38.520]   The reasons why android is a better choice for me personally right now
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:42.680]   Uh, and I thought that by being really careful about well here's here
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:50.200]   The four things about android that really got me to switch here are the things I was worried about android that didn't turn out to be true
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.480]   Here are the things that are turned out to be absolutely true that are problems
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.680]   But they're not such a big deal that they trump everything else
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:01.080]   Uh because unfortunately, I think the waters been polluted a bit in the past year
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:05.240]   Where people who want to really want to see apple fail and fail hard
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.520]   And so there are a lot of people who would like to
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:14.920]   Keep kind of flooding the the comment boards and and blogs with well here's why i'm giving up on apple
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:19.480]   They no longer innovate and they're no longer easy to use and that's really not the the case here
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:24.600]   Um, I just I think that uh if there's a way to summarize that 6 000 words
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:29.480]   It's just that I think that apple in the past couple of years has been a little bit more aggressive and
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:32.120]   Targeting a specific kind of consumer
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.880]   Uh someone who
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:38.040]   Really will is willing to take whatever is given them if it's well designed
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:45.320]   Who doesn't really mind if they don't have quite so much choice about it who will take options that are hardwired in
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:51.080]   Uh, and they don't really doesn't really matter so much them to customize the experience to make a better fit for them
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:56.520]   And who don't really have a whole lot of demands about the design the physical design of a phone
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:59.160]   uh, so if you're willing to simply
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.880]   Uh take the operating system that's given to you
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:05.320]   Accept the behavior of the operating system as it's delivered to you
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:11.400]   And then simply deal with the fact that there is going to be one phone a year one design one concept take it or leave it
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.320]   That's going to work great for you
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:17.240]   Uh for me the way that I use a phone which is as a very very active device
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.120]   I mean this really is a post pc device in my pocket
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:27.400]   I'm using it all the time to capture data capture ideas manage projects projects. It's what I use when i'm not
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:32.680]   Uh actually behind a keyboard and i'm actually still getting actual work done for that kind of stuff
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:37.480]   I just found that uh the iphone was just wanting on a bunch of different levels
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:39.480]   Uh, and i'm in the unusual position
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:45.400]   I mean most of people is a conversation or in this position where they get an opportunity to try out pretty much everything and I get every
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:49.800]   Sing pretty much every phone that's uh every uh, uh big name phone that's ever released
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:51.640]   I get to try it for a couple of weeks to a month
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:55.720]   Uh, that's just the last year I found that every time that I have to put the phone back in the box
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:59.960]   And send it back to the manufacturer and switch back to the iphone. It was like, oh
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:06.280]   The screen's a little bit small. Isn't it? Oh, remember how easy it was to like take a text clipping and make turn into an evernote clipping
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:11.400]   Oh, wasn't it nice to be able to set up a custom like desktop screen that had really everything I needed to it
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:15.320]   But this is nice too. It's beautiful and it's simple and it's easy to use
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:22.120]   Uh, so really that that's all it's about I felt is uh, I was uh, I run into a lot of people who are in that same sort of category
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:29.000]   And I thought that by I could have just made into a little like 800 word. Yeah, I'm switching I like the galaxy s3 and
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:34.600]   I'm I'm really happy with it right now. I thought that if I were if I were able to talk about this in great detail
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:40.440]   It would help a lot of people understand either why they should cast their net a little bit wider or why
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:45.800]   Switching from the iphone is probably not going to be the best decision for them and uh, uh, it's
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:51.160]   I've gotten I've gotten a lot of feedback over that or that uh, article so far. Uh, you're like
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:53.720]   Dylan going electric somebody said. Oh god
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:56:00.840]   I'm so curious and yeah, well, I tweet I mean I knew I knew that something was up when I tweeted that it was posted earlier this morning
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.080]   I tweeted out the link at like a little after nine
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:08.680]   I checked back like at 9 20 and it wasn't just the number of like retweets and like comments. It was
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:13.160]   1 2 3 I see retweets in five different languages. Okay
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:19.160]   But you will in part three talk about the downsides of androids so apple
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.160]   Yeah, we talked it's it's four
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:28.840]   The structure is in detail. I go over the four things that really made me switch to androthe four features of androids that really attracted me
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:31.880]   There's in the last part. I'm talking about
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:39.160]   Uh, the stuff that people often say is the reason why they don't use and reason why androids is a terrible system
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:42.520]   Uh, and it turns out that those things are not really true
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:49.240]   The reasons why it is actually a disadvantage and then I talk a little bit about why apple I think is getting so much flak
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:54.280]   Uh over go while you're not innovating enough and you're being left behind which is again not true
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:58.600]   Well, some of this was a little bit defensive and it's part of the reason why I decided to
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:03.240]   Take some time with this because I knew that there were a lot of people who were just going to see the headline that hey
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:09.720]   I'm switching from uh, iphone to androids and think I was just linkbaiting or just, you know trying to be a rabble rouser
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:13.400]   No, you don't know there's there's reasons why I do things that as as I've said before
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:18.440]   I think that you should love the features that a device gives for you
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:22.040]   You should love the way that it makes your life easier and simpler
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:26.120]   You shouldn't love the company that makes it because if you they don't love yourself
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:30.440]   Exactly. I I love for five years. I love the iphone for the features that it delivered
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:36.120]   Uh, and if I found myself that I was sticking with the iphone just because I love apple and
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:40.840]   I've been an apple user since I was in, you know middle school then i'm kind of a dope
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:45.400]   What could uh, and i'm sure johnny. I've and uh, tim cook will be listening carefully to this
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:49.000]   What could apple do to win you back with the next iphone
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.200]   Uh, well, uh, of course there are rumors that there's going to be a large
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:58.760]   What one of them is that I really really do miss having a larger screen phone and this is you know, the four point in screen
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:01.240]   It was just so hard to switch back to the smaller screen
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:05.080]   Uh, when I had actually i've been thinking about this for a number of months
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:09.320]   I was really waiting to see well, what's ios what what is happening to live with ios six
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:15.640]   What's the iphone five going to be like and really one of the main things i was hoping for is give me a properly big screen
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:20.680]   Because it's uh, it's it's something that is just enhances my mobile experience
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:25.320]   Inestimably, I mean that they're there they're they're have you ever like read an opinion?
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:31.640]   Online that is so completely out of whack with your own experience that you for a moment
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:37.080]   You doubt your own recollection of your own feelings because it's just wait is two point two plus eight
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.000]   11 maybe it
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   Have I just assumed it's ten?
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.960]   And when you see so many people claim that oh well the larger screen
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.000]   It's actually just a marketing gimmick that gullible consumers are
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.600]   Swoo are swooned by in the showroom and doesn't actually show you more information. Yeah, yeah, it does
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:59:00.200]   But it's not just that it's I like the fact that it's so easy to move information between apps
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:03.080]   Uh instead of having to do a cut copy and paste
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:05.400]   Which is how you usually have to do it on the iphone
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:09.000]   Uh, and they're there a bunch of other things that are that are in the in the articles
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:14.360]   Uh, but uh, if apple apple really needs to make a lot of changes not just to the hardware
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:18.280]   And not even just to ios they really have to change their attitude again
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.440]   I'm not saying their attitude isn't as bad right now
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:26.120]   I'm just saying that they really are focused towards a consumer who really wants to take the thing out of the box
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:29.800]   Power it up charge it up put their phone their contacts in it and go
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.440]   Well, I'll give you a good a good example of an area that apple
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:36.600]   You and I might want apple to change but apple will not ever change
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:43.800]   And that is the openness of the system. So you mentioned a little bit with the sharing menu in and red which can be extended by any app
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:48.760]   Uh, but of course is limited by apple intentionally to twitter and facebook
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:52.360]   Uh because they can control it similarly you mentioned
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:59.240]   Uh that you can use different keyboards apple won't let you do that for good reason because a third party keyboard can capture keystrokes
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.200]   And if it's malicious send it back to the bad guys
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.600]   Um, and so this closed
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.960]   Ecosystem that apple's created where they don't give api
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:14.360]   Access to for instance your text messages while androids does means that there is some functionality missing
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:19.080]   I use an android plugin for chrome called mighty text. Let's me center receive my texts
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.720]   Uh on the phone also on my desktop
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:26.600]   Uh apple controls that tightly with messages if you don't like the message experience too bad
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.120]   Because apple rightly I think says there's a potential for
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.800]   Uh misbehavior if we let other people write to the text message
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:38.360]   There's also some technical reasons behind a lot of this, you know, i've had androids since the g1
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:46.200]   I've I most recently have an excess for now, but both these these devices came from very different backgrounds when the iphone was created
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.320]   It was
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:53.560]   It's unclear. It was ever really meant to run third party apps and it wasn't springboard is not springboard is one giant lump
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.520]   It's not
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:59.320]   Architected in a way that makes it easy to do things like multitasking or contracts or intents
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.400]   Or a lot of stuff that android was built from the ground up to support
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:07.240]   A lot of that has been kind of added on in layers to ios
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:11.320]   But the same token android was originally not meant to be an iphone like device
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.960]   And that's why when I use an xs for and I think I mentioned this before you put it in developer mode
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.960]   And you turn on screen redraws
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:24.280]   I just see the scroll view being drawn four times because google hasn't had time to go back and re architect the display layers
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:29.400]   I'm i'm a designer by trade and that really bothers me the interface on android really bothers me
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:33.640]   But other people the functionality on ios really bothers them so to andy's point
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:39.400]   It's what annoys you more you'll end up going towards a platform that better. So what's interesting is and Andy you always
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.200]   While you were still using the phone
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:50.200]   Uh, you always brought up that exact design thing you said that the fit and finish on iphone is better for both apps and the os
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:54.680]   Did you what happened to you on that one? Did you just say well i can live with it?
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.720]   Yeah, it's um
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:05.400]   And i get i get into this in greater detail in later sections of the article, but uh, it's not a case of android
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:08.760]   kicking ios's butt in category after category after category
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:16.280]   It's more like there's a point system and the look and feel of the apps got good enough that although it's still not as good as
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:22.360]   as ios it's not a bad look and feel it's not a bad interface and
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.040]   the
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:29.800]   Tone of the entire app market has changed. Uh, when i was for i had sort of transitional period
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:34.360]   i'm talking as almost as though i'm going through gender reassignment surgery there was a time when i was sort of
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:44.360]   Uh, there was a time of which i is android curious folks. It's not necessarily a long term i was definitely by phone i had i was
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:47.000]   I was carrying both phones in my pocket all time phone love
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.880]   And i was and i was using i was using the sam song as a wifi device because i
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.600]   had that i had no sim in it and
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:00.680]   Uh, i found and i'm like well i'm gonna miss so many of the ios apps, but i found that really
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:07.480]   Nearly all of the apps that i really care about are multi platform and in the past 14 to 16 months
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.680]   uh companies like ever know they're no longer
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:17.400]   Content to have an ios team and an android team now they want it to look exactly the same on multiple platforms
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:21.080]   And i think though ever know does update ios faster than android
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.560]   The new features seem to come to ios first
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:27.640]   Um, maybe not i'd be wrong i couldn't i couldn't say either way
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:33.480]   But the point is that now the design isn't coming directly from the operating system the design is being dictated by whoever's
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:40.280]   Trying to build this and apply it on multiple platforms and also i mean this it's not even to say that there are not great
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:45.880]   Great looking apps designed for uh, designed for uh, uh, design for uh, uh, uh, android
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.160]   i mean my
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:54.120]   i've never really used google reader on, uh, on my iphones i've never found like a google reader rss app
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.920]   That i thought was very pretty and very readable and very very good
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:04.040]   And now i'm using this app called when i found this app called press now. This is really almost my my, uh, uh, rss reader of choice
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:07.480]   Uh, on a desktop ipad or any other device
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:15.320]   Uh, so it's they really have elevated their game part of that is that they've finally made that transition android 4.0 android 4.1
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:19.560]   Uh, they really have gotten their developers in line enough to say look
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.680]   You can't just simply throw a bunch of crap onto the screen and if it sticks and if the buttons highlight when you press them
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:27.480]   You can't just say okay the user the user interface is done
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:34.280]   So yeah, it's a lot of what you have to talk about is when you're talking about the differences between the two is that just because
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:39.400]   Android is not quite as reliable as ios doesn't mean it's unreliable just because the the
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.640]   Uh, the apps aren't as pretty as ios doesn't mean they're not pretty apps
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:51.000]   And then when you say that they're certainly within the letter close enough to the letter grade of ios that now you can look at other things
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:57.880]   Such as again, they're not apple is not willing to give me a true big screen phone apple is not willing to give me
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.360]   An app switching mechanism and an app
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:05.240]   Data sharing mechanism that really really works. There are lots lots of little things that i find more
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:09.160]   Easier to use and another thing to talk about customization
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:16.600]   Android has a google has no problem if a developer wants to remap the volume keys that this walk rocker switch this on every single phone
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.920]   To do other things
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:26.680]   So it's often being used as a page turner device. It's often being used for really interesting functions for those situations when you really are in that
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:31.880]   Viewing mode we're just sort of sitting or standing and then just like looking at a screen and paging through information
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:34.440]   And it makes this kind of device a lot easier to use
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:42.600]   So it's it's what i'm saying is that when the bulk of these two devices are close enough in a letter grade
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:50.600]   It doesn't matter that the iphone is an a minus and this samsung galaxy s3 with android 4.1 is a b plus
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:55.160]   Or a b the fact that they're close enough that these are two
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.480]   sufficiently advanced
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:04.440]   Useful well-designed phones means that now the the the field is open for me to be swayed by other things such as you know
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:09.240]   Physical design larger screen the fact that hey, I can actually just move a
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:16.200]   Memory card from the camera that i'm shooting to a memory card slot that's on this device itself isn't that nice
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:22.360]   There's a there's a i'm using a to-do list manager that i was never i was never really a big
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.520]   damnit
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.080]   I there's just it's just the perfect thing to came up
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:33.960]   There's a to-do list manager that i really really like that's called any dot do i heard it go daling
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.200]   It's also it goes the ling too, but you know what that's on ios as well
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:44.040]   But it's on ios as elb and fortunately i just i dismissed it before before i could have a really nice new feature
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:49.160]   Has has a really nice feature where you can tell it that not only is there a list of here's the things i want to get done today
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:55.640]   You can say please remind me of these things that are going on and instead of just putting up an alert and just simply here's a dialogue box
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:07:00.520]   It will just simply a little deck of buttons from the apple roll up in whatever app you're using right now
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:04.600]   To remind you hey you really wanted to get the last part of that android piece done today
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:09.320]   Do you want to snooze this i'll remind you again in an hour or are you going to tell me that this is dumb
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:14.040]   Does it not do that on ios because i love that feature i really active notifications webOS used to do it
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:20.120]   But ios hasn't got any it can't do it really have very many active notifications because because one app can't really interfere with another app
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.440]   Right and that's a good thing because if it's if it
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:28.200]   I hope so but but that's exactly that that kind of goes back to the point i was making which is apple
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   More because of a
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   Decision about security and integrity is not going to be able to support those kinds of things
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.480]   Because they open up holes
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.560]   Um, but you but the good news is you have a choice and i would just like to say one thing i mean
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.240]   Mm
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:49.880]   The the really good news is there are really good phones in both camps and in fact
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:54.840]   I think you could make a good case that windows phone and maybe even blackberry also a great answer
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:02.280]   Excellent choices and the differences between these are relatively minor, which is great. You get to choose what you like
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:07.160]   The nice thing is that people used to fight over phones and now we're at a time where they're fighting over us
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:12.040]   And I think that's that's the best thing to be every reason and he mentioned that he likes android better
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:18.040]   I agree with but is almost always a reason that I still prefer ios and there are signs
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:24.040]   You know apple broke springboard into springboard and backboard they ported xpm xpc from os 10 to ios
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.040]   So there there might be a lot of stuff going on there
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:30.520]   But the fact that I can just pick that phone up and go that I don't have to worry about managing it
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.440]   I'm not going to waste my not waste my time
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:37.640]   But I have other things to do rather than customize a phone so I can make that choice now a great experience
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:45.000]   And younger me or you know someone who's still like and he really interested in that stuff can pick up whatever the latest android devices and be absolutely
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.680]   Delighted by that experience and I think
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:49.480]   That's an amazing time that we live in
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:54.840]   So Andy without getting into a ton of detail were you tempted at all by windows phone 8
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.560]   Very much so
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:03.800]   I there's the old joke about the perfect european society in which you know the police or the priests are all are all
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:09.560]   The mechanics are all british the police are all Swiss the chefs are all french
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:12.360]   The french are all Italian the lovers are all whatever
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:17.000]   I think the my the ultimate device really would take a lot of things from a lot of different areas
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:21.000]   I really really love windows phone 8 because the the live tile feature
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:29.480]   I truly think that this is the way for to manage lots of information in a very simple and a beautiful way on a tiny device
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:32.200]   I I will continue to say every time every time I see
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:41.400]   The microsoft windows modern interface. I am continuing to be I continue to be impressed with how flexible it is no matter what display you put it on
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:49.720]   What size what shape would orientation it's always just such a beautiful and useful way of arranging information and it's also
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.600]   It's also great to
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.440]   Take a phone out of your pocket
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:10:00.120]   As you're waiting for someone to show up for dinner and you just simply wake the screen and you see a live
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:04.280]   You see a batch of live tiles that simply gives you a quick overview of
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:10.280]   No emails. No, nothing really interesting happening on twitter. No, no pictures posted great. There's nothing going on. Nothing is on fire
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:14.040]   I can put this in my pocket back in my pocket and leave it there for the next two hours
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:21.000]   Whereas on the iPhone and even on the android you have to drill down into a lot of different apps to get that kind of
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.960]   Dashboard look at everything that's going on in your mobile life
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:31.880]   If you've been waiting for the iWatch to come out later this year because then you'll go back to the iPhone
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:33.640]   You may be waiting a little longer
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:37.080]   Corning says hey, you know that glass that wraps around your wrist
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:42.120]   It's gonna be years three years before flexible glass
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:45.640]   Is available? I don't know if that's a
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:49.800]   A requirement of an iWatch but of course it was part of the patent that we saw and uh
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:55.560]   Everybody thought gee if you're gonna do an iWatch you don't what you don't want to do is something like this a big clunky hunk of metal
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.800]   That floats on your wrist
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.800]   um
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:03.400]   Well, we see what do you think will we see an iWatch this year some say yes
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:06.440]   Maybe i mean people here
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.960]   Okay, sorry your your your rumor guy run a small
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:12.680]   Deferter in a rumor
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.760]   I heard that they have got that they have you know, they're pushing ahead on the project
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.320]   I haven't heard anything's gone into manufacturing it
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:24.040]   But that they are devoting a lot of resources of the project and other publications have heard that as well
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.280]   So unlike the television panel which sounds like it's just sitting in a lab somewhere
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:32.920]   The watch project sounds like it's a real go can we declare the iTV did
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:39.960]   No, I mean it's in the lab so it's just gonna be it's exactly what Steve jobs said in 2010 that when the market conditions support it
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.600]   They will go to market with it and those haven't subsensent
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:49.560]   Substantively changed in the last couple of years, but the watch market, you know, they're getting way better at doing much smaller ios devices
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.000]   there's um
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   There's a school of thought that you can make ios even more accessible and bring it more places and make it open to more people
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.120]   And if you think that the iWatch would be a watch that's like saying the iphone is a phone and well
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:09.400]   Yes, there's a phone app on it, but it's a lot more and the iWatch would probably be you know similar more to a watch than the iphone is to a phone
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.120]   Yeah, and the the
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:17.400]   I I I have heard from the same thing that now I think that rene has been hearing about it
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:25.640]   I know I really have heard nothing beyond the idea that it is a very active project and an area of rather intense interest
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:30.200]   My sources are usually not the kind that will show me a picture of something that apple's working on
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.320]   With under the assumption i'm never going to show it anybody so much my sources aren't as good as as a lot of other people's
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:41.080]   But yeah, we're asked I have not heard really anything new about an apple tv. I keep hearing things about an apple watch
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.720]   uh, and it's it's attractive in that
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:50.600]   uh, I keep if I have a consistent complaint about apple among them is that you really do have to have a bit of coin in order to
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:56.280]   Get into the apple product line and hopefully a watch would give them a price point that would allow
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:00.680]   People who don't have quite so much money to get access to that kind of design that kind of functions
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:05.000]   Uh, and I was I was thinking I've been thinking about this for as everybody has for the past several weeks
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.520]   And I think that the more I think about how ambitious apple's notification system is with push notifications
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:17.640]   The more I think that if the main focus of an apple watch is just simply to be a receiver for notifications
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.000]   from
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.120]   Any user who's plugged into the apple ecosystem or any app running on any apple o s that's in that
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:30.760]   Echo system that in itself would be a very very cool thing because you know as as usual we started a little bit late today
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:36.920]   And so I'm sort of like thinking about I bet I bet I have time to run upstairs and
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:43.400]   And put on like my warmer socks or hey, I wonder if you know, how would the eye watch help you with that?
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:49.000]   Well, the the idea that I could simply be throughout the house doing whatever I want to do and then it's simply
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:54.520]   The skype notification that's normally just a little dingus that's in the quarter my screen also flashes to my watch
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.720]   That could tap a button that's that's not even like an interface just simply and I acknowledge this notification
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:05.320]   Uh, and so and so you guys would know that okay. He has seen this and he is reacting to it so he's not dead and he
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:11.800]   And the other be great is if what you really want is an ankle bracelet on leo that says when he's left the house
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:15.640]   Pings you then how about that? Mine my friends alert on leo
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:20.200]   Hey, somebody call me on the radio show nice a nice elderly woman
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:24.680]   Said she was very excited about the new watches the new phone watches and I said
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:29.720]   Oh dear. You don't expect to be able to make a phone call in that watch you she said well. Yes
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:34.360]   I said well as far as I could tell and of course we haven't seen it. It's just a rumor
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:38.840]   This requires an iPhone is that right? I mean, we're not talking about a yeah
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:41.400]   We're not talking about something you talk to a watch right?
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:45.720]   It makes sense that at least especially in early generations that you wouldn't be able to fit all the lt
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:50.520]   Radios and everything else that you can fit into a device the iphone size into that tiny package
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:54.440]   So in beginning your service like yeah battery all those different things
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:15:00.840]   So in the beginning it it makes sense it would be like an apple tv style extension of an iphone and then as technology improves
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.000]   You know one day maybe we have iphones that size
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.920]   So I was I told her the right thing. I said dear go ahead and get a phone
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:13.560]   This isn't gonna be first of all don't wait for an ightwatch second of all. It's not gonna be a phone anywhere
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:19.240]   A friend of mine. I worked at the apple store said someone came in and asked for 50 bucks worth of ight cloud for their boyfriend's amson
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:26.600]   I'd like to buy some cloud some cloud storage. They remember when Steve jobs introduced the iphone
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.960]   We were there all sitting in the in the auditorium in
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:35.800]   Moscone west first thing he did is pulled out the phone dialed starbucks in san francisco and said good morning
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.480]   I'd like to order 4,000 lattes to go remember that
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:43.640]   Yep, uh, then he goes no just kidding wrong number. Goodbye, but you know
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:51.240]   Both both steves was and jobs were phone pranksters before they were anything else if he had passed look back then he would have been charged
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.920]   I know
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:59.400]   Too late and they'll be on their way. So, uh, I love this because uh fast companies tracked down the barista who answered that call
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:01.560]   She's still at that starbucks
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.720]   Hannah jang
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:08.920]   She said I really feel honored that I got she didn't know it wasn't it was a prank call
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.560]   Uh
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:16.120]   It was just another phone call and later fast company tracked her down
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:21.640]   And she's been there now, uh for more than half a decade. She says honestly I was shocked
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:24.760]   I would I've never heard anybody order 4,000 lattes to go
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:30.040]   I didn't say anything because I was shocked my first impression was he was just being humorous. He sounded like a gentleman
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:33.880]   So there you go now
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.240]   Oh sure now

[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:51.320]   Um then I don't know if they say which starbucks it is but they do they do have a picture of her be kind of fun to go in there and get her autograph
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.960]   It's probably there's a starbucks right across the street from us goany. Maybe I wonder if it was that one
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:00.120]   All right, we're gonna take a break when we come back here picks of the week my friends

[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:52.440]   you get to keep your books. So
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:57.240]   Uh, the one I'm gonna recommend this week is one of my favorite audible books is called pictures at a revolution
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:01.080]   Uh, the unabridged versions by mark harris and it's a book
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:05.880]   About the making of four different movies that are all made in the same year
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:08.280]   They're all nominated for best picture 1967
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:12.040]   So it's all about the making of guess who's coming to dinner the graduate in the heat of the night
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.280]   Dr. Doolittle and bonnie and clide
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:20.120]   So all five best picture nominees and the great thing is that it's it's almost as though that lineup was taylor
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:23.000]   Made for interesting stories because you have
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:31.480]   Uh, guess who's coming to dinner? You have an old film make old filmmakers trying to make sense of a new culture and trying to address that
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:38.120]   The graduate which is part of that new wave of uh of late sixties early 70s cinema that was going to revolutionize everything
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:41.480]   in the heat of the night which is sort which would actually
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:48.360]   Achieved what guess who's coming to dinner was trying to do. Yeah, dr. Doolittle, which was the one of the classic
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.160]   epic
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.640]   Budget bill makers. I mean every chap
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:57.000]   What has been a chapter three animals to the animals?
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.320]   It's like everything everything that it's it's it's oh god
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:08.200]   It was that was probably my favorite part of the book because the producer his father was also like a legendary producer
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:11.960]   And so he said hey dad here's the script of dr. Doolittle that i'm gonna start shooting
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:17.640]   And he reads it with decades of hollywood experiences. Okay, so here's every disaster
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:22.360]   powder that you're not going to have a solution for and dammit he hit it every single one of the bright
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:30.440]   I can't wait you you recommended that peter. I think it was peter biskin book about the new hollywood that I loved i'm adding this

[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.440]   Yeah, yeah, I mean it's uh
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:45.400]   It's it's I just tweeted yesterday that you know if I could pay an extra eight dollars for a cable package that would never ever start a great movie
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:49.800]   Like 2001 a space odyssey in the morning when i'm just trying to settle down and get to work
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:55.880]   I would pay that eight dollars because it was like how many times have I lost like three hours in the morning by

[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:44.040]   Look at that looks beautiful on an iPad doesn't it?
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:46.520]   Yes, you can read on an iPad or on
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:49.560]   Whatever device you like it comes in all the usual formats
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:53.160]   Uh, so take control of your passwords. It's a ten dollar ebook
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:58.440]   It tells you everything you need to know about passwords and a lot of things you don't really need to know but you might like to know
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:03.880]   And uh, I I hope you'll enjoy it. I do have another pick I'd like to mention
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.800]   Uh, something that I've I've started to use the last couple of weeks
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:12.040]   Uh, you know, I I have a I'm well a few iPads and iPhones and so forth
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:16.760]   Um, and I often have to use my you know, one of my max
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:21.640]   You know do screen sharing to access one of my max from an iOS device
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:25.000]   And there are lots of apps that do this, but I there's a new one that I've been using
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.240]   Recently that I really like
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.080]   called air log in
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:32.600]   Currently air log in is iOS only they may do an android version of the future
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:39.640]   Uh, but you install an app on your mac called air connect and so it'll negotiate all the you know, nat routers and those sorts of things
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:45.320]   But what makes this different from uh from other sorts of screen sharing apps i've used
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:52.120]   Is that they they sort of pull out the menus so you know, I can I can do screen sharing to my my big
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:55.800]   27 inch iMac which has another 27 inch display next to it
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:59.720]   And on my ipad, you know, it's it's just this tiny little thing
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:05.080]   You can't you can't make out any of the interface elements you can see the windows, but the menus are like, you know, two pixels high
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:11.560]   So uh, what air log in does is it makes the menu full size
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:15.240]   So that you can actually tap all the all the menu commands
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:19.080]   Uh, yeah as you as as you were showing right now. That's so awesome that you can do that
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:23.480]   Um, and and so it's it's a much more usable app and also you need that
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:28.600]   For this kind of like expose where it just sort of explodes out all the windows and you say
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:33.160]   I want this window to fill up my entire screen and uh, so as screen sharing apps
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:38.600]   Uh for iOS go, uh, this one is quite a nice one. That's amazing. Wow
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:41.480]   From avatar on avatron.com
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.440]   It's called air log in
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.480]   Right on and you need both the iOS app
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:51.320]   And the desktop air connects software to make that work
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.800]   Right, how much how much total is it?
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:59.720]   Well, it's it's free now they they do have some sort of in app purchase for a subscription
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:05.960]   Which I haven't I haven't paid them any money and I I haven't quite worked out what it is you are paying them for but, uh,
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:11.800]   Well, it's it's it's free if you're going to use it just to control another mac on your home network
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:15.240]   If you want if or if you pay with that that yearly fee
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:20.040]   Then that includes like a central bridge service that let you log into your mac from everywhere anywhere on the internet
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:22.040]   So far i haven't had to do that, but that's good to know
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:25.960]   But that's like back to your mac except you back to your mac with an iOS device
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:30.040]   Right, well, that's very wackling it actually works that one that works. Wow
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:34.520]   Good pick joe. How about you rene richy what you got for us?
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:40.600]   Last week I spoke about app.net because they offered a free tier and it was it was interesting last week
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:44.120]   This week they did a hackathon sort of a project and steve straza
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.760]   Who's well known as one of the developers for pocket
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:55.240]   He did this project called ami and what it does is allow you to use app.net messaging inside the mac messages app
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:57.800]   Ooh now i'm interested
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:05.320]   Yeah, it's really smart the same way you can use iMessage or you could use uh aol or any or gtalk or anything else in the
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.680]   um
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:11.320]   Messages app you can now use adn and adn is is a very straightforward client
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:16.680]   Like you give them money they give you a service and I like that sort of an arrangement and being able to do that
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:20.520]   Uh, you know and you can store files and adn it just it becomes
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:25.800]   He's they're bringing the service to the apps that I already use and that's always a better way to get me to use something that to make
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:29.400]   Me have multiple apps running might even make me want to use messages
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:35.960]   Wow, yeah, they're interesting because they're multiple person you can do it's a very it's a very feature-filled messaging service
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:40.760]   It's much bigger than just twitter dms project ami you can find it at app.net
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:44.440]   You have to google project ami to find it what a great idea
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:50.280]   Yeah, so there is an api to messages. It allows you to add these kinds of plug-ins
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.360]   That's a nice thing. I mean they're they're very open
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:59.160]   We were talking before about android and ios and I like my devices closed. I like tightly managed tightly integrated devices and interfaces
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:03.000]   But I like my protocols open. I like those to be as accessible as possible
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.000]   So I can move them between those, you know shiny little boxes and app.net
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.320]   So far has been really good about making their files api open and their messages api open
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.160]   And they're very straightforward about their micro blogging api
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:20.600]   So you have a wealth of really cool clients that you can use them and you can even as steve stras a show
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:25.160]   You know put them right into the messages app because apple allows you to put plug-ins into messages
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.480]   I'm gonna have to pay more attention to that
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:31.240]   Yep, interesting. Thank you rene richie. I'm more.com
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:34.440]   Where the rumors live
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:39.080]   And andi and akka shikago send times former makita's reporter
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:43.240]   No, you still use makita's i'm sure
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:47.800]   I guess I guess I can no longer call myself internationally beloved because never even
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:50.760]   internationally loaded
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:57.000]   Oh join the club. I'm john adam's i'm obnoxious and disliked. Yes, but a great president
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.600]   Thank you. What do you carbell president good states? What do you like these days?
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:06.680]   Uh, this is kind of an esoteric choice. It's actually a font
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:14.280]   And it's a version of courier. Wow. It's now this is no, but you know, it's funny. I collect mono type fonts
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:17.320]   Yeah, and because well i've had to i've
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:21.720]   Over the past week or so i've been trying to like modify my workflow
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:27.640]   Because uh, I when I I love the ipad so much that I really changed my workflow a couple years ago
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:34.920]   So there would oh so it all flows around pages, which is really still the only really good formatted text editor for
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:39.960]   For the ipad waiting for apple to give the sort of rich text
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:45.960]   Editing tools to developers that now we can have maybe some options for this and now sort of like okay
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:49.480]   Well, I've i'm gonna have to sort of make a change now. I'm sort of switching to
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:53.640]   uh text editors and the problem the only problem there is that uh
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:30:00.520]   This is the sort of problem that people who write for eight to ten hours a day have to face
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:03.640]   Instead of working on the big project that's due today
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:07.240]   You keep fiddling with what's the most comfortable font to edit
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:11.560]   And so anything but right exactly
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:19.480]   Times times new roman time. Yeah, and what size uh, and so uh
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:25.080]   I've I've I've always liked mono space fonts because it really does help you focus on
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:29.320]   This is just the text the formatting doesn't matter because you're gonna be slipping into another another editor later on
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:33.240]   A courier a courier prime is a deliberate attempt
[01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:39.560]   For someone to create a mono space typewriter style font that looks good like when it's printed in screenplay form
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:44.440]   The problem is that typewriter style fonts usually have one of two problems
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:48.040]   Either they try too hard to look like a typewriter font
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:54.520]   So it looks like the sort of thing you would use on the on a movie poster about people who work who are professional novelists
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:31:01.880]   So it's too distracting or it's just so robotic that it's just there's just no no life to it whatsoever
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:07.640]   A courier prime is a lovely happy medium between the two and given that this is something I have a
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.480]   There you go. This is
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:15.640]   Given given that this is something that you're going to be staring at for hours and hours on end as you as you deal with your own writing
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:19.880]   It's so comfortable. It has enough weight to it that it has presence on the screen
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:23.800]   But it's not so heavy that it's distract that you stop looking at the actual words
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:26.680]   It's lively. It's really really neat
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:30.840]   And it's a free font. So you just download it install it pretty much anywhere you want to go
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:35.640]   Uh, so I've been using this as my editing font for the past like week or so
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:41.320]   Uh, and I absolutely love it. It's it's hard. It might be overstating things to say that it's sort of
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:45.480]   Uh improved my decision to switch to plain text editing
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:49.160]   But it really is a benefit of switching to plain text editing
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:51.160]   I mean you can use this with anything
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:55.320]   But especially if you're going to be using a plain text editor where you're not going to get the the the sort of little
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:32:00.120]   On-screen beauty of here's what real it house looks like and here's what the margins look like
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:03.160]   Here's what the indent looks like uh, it'll still give you that really cool
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.240]   Something really pretty to look at
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:09.480]   I was i'm thinking why because I have the same kind of thing where moi's looking for a better mono spaced font
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:12.360]   And I think it's because monoco sucks so bad
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:19.720]   Yeah, I mean that it just ever since apple deprecated the kyro font. I mean, it's been a long slow climb
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.520]   Uh, kyro, uh kyro, we hardly knew ye
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:29.080]   Uh, uh, so yeah, I have inconsolata, which is a consolus uh clone
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:36.200]   I use and I like pro font which is a monoco with a strike through the zero which monoco un unaccountably does not have
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.480]   Um, droids sands is quite good
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:43.400]   But I'm I just downloaded and installed a career prime. It's a true type font
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:47.800]   And I yeah, I do like career, but you're right. It's so funny. I don't like it
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:51.160]   Because it's too it's it's something about it the strokes
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:56.200]   I think I think part of it is also psychologically. It's the oh you didn't have the right font installed
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:58.360]   Right substituted this right
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:02.440]   Defaults as oh, I have a problem with my computer. I need to fix it. I can't be writing a novel right now
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.200]   Uh
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:05.480]   That's so funny
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:10.520]   I'm I'm installing it. I you know as that that's a weird thing collecting mono space fonts, but I do
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:13.400]   And apparently you do too, antie
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.560]   Only when i'm on deadline
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.800]   Exactly only the as there's no as
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:20.280]   No, Stanley Kubrick movie on
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:26.840]   That's the that's the fallback position as the wise man once said there is nothing that a man can't accomplish long so there's something more important
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.840]   That he's supposed to be doing instead
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:33.320]   I'll tell you here's one you can use your your new font with that I I
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:37.720]   Found the other day and I'm just really having a good time. It's a little expensive $10
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:40.200]   It's called cathode. Have you tried this yet?
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:44.520]   Uh, any you're gonna you're gonna like this. Let me launch cathode
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:49.560]   Uh, so what it is is a terminal replacement, but it but it's but it's for people who?
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.640]   um
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:55.480]   Have used terminals in the good old days you see first of all let's go full screen on it first of all
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:34:00.760]   It's got it's it's got all sorts of problems like uh scan lines
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:06.360]   Flickering and you can what's nice is you could choose different terminals like here's a 1976
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:10.920]   A monitor which has had a lot of flickering and then I can choose different
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:15.000]   Uh, like here's an amber green screen now. This is actually using
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:18.760]   the apple terminal so it's still i'm actually in terminal
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:20.840]   um
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:27.000]   Is and you can make you know you can I can use different fonts and so forth and I mean this is this really brings back some member
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.640]   That is if using an apple doesn't give you enough of a headache
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:39.320]   Can you draw on all this graphically? Oh, well, it's it's the coolest like a freemium model i've ever seen because you know
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:44.280]   You know how it convinces you to like actually pay the share worthy right? Yeah. Yeah, look at this
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:46.600]   How does it convince you to pay the share worthy?
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:50.680]   Uh, well, you see those if it's the same app that i'm thinking of if you see those scan lines
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:53.480]   Yeah, if you don't pay the share worthy again worse
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:35:00.520]   And still and yet it's still like mimicking a real like bat a real like cathode ray display
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:05.880]   Just like one that's like really messed up and the scan line is off the flyback transformer is about to blow
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.040]   It's like it shifts like that
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:13.240]   This is hysterical now you said did somebody ask for asky art of course you've got asky art
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:20.680]   How about a little bit and you can run this back in all of your uh in all of your different monitors a little bit of
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:25.560]   Geddy get ready for it. I wonder if there's music on it
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:28.600]   It comes with built in the entire
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:35.400]   Star Wars it's taking a little while to load because it's a large file on it on it. It's 300 bottom
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:39.000]   Oh, that's right. It does simulate different modem speeds by the way
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:43.560]   I love the fact that I live in a world in which people make things like this
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:47.320]   This is a full asky
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:51.160]   version of star wars, I mean full the entire movie
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:54.280]   And you can see yes, that is like a 300 bottom modem, isn't it?
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:58.600]   I can change the modem speed if I want on the uh on the menu you get to choose different
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:02.360]   Oh, there's all sorts of fun stuff. Oh, I can even degouse the screen remember this
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:05.080]   There we go
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:12.360]   All right, this is pure nostalgia. There's no reason to spend $10 for this but I can't help it
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:16.200]   Uh, yes, you can play back star wars asky and in terminal effect
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:20.840]   It looks a lot better in terminal than it does here, but this has something nostalgia appeal to it
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:28.600]   It is called let me degouse it again. It looks like we're getting a little magnetic. I want to play war games. Yeah, shall we play a game?
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:31.400]   Uh, nuclear war this is called
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:37.640]   Cathode it is no longer share where maybe there is a share where version still around this is $10 on the app stores
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:42.200]   No share where available on the app store. So maybe with any hope the scan lines don't get any
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:46.920]   I'm sorry. I I might be misremembering with you there. Oh, that sounds like exactly
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:50.440]   You can also run activity monitor if you just want something to fill the screen
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:52.840]   You can run top and see what's
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:58.280]   This is the good old days different bezels to make it a lot of fun
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:03.720]   Andy and aco is the star of the chicago sun times. There's my 286 machine
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:06.360]   Look at that
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:11.320]   Packard bell. Ah, yes. Here's a Commodore. Oh, yeah, look at that flicker
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:15.560]   Uh, he is
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:19.160]   He is
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:23.160]   I feel like I should be making airline reservations and saber with this
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:29.480]   Or maybe making logging into the genie network or compuser. He is the man at chicago
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:36.520]   Sometimes joins us every week for mac rekaweley. We're darn glad about it. He also does a knock-o's almanac on five by five dot tv and
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:39.480]   Somebody said you have a new podcast to you. Is there a new one?
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:46.120]   Yes, old tech news, which is sort of an audiobook edition of my son times column and columns and other things that uh,
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:49.640]   I write for the people so sometime tonight or tomorrow i'm actually going to be recording
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:53.960]   The audio edition of all 6000 words of this uh android switch piece. Wow
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:55.880]   Old tech news
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:38:01.160]   You could usually just like a week or two or sometimes a month of laps between when I record it when I run it's published
