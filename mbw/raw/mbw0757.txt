[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Richie has the week off. Doc rocks in
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.320]   Inform, which is great Alex Lindsay and Andy and Iko also here. It's the end of
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.600]   the line for the HomePod. Doc Scott feels about that. We'll also talk about
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.680]   Adobe's Photoshop AI. They now support M1 and they've added an interesting new
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.200]   feature. We'll also talk about deep fakes, how to
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.840]   detect them and how good they've become. It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:38.320]   news from Apple. The Apple sauce as it were. Alex Lindsey joins us from his lair at office hours.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.600]   Hello, Alex. Hello. Hello. I apologize to you because you are on the low and slow machine.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.560]   We figured of all the people in the world you could take it. I'm getting handicapped.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.600]   You are. So you would look so much better. But then you would put us all the shame.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.880]   So we are replacing. We have four. I guess I can't call them Skype machines anymore.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.520]   They used to be Skype machines for years. It was a connection to source. We'll now call it Zuma
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.720]   source because thanks to you, Alex, I think we're going to be moving to zoom. We tried OBS Ninja.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.880]   There's something weird about our systems. It may be that once we get new new zoom machines
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.440]   on three and four will be all right. But the machine you're on is from 2009. It's got a vintage.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.280]   We have we have pretty good machines at the office that we do the connections with.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.720]   But they're they're Dell. Actually, Dell's these are your own Dell.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.760]   You're with these Dell. 2009. You're a Dell. We are. Are there 2020? Yeah.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.880]   We're going to upgrade. Let's put it that way. That sounds good. We're buying two new ones.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.120]   The others are only a couple of years old. So we figured those are probably all right.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.720]   But yeah, it's CPU bad. I would guess that that has something to do with it.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.360]   CPU and GPU. It'll definitely take that into account. Oh, tell Russell, John, we need decent GPU.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.720]   Or is Intel Iris or whatever the new EVO is? I know the ones that we got had, I think,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.400]   1080 cards in them are maybe 2080 cards in them. So I think that they.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.880]   Geez Louise. Yeah, they were they're real machines.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.920]   I'm going to wait a minute. Let me slack Russell.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.320]   I mean, I can send you that. I can send you the look at what we use.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.240]   It's probably overkill. But what we didn't never wanted to do is explain to a client why they're
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.440]   there. Yeah, I mean, it's your kind of our business. Yeah. So so we, I can, I'm happy to send
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.360]   Russell the speck of what we use. And I got it just from there's a guy named Jeff Keefley that we
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.000]   work with. And I just called him and said, what do you use for your connection machines? And he
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.840]   said this. I copied it because it's all he does is build these out on PCs because I'm not as a
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.280]   PC aware. I will. Yeah. It's good to know that you use those Dell's because that's that's pretty
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.000]   much what we use. That's kind of the stock machine that we use.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.960]   Andy and Ico is also here WGBH Boston. Hello. I know.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.640]   I, you know, I've always favored a handicapping system like in Pro Golf, where like Alex who has
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.840]   like the 24k camera plus like the the pro level like lighting system, he should be limited to like
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.880]   360 kbits and like eight frames per second. Rest people like me who just like order cheap
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.480]   consumer stuff off of Amazon. We should get just to even like the professionalism sort of score.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.240]   I mean, right now I'm getting word we're back in a daylight savings time on or off, whatever it
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.240]   is. At least now I get like I can use like my natural sunlight as a fill light and maybe compete
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.320]   with like you and and Renee and Alex. So this is why I'm like, I'm like a 10. I'm like a 12
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.840]   handicapper when it comes to like video streaming set quality. And you're and you're basically a
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.680]   scratch golfer. So well, I don't know how I don't know how I got I got handicapped when I saw
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.080]   dog's video. He looks amazing. Doc is a YouTuber. That's Doc Rock, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.360]   Doc is crushing it. I love so he's so good. He had a he had a lot on it for a while because he
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.760]   you shoot you shoot in the log for your YouTube. Yeah. Yeah. So I listened to some dude name Alex
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.200]   Lindsey and I find out that you shoot in the log video. What happens? You get better dynamic range
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.400]   for your edit. So when you go to edit, you can like, you know, do better. So try to be color
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.760]   corrected and properly white balanced and now are you are you posting it? Are you posting it?
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:22.800]   In HLG or normally what I do is I go from 2020 to rec 709 at the end just in case because you know,
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.520]   YouTube doesn't depending on the person's browser, YouTube will not properly convert HDR. But if you
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.160]   have, you know, say you're using Chrome browser on a, you know, LG monitor with HDR profiles,
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.880]   it'll be fine. It looks amazing. It looks like the the the HD well and the HDR if you post to YouTube
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.120]   when it comes out, it looks it looks just gorgeous. Yes, it does look good when you do it. But I'm
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.040]   always afraid that like someone's gonna say, well, you look so funny. And I'm like, get it right.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.720]   Right. Right. Yeah. You know, YouTube's you should you should put to let you upload two files. Like
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.760]   here's the HDR or like a slider where people can see like this is what you're missing, right?
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:08.480]   I mean, at least we're getting, you know, proper, what is it, V9 for Safari now. So that's already
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.920]   going to make it better anyway. So Andy, you read any good comic books lately?
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:19.120]   We're getting down. We're gonna like, like, we got a mini office hours going on here.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.520]   All right, as far as we're talking, as long as we're talking, I mentioned that I was gonna get
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.240]   a Mac, I didn't want to get I have an iMac Pro. And now that Apple's discontinued it,
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.200]   obviously the writing's on the wall that I overspent for something that's now obsolete. But
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:43.440]   I was gonna wait maybe get some M1X or M2 or some Mac mini. And then and you guys, please don't yell
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.440]   at me. I decided, well, you know, Linux is almost as good as Mac OS. What if I just got a really
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:07:00.800]   powerful PC? I'm not I'm not about to I'm not about to replace anything with my Macs with a
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.240]   powerful Linux machine. But it really it really has I'm good at using Linux so much on an old Lenovo
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.040]   laptop that I bought at a flea market for 30 bucks and liking it so much that now I'm like,
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.440]   but what if you put just five or $600 into getting like a building a middle of the road,
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.160]   like doesn't even have to be in graphics powerhouse. And just making that giving that desktop parity
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.800]   with a couple of the other operating systems in here. Because if you if people haven't tried a
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:31.920]   modern build like like mint Linux, it is so easy to use it is I think it is I think is in the same
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.880]   weight class as Windows and Macintosh. I don't think it's this is gonna be useful for the same
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.760]   type of people because with Linux, there is still always that point where hi, what how do I do this
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.800]   simple thing? And then you really have to dig to make to make that work, but you can make it work.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.760]   And I just I just like the way I've got my mint Linux setup going on on my Lenovo. So yeah,
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.680]   I don't think you're crazy. I think that so yeah, I will wait a year when I got my video.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.880]   Leo, this is this is what I built the computer over the weekend. Oh, did you? Yeah, look, look,
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:10.880]   there it is. That's a Raspberry Pi. We did the coolest thing on office hours over the weekend. We
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:17.040]   built this as a group. So there was literally 30 of us with 100 people watching and we all built
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.480]   a Raspberry Pi. And that's what's playing out this video is that Raspberry Pi. It's a called
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.920]   Play-out B. It's a little play out. So that was your that was your test video that you sent us.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.720]   Yeah, but it was this is a guy in DarmSala making parades.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:35.280]   So everybody can have some flat bread for breakfast. Is this your breakfast guy?
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.840]   It was. Did he give you Chaimasala as well? No, the chai is neck right next to us. So each booth
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.000]   had its own specialty. And of course, the chai was on the on the chai wall for the chai. You can't
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.640]   just get the parade guy to give me a chai. That's silly. That's crazy talk. Exactly. So it was
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.000]   so I can really do it anyway. Parade that's shy right about now. But yeah, it's funny when you
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.160]   have when you have actually 30 people, at least 15 or 20 people that have multi camera systems
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.120]   that are joined zoom that are all working on these little like literally building this thing out.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.400]   The pies are kind of amazing, aren't they? They are. For the price.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:16.160]   That's and by the way, those are arm chips. That shows you a little bit that you know,
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.600]   arm is not. I think we thought of arm as kind of the oh, that's if you need a lot of power,
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.000]   but a lot of battery life, which I mean power, you know, it's good for phones, I guess.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.400]   Yeah, it's good thinking otherwise. So when I was you get what'd you build Leo or what?
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.040]   Yeah, it's probably not too late to cancel because this is it's going to be two months because it's
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:41.680]   short supply. But I thought, well, if I'm going to get a PC to run Linux, I probably should get
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:48.560]   something so I could try some other new technologies like the AMD Ryzen 7. So I got a 5800X,
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:57.600]   which is a pretty powerful AMD processor, G4 3080. That's what's going to take two months, I think,
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:06.240]   because as are in short supply, 128 gigs DDR4 RAM thing weighs 39 pounds. It's not a it's not a
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:14.480]   Mac mini. And then I went really crazy. I went really bonkers and I got a 55 inch OLED gaming display.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:21.120]   Okay, that's a choice. Doc, am I am I going to I'm thought I'd be my new YouTube channel.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:30.880]   Leo spends all his money in one fell swoop. The 55 inch is the part that just gave it away.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.040]   It's like, I'm just going to build a simple machine for, you know, but I mean 55 inches.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.880]   Okay. Well, I was going to get the super wide one because you know, that's that's the whole
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:44.880]   reason I didn't want to get an iMac anymore is because I want a choice. So I'm I'm this is all
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.080]   alienware stuff from Dell. So and then I thought, well, Dell has a I know, because Lisa has it a very
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.920]   like a 50 inch monitor a wide super wide monitor, 49 inch. But it's but it's narrow. She says,
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.920]   I wish it were go went up to. So then so I thought, so the secret to going up to is to order what's
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:09.440]   known as a 5k 2k. Okay, so for instance, I'm running a 27 inch iMac and then I have a 5k 2k
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.880]   LG sitting here. Then the extra port is connected to the M1 Mac mini because that's the dedicated
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.800]   streaming machine. So you can get wide and tall, but you have to specifically look for 5k 2k.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:28.800]   This is this is a 30. This is a 120 Hertz 38 40 by 2160. I think it's probably just like a TV is
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:36.160]   what it is. Yeah, yeah, that's 4k. Yeah, 4k. Yeah. Yeah. So is that good or no? Should I not get
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.600]   that Doc Rock? No, I think it's amazing. But I just find it hilarious that I'm just going to
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.720]   build it little like utility machine. No, I didn't say this is my main desktop at home.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:52.880]   It's replacing a Mac iMac Pro. Hell of a desk. 52 and I have a big desk. I know I'm not
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.280]   even going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.080]   back here. I don't know. I can cancel it. It was it was at breakfast. I shouldn't I should never
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.280]   order anything at breakfast. You're definitely going to need another one of those chairs.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:10.320]   And then I got the alien where gaming keyboard and mouse because I figured now I can really be
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:15.360]   a youtuber. But you know what I you know in the words of the Wizard of Oz, you know what Doc Rock
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:22.560]   has that you don't have. He's got ring lights. I need ring lights now, don't I? No, I that that
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.520]   one over there is only a fill and I absolutely hate it. Really? My key light my key light is
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:33.120]   really funny because it's a Stella company called Light Emotion. And you know, everyone complains
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:40.400]   about how expensive 120 these are at 700 bucks. That is a $1,500 light. So don't do what I do.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.040]   Well, just buy. I've just put it on my wallet. I'm going to be buying any $1,500.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:51.440]   Yeah. I just thought it's probably time we talk a lot about these, you know, the new
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.720]   rise in chips. We talk a lot about the, you know, the Nvidia new gaming cards. I thought
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:04.720]   I ought to try some ray tracing at home. We'll see. I think I'm a foolish, foolish man. Yes.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:12.000]   I'm announcing on Mac break weekly that I'm buying a PC. And now, now that I think about it,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.560]   I should probably keep windows on it because nothing's going to take advantage of any of
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.800]   that stuff unless it's running in windows. All right, back to Mac break weekly.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:30.080]   Of course, you know, it's going to happen the minute it arrives.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:39.200]   You're in a place of peace and love and safety. Nothing is going to happen in the chat that
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.360]   you don't want to happen. You're just going to discuss some certain decisions and actions.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.480]   I've got some of your friends very, very concernedly and we hope that you'll
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.600]   we'll stick around and we're going to present you with two or three options at the end of the
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:57.760]   conversation that we arrived. Apple's going to announce the M 80, you know, processor and I'll be,
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:03.280]   this is the year of Unix on the desktop. I'm predicting. Oh, thank God. You know,
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.800]   it's not the year of the Apple HomePod. Bye bye HomePod.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.840]   Yeah, I have feelings about this. Do you have the you have all the feels?
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:20.400]   I have all the feels about this. I definitely genuinely love that little beast mode that it is
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:28.000]   for. But after getting my minis and I ordered them. Actually, the last time I was on the show,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:36.240]   we ordered them live and they are freaking amazing. Yes, they do absolutely miss that
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:42.320]   extra base that comes with the big ones. But that basis for me, the other person in my house
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:48.240]   actually likes it without all of the base and it's really incredible. And you can tune it if you
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:54.880]   have room to adjust corner placement, you can kind of get a little extra base out of it by using,
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:00.640]   you know, physics. But the minis are just absolutely incredible. And if you think about it, you can
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:05.920]   buy three of them for $50 more than just one of that. And you just get a better sound, say,
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.560]   in your house. Now they don't they don't do the minis. Don't do the surround
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.440]   solution, right? With the Apple TV. No, they have that. Yeah. Unfortunately.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:24.400]   But you can fake it though. They do left, right stereo. I got so I did the same thing,
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.360]   Doc Ruck. We have two HomePods because Lisa really liked the big, the big boys when they came out.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:35.440]   And I but I ordered five minis to to sprinkle around the house and they sound fine. You're
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.520]   right. They're not super basic. It's not probably I wouldn't want to I mean, I have good stereo to
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:45.040]   listen to music. But for audio books, podcasts, you know, a little background music while you're
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.000]   cooking, it's perfect. Yeah, I know that now that these streaming speakers are kind of streaming
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.560]   table stakes for everybody. I think one of the big things that we've all learned is that it's
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:16:01.200]   cool to have a pair of 600 a single pair of $600 speakers, like in a court in a
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.520]   against the wall or in a corner of the room. But if you have that five or six 80, 90, $100 streaming
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:13.840]   speakers everywhere in the room, that gives you that kind of room filling presence where you feel
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:19.200]   if the quality of each individual speaker is of a certain quality, that's what I'm after. I'm
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:26.640]   not necessarily after, you know, this big like maxel tape sort of tsunami of sound coming from
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:31.760]   from one corner of the room. I kind of want to be able to hear the music wherever I am.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.080]   And that's the sort of immersive thing that you get from it. So that's I it also helps that the
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.960]   many's are really, really good. They're good enough, which is which is something that Apple tends to
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:46.640]   have a problem with that. No, no, no, we don't want the four $500. Amazingly, incredibly
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.880]   best in class speaker. We want something that is good enough that allows us to come home from the
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.760]   mall with three or 400 always in our pocket that we didn't have before. It's so funny that you use
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:01.280]   that analogy. And I'm gonna tell you why, because in my family store, we used to sell B&W speakers,
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:07.120]   Bowers and Wilkins not the car. Oh, well, that is with the diamond the maxel commercial.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.840]   Oh, man. Yeah. So we had a pair of those eight of ones from the maxel commercial.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:19.440]   I currently have five of those set up, not the eight of ones. I have the six series. So I have
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:24.720]   six or two point five's in the front six or ones in the back and in the six hundred series center.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:33.360]   So my music listening experience is that exactly for my I just need to hear the news in the morning
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:40.720]   or listen to you guys are listening to Renee wax, rhapsodically about, you know, Google privacy versus
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:48.400]   Apple. I can have three minis with a house full of Canadian as I walk around and do my stuff in the
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:54.640]   morning. So it's actually okay. I hate to say this and my audio file family would kill me,
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:01.200]   but that sounds better. When you're listening to that content, it actually sounds better on the
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.320]   mini speakers than even piping it through my Bowers and Wilkins because they're not designed for that.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:12.000]   I mean, that's I think that's probably the smart way to think of it is I when I want to listen to
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.080]   quality music, it's not while you're doing stuff. It's when you're going to sit down,
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.960]   have the speakers perfectly positioned, you're going to pay attention and enjoy it for wallpaper
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:27.680]   music. The minis are fine. I agree. I'm probably going to now that they're now that
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.040]   discontinued, probably go out and buy one more because I just want to be able to do it with the
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:36.880]   surround, you know, you need to for the surround or just just just to just to just to and it was
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.240]   kind of interesting that that that that doesn't support it with little speakers because it seems
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.360]   like it would be fun to put them around like little little candles around around what you're
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:49.840]   doing and have them actually work, but it doesn't work. One of the folks in our office hours actually
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:19:01.040]   compared them, you know, having just the two of the home pods with TJ has a he's got 10
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:07.040]   discrete speakers in his in his in his where he watches TV and he said it was 80 percent,
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.560]   like 80 percent of the of the 10 speakers was just those two. It was just kind of amazing.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.280]   And so so it it is an interesting that's the best solution for those. And that's why
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:20.080]   but had it on my list of things to buy, I'll probably buy one just so I have a complete set. But on a
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.560]   day to day basis, our sits in the kitchen and whether it's a little one or the big one, I'm not
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:30.400]   sure it matters for me because I turn it way up. So but it probably doesn't matter to my wife,
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:36.800]   we just constantly asked for timers. That's the number one use of that thing is timers and
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.720]   stacking timers on top of each other and Siri trying to keep track of all the timers.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:46.880]   By the way, that's we talked about that on Sunday. There is a little plateau and voice
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:52.640]   assistance and and what the plateau is really mostly us humans, the humans who use it,
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.920]   which is we just basically use it for timers to ask for a podcast or music. We're not,
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:03.760]   I guess there's a few like super humans that use it to turn lights on off, but it's not really,
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:10.640]   it's not how 9000. My primary is definitely the lights. However, I think the one thing
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.960]   everyone misses about Siri and it's still going to be the case. And I said this over and over,
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.800]   so I'll keep repeating myself. Siri will always suffer because she was originally
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.680]   designed with with the intention of there being a screen there to get you the rest of the answer.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.720]   The other assistants were designed knowing there may not be a screen. So they go deeper and go
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.240]   further. But what everyone does, every person on the planet is they never put in the work to
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.920]   let her fully understand you. You have to talk to her more. So if you dictate notes,
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.240]   if you dictate text messages and things like that, Siri will get better. It's just the way
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.360]   that the system works.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:53.920]   Doc, you lost me it. You have to put in the work. She's very good though. We compare them by
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.880]   asking each service how much wood would a wood chuck chuck of a wood chuck could chuck wood.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.800]   But that's just and that's an Easter egg.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.920]   They have, well, they have, why is it? Ask them to beatbox too. That'll, that'll, that'll give you a nice
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:11.600]   distinction. It's very, very fulfilling that all these companies, Amazon, Google and Apple,
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:16.400]   they have, that's probably on their business cards, Wisenheimer, Siri, Wisenheimer.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.680]   Yes. Like come up with WISAS responses to basic questions.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.240]   We talked about, you know, there's a team that does that, right?
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.000]   Oh, absolutely. Full-time job.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.440]   Has bars. I didn't know this. Ask them, let's give them a wrap. Sorry, I didn't mean to say
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.280]   that. I hope I didn't trigger to his house. Say, say, say, say, say, echo.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.000]   Hey, that's what we, that's what we, that's what we, if you go to rap,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.200]   Scott bars and it's hilarious. I absolutely love it. So that's just a fun Easter egg if you
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:48.400]   haven't tried that yet. So the HomePod, it's interesting because at the same time as just shortly
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.520]   before Apple discontinued the three, well, it was 250 bucks at the end, but it started originally
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:22:01.920]   300 bucks. Google also discontinued his $300 Google Home Max. I mean, I think what the, what really is
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:08.000]   happening in addition to all the things we've mentioned is that people aren't buying expensive
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.480]   speakers. If they are, they're going to get a stereo, they're going to do, they're going to go
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.840]   all the way. If it fits a middle that doesn't exist, there's either the normal people want a
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:25.120]   $100 speaker and the people like Doc Rock who want, you know, BMW 801s. And there isn't somebody
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:30.720]   there who's saying, well, I think $300 for a speaker is a great price. Maybe they're the ones
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:36.080]   are by Sonos, I guess. The little ones are great. Way speakers. So they're great gateway speakers
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:42.880]   and they're not you hear it. And actually, for even the new Echo version at the $99 price tag,
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.440]   sounds pretty decent. All the $100 speakers, Google's at the Amazon's and Apple's are good.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:54.640]   They're not great. And I have a Sony one back there, which is a GA and it sounds fantastic too.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:59.040]   That was a gift. Now, what you have that, and you know what, this is not that bad.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.440]   And I can't get it louder because it's too tiny. But if I double them up because they all have a
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:08.320]   double them up feature, then it'll get better. And so after the second one, you go, wait, I need
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.880]   one for the bathroom and then he won for outside, you know, and this is so you end up with what
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:18.160]   they originally wanted is the network, right? And it wants you have them set up. Similarly,
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.720]   they sound absolutely fantastic. And Sonos is going, where did we go wrong?
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:28.560]   Yeah, Apple, I think Apple made a very, very traditionally Apple mistake in which they tried
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:34.240]   to dictate to everybody what they wanted. And that always comes filtered through Apple's point of
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:40.880]   view, which is, oh, the design is impeccable. If it's for conveying artistic content music,
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:47.840]   the music and the sound has to be impeccable. And even at that point, when this device was introduced,
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.080]   the industry was saying people through what they were buying were saying that no sound really
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:57.520]   isn't the thing sound. This is a speaker that does a lot of different things. We really want a $30
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:03.200]   $40 one so that we can have one in the bathroom too, so that we can send as we're getting ready
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.840]   to go to work. And we're going from like the bedroom to the bathroom to the kitchen, we don't
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.680]   have to keep like switching speakers from one place to another. We can fill the entire room
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:18.240]   with this sort of stuff. And you're absolutely right. I mean, I have in the, in my bedroom,
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:24.240]   my bedroom speakers are Google home Mac speakers. And I only bought them when they were really,
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.080]   really discounted. The first one I bought was like a Black Friday sale at 200.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.560]   Then I bought a second one when they were half off and being discontinued at 150.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:37.040]   But if I were to and having two of these things, the big ones with a big base,
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.800]   that is impressive full immersive stereo. But when I look at that pair on the shelf across from my
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:49.120]   bed, and I think that if I paid list price for these, this would be like a $600 $700 speaker set.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.280]   And then I look at, well, what could you get in terms of real speakers to hook up to,
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.720]   like your actual stereo system, the actual high-fi in the living room.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.760]   And I can almost certainly get something that would kick its butt. I don't understand.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:04.080]   It's hard to get that proposition of, oh, I'll never buy another pair of speakers again,
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:10.160]   because I've got these, these three to $400 smart speakers are going to do it all for me.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:16.640]   It reminds me of when Steve Jobs introduced the iPod high-fi and said, oh, I've gotten rid of all
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.840]   my stereos in my house. All I have is now is this wonderful shoe box sized iPod high-fi
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.240]   to dock my iPod into. It's like you have to listen to what the consumers are telling you.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:33.920]   They were telling Apple, don't give us the $350 $400 big piece of fruit,
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.000]   give us something small that we can put everywhere.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.240]   High-fi high. App had a high-fi was a legendary flop. And I hope Steve got his stereo back.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:49.040]   We used that thing in our shop forever. Like the funny thing is that that,
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.640]   you know what, but people also bought Bose waveform radios. I mean, that doesn't mean it's good.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:59.840]   No, no, I was thinking about it for the years. It was great when we were kind of moving around.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.240]   And then last, I still have my. Yeah, it did.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:08.640]   Might only die not that long ago, but yeah, and to Andy's point, a pair of audio engine
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:15.920]   fives at $399 will definitely pounce those speakers to death. But most people don't think
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.960]   about those anymore. If you check out our Chuck Joyner, he has the audio engine fives in the back.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.320]   And those are in a corner. I think they're great. That's what I use on my computer. I think they're
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:29.040]   with an audio engine sub. And I think that that's a very nice system.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:36.000]   I think you just have to consider what you're using it for. The point though is that well,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.120]   Apple clearly didn't sell a lot of these, right? Or they would have kept them around.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.400]   They spent, remember, they, what do they buy? 10 anechoic chambers and they brought in people
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.160]   and showed them all the experts. Remember all the talk we did about this? They're going to be
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.640]   the best speakers. I'm sorry, Renee's not here. He was like all into this. He got the briefing.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:02.320]   These are going to be a lot of you. Yes. Yeah. And honestly, I was a little skeptical because
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:08.960]   there's physics is physics. With that concise container, for instance, it only had tweeters and
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:14.480]   a low end. It didn't have any mid range speakers at all. There were a lot of things. An audio file
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.840]   looking at that would have said, yeah, no. But for what it wanted, my other issue of what you
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:24.720]   want to do, it's for the purpose, it probably fit, although the $100 one fits better. But
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:31.680]   the other problem is, I think, and I learned this from bitter experiences, Sonos, you don't want
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:39.280]   to put the computer in the speaker. Ideally, you decouple those. If you want good, you can get
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:45.520]   great speakers, great sound. The problem is that the computer, the speakers will last decades.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:51.600]   Yeah, the computers, you don't last a year. I could, I could still wait a time. Right.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:58.400]   Yeah. I still have my iPod high-fi. I still use it. It's a speaker that I've got in the living room
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.040]   for when I lead to physically plug into something. It still sounds great. You're absolutely right.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:10.240]   It's difficult. I had a pair of Sonos speakers that used to be sort of the bridge set of speakers.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:15.760]   But then as soon as the smart speakers came in, I just don't have any use for it. And it kind of
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:24.000]   kills me. I've got this $350 set of gear that I realized that it can be used for other things.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.600]   But it's just so inconvenient and it's kind of inconceivable. And we're going back to
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:35.760]   the power of a copper wire that goes from one standard plug to another standard plug.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.400]   This is something that I've got. I've got tape recorders here that are 30 years old that can
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:45.040]   still work with modern speakers because copper wire going from one standard plug to another
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:50.480]   standard plug. And I'm not sure we're going to find this. And I've got Amazon smart speakers
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.200]   two or three of them just in storage that I just don't know what to do with. They're kind of too
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.240]   nice to throw away. I don't know if I can give them away. But and that's how quickly these things
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:08.640]   die when it's not a standard. Yeah, it's like you want to store all your files in a text-based format.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:15.600]   You kind of want to decouple technology from the stuff you want to survive. You don't want to put
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:22.400]   a browser in a refrigerator as Samsung did because the refrigerator is going to be around for a
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:28.640]   lot longer than you're going to want to update them. And that's also why I don't care about
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:34.720]   computers in my cars. And I got an iPad for that iPhone. You're not going to. It's not ever
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:41.920]   a car play or Android Auto is the best thing ever. I have a brand new car. But I can but it will
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.560]   be updated every time I get a new iPhone and every time I add apples up taste car play and then all
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:52.240]   the stuff I want including GPS and directions are coming from my phone. It's exactly the way to do it.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:58.320]   See, I find that the screen on the Honda that we have is great because the suction cup for the phone
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.880]   fits right on. It just pops right on and it just you know, let's want to get on. I just like,
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:08.320]   look, look, there we go. This Ford has a Tesla style big screen. You could put a couple,
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.880]   you could suction cup a couple of things. Yeah, exactly. You have an iPad and an
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.880]   I a couple of really like I love car play. I have to say that every time I get a car.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.320]   Car play is legit. And I have wire. It's wireless now. So it's projecting. So
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:26.240]   and it's got a Qi charger. So, you know, I mean, it's like, I should live in this car. It's got the
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:33.120]   best set of anything I've got. It's kind of funny to me when I think about it and any just
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:38.480]   have it a point home that I guess I use all the time without thinking about it. But I have a Fisher
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:43.120]   X 102 BAM right there next to my feet. It keeps the feet warm and it gets cold and office.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:47.920]   Wow. When I really want to sit down and listen, I have an amplifier that's yeah,
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:55.600]   old as me. Yeah. I think it's as old as I am. And it sounds great. As a matter of fact,
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:03.200]   sounds absolutely incredible. And I have two like 1972. Marantz pieces and preamp sitting
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:08.080]   right there in the back room that I'm building new cabinets for. And again, they sound absolutely
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:13.600]   incredible. And if I bust those out, first of all, people like, what is that? Why are you glowing?
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.960]   Is it going to inspire? And I'm like, give it five minutes to you, you know, and then listen.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:24.640]   And then like, oh, I didn't know that. I said, why? The reason why all of this is going away to,
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:34.240]   I believe, something we did in touch on the AirPods and the AirPod Max and the bull situations
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:40.880]   and all the other things like that, are allowing a house say of five for every individual person
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:46.880]   to have the experience that matches them. When we were children, we had to listen to with dad
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.360]   and pop up with listening to. Yeah. Okay. Enough. I got a cod if dad. I've had enough.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:57.840]   Right. It depends on what your person listened to, right? What did your dad listen to? I had jazz.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:02.720]   I had classical. That's okay. I had for you. You know, singer songwriters, you know, like,
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:10.160]   the 60s. I'm especially, it wasn't Lawrence. Well, at least. No, like, I didn't have tiny bubbles in
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:16.320]   my wine. Actually, that's Don Ho. That's from here. Sorry, people from here. But yeah, like,
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:22.560]   having a wide eclectic music taste and then listening to vinyl and I was taught to understand those
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:27.520]   nuances and can you hear the fingers on the fretboard and this particular system? Okay,
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:31.680]   let's change the needle. Look, you still hear this all right? Yeah. But do you hear the finger
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:37.360]   slide on the fretboard? We should do not. We should explain Doc Rock's family owned a stereo store.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:44.240]   So I mean, I learned, right? So when we take apart a satryani, like, I understand what I'm
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:49.040]   listening to. And nowadays, no one talks about music like that. And it kind of makes sense because
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:53.680]   the listening experience is not going to give you that. Maybe the max is might, but a lot of the
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:59.520]   other stuff is not just going to do that. So now that everyone has this sort of fractured,
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:05.120]   like individual listening experience in the house, there's no longer need for that one
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.920]   gorgeous centerpiece with the glowing and serious thing in the top. Yeah. You know,
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.680]   unless you can get headphones that sound, everybody's good as those B and W eight,
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:18.000]   Oh, once well, maybe not everybody's good, but not every bit, but close enough. Really close.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.200]   Yeah. Yeah. We should mention also parents let you go ahead. We should. I just want a
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:28.880]   programming note. You probably said, what happened to Renee? He's not gone. He's taking the day on.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:34.080]   I'm going to say a boat. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Doc's here filling in for Renee because as Renee
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:39.120]   explained last week, but I know everybody's and listen to every show, he had already made a
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:44.000]   prior agreement and couldn't get out of it. So I think personally, he's getting briefed by
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.680]   Apple about next week's event, but that's just, no, no, no, he's I checked his Instagram. There
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:54.160]   is no picture of him like picks no picture of his Apple watch with with their report and structure.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.240]   Oh, all right. Don't worry. I did grill him on a live stream this morning, and he didn't answer.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.600]   He cracked all the rest of the jokes. But he didn't answer that question. He didn't.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:10.400]   So that's interesting. Okay. It hasn't has the has the event been announced yet. There's
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.840]   nobody got an invitation, right? I'm the wrong guy.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:20.880]   So I was going to say you did it, Leo. Actually, I guess they don't have to
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.000]   be streaming them. They've actually invited me because they figure, well, what can he do?
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.320]   We're already streaming it. Can't screw this one up. He's going to come in wax
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:35.040]   rhapsodically about Raspberry Pi's and Linux machines. Yeah, that's right. Have you heard about the
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:40.720]   rise in lately? You know, that would fit. No, because he denied it a couple of weeks ago that
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:45.920]   he did that week off forever. He did. So so if it turns out that that was a lie, we should spend
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.320]   the first half first hour again talking about Linux talking about Raspberry Pi talking about
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:55.120]   speaking about them saying all of the stuff he's an expert on. He doesn't even have any opinion on
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.760]   I'll talk about my I'll talk about love and rockets. The the comic from the 80s that I've been
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:05.360]   bringing back into it. He's Canadian. He might not have heard of it. He'll say, hey, but don't you
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:11.600]   want to know about the ear tags? No, no, no, no, that too. Yes, yes, yes. You do want to know
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.920]   about the ear tags. So I'm just I'm logging in. I'm sorry. I have to press my ube key because I'm
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:25.360]   logging in to see if I got an invitation at my work address, my work email. But now I've hung
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   the computer. So I guess I won't. Nothing's happening. Oh, well, you be keep broke it. Okay, never mind.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:41.280]   You did anybody invitations? Anybody? Anybody see the tweeters? Nine. They would do it by now,
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.400]   wouldn't they? If they were going to do something? They don't have to because if they're going to
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.360]   if they're going to put on a video, they could tell you three days ahead of time. You're not going
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.200]   anywhere because it's all you're going to get to be a drop. Yeah, good point. Although you're
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:57.040]   going to use zoom and have like the Alex Lindsey set up where we were just sitting in the gigantic
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:02.720]   500 person zoom room. Yeah, maybe we won't have a an event next Tuesday.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:11.280]   Maybe it'll be the 30th. Yeah, sure. They'll be one in large, right? I'd be surprised if there
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:17.440]   wasn't. It's they've got so many things in the pipeline right now that are it's air tags are
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.840]   the tip of the tip of the iceberg that I mean they could do things in April as well. But you have to
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.600]   think about how they want to space these things out. Right. There's certainly we're going to have
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:31.040]   some you would think that they were definitely have some hardware announcements big ones at WWDC,
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:36.160]   even a virtual one in June. That means that you want to have some air between whatever I have to
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:42.560]   imagine there's going to be at least two product releases product announcements between now and then.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:46.800]   And it just seems as though March would be the best time to do one of those, particularly something
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:52.080]   like air tags, which is a brand new be go out and get it right now. It only costs 50 bucks or
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.560]   whoever much Apple's going to be charging for this thing. And then after that, you kind of want
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:02.160]   to have a little bit of a room to talk about a new iPad. So who knows it's a different world.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:08.560]   As Alex has been saying, it's a great it's a great time for a company to decide that just as Apple
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:14.640]   untethered itself from the January mackerel expo keynotes and started to set their own agenda of
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.800]   when they they would have to make major announcements. Now when they're not even tied to having to,
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:24.800]   you know, we need to get 80 gallons of coffee in this room stat to get for all the all the
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.840]   unwashed press people who we have to bring in for keynote. All all things are on the table now.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:36.800]   And at the right, Apple is releasing things. It probably, you know, becomes a really long keynote.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.920]   If you don't, if you don't, if you don't, regularly, you're going to break it up.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:43.920]   Means WWDC would get to be, you know, oh, we have all these things you want to do. So it seems like
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:48.480]   they they would want to do something before that. You can thank me. I bought that AMD computer.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.200]   So that they'd have something really great to know. Thank you, Leo. Yes. It's perfect.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:57.360]   I'm gonna have to read my ad off the phone.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:08.320]   This thing is this thing's dead. It's dead, Jim. So much for PC. Man, I tell you,
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.680]   we could Alex can, if I bought an iMac, excuse me, you see, the reason we like this is because
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:18.320]   this screen can tilt out of the shot. So I have a nice, I have a screen in front of me, but it's
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:23.040]   not blocking me. It's like tilted like this. Yeah, if I bought an iMac, can I take the stand up,
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:28.880]   put a visa man on it and somehow get it mounted like this? Yep. Or maybe get a Mac mini and get a
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:34.640]   nice 50, 55 inch computer, right? Just get the 80 inch, Leo. Come on. Yeah.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:42.240]   The whole table is a monitor. Microsoft Surface. Microsoft Surface. Get one of those wall mounted
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:48.480]   Microsoft Surface things and just make it the table. That's a great thought. All right. I guess
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.240]   when you buy a card now, that's how they have you sign all the papers. They have this giant
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.920]   like surface in a table and you sign everything. It was kind of crazy.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:01.840]   All right. Let me open up. That's that's when you know you've been screwed. Like, wow,
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:07.440]   you can afford to have this $80,000 Surface table instead of just putting something off of a printer
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:12.320]   and making me sign it. I'm guessing that the financing you offered me was not to my advantage.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:21.520]   Well, it's at BMW. So it kind of matched. Okay, there you go. All right. Let's take a little
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:27.280]   break more to talk about since my computer boots up. This is why you keep you buy a Mac. Okay.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:33.120]   Just I'm just saying our show today brought to you by the coffee right here.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:38.160]   IT Pro TV. It's really small. Fortunately, I know a lot about IT Pro TV. They started
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:44.880]   advertising with us when they first began back at what 2013. It was actually so I feel like a
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:52.240]   little proprietary over this company. The founders Tim Broome and Don Pazette were IT trainers.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:56.880]   The kind of guys you have classrooms and they teach you what you need to know to get the
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:03.040]   A+ certificate or the MCSE certificate so you can get that first job in IT. Those certificates
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:08.080]   are really helpful if you're just getting into IT. When they came to the National Association
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:13.680]   of Broadcasters Show, I think this is round 2012, I was on a panel. It was with Adam Corolla,
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.440]   as I remember, and some other guys. All of us were doing like streaming stuff.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:23.680]   Don and Tim said, "Hmm, what if we did what we're doing in a classroom but we did it
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:29.440]   like Twit. We did it alive. Of course, they did it much better than Twit because now they have
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:35.280]   seven studios in their Gainesville headquarters open Monday through Friday, 8am to 6pm.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:40.800]   The reason they have to record new material all the time is stuff changes. The quiz, the test
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:46.000]   questions change, the certificate questions, but also new versions of products. They're always
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:53.200]   keeping up to date and that's the beauty of IT. It's kind of an endless growth in terms of the
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:58.720]   kinds of things you need to know. IT Pro TV is great not only for people who want to get those
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:05.120]   jobs, get those first jobs, but for people already working in IT because you can continue to learn,
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.840]   continue to add to your skills, make yourself a better employee, make yourself a more desirable
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:15.600]   employee. March is Cisco month at IT Pro TV. That means they're going to be featuring their 12
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:21.760]   Cisco courses. Those are very popular certs. The CCNA, CCNP, CCT, NCOR, Roncor,
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:29.360]   Sled, and RC. Those are those are certs people really want. You check out their Cisco webinar.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:35.280]   They did it earlier this month, I think on the 11th with Cisco award winner Dave Bombal,
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:42.480]   but it's online. It's called Get Hands On with Cisco. You can view it on demand at itpro.tv/webinars.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:47.840]   That's free by the way. Also free their Technado podcast with Don Pazette featuring industry
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:55.360]   guests and IT news recaps. It's a deeper dive into the IT realm. IT Pro TV, look at all these
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:00.320]   courses. It's amazing. Now there are a number of different subscription levels. There's IT Pro

[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:04.960]   week if there is an Apple event. Just to recap, I'm not going to go into it. AirTags for sure.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:13.120]   A new iPad Pro featuring mini LED technology may be better LiDAR for sure. And of course,
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:20.880]   the new 8, what is it, a 14X? Is that what they're going to call it? A new chip. We also think
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:26.960]   there might be this a little less certain. There might be a new Apple TV, which would make me very
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:33.120]   happy. But not any new Macs. This wouldn't be a Mac event this month.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:40.080]   Yeah, probably not to WWDC. What are they going to do in WWDC? Is that going to be when they announce
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:47.600]   iMacs? I think that that's when they put on the table the super high power
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:54.720]   M1 chip. Super high power Apple Silicon chips, because what we saw at the end of 2020 was proof
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:59.360]   of concept. Very functional proof of concept. But it wasn't there to convince people who are using
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:04.720]   Macs to do really, really high power computing that this is something that they're going to want
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:10.000]   to switch to one of these three models. This is the time for them to come out with either iMacs
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.480]   with iMacs and Mac minis with next generation CPUs or next generation designs that really,
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:23.440]   really push the button of. We've already proven that the Apple Silicon is as compatible and faster
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:27.840]   than whatever we would have put in there that had an Intel label on it. Now we're here to
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:33.120]   press the advantage of why we made this switch to begin with. The things that we can now do in
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.560]   terms of power and functionality that we would not be able to do in June of 2021 if we're still
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:45.920]   on Intel. I think the third wave will be the equivalent of the Mac Pro. There's the rumors of
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:50.080]   something like a Mac Pro Mini, which it would be right up my street.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:54.320]   Yeah, that's the one I'm going to really regret buying this AMD processor.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:45:03.040]   If they do a Mac Pro Mini with say, I don't know, it could have 16 or 32 cores. It could have
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:10.960]   another 16 or 32 GPU cores. Just the mini form factor with whatever the chip is
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:16.000]   that I'm putting into the iMac. Swappable storage, swappable RAM would be huge.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:20.320]   And more RAM, many more RAM. What do you need for RAM, Alex? What do you get for RAM?
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:26.880]   Most of the machines that I get are still not more than 32. I usually do
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:33.840]   the little Mac Mini's have or eight. 16. Yeah, I mean, it's the little Mac Mini's that we have.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:39.040]   I just don't use them for heavy lifting. Most of the stuff does 32. I've got a couple with 64
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:44.720]   gigs of RAM. And then so far when we've gone over that, we actually go to AWS.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:51.360]   So like, you're like AWS, you can line up 256 gigs of RAM with a couple graphics cards
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:57.200]   and get these big machines and just throw a problem at it. So we haven't needed those on
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:02.080]   a day-to-day basis, and it's just cheaper to do it in the cloud. So with Final Cut,
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:10.400]   with Final Cut running on the M1 Mini, I had a gig. And I'd never ran into a single problem.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:10.800]   Really?
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:16.720]   Only place where you would run into a problem would be if you had the type of plugin that did
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:21.520]   some high-level procedural stuff, but even the tracking plugins and all of the above,
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:26.800]   you're basically color-correct tracking, titling, things like that, not a single issue.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:34.000]   I did return that and get a 16. And I did it for one reason only. And it is slightly faster.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   It's not something that you can notice on an everyday basis. It's again, when you do something
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.240]   really difficult, like it powers through it slightly quicker because there's more space to think.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:48.720]   But I primarily got a 16. It's because when this space-grade version of a mini comes out,
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:54.240]   that's kind of pro. This will sell easier because it has 16. And people don't understand
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:58.480]   the, you know, the common unified memory. I was going to say common memory.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:02.240]   The reason people don't understand unified memory and how it works. So the number would just make
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:08.080]   more sense. But it's so hard to explain to folks, you cannot compare your Intel memory
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:13.840]   paging to this level of memory. It's completely different Xbox in PlayStation,
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:18.400]   been doing it for years. And no one talked about it. Apple does it and the whole world's going to
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:24.480]   melt. Well, and the thing is, is that the Apple has to keep moving quickly because
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:28.960]   all a lot of us, I mean, I was, I was in this, I'll get to buy some Intel machines before
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.880]   these little toy machines come out. Before the M1, I was like, Oh, I'll just, I better,
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:37.440]   I better invest or be ready to invest in Intel machines because this transition is going to be a
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:42.720]   mess. And as soon as the M1 mini came, you know, a Mac mini came out and especially after we got
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:47.440]   one and tested it, it was like, okay, we're not buying any more computers. We're just going to
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:51.760]   wait now. We're just going to wait until we see what because you could just extrapolate very quickly
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:57.760]   where the iMac and where the Mac Pro and where the MacBook Pro is going. And so I think that now,
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:02.880]   while there's been this huge surge and the Apple can experiment with this because
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:08.960]   such a small part of their income. But, but a lot of us now aren't buying, I mean, I know a lot of
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:13.120]   people that aren't buying any machines right now because they're just waiting to see what the M1s
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:18.560]   look like at the iMac and MacBook Pro. I think that I mean, what I'm interested to see is if at
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:25.040]   WWDC, they give us a preview of like, here's the speed of the Mac Pro. You know, like, here's what's
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:29.760]   coming out. I mean, because they obviously know what it is. But yeah, whether they'll show it to us
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:34.400]   or not, it'll be interesting. The most impressive thing to me, and I think this is really hard to
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:39.600]   understand, but it's just because it doesn't make a zero bit of sense. What I'm streaming to you
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:47.280]   from right now is a fully loaded 2020 iMac. This is $4,600. That thing right there at $8.99
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:55.280]   on most tasks are faster than this. The only time again that I run into at the end, when I'm adding
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:04.400]   the final conversion from, you know, BT 2020 to Rec 709 color correcting and rendering this one
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:09.840]   renders a little bit faster. And I mean, not 10 minutes faster. I mean, like a minute, minute and
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:17.840]   a half faster, so negligible. So had to do it all over again. I honestly straight up would buy like
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:23.200]   three or four of these as opposed to this. And I mean, yes, we're not equating the monitor and
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:27.520]   the mouse and keyboard and all that. Most of the people on this show, most people listening to this
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:33.200]   show have been Mac users for so long. You already have mouse and keyboard and monitor. So take that
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:40.640]   excuse out your face. This thing is stupid, fast, and I am waiting. And you will agree with me
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:46.720]   for the Celtics green iMac. I don't need it. Just want you want a green iMac. Yeah, that's the rumor
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.640]   whatever. What if it had a parquet floor?
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:50:02.560]   So Leo, really? So, well, you said Celtics green. I'm curious if you would ever consider doing what
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:08.880]   Alex does, which is cloud editing or cloud. If you see, I feel like we don't have to call it
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:13.600]   editing. This is usually like a calculation. Like I got a we got we're going to look at a cloud
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:17.600]   editing. We're looking because you know, we're using windows for editing. I apologize. But on
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:23.200]   Dell Precision Workstations, but after the fires last summer, we've set it up so that we could spin
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:31.200]   up a cloud compute instance that has GPUs that has lots of RAM. You probably have to do an EDL
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.880]   back and forth because you don't want to upload the giant files and stuff like that. I don't know
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:40.560]   how you do it. But we want to do that so that their editors at home can or anywhere can edit
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:46.240]   in the cloud. I think that's the certainly the wave of the future on the PC side.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:51.040]   I mean, for video, we're not doing that. We're doing calculations, you know, like throwing stuff
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:55.280]   up there to do calculations. But the same idea. I mean, the only issue is that they don't have to
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:00.720]   interact with the files. Yeah, frame rate. So frame rate going coming back to frame rate and
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:06.880]   interactivity and latency becomes a thing. Really? And so really? Well, I mean, you could play video
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:12.480]   games from the cloud now. Yeah, yeah, but it's not can you do it all the time and will it be accurate
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:17.120]   and will it you know, like it's not? Anyway, I haven't found it to be as snappy. So it's not
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:23.280]   there. And so it's you as ISPs continue to do what they do. US ISPs are like holding back and
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:27.920]   like holding data and like making up stuff that doesn't exist because there's countries in the
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:34.560]   world that, okay, here's a prime example. And Alex will know this. Go to Japan, right? And you
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.800]   go into the airport when you first get your bags, walk over to the counter, rent a device this big.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:48.320]   And it will spit you 175 megabits per second up and down for $7 a day. They're walking anywhere
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:53.120]   in the country underground in the train 300 miles an hour in the same concept that suckers
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:59.440]   connected 10 devices lightning fast over here. Oh, you're going over your data this month. So
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:04.560]   you're going to slow you down. Man, I want to reach over there. Randolph, Steve is in. If I can meet
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:13.200]   you at the bar, brother, you're talking about the CEO of AT&T. And I think that with if you have a
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:17.200]   fast connection, I think that you absolutely can do it. I think that I've tested it at home and I'm
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:22.080]   kind of like, Oh, it's good. It's good. It's not it's not like being there. It's it's it's it's really
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:27.200]   close. But but with a, you know, an industrial connection, probably it's probably very close to the
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.960]   to being able to do it. So we should mention if you if you Carl Randall Stevenson these days,
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:37.280]   he's going to say, I'm retired. I'm actually on the beach down the road from you a little bit.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:44.240]   It's now John stanky and I just like saying his name. So I'm going to say it again is now
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:50.720]   CEO of AT&T is now John stanky. Okay. So let's talk about I think Legerica fight. So I don't want
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.880]   to call anybody that's brave enough to wear magenta chucks.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:02.320]   He also is retired. You got to get with it. You're telecom executives. They've all moved on, my friend.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:08.720]   They've all moved on. Let's talk about the M1 because a couple of things happened this week
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:17.760]   that I think made Mac users very, very happy Photoshop now is optimized for Apple Silicon.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:22.320]   Well, some some of it is. Oh, tell me about that. Not all of it. Yeah, there's a couple of
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:28.400]   the I read the headline. I must have missed the details. Yeah, I mean, I think that I was there's
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:32.560]   some other stuff that we were talking about. I think an office hours where but but it's it's that
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:37.760]   most of the app has been the core app and most of the app has been released. There are definitely
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:41.040]   some cycles that they're still working on, but they said they didn't want to hold it back. Is it
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:46.640]   plug-ins that are? Well, there's there's a lot of code. It's it's not just it's there's a lot of
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:51.040]   code in there that there's some pieces of it that are older architecture that's going to just take
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:56.000]   a little longer. So rather than make everybody wait for them to get all that done because the
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:02.800]   reality is is that 95% of the Photoshop users aren't going to use those things. So so so I think
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:06.880]   they were they felt safe enough to they had to make the caveat that hey, we're not completely
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:13.920]   done with it. It's not one to one shows you 95% that Apple's notion that oh, you just flip a switch
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:20.720]   on Xcode and now you're compiling a universal binary that for modern. Well,
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:26.000]   I was at work today day one. There was a work day one which is good. Yeah. Yeah. We're talking
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.520]   about having to refactor for absolutely every process that's in a giant app that's been around
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:38.320]   for 30 years is it's not a monoling thing. Yeah, it's a thing. Yeah. And so so it it you know and a lot
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:43.120]   of apps. I mean, that's what we're seeing kind of some little places where it's not working perfectly
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:49.440]   are smaller apps that don't have a big, you know, programming staff or haven't had a programming
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:55.200]   staff for two or three years. You know, those and some people are using their code for their
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:00.000]   virtual camera or their something else and that you know, that's taking a little bit longer. So it's
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.960]   a lot of these dependencies that the people are trying to, you know, kind of tie up before before
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:10.720]   they move over. They also updated Photoshop for the iPad, which is of course always been compatible
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:16.160]   with Apple Silicon. Have you tried the new Adobe camera raw super resolution feature or anybody
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:21.760]   in the office hours? Try that. Haven't tried it yet. I'm seeing just a few have tried it. I have
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:27.520]   it at home. I should really try it. The idea is it it effectively doubles the resolution even
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:35.840]   of a 40 megapixel or 60 megapixel image using put it in scare quotes AI to figure out what those
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:42.000]   in between pixels are. But I have heard some people say it's really impressive but nobody's
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:49.120]   played with it. Scaling technology has gotten really good. Yeah. I mean, it's just built into
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:55.120]   your TVs now and so it's so it being able to analyze those things. If you give the
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:56:01.680]   algorithm enough data to work with, it can figure out a lot of things. So I've definitely seen some
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:08.240]   of what Adobe's done with basically being able to, you know, the smart replacement tools are
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:14.880]   mind blowing, you know, of what it figures out. Yeah. So all I have is Adobe samples,
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:21.520]   but I can give you an example. This is from Adobe's blog. This is a panorama. It's kind of an
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:27.040]   interesting choice. It's basically snow on trees. So it's black and white, mostly white,
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:34.400]   but it's enhanced with super resolution. The inset images show crops zoomed in. So one to one
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:42.560]   crops. And as you can see, you could see some softening, but it's pretty surprisingly good,
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:49.120]   given that this is this is doubled the pixel density. It's incredible. I've had to go back to a lot
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:54.720]   of the pictures I took with my second or third digital camera and which were a little too soft
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:57:00.800]   to really want to print anything more than like, you know, postcard size and like, damn, it's not
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:07.120]   perfect. But for, but you would have to really be a nitpicker in order to see the difference between
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:15.040]   this like 2002 picture that has been then further processed in Photoshop and then with that extra
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:19.840]   data, given the usual enhancements you would do with high resolution image. And now suddenly,
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:25.200]   I have a much, much better picture selfie of myself with my dad who died 10 years ago than I did 10
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:30.880]   years ago. It is mind-boggling. Michael Sargent, who's in the chat room says he's tried it,
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:35.360]   but he says it's not that different from what you can get on pixel-made or photo on an iPad Pro.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.960]   So, you know, I'll have to compare that. Here's another image from the Adobe blog.
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:41.920]   I was just going to tell you to pull that image up because that's the one as we
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:46.480]   called our head to the Biscuita or bicycle cards. If you pull that one up, that's the one that kind
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:51.920]   of shows it the best I think. So, if you've used Photoshop before or any resolution enhancing
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:58.000]   technology, you're familiar with bicubic resampling. That's what's on the left. On the right is the
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:03.200]   super resolution. And it's clear that they've improved on these other systems that we, you know,
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:08.480]   the dithering systems and so forth that we've had in the past. Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to see it
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:14.960]   against some like dedicated, because a lot of dedicated scaling plugins do a pretty good job.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:19.840]   And so, I think it would be probably less dramatic. It might be better, but it would be less dramatic.
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:23.280]   There's been some, I can't think of the name of them at the office, I thought my head, but some
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:28.480]   scaling plugins that are available for Photoshop that really specialize in that bicubic is really
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:34.720]   old. Yeah, that's true. So, you're going, okay, well, I mean, it's good for AB, but if they say,
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:39.040]   this is the best plugin that's made for Photoshop that does scaling or, you know, and then this is
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:44.160]   ours, that would mean more to me than showing me something that they wrote in 1991. Yeah.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:50.720]   Yeah. Yeah. It really does, it really makes you think about where our society's comfort zone is
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:58.640]   going to be in terms of synthetic improvements to imagery versus optical straight straightforward
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:04.320]   numbers and numbers out sort of improvements. I was, I was watching a video about an academic
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:11.440]   paper about a technique for synthesizing photorealistic faces based on just one single view.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:18.240]   And it's very, very clever the way it works. But the end result isn't that it pulls a 3D model,
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:23.840]   it's just that it keeps adjusting all the parameters of its own algorithms until it senses that it
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:29.920]   has a set of parameters that can generate this face, then it matches the input source picture.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:34.400]   And so we're not very far away from having the kind of a power in Photoshop where,
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:40.240]   let's say that you've got a picture of the picture of, again, me and my dad, and
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:49.040]   let's say that there is, it was a selfie and it's missing like part of his face. But because of this,
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:55.840]   this, because of this algorithm, it can create a really, it can synthesize what this head look
[00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:02.480]   and face looks like in 3D and restore synthetically what's missing from the image. Will, will we be
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:09.760]   okay with the idea of this is not really my dad's forehead corner? This is a computer's guess at
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:15.760]   what it is, but it gave me a usable picture. It's the, I was thinking of that recently because I just
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:25.600]   find this, I'll make this quick, that when you have the heritage, that AI filter that can take a
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:30.720]   static photo of one of your old relatives and turn it into just like an animated face that's like
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:36.880]   blinking and smiling. I have used it on like press photos from Hollywood stars in the 30s and 40s.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:42.880]   I have not used it on like my mom or my dad, no, ever will I because I don't want my memories of
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:49.920]   them to be contaminated by an algorithmic guess as what my dad's smile or what my mom like turning
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:53.840]   in blinking look like. It's something that society really has to think about it.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:59.440]   Yes, and you know what is going to come into play to, I think, you know, we immediately go to the
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.760]   Photoshop's in that because well, that's the industry standard. But when you think of apps like
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:10.240]   Rifex and 1B, which everyone thinks they're kind of jokes, the technology is going to help out a
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:16.080]   lot when it comes to law enforcement, missing cases. You know, like I remember on a,
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:21.520]   strangely enough a show that Leo did way, way, way back in the day when I saw the first lady
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:28.000]   constructing a clay head out of putting the little things on it. And then they wrapped it on and
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.440]   we were all flabbergasted and how it would help them find a missing person. Now you imagine what
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:39.440]   we're going to be able to do with a single image and aging them and trying to find, you know,
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:44.880]   has anybody seen this person that they're going to be roughly 32 years old now and this is what
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:50.000]   they should look like. And oh my God, it's going to crazy for like this person would look like like
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.120]   a scary clown or a woman or right. Because that's mostly by the way, that's what's driving
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:01.280]   refacing all of these. It's TikTok. It's not being driven by police work, I don't think.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:04.080]   Which is right. It's there.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:09.520]   The tech is there. This is reface a reface.ai. It's an iPhone or Android phone. So you take a
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:15.920]   picture of your face, you then apply it to another body and you could be, is that how they do the
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:24.320]   Tom Cruise guy? I wonder. Oh, there's so many. I did that Brittany one and I did the Beyonce one
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:29.920]   and it's super scary. I'll see you as Beyonce. Yeah. Oh, I'll send it to you. It's super scary.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.760]   That's turning. That's taking lemons and turning them into. Well, have you seen
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:59.220]   Rock
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:08.820]   Star? I mean, it's amazing. Yeah. One thing to say is that it's going to, it's also going to
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:14.340]   probably avoid using video or photos as evidence within the next decade. So you're not going to be
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.700]   able to, it's going to, at first we'll say, Oh, we really need to figure out some way to
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:21.060]   authenticate it. And then you're just going to get to a point where you can't prove it to a jury.
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:25.780]   You know, you can't get a jury to believe just because you had an image or a video of that person
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:32.660]   that that means anything in the same way that DNA was absolute a couple decades ago.
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:39.380]   And now, you know, jurors know better. They know that there's chain of custody. They know that
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:45.940]   there's all these other things that occur that brings doubt back into the system. And the question
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:50.180]   is when does it get to reasonable doubt? And so, all these technologies are also going to make it
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:54.500]   much harder for law enforcement because they can't just use, here's a photo of that person walking
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.260]   through. No one's going to believe that anymore.
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:04:02.660]   Well, there's their forensic tools are going to catch up. They always do the same reason why
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:07.300]   I can't just simply create a fake header for an email and say, Oh, well, Alex sent me this email,
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:12.180]   which he promised to pay me $80,000 for 10 minutes of work. That's like, okay, well, let's take a look
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:18.580]   at these headers. Like, okay, it seems as though Alex was emailing from Croatia and it helped
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:25.460]   through these other things. That's what I really want to see is that this is when I get my first
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:29.780]   thing I'm going to do when I get like an M1, a really, really powerful Mac or a really, really
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:34.980]   powerful desktop is I really, really want to do a deep fake in which you take all of these movies
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:41.140]   in like Amadeus where F. Murray Abraham plays like 78 year old Sally area, but also like 34
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:45.860]   year old like his own, his real age, Sally area in the past. And I want to do a deep fake in which
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:52.260]   we take his now currently 78 year old face and we replace like the makeup with the real thing
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:56.500]   and see exactly how that works. Like, also with Back to the Future, which you because they never,
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:00.500]   they never make them look, they always make them look horrible because now we see Michael J. Fox
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:04.660]   and everybody else and they look great. Like, and they're 10 years older than they were like
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:08.500]   supposed to be in their late 40s with all that makeup. They're not, they're not as like
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:15.380]   weather beaten and haggard as the makeup artist made them out to be. You've seen though the like
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:21.940]   Scorsese is the Irishman where they de-aged Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci and it was
[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:29.540]   a great well, so that's not using deep fakes. That's that's actually CG. So that was really
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:33.540]   tracking it. Yeah, that wasn't I don't know that wasn't deep fakes. In fact, some people have put up
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:40.260]   some of the ones that are more in that they put up deep fake versions of that movie,
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:43.780]   which I think actually look better than I mean, they don't look perfect. They're not seamless,
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:51.540]   but they the feeling of them looks better than here I am is a Rocky. Yeah, that looks like me.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:58.580]   I don't know. Some some there is a there's some special effects people use desktop software to
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:04.020]   remember when the rock was in one of the mummy sequences, the scorpion king and the
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:10.260]   the CGI version of the rock was it was like Sony PlayStation quality graphics, but in a feature
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:15.380]   film, and they just spent a scorpion. Thank you. And so these two or three guys like spent an
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:20.660]   entire day just like redoing it all with deep fake and it's like, okay, that's better. It's like
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:25.380]   just so it's just a bunch of people who had nothing better to do in the afternoon than create a video
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:30.100]   that hopefully we get a couple of million clicks actually did actually fix this thing that is
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:37.380]   so distractingly bad. That's people I learned. I was gonna say what people have learned
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:43.140]   is by doing those quote unquote waste of time deep fakes and stuff and on YouTube, they get hired
[01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:50.900]   by the CT houses. It is one of the best job applications. I won't say better than you know,
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:56.980]   spending all your money at full sale, but it's getting close there. I just saw a story.
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:02.820]   Oh, and I can't remember it was a, I think Carnegie Mellon had figured out one way to detect deep
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:09.460]   fakes in portraits anyway. And I imagine it could be extended to other things. And they were about
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:17.140]   94% accurate was to look at the eyes and to make sure if the lighting didn't match in the two eyes,
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:23.460]   right? So I'm thinking that as we get better at deep fakes, we'll get better at deep fake detection.
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:30.820]   Yeah, one would hope by by necessity. And of course, if you are, if they've got a video of you robbing
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:37.300]   a bank, it would be prudent of your defense attorney to get this reface app and show the,
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:42.500]   show the jury a video of you running up the steps at the spectrum in Philadelphia and everybody
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:48.820]   be happy then. Oh, you see, and you can do anything. The bigger problem is when it's at lower stakes.
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:54.660]   I think I read a story recently where a somewhat, someone on the cheerleading team, a rival,
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:08:00.980]   a rival got her kicked off by producing a deep fake of this cheerleader vaping. Because, oh,
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:06.420]   yes, let's be smoking your kicked off the team. A mother. Yes. Right. Exactly. And that's the sort
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:11.300]   of stuff where you might not have the resources to fight it or you're dealing with like a high school,
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.900]   high school bureaucracy where they just want to move on to the next thing they don't care about
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:18.740]   justice. That's the stuff that's going to really, really hose people when people get fired
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:25.540]   in retribution style for videos that they can't disprove because they don't want to. And I do
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:30.900]   note that that mother got caught. Yeah, exactly. Well, and I think that I think that the,
[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:36.340]   we're going to go through a phase where people don't know and then there, I do think we're going
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:39.060]   to go through a full understanding. We're going to go, we're going to evolve to where no one believes
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:42.100]   anything. Yeah. You know, like it's, you know, like they don't believe anything they see. Did I
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:47.060]   mention I played golem in the, in the Lord of the Rings sequel. Did you do you have any footage?
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:51.620]   Yeah, I do actually have some footage that could prove that there. There I am. There I am.
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:55.860]   It's going. That's pretty good. I don't, I don't know if we're going to unsee that.
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:09:02.980]   Does it look like me? I can't tell. I can't tell. I am wearing, apparently I'm wearing
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:07.300]   AirPods Pro. So it must be what you are. I don't know what your workout regime is, but you are
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:18.980]   really cut. That is. Oh, this is the, my Linux, my Linux. Precious 15 inch monitor. Oh,
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:26.020]   let's go ahead. We've got Alex Lindsey showing us. This is the, this is the one I was talking
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:32.100]   about, the Rembrandt. Yeah. But there's like, but that is a cartoon character, you know, basically,
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:39.780]   but they're using AI to essentially style game. That's a still, of course. These are stills.
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:44.260]   No, these are, but, but when you look at what they're doing with it, it's calculating.
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:48.020]   That's a little more sophisticated, isn't it? Yeah. You know, you're, you're starting. Yeah,
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:50.740]   it's not, it's not a video. What I would say is it's not a video.
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:54.980]   Ricky Gervais. Yeah. Ricky Gervais as, as, as grand.
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:10:03.220]   Yeah, exactly. But again, the, the, the key to all this is that it's not just,
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:08.980]   it's not just morphing a photo. It is building the style game. I think style game two is the
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:14.500]   name of the algorithm. It knows how to synthesize like an entire head. And so with all these parameters.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:19.940]   So what you're seeing there is the, is the algorithm trying to figure out what parameters
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:25.780]   are correct to reproduce this face. And so now that they have, once they have all those variables
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:31.060]   locked, now you can create, you know, you can create things where like, let's, let's say that
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:36.740]   I'm, let's say that I'm doing, I'm in the studio and I'm looking off camera like this for whatever,
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:40.500]   whatever technical reason where that has to happen. I'm looking at the interviewer. If I,
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:45.940]   if the producer then wants me to be looking directly at the camera, it can then like, because all the
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:50.340]   parameters for generating my head are known quantities because they apply this algorithm to it,
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:54.500]   they can synthetically turn me so that I'm actually looking directly into the camera.
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:59.140]   It's, it's a really, really powerful and I wouldn't say scary, but definitely that the
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:04.020]   application sports a long, long list. And a lot of actors for the last decade have been getting
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:10.100]   scans of themselves all the time. So they want, because if you want to go back in time and use
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:15.940]   that actor, when they, you know, look, so you have a flashback, you want to use the actor and, and
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:18.420]   they, they're like, we don't even know what we're going to do with this, but we might as well
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:22.980]   gather it while you're getting older. So if you're a popular actor, those services in LA have been
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:27.940]   exist for quite some time to make sure that they capture them at different stages of their life,
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:33.220]   which makes this process even easier because they have the actual data to generate the, you know,
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:38.580]   to match back into it. So it's, you know, it's going to be really interesting to see where films go.
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:42.900]   Actually come to think of it. You probably couldn't get insurance these days for a film
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.620]   unless you did that with all the principal actors in case they,
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:50.260]   somehow they've gone that far yet, but I don't know if they've gone that far yet, but they definitely,
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:52.900]   there's a lot of films I think that they wish they had done that. Yeah.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:59.620]   Now, I think about this real quick. There's very few actors in Hollywood right now that have more
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:04.420]   angles, faces, different looks in screen time than you three. I know.
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:12.580]   And that's funny, right? What are we at? 757 episodes later. There's enough data out there.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:18.340]   I can make Andy be anything with the right computer. Can you make? Can you make Andy be
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:24.740]   Zina Princess Warrior? Oh, God. Oh, just actually, if you I'll give you links to my only fans. That's
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:31.620]   at the $10 tier. You can see the cosplay. You look good in the outfit there. If I can look 10%
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:37.060]   as hot and capable as Zina and anything, I will take it. I remember Dustin Hoffman and Tootsie
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:45.140]   said the only drawback to playing a woman is I'm so ugly. I would be such an ugly woman.
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:49.460]   Let's take a break. There is actually other Apple news. I thought this was a good conversation
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:53.300]   since we, you know, when we get people like Doc Grock and Alex Lindsey on, it's really good to
[01:12:53.300 --> 01:13:00.100]   to talk about these technologies. They're on the forefront. Alex Lindsey's office hours, youtube.com/Alex
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:09.140]   Lindsey. Although you could also, if you know how to capitalize just so, go to bit.ly/the office hours
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:15.940]   with a capital at the beginning of each word, T-O-N-H. And we're really, it's starting to really take off.
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:21.140]   Oh, really? More than before. Well, we did this again, this Raspberry Pi thing we did.
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:25.620]   And we're doing more and more of this where we're not just having, we had these kind of round table
[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:30.020]   discussions, but what we've also gotten now into it are kind of these lab work together.
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:33.540]   So for like three hours, we were sitting there building these Raspberry Pi's and installing
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:37.300]   software and getting into work and, and trading notes and we're doing it with people all over the
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:41.460]   world, all at the same time, you know, and I'm gonna have to start worrying. You just ruined my
[01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:46.100]   mornings, you realize. Well, that's Saturday afternoon. That's Saturday afternoon. You know,
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:51.860]   like Saturday now, like last Saturday was 10 hours of, from the time we opened to the time we finished.
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:56.740]   And we had covered in that. People come and go, right? Nobody stays all 10 hours. Some do.
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:14:01.540]   Probably 30, 40, probably stay the whole time. You know, we gave him breaks, but we talked about it.
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:06.260]   We had general discussion. We talked about education. We talked, we were learning how to use resolve.
[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:10.020]   And then we got into building Raspberry Pi's. So it was a lot on Saturday.
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:13.060]   Your show was sponsored by astronaut diapers, aren't they?
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:20.900]   Yes, frankly, this show should be. That's Al and Andy Enoco. He's on WGBH Boston,
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:25.140]   typically on a Friday. We'll find out this week when you're going to be on next. Great to have you
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:31.780]   in. Filling in for Renee Richie this week. The beautiful, the lovely, the talented Doc Rock.
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:34.900]   So nice. I got to need an astronaut diaper right about me.
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:42.180]   Yeah. We're gonna do a bathroom break coming up, bio break coming up, youtube.com/docrock
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:48.900]   to watch him at work. Smoke him if you got him, fellas, because we're gonna tell you about Uber
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:57.380]   for business. A great way to reward clients or even colleagues for doing things you want him to do.
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:15:03.620]   You all know Uber. Uber eats, brings you food, Uber rides, brings you rides. Uber for business
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:11.940]   lets you buy vouchers for rides or order meals from restaurants you love. Say you want to have
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:18.740]   colleagues come to a, or maybe some potential clients come to a Zoom meeting. Some three hour,
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:23.540]   maybe even a 10 hour Zoom meeting in which you're putting a Raspberry Pi together of a Saturday
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:30.420]   afternoon. One nice way to get them to come and be saying, hey, here's a coupon. Let's
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:36.820]   we'll buy you lunch. We'll buy you coffee. We'll buy you dinner. We'll buy you a ride home afterwards.
[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:43.300]   Over 150,000 companies use Uber for business, both to improve customer and employee satisfaction.
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:48.340]   It's a great way to tell somebody you appreciate them. A great way to
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:54.580]   spiff them if they're staying late after work. Get them a ride home. With vouchers from Uber
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:58.740]   for business, you can add $20 to their personal Uber accounts so they can easily order meals
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:05.060]   through Uber Eats before the meeting. You can offer a voucher for a ride when they make
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:09.460]   customer makes their first purchase or spends a certain amount. The nice thing about Uber for
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:14.100]   business is very easy for you to set up. Any company can sign up, it costs you nothing.
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:18.660]   You'll immediately start delivering extra value to the people who matter most to their business.
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:25.300]   Vouchers are simple to send and to redeem. You have total control over who gets them when they
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:30.740]   expire. You can even say, I only want to cover half the meal or half the ride. Any portion
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:36.660]   thereof. It's very easy to share vouchers. They're shared via text or email. Your customers or
[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:42.020]   colleagues can redeem them with a single tap. Best of all, you only pay for the rides they take
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:50.500]   or the meals they order. Really is a clever idea. Samsung, Coca-Cola, Zoom, lots of companies use
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:56.180]   Uber for business to make clients and customers happy. Now, if you want to get started, go to
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:17:02.740]   uberubar.com/macbreak. For a limited time, you'll get a $50 voucher when you create your first
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:09.780]   vouchers campaign and spend at least $200. Nice deal. Go to uber.com/macbreak to learn more.
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:16.260]   uber.com/macbreak terms and conditions apply. Uber for business. What is that,
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:21.860]   URL again? Uber.com/macbreak. Thank you, Uber, for your support.
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:27.220]   Thank you, dear Macbreak Weekly, listener for supporting us by using that address specifically.
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:32.580]   uber.com/macbreak. No wonder Alex Lindsay doesn't believe in Zoom fatigue 10 hours.
[01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:40.260]   That's great, great. I got to get in there though. They're there because they're having fun,
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:43.620]   right? They don't want to leave. They're having a good time. It was funny,
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:47.140]   it was I didn't think that anyone would want to watch us make build the Raspberry Pi, but people
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:51.540]   were like, "Oh, I just turned it on and just couldn't stop watching." What happens is you got
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:57.780]   when you have 15 or 20 people with multi-camera setups, we're cutting back and forth between
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:02.980]   everyone working on it. It's not just looking into a webcam. It's kind of turned... How many
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:10.580]   people were building? We're building. About 30. What happens is that when you... We're going to
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:16.980]   get into our Dweino and probably Swift programming and Unreal Engine and everything else. The
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:22.980]   interesting thing is that you learn so fast because someone's right ahead of you, like 10 seconds
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:26.820]   ahead. I was like, "Oh, why am I getting this black screen? Oh, that happens on this thing."
[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:32.420]   Then somebody else had a problem with their internet connection. I said, "Oh, I just had that
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:39.060]   problem." As everybody learning it together and the developer of Playout B, Jonas to tell,
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:44.020]   was actually in the thing with it. The Playout system that we're using on the Raspberry Pi that
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:52.340]   I'm using here, this little software on the Raspberry Pi is the developer of that was in the meeting
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:58.340]   with us. We're able to figure it all out with someone who can really answer the questions,
[01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:02.260]   as well as from each other, as well as... There's a bunch of people that have already built it.
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:11.220]   It's a fascinating way to learn. It's just very different. In addition to the general
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:16.580]   conversations that we have, we're getting into these big group sessions of learning how to do
[01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:22.340]   something together. A lot of us get stopped from building... I tell people to build Raspberry
[01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:27.220]   Pi's. I had never built one before. People ask questions. You don't have to build it. The thing
[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:33.700]   is complete, but you're saying you're adding into the GPIO stuff. We got it in pieces when we got
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:40.180]   a bunch of hats. We were putting on the heat sinks on and we're wiring it up.
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:43.220]   And there are people saying, "Oh, geez, I'm stuck. What are you guys doing?"
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:47.380]   Because everybody's watching. Not two videos of people doing that. One person.
[01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:50.900]   No, no. The idea of them all doing it the same time is kind of interesting.
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:55.460]   No, that's the whole thing is that every time someone gets stuck, we had a range of
[01:19:55.460 --> 01:20:01.940]   electrical engineers to folks that didn't even know what a Raspberry Pi was two weeks ago.
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:10.020]   And so the thing is that what makes it powerful is exactly that. We are learning from each other
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:14.980]   and you're just not getting stopped. Everybody figured out how everybody who was playing on air
[01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:19.380]   figured it out by the end. And the answering the questions and figuring it all out.
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:22.260]   Is that why I went 10 hours? Because you couldn't end until everybody booted.
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:26.980]   It was like two and a half hours of building the Raspberry Pi. That was the last thing.
[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:31.380]   Before that we spent an hour learning Resolve. So the guys from Ripple Training,
[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:36.820]   so the actual guys who make it, we're doing, we were in the color page of Resolve. So we were
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:40.900]   learning how to do color correction there. And then before that, we had two hours of discussion
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:48.260]   about the future of education and how online education with teachers and education technologists.
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:52.260]   And then we had the general discussion before that. So there's a lot of Saturdays.
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:59.540]   Long day. Somebody in the chat room is asking where you got the deep fake pictures you showed
[01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:04.260]   earlier what the link was. Oh, that's on board Panda. I'll put it. I'll put actually into the
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:10.020]   every piece on board Panda. Oh, it's the only magazine to pan this as it turns out.
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:13.780]   All I did was search. I think I searched Cartoon.
[01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:21.620]   What did I why? I searched something like deep fake fake deep fake no Photoshop cartoon.
[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:27.220]   That was my that was deep fake no Photoshop cartoon. It's not what you know. It's how
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:29.540]   you Google. Yeah, really. It's really true.
[01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:36.500]   Okay, we're going to do this. Not how well you code is how well you find the code you need and
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:42.420]   cut and copy and paste it. Yeah, you know, it's true than you might imagine. I'm still kind of
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:47.300]   shocked right here with people just Google it or search it on Stack Exchange and paste it in.
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:51.620]   And the reason we know that is because every once in a while, there'll be sample code with
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:56.180]   massive exploit, you know, massive security flaws in it. And it's apparently been pasted in every
[01:21:56.180 --> 01:22:00.100]   way. Everybody's just used it without even looking at it. Just going, yeah, that must work.
[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:04.180]   It works. It's good. What's this massive block of hex that's part of this simple.
[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:07.860]   Simple Python code. Don't worry about it.
[01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:13.940]   Paste it in. Okay, we're going to do a little mini speed routing. Well, does that be that speedy?
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:21.780]   But a little round of quick stories. Apple is suing a former big shot, actually, employee
[01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:26.020]   for leaking to media. You know, we talk about leaks all the time.
[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:32.340]   And you know, leakers having stories, people like John Prosser and Mark Gurman.
[01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:38.260]   I always wonder if they think about the consequences to the people who leak to them,
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:44.980]   especially if it's an Apple employee. This is a former materials lead at Apple. He worked in the
[01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:54.340]   design team. Apple says that on his last day, which is in 2019, he downloaded a bunch of stuff.
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:23:00.980]   Simon Lancaster downloaded a bunch of stuff outside of his jobs scope and then sold it to a
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:05.060]   media outlet. They don't say which media outlet. I've been trying to figure that out.
[01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:09.620]   Yeah, I think Apple has to try to figure that out. I think Apple almost has to prosecute that.
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:17.380]   Totally was totally within their rights. This is not like that, you know, having a beer and
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:22.820]   telling someone what's coming next. This is like really theft. Yeah, you know, no, it's outright
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:28.900]   theft. Core 11, Dasky did that to Google and ended up owing them $172 million.
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:34.500]   So it's not taking taking self-driving technology and creating your own self-driving startup and
[01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:39.380]   then selling it to Uber. Yeah, that's that. And that's what Lancaster did. I mean, if you go
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:45.860]   deep into the story, this dude, like he was incredible, right? So before he left, he invested in
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:52.900]   companies, materials companies that would possibly be used by Apple for some things. So he was
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:57.540]   double dipping. He's getting paid to create materials for this stuff. But then he added a
[01:23:57.540 --> 01:24:04.180]   startup, bless his call it that. Okay, then after he started doing things with the startup
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:09.620]   that was kind of like trying to force contracts on his, I'm leaving guys, I see you, I got two
[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:13.860]   weeks notice. Okay. Oh, by the way, I need to go to that meeting where you guys are talking about,
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:19.540]   you know, XYZ. And he goes into the meeting and tries to steer a product towards a situation
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:24.340]   that would help his startup makes for money. He was brazen. He's like those movies where you
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:30.340]   see the guy and it's like, man, that was an incredible scheme. Genius. Oh, genius keeps sticking his
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:36.020]   hand back into the cookie jar. Okay, now genius got all of the keyboard things in his hand. He
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:42.420]   can't get his hand out because he went too far. Had he stopped when he already was making the money,
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:47.700]   he was fine. And then the last thing he did, which was insane, he sent some of these nefarious
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:54.420]   infos with the computer that was given to him by the company, it was with company property.
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:59.300]   Oh, it didn't even have enough common sense to move it to something that didn't belong to them.
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:05.220]   So they couldn't maybe necessarily confiscate it back. So he like triple quadruple dipped like that
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:11.220]   rounding danger field, triple triple Lindy to dump into the yeah, triple Lindy. It was a
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:17.540]   it was egregious. egregious is the word. Although I imagine Apple pursues these anyway,
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:22.100]   but something like this, they're really going to have to. Yeah, I think the one things about
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:27.460]   what happens to the people, like you said, but even for me, I think bigger is no one thinks about
[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:33.220]   what it does to fans like us. I personally miss Christmas because now when we get our device,
[01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:37.620]   we don't hurt everything. And there's I mean, Apple only has one or two surprises,
[01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:42.580]   but I used to love the days of like, it's launched a let's go find all of the cool stuff it can do.
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:46.260]   It's interesting that they went after a civil suit, not a criminal prosecution,
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:51.860]   because this is also criminal. Levandowski both was sued by Google, but also was tried in court.
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:57.780]   Well, they don't have to convince a DA to prosecute. They can just simply file that's
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:02.740]   in their own. And they can put a lot more hurt on this person by saying, here's how much money you
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:06.900]   owe us because here's the contract that you yourself signed and things you agreed not to do.
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:13.220]   And given the capital, criminals are the big after the civil wins too. So if you win the civil,
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:18.420]   you can still go criminal after. And now there's, you know, evidence, but
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:23.460]   well, you're right. Well, you the rules of evidence with civil is different than the rules with
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:29.860]   criminals. So you don't have Fifth Amendment and stuff like that. So there's some advantages
[01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:36.180]   there. And the it's going to cost him $100,000 just to defend himself at best. You know, so it's
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:41.860]   like just to defend himself against something that he already is already pretty clear he did.
[01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:46.820]   Given the number of leaks, you know, Mark Gurman seems to know everything that's going on.
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:50.660]   I'm surprised this doesn't happen more often. Or do you think Apple's throwing the book at this
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:56.180]   guy just to? I think they're going to go out and leakers after they squeeze this dude. And he's
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:27:00.740]   going, Okay, so who was it? You know, like who's sunny? Who's, you know, did you tell Mark Gurman?
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:04.340]   Go after the journalists, obviously, they're protected sources are protected.
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:10.580]   I wonder, I've talked to Mary Jo Foley, who does who used to do a lot of leaks. And she says,
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:14.580]   yeah, this is something that's sometimes very hard because, you know, you're not, you're not
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:18.980]   tricking somebody into leaking. They're volunteering it for a variety of reasons.
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:21.860]   But if they get caught, this is their end of the world for them.
[01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:26.500]   The rumor, the rumor was that like when Steve Jobs got there, you know, Apple leaked like a
[01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:32.740]   sieve and he brought in three senior, you know, three senior people. I don't know what level
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:36.900]   they were very high up and said, Hey, we've got this new thing coming up. And here's the code name.
[01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:40.420]   And, and, you know, I just want to make sure you're clear. It's really important that that
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:44.100]   doesn't get out. And if that code name gets, you know, if this gets out, I'm going to fire you all.
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:48.420]   I'm not going to try to figure it out. And the code name got out and they all got fired.
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:54.100]   And then no one talked about anything. It wasn't even a code name for a product.
[01:27:54.100 --> 01:28:00.260]   Like he was literally just a trap. And I can, I can, I can attest to this before Steve came back.
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:06.900]   I was getting a lot of leaks from product managers that clearly were trying to manipulate me,
[01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:12.260]   who didn't know that I had a lot more sources that they thought I did, that every time that they
[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:17.380]   gave me information about, Oh, well, Rhapsody's in big, big trouble. It's absolutely not going to
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:22.340]   ship. Or this is this, this new printer system is not going to work at all. That, okay, well,
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:27.460]   I know that you and the person that you're taddling on are in are kind of fighting for
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:31.540]   resources and fighting for employees and fighting for budget. I think that you're just trying to
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:35.060]   undermine this other person. And I'm not going to want to be a part of that. And that pretty much
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:41.300]   stopped as soon as Steve Jobs came back. But I'm the complaint doesn't mention who the who the
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:45.380]   leaker was corresponding with the only referred to this person as the correspondent. I'd be
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:51.060]   surprised if it were an actual member of the media, it sounds like it would be more of an
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:55.140]   analyst, someone who's writing analyst reports for investors, because the stakes are quite that
[01:28:55.140 --> 01:29:02.500]   high. If you are a real journalist, it's you're right when you say that people are free to talk to
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:07.620]   me about whatever they want to talk to, whether they want to talk about. But once I start to be
[01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:12.660]   an active agent saying the complaint says that the correspondent was actually giving this person
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:16.180]   like a wish list of a hunting list saying here's documents, I hear here's information that I
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:22.580]   definitely want to have. That's becomes a little bit more squirrely, probably not in terms of legal
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:30.660]   prosecution, but definitely in terms of you're committing an ethical violation within the context
[01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:34.340]   of this just simply being what's the shape of the new phone going to be like? This is not about
[01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:43.220]   ferreting out powerful people who are manipulating or abdicating their responsibilities and hurting
[01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:47.940]   people. This is about the shape of the new phone. This could really, really affect your ability to
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:52.420]   do business, both to get hired and get people to talk to you. I mean, probably, Renee would
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:57.140]   probably have other things to say about this as well. But there are at any given moment, when
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:30:02.900]   I know a lot of things that people have told me conversationally that they knew that I was not
[01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:07.620]   going to talk about, or people have told me things in confidence just so I can understand
[01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:14.500]   something a little bit better. The only reason why I keep getting this sort of stuff is that if I
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:18.580]   agree not to spill the beans, they know that I'm not going to spill the beans. That's been my
[01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:23.940]   reputation. I'm always really, really curious as to the sources that people like Mark Gurman have
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:31.540]   that they're continually able to get the straight dope because I can't do that. If I would be burning
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:36.580]   so many people, if I were to, again, I would not want to end somebody's career because, hey, wow,
[01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:43.300]   looks like the chamfer angle on the iPhone 13 is going to be 0.04% less chamfer than the last one.
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:49.060]   Okay, whatever. It's not important. >> Yeah. And actually, Renee did a great deep dive on his
[01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:55.620]   channel. And to your point, he's right. A lot of the stuff that people leak are just useless and
[01:30:56.340 --> 01:31:01.220]   become sort of clickbaity. And they're not really giving any information or any value or
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:07.940]   actually being helpful. They're just trying to be first. And that, I don't know, value seeking from
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:13.140]   that just kind of needs to go away in the worst way because it's not helpful to anyone. It's not
[01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:19.140]   helpful to the industry. It causes like full-on manufacturers to listen to some leak and then try
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:24.740]   to do some stuff that Apple was completely faking about. Then we find out later when the real product
[01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:29.780]   comes out that the guys who thought they were listening just made a bunch of stuff that will
[01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:34.980]   never fit or never work because it was a fake leak. So yeah, I just wish this part of the industry
[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:40.020]   would go away because you're not doing anything, bro. >> Yeah. Or the data you have is going to be
[01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:44.660]   dead in about a month anyway, because Apple and other companies change their minds so many times.
[01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:50.500]   How many times have even the best reputation leakers have said, "Oh, well, air tags are going
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:54.980]   to be released on this date. There's going to be event at this time and Apple changes their mind."
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:32:00.580]   >> Air tag has been coming out for three years and then now when I press, she says, "You don't get
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:08.900]   mad when Apple changes their mind." >> Co-name to Joe. >> I have to say, I have no
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:17.540]   compunction about repeating leaks that Mark Gurman and others have. But when somebody will DM me
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:21.300]   and it happens from time to time, a message means say, "Sometimes it's from a well-known leaker.
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:28.980]   I have images. I always ignore them because I have hard time ethically. I just don't want to do that."
[01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:33.460]   But on the other hand, if we report on leaks all the time, it's just somebody else's name.
[01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:39.540]   >> It's not mine. >> Again, I'm not a reporter in politics who writes about voter suppression.
[01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:42.980]   >> Right. >> If that's something else. This is again about,
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:48.500]   okay, well, who's going to be making the radio in the next iPhone? >> Does the public have the
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:53.780]   public has a right to know if the Vietnam War is going to be lost and we're still fighting it.
[01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:58.100]   But I don't know if the public's right to know what the chamfrid ankles on the phone are.
[01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:02.420]   >> Yeah. >> Really, super seeds, Apple's interest in secrecy.
[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:05.620]   Or Doc Roxy interested in having Christmas debut surprise.
[01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:08.660]   >> Yeah. >> All I can say is that it just doesn't interest me.
[01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:11.380]   >> Yeah. >> And it kind of burns me. >> I don't want to get that business.
[01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:16.020]   >> Yeah. >> When Gizmodo did something very illegal,
[01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:18.500]   buying a phone. >> I would never have done that.
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:19.620]   >> Someone who did not own that phone. >> Yeah.
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:22.020]   >> Yeah. >> But I got a lot, actually,
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:27.060]   actually the head of Gizmodo, the publishers of Gizmodo named me, like, "Oh, well, this is the
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:30.820]   reason why people like Indian Akko are going to do stuff like that is because he doesn't want
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:34.260]   to damage his relationship with Apple." And it's like, "Well, no, number one."
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:39.780]   >> They're showing how independent they are by illegally purchasing stolen phone.
[01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:42.420]   >> And they're underminers. >> And that was so stupid.
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:47.460]   That was so stupid because there is a way, I mean, I was in that situation earlier,
[01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:52.020]   as a matter of fact. And the answer to that is you don't buy the phone, you agree to pay this
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:55.460]   person a fee to meet you at a hotel room. >> And show it to you.
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:34:00.420]   >> And show it to you for two hours. Then you're absolutely, the other thing is that even if you're
[01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:05.620]   going to do that, they had their hands on, I will wind this up quickly, I'm sorry, but I'm still
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:11.780]   amazed that they had their hands on one of the most innovative changes that Apple had made to
[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:17.460]   the iPhone since the beginning, which is an entirely new antenna system based on the frame of the
[01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:22.500]   phone itself. They did not figure that out. All they got was like, "Hey, look, it's flat,
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:26.660]   and it's rounded. It's got rounded edges." It's like, if you're going to expose yourself like that,
[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:29.060]   at least bring an expert on board. >> Yeah.
[01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:33.620]   >> And it brings a bring an engineer who can look at it and say, "Ooh, they did not put these
[01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:38.260]   black seams on the edge of the case for no reason whatsoever. This month, I bet that they're doing
[01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:42.260]   this." Anyway, it was still amazing. >> And this short-sighted play, honestly,
[01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:46.020]   I swear to you, this short-sighted play, and this is why I tell all my YouTube people,
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:49.940]   "Don't get caught in vanity metrics." The vanity metrics was, "This is going to get us
[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:54.020]   millions of clicks." So these millions of clicks are going to be worth this amount of money.
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:58.420]   >> Right. >> How much do you suppose it would have been worth to not say a thing and go,
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:03.780]   "Bruh, yo, Samsung, check this out." Which one you think made more money? Just think about it.
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:08.580]   >> That's a good point. So that neat clicks are ignorant and short-sighted.
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:15.140]   >> And fundamentally, I think that they undermine the validity of the press and of that person.
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:20.100]   And I think that that's the thing that's really can be damaging, is that people keep on asking,
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:25.140]   like, "Why aren't people believing what they see?" Well, it's because they keep on getting fed
[01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:28.820]   things that aren't true, or aren't there. >> That's a good point.
[01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:33.540]   >> And so when we try to-- and I get that we're all racing to try to make sure that we get out
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:37.620]   there first. I mean, I talked about the Stanford article. I wrote an article that's actually up
[01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:45.540]   on Medium yesterday. So about that, about how when you just go grab something as a press person,
[01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:49.220]   I think some of our responsibility is we can talk about rumors and what we project, but we're
[01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:54.820]   very clear on the show that we're projecting it. We're guessing. And I think that when people
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:59.300]   put it out as truth, they just have to be really sure that it's true because it's not something
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:04.260]   you're going to get back. People are kind of slowly not trusting what they see, and that becomes
[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:09.220]   harder and harder to fight. If you keep on putting it out there, it's like crying wolf.
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:12.260]   >> Hey, I didn't know you had your media tech on Medium.
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:21.540]   >> That's my-- I did it a couple years ago, but I barely published to it. I felt like this,
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:25.460]   that article, I felt like the article that--
[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:29.140]   >> Because we had talked about this, if you came on Twitch specifically to talk about Zoom Fatigue.
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:29.940]   >> Yeah.
[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:31.540]   >> We talked about the Stanford release.
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:36.500]   >> So I really thought through it a fair bit and then decided that we needed to write something.
[01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:39.860]   I needed to write something about it. I'm going to write another article. This article just really
[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:46.420]   goes after the-- I mean, just really point-by-point addresses the Stanford article. And fundamentally,
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:51.300]   I think this gets into the press not researching the research. Because it came from Stanford,
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:57.220]   everyone just reported it as truth. And it's not even close. It's even at the bottom. It says,
[01:36:57.220 --> 01:37:01.220]   "Well, this is all theoretical." Why did you write it? Like, the whole thing is theoretical.
[01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:05.380]   And so as someone who actually does this every day all day, I thought it would be useful to
[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:12.900]   rebut the article. So anyway, so it's up on Medium. But it's a good example of also
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:17.780]   of the press latching onto something that, as Doc said, is going to get them clicks,
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:20.660]   because it's about Zoom. >> Stanford's going to get people excited.
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:25.140]   Stanford's PR department. And they knew it would get-- this would be very hot.
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:32.260]   This is, of course, why they released it. >> And it's completely just smoke. There's no
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:39.460]   there there at all. And so it doesn't address any of the real issues that occur. And it actually
[01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:46.260]   does damage. And so this is where we have to be-- everyone has to stop to Doc's point,
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:51.060]   start thinking long-term about authenticity, about people believing what you're saying,
[01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:56.500]   and not just going for that short-term click, whether it's a small company or a big university
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:38:03.140]   or someone else, of really trying to make sure that what comes out of your-- what you're doing
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:09.140]   actually makes sense. >> And it was funny, as I tell people all the time, that if Zoom fatigue
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:15.220]   was for real, if I told you that if you had to come to 30, like 10-hour Zoom meetings in the
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:22.340]   room and it was going to get you a full Bitcoin, and I was just going to sit there and stare at you
[01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:26.180]   the entire time. How many people would line up? >> Six grand? You bet.
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:30.260]   >> Thank you. Hall of bat, right? If you got something to say, there is zero--
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:34.260]   >> I could do eight of those. >> Right? If you were having a conversation
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:38.420]   with Steve Jobs on how to reinvent the next-- >> There you go.
[01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:43.380]   >> --that's going to turn you into some multi-billionaire. You sit there. So,
[01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:47.700]   fatigue comes from-- you got nothing important to say. If you're saying something important,
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:49.700]   the people listening to you are fatigued. >> That's a very good point.
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:53.220]   >> Yeah. >> And no one wants to take their responsibility. They wouldn't be like,
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:58.980]   "Oh, but my people are going to be Zoom fatigue." Wouldn't be charismatic. Be Leo. Be Andy.
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:04.500]   Andy could do 10-hour Zoom call on comic books, and nobody would not turn off because his depth,
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:08.900]   his knowledge, his presence, his chops, you know? >> That's not the--
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:12.740]   >> It's not the container. It's the content.
[01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:16.500]   >> I think that's a good way to put it. >> Yeah.
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:22.980]   >> Yeah. That it really is a-- what it has exasperated is the fact that we hate watching
[01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:27.540]   slide decks. So, when people use Zoom for that, that creates a lot of fatigue, but that created
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:28.980]   fatigue when we were in person. >> Yes.
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:36.260]   >> Like, that was painful. >> And so, I think that-- and I don't-- we've belabored that one a lot,
[01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:40.020]   but the-- >> Yeah, this was supposed to be the speed round. Obviously, I picked the wrong story.
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:42.980]   >> Yeah, exactly. We dropped into it. We wanted off into a rat.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:50.580]   So the-- but anyway, so-- but yeah, I think that the press has to-- is constantly-- this short-term
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:58.100]   trying to find clicks is killing it. >> 91 point-- according to Soft Cell Cell, 91%,
[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:04.180]   actually 92% of iPhone owners plan to buy another iPhone when they-- next upgrade,
[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:11.940]   and that's up 1.4% for 2019. Samsung, it's dropped from 85% to 74%.
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:18.420]   Samsung owners are less loyal than they were. iPhone owners are more loyal than they were.
[01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:24.820]   This is, of course, to-- according to Cell Cell, which is probably not the best name.
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:31.780]   How do you spell that? I have no idea. But it was their brand loyalty survey.
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:38.020]   Apple-- remember when Facebook was complaining about Apple's privacy labels, everybody's
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:42.420]   complaining about it because their people now know, users now know, all the information they're
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:48.420]   giving up. They said, "Well, Apple doesn't do it. Well, now Apple does. They're transparency
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:54.020]   pages. It's at apple.com/privacies. That's labels has privacy labels, just like they require
[01:40:54.020 --> 01:41:01.380]   of everybody else for every single app that Apple offers, including apps. You know, this is a
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:06.340]   great way to find out about apps I've never heard of. Like, "Bed it? Apple has a bedded app? They
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:13.780]   don't collect any data, just so you know." So this is good job, Apple. It's really important,
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:17.540]   because not only do they really have to do this to fight off regulators, we're saying,
[01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:21.540]   "Hey, you're giving yourself an advantage that you're making your third party developers
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:27.060]   do things you're not putting yourself under." It also gives consumers a baseline to look at,
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:31.380]   that when you look at the Apple Music app and you see, "Oh, wow, it really is tracking a whole
[01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:36.260]   bunch of things. Maybe I shouldn't be concerned that Spotify is also tracking a lot of the same data."
[01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:42.580]   So not that there's an actual, not that there's an equivalence between Apple's data collection
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:48.020]   and any other companies, but it's like when you start to see, "Oh my God, why is there, why is
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:54.260]   there tungsten in this package of pre-made bagels?" Then when you find out that, "Okay, no,
[01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:58.420]   everything has tungsten in it." I'm not, "Okay, I picked out tungsten because it's a funny element."
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:04.660]   It makes you think that maybe this is not just some completely irresponsible, dangerous, and deadly
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:08.660]   product, that there is something in the manufacturing process that has been certified as being okay
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:12.820]   for this application. So yeah, there's nothing but good. It's so easy to find, so easy to use.
[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:17.860]   This is nothing but a 10 out of 10 for consumers. "If you bought a bra for your AirPods Max,
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:23.940]   hoping it would reduce battery drain, you might have noticed it hasn't, but now there's an up,
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:30.660]   upgrade to the firmware of your AirPods Max that does fix that battery drain issue." I wonder if
[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:37.220]   Apple actually ever admitted there was a battery drain issue. The bra just looks so weird.
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:45.220]   It's a thing. It's a choice. It's a saggel. It's not a bra. It's a, you're
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:50.660]   being a poor saggel. They couldn't afford to give you a hard side case for the small amount of
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:55.780]   money they've managed to manufacture that for. I don't know what people are complaining about.
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:43:05.220]   Let's see. I think Arizona passed its bill that would require Apple to open a non or to allow non
[01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:09.300]   app stores. I don't know if that has yet been appealed, but...
[01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:15.380]   I'm not sure if it's been signed yet, right? It hasn't. It's not signed yet.
[01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:18.740]   One bill was passed. I can't remember which state. Maybe it was in Arizona.
[01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:28.340]   They're lobbying. South Dakota lost. Somebody said, "Oh, it advanced." Never mind. It's maybe
[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:33.620]   it's advanced. It went to the house. I think it's... It's gotten farther than the North Dakota
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:40.180]   one in his house voted 31 to 29 in favor of the bill. But now, I guess it has to go to the
[01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:47.940]   Arizona State Senate. It's going to be funny is when people pick this stuff and say they actually
[01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:53.060]   win for whatever reason. East Texas is the kind of thing they've win. And then Apple goes, "Okay,
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:58.020]   cool. We're out." And then, "What does everybody go to the way? I can't get an Apple thing now,
[01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:02.740]   because my people chased them away over something that they didn't really know."
[01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:06.500]   What would the reaction be if Apple said, "Well, I'm just not going to sell iPhones in
[01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:13.620]   Arizona anymore." Let's look at it. I think that the interesting thing is business-wise,
[01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:19.700]   if Apple is providing a space for people to do this, if they can't charge for that space,
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:26.980]   what else could they charge for? All the bits being moved. There's a lot of... They're going to
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:30.260]   have to figure something out. It doesn't mean that they have to provide it for free.
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:37.460]   It's like a mall. It only costs this much money to manage my stall of the mall. I should only have
[01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:41.780]   to pay for that. But you're still paying for janitorial services and security and the infrastructure
[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:45.940]   and electricity and all the activities that happen in the main area and everything else.
[01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:53.060]   The numbers that people threw out, someone threw out some insane number. It only costs Apple $100
[01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:58.660]   million to support the store. Well, that doesn't count all the engineers that work on the
[01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:04.340]   libraries that everyone's using to build that, to make that work, which is probably more like
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:10.100]   a couple hundred million dollars a month. But if somebody wants to put a pop-up shop in the parking
[01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:16.260]   lot, I think they should be allowed to. On Android, you can do that. You're warned if you're going to
[01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:21.140]   turn off the... If you're going to allow unsupported apps from an un-supported store. But what they're
[01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:23.780]   going to want is all the same security. They're going to want all the same security.
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:30.020]   That's why Android warns you like crazy when you do it. You're right. They're problems.
[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:33.940]   But that's what they're fighting. They're fighting. They want to have it. They want to be first
[01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:41.940]   nation status. But they also want it to be free. I think Apple could solve the problem if they
[01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:46.980]   wanted to by just putting that checkbox. We'll see. I think they're going to have to make an
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:51.060]   adaptation because this is not going to go away. There's going to be a problem internationally as
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:55.940]   well. And I think that if they were to at least modify things so that people would still be limited
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:46:04.180]   to the App Store for installing apps, but content could be installed from a third party seller or
[01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:10.260]   third party transaction company, that might get people off their backs.
[01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:15.860]   Because right now, I think that this is the year two of Apple having to finally take a look at how
[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:18.980]   they're running the App Store. They've been running it without any influence, without any
[01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:25.860]   need to respond to any outside pressure whatsoever. Now they're going to have to really listen to.
[01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:30.100]   Here's what developers and regulators are really, really steamed about. And you're going to have
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:39.220]   to start revisiting all these rules. The fact that they changed their percentages in the last year
[01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:44.660]   in reaction to the Fortnite lawsuit, this is not like I keep saying, that's not something that
[01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:48.020]   they had already planned. That's not something they said, "Oh, well gosh, I think we have been doing
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:51.140]   this wrong. We're because of the goodness of our hearts. We're going to change this." It was
[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:54.980]   because of legal pressure that they were forced to do this. So this is, I don't think it's going to
[01:46:54.980 --> 01:47:00.340]   last among other things. There are obvious they're really applying huge pressure.
[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:04.020]   Their argument, which I've been asking people who know the law because I don't,
[01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:08.660]   that the big problem with this law is that it might be unconstitutional because of the
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:12.980]   interstate commerce rules. Sure, the old commerce rules. But nonetheless,
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:15.940]   it's pressure and Apple's going to want to have to find a solution other than
[01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:20.580]   fighting it out. I doubt they're worried about the state stuff, but they probably would be worried
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:24.580]   about federal stuff and they're absolutely investigations going on at the federal level as well.
[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:28.420]   And then there's Russia. There's Russia. There's been Tim and the Dclaws. If you do a multi-step
[01:47:28.420 --> 01:47:32.500]   and dim and Dclaws, I'm talking like eight, nine, ten, maybe fifteen steps where you got to,
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:36.260]   "Yes, I know." You know you want to delete stuff in certain apps, you got to tell it 12 times,
[01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:41.300]   you want to delete it. If you take this app and you put this on that didn't come from the App Store,
[01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:45.540]   you warranty is voided or you get less warranty. Do you agree? Do you agree? Do you make it just
[01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:49.300]   such an irritant that nobody wants to put that crap on there? But you can say, "Hey, but we're
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:54.100]   doing it." If they really want to put it on there, they just have to agree to these ten pages of
[01:47:54.900 --> 01:48:00.340]   "We're not responsible and then you're okay." That's maybe an easy way to do it, but I don't know
[01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:05.460]   if that works. And then there's Russia. I don't know. How's your Cyrillic? I'm not sure I can read
[01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:12.500]   this, but I can tell you what it says. iPhone. You see the iPhone word there? That's a real word.
[01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:16.980]   According to Mac Rumors, who apparently has some Russian translators on staff,
[01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:23.780]   Apple has agreed to show users a prompt. This was a request by the Russian government to install
[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:30.100]   the Ministry of Digital Affairs that you have to install these special Russian apps.
[01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:34.820]   Apple has reportedly agreed to show a user a prompt when first setting up a device in Russia
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:41.380]   to pre-install government-approved apps. This is from the Russian publication, Védómosci.
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:47.780]   It's not forcing users to that they must install certain government apps. It is that
[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:55.060]   during the setup process, the user has to be offered their selection of certain apps that
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:49:00.100]   were created by Russian companies. Certainly things that are complying with Russia's rules
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:05.140]   on the internet. It's not necessarily spy apps, by the way. We should just say it's Russian
[01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:11.620]   government apps. What Russia is trying to do is foster home development of apps. These apps are
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:20.980]   by Russian developers. They have all these Russian hackers that they have to find other jobs for.
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:26.340]   And Apple does say it would be equivalent to jailbreaking to do this. I think this is maybe a
[01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:32.340]   good compromise. This is like the browser ballot in Europe. You give people a choice and if they
[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:38.820]   don't feel like they want to do it. According to OpenSignal, the iPhone 12 is actually slower
[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:50.260]   at both 5G and LTE than any Android device. Samsung dominates the rankings for the top 25 fastest
[01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:57.380]   5G smartphones. This greatly affects the 12 blocks in the United States that you actually get.
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:50:05.860]   Well, it's not just 5G. It's also LTE. But you do see an increase. Apple 5G smartphone users
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:12.420]   see the greatest jump in download speeds in 5G areas. So you do get a bigger improvement
[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:17.300]   from Apple phones. But nonetheless, according to this. They started from way behind. I mean,
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:21.620]   it didn't embarrass the biggest improvement. But they were the furthest behind. So they didn't
[01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:28.420]   actually catch up with Android. But those of us who will probably never see 5G as well.
[01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:34.820]   Who cares? I'm like, yeah, whatever. Yeah, who cares? Yeah. But I guess if your goal,
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:38.340]   you're only going buying a smartphone where they have, I want the one that's fast,
[01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:43.780]   asked is 5G. You probably should buy an iPhone. Because the distance between between,
[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:48.660]   I know that this is between 45 megs a second 55 megs a second is going to make a difference.
[01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:54.420]   This summer, like millions and millions of people worldwide are going to find out what
[01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:59.620]   happened to mobile broadband while they were at home. I certainly have not used my hotspot.
[01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:08.740]   And I probably this actually today is the one year anniversary of the last time I was more than
[01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:14.100]   two miles away from my house. So this is a lot of people going to have to figure out like what
[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:18.820]   new towers have been installed. I understand there's a new CVS in town. I'm excited about
[01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:22.420]   checking it out now that now that I've actually hit the one year anniversary, I will take my bike
[01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:27.460]   on longer bike rides. I just something about like ADHD wanted me to say, okay, at least make
[01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:31.220]   it to a year. But yeah, a lot of people are going to figure out what changes have been made to
[01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:34.900]   infrastructure in the past year because a lot of this stuff has just not been used.
[01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:40.500]   I have to admit my problem now is that I go days without leaving and I go, oh, I need I need
[01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:43.780]   more coffee. We ran out of coffee today because over this morning because I was like, oh, do I
[01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:47.940]   really have to leave the house? Like I got this all figured out now. I got this all figured out.
[01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:53.140]   I'm getting my first shot tomorrow. I can't wait to leave the house. Yay.
[01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:58.500]   You're going to get to watch me decline through the through the day to mark. I'm getting it before
[01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:04.020]   the shows at 9.30 a.m. Windows Weekly. I'm going to start looking a little peeked by the end of
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:07.300]   Twig. I might be feinting. I don't know. We'll see. I don't know. Do you know what brand you're
[01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:10.740]   getting? I don't know yet. It's a two shot. So I know it's not the Johnson and Johnson,
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:16.100]   but it's a double shot. They haven't told me yet. I'm sure I'll know unless they blindfold me.
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:23.300]   I'm sure I'll find out once. It's not even so you take photos. He never had a second shot at home.
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:27.620]   There's a certain foody quality that the modernity is.
[01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:37.380]   Opie's making a deal with Apple Studios. First look, Phil, deal. What? That's Opie, isn't it?
[01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:43.300]   Opie. Yes. Ron Howard. He'll always be an Opie to me. Thank you. He and his partner Brian
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:49.700]   Grager are produced, made a deal to produce a slate of scripted movies exclusively for Apple.
[01:52:50.340 --> 01:52:55.460]   They've locked in Vigo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, and Joel Edgerton to lead an international ensemble
[01:52:55.460 --> 01:53:03.620]   cast for the MGM Thai Cave Rescue Drama 13 Lives. Those 13 little kids, I hope Elon Musk
[01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:09.860]   plays a little role in this movie. They'd be very funny. So there's going to be a lot more movies.
[01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:16.500]   Ron Howard's been working with Grager for 36 years as Imagine. You've seen those imagined films.
[01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:25.060]   The cracks are building quickly in Hollywood. It's really interesting. I'm sure that it was
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:31.700]   expensive. Everybody in their brother looked at Netflix and said, "We've got to do our own original
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:37.620]   content." That's been such a success. Netflix transitioned from DVD by mail to
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:42.980]   "You've got to see what's new on Netflix." I think they're sustaining the quality. Boom, boom,
[01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:46.260]   boom. Look at all the Oscar nominations for them.
[01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:55.540]   Part of it now is that HBO Max is normalizing it with what they're doing with day and date releases.
[01:53:55.540 --> 01:54:02.340]   Amazon possibly will turn the corner at some point and produce a bunch of… They've had a
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:08.500]   couple of things that have done well. Disney, of course, is just crushing it. And then, of course,
[01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:14.500]   Apple. I'm kind of interested to see what happens with Foundation. It's either going to be amazing
[01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:17.300]   or a horrible train wreck, and I just can't figure out which one.
[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:19.380]   Can't wait, though. We'll all be watching.
[01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:21.540]   Oh, no, no, we're all… There's going to be watch parties.
[01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:26.420]   Look at the… It's funny because I get screeners because I'm in the Screen Actors
[01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:29.700]   Guild. I get screeners for all the movies for the Screen Acticals Award.
[01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:32.420]   Most of them I go, "I already saw…" Because they're all on Netflix.
[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:36.900]   They're all on Netflix. Best Picture nominees yesterday,
[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:44.580]   "Mank is Netflix," right? No Mad Land was… Was that Netflix? I can't remember. I saw it on
[01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:46.180]   streaming. I think it's Hulu.
[01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:49.860]   Hulu, maybe. Yeah, that's right. It's Hulu. Trial of Chicago 7 Netflix.
[01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:58.020]   I mean, this is a different world. Of course, it is the year of COVID, but everybody's got to
[01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:01.300]   be looking at this and saying, "Boy, not only is it money-making, it's prestigious."
[01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:05.460]   Yeah, that's exactly what Stephen Spielberg was on about a year or two ago.
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:11.860]   Yeah, exactly. It was less about the legitimacy of making a movie and releasing it on streaming
[01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:18.100]   as a fact, like for Oscar consideration. There's a difference between how many voters are going to
[01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:23.380]   be able to see a movie that has been on Netflix for five months versus how many actually were
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:28.580]   able to leave the house, went to a movie theater, saw even a set up screening for it and come back
[01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:32.980]   in. He felt as though streaming movies would have an unfair advantage.
[01:55:32.980 --> 01:55:38.740]   Okay. Imagine his apparently had deals with Apple for a while. They did the Peanuts in Space
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:42.500]   Secrets of Apollo 10. I missed that one.
[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:50.340]   Dad's the documentary. They're going to premiere Peanuts 70th anniversary documentary that I will
[01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:56.340]   watch. There's an upcoming docu series called The Super Models. They have a deal with Lin-Wim
[01:55:56.340 --> 01:56:03.380]   and Mel Miranda on a movie called Tick-Tick Boom. Good name? Wow. This remake of a really,
[01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:08.740]   really good movie. Okay. Lee Daniels directing a reinterpretation of another really good movie,
[01:56:08.740 --> 01:56:16.420]   Terms of Endearment. He made help of the ideology for Netflix. No Oscars for him, but
[01:56:16.420 --> 01:56:22.420]   for that. But yeah, that's a smart move on Apple's part. And you're right.
[01:56:22.420 --> 01:56:27.140]   Can you imagine the bidding war that went on? And creators must love it, Alex.
[01:56:27.140 --> 01:56:35.860]   Never been a better time. Yeah. Never been about it. Apple has made it an absolute point.
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:40.500]   And I appreciate them for this. I used to climb them for it because they kind of take it too far
[01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:45.940]   sometimes. But I'll give them credit for at least trying. They're going out of their way to make
[01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:54.100]   sure there is full rainbow representation in all of the content. So given Lee Daniels a shot,
[01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:58.820]   it's not that he doesn't deserve it. He's sick with it, period. But it has it's still an
[01:56:58.820 --> 01:57:03.540]   outward battle. Do no one please get this twisted. It is still an outward battle for people like
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:11.780]   myself. So to see Lee Daniels coming in, they put Oprah on right away. Karen, aka Whoopi has been
[01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:19.940]   a prime creator for them for quite a long time. So yes, I got to give Apple credit for that.
[01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:25.860]   And they're just amazing. It's not just Apple. I mean, the five bloods dot I'm sorry, the five
[01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:31.780]   bloods, the five bloods. That looks so good. Did you like that? You know, I love Spike Lee. And I
[01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:36.100]   love all those actors. And I really wanted to like the film. And I did not like it. Okay, maybe
[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:44.020]   that's what it is. I was more in love with the actors and the process actors and Spike Lee. But
[01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:49.620]   yes, the overall picture itself not one of the best scripts. Not the best script ever. Okay,
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:54.020]   that's good. When they blew the guys arms and legs off and he's just lying there. I thought,
[01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:58.420]   okay, I'm that's actually literally where I stopped. It was like, okay, that's and apparently
[01:57:58.420 --> 01:58:07.300]   it wasn't the last time. Let's see. Moving on. The Mac SSD where problem, which I think really
[01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:13.140]   is probably an issue with the measurement tools. Ben Lovejoy writing in nine to five.
[01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:24.900]   Mac says it's probably exaggerated. Actually, the piece was because Linus text tips and others
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:31.780]   on Twitter had said, we're seeing a lot of where. But there's a article at help desk geek that
[01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:38.500]   explains none. What you're looking at isn't really going to be a problem. So I guess if you care
[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:43.460]   about this, you'll follow it. I'm not worried about it. I have an M1, the Mac SSD. And no one's
[01:58:43.460 --> 01:58:49.220]   going to hold the machine that long. That's the part that's crazy. It's like a lot of the where
[01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:54.900]   conversations were like, well, in 10 years, you know, I'm like, we're in a different spot now,
[01:58:54.900 --> 01:59:00.900]   but it's not like 10 years, two years ago. It's a legit concern though, because you can't replace
[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:06.980]   it. This is saw, you know, it's part of the motherboard. So it's not like you could put a new one in
[01:59:06.980 --> 01:59:13.060]   if it did wear out. Right. Right. But if it was on a, say, $2,000 machine, I might be more irritated,
[01:59:13.060 --> 01:59:18.340]   but like fully loaded maxed out as 1200 bucks. Yeah. And then just back it up, bro.
[01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:23.940]   And Apple's finally done the right thing. They've replaced the word subscribe
[01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:28.980]   with followed in Apple podcast. It turns out, I didn't realize this, but according to Edison
[01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:34.020]   research, 47% of podcast listeners thought when you press the subscribe button, you had to pay
[01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:41.140]   something. That's the onboarding of new podcasters. And I think that's different. Right.
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:46.420]   New podcast listeners, you mean? Yeah. New podcast listeners and new podcast.
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:51.060]   See, it's funny to us because we've been here for a long time. And I've always said, I even say,
[01:59:51.060 --> 01:59:56.260]   subscribe, it won't cost you anything. Yes, true. Because I realized people think subscribe
[01:59:56.260 --> 02:00:01.540]   sounds like you pay for it. How many people can say that they're pushing 800 episodes? Not a
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:06.660]   lie. So you've been, you mean, you've been doing this for a long show? Right. Exactly. Like,
[02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:11.700]   if you go all the way back from the beginning, even before Apple's conflated podcast with a little
[02:00:11.700 --> 02:00:17.860]   white device and the spiraling thing, like, we all hated that because and we were all Apple people,
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:24.260]   but we're like, does it require not, you're not confessing and you're making people think
[02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:31.380]   that they need an iPod? But my original podcast listening came on a real 300, like little blue,
[02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:36.660]   weird, I don't know where that shape came from. I don't know who made that up. But it's, yeah. So
[02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:41.940]   unfortunately, I think that with the brand new folks coming and how many people I know just,
[02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:47.540]   you know, adding totally in my space that thought to this day, you still needed an Apple product
[02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:51.700]   to do podcasts. I'm like, look at the dashboard on your car. Here's the other thing that's going to
[02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:55.780]   that concerns me though. And I wonder what you think about this, Doc Rock. Now they're going to
[02:00:55.780 --> 02:01:01.780]   say follow, but it won't automatically apparently is this in 14 five. So we'll find out, but it won't
[02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:06.340]   automatically download them then. It's just assumed that you're going to stream it. And so you know,
[02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:11.620]   when you use Apple podcast or most podcast clients, you can you can subscribe, follow whatever to a
[02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:15.940]   podcast, but you also have to say or it has to be in your settings and now download them.
[02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:22.580]   I guess people, because they're doing a mobile, they just they just press play. I guess I did that
[02:01:22.580 --> 02:01:28.260]   today. Coming in listening in the car. Yeah, I used to download everything and now I download
[02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:33.540]   nothing. I'm worried about that because we count downloads as you know, yeah, so they're going to
[02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:36.820]   have to change the metrics and I tell you why. Here's here's the reason why for me.
[02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:43.060]   And now that people are, you know, the devices, you're making an executive decision how much
[02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:46.900]   memory you want because you're going to decide how much stuff is going to be in the cloud.
[02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:51.220]   The one thing that takes up the most space and everybody wants to give it credit for like the
[02:01:51.220 --> 02:01:58.340]   anchors at the mall are your photos, right? So the full court space gets smaller when the anchors are
[02:01:58.340 --> 02:02:03.300]   bigger. So as these super stores are getting huge, the mall is giving them all that space. So you're
[02:02:03.300 --> 02:02:09.300]   going to want people to hear the podcast have it disappear so that it's not sitting there taking
[02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:15.060]   space, especially if you take a show like this, the video portion of it. Yes, he's a relatively large
[02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:20.340]   young guy, right? Yeah, right. And it doesn't unless you know how to go in and set your abs to
[02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:26.100]   delete after XYZ time and so forth, so on and so many people don't know how to do that. And so
[02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:31.300]   the streaming and with, you know, quote unquote fake 5G and all that getting faster, the streaming
[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:34.180]   experience is pretty flawless. Advertisers are not going to like it.
[02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:40.900]   Yes. Because it's going to because if I get a listen for somebody streaming the first five
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:46.180]   minutes of the show, they don't get a listen for their ads. They don't they don't equate. That's
[02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:49.860]   kind of a problem people have with numbers on YouTube right now, right? Yeah, they're going to
[02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:54.500]   have to come up with some different duration and things like that. But you know, yeah, it's kind
[02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:59.700]   of weird. I do think the idea of about listening is though, here's what the demos didn't match,
[02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:05.700]   right? There were times where you guys would get into a very good conversation about something.
[02:03:05.700 --> 02:03:10.660]   And like I was listening to it in passing, I was being bothered by say the small person that's,
[02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:16.100]   you know, so what I would do is listen to it again. See, I've already downloaded it. You don't get
[02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:21.540]   to know that I listen to this three times. Okay. So in a way, it gets better. I hope people do
[02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:26.980]   what you do. On the murder mystery ones for sure. If on the murder mystery ones or even some of
[02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:31.140]   the political ones, maybe that's why they get so many. Maybe that's why their numbers are so
[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:37.380]   high on the murder mystery ones. Because people are relistening, you think? Yep. Go back and double
[02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:42.820]   check facts or listen again, or I'm about to make a purchasing decision. And I'm trying to remember
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:48.020]   what was that pick that, you know, Andy said, because Andy picks are cheap and Alex picks are
[02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:54.820]   expensive. Six seven Alex's, I need to figure out how to budget for it. And one of the things is
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:58.340]   that, you know, it depends on what the telemetry is that you get back from the player as well,
[02:03:58.340 --> 02:04:02.660]   because we've had a lot of players where we get to see, I mean, even YouTube now,
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:07.860]   you get to see what people listen to, you know, in that, and when did they tail off and what did
[02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:12.340]   they look like? And when you they download it, you don't often get that telemetry. And it's,
[02:04:12.340 --> 02:04:18.260]   it's super useful. Like we use it a lot. Oh, that was a bad idea. Like this was like whatever
[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:22.820]   that was, we look at it like what happened here? Why did everyone leave? Okay, there's, there it is.
[02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:29.060]   Yeah, I don't care about that. I start looking at that. I'm in deep trouble.
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:34.580]   We start, we look at it like, like just as input of, you know, what are we, and usually it's not
[02:04:34.580 --> 02:04:39.860]   something we said, it's usually like a make you nuts. Because we had that information back at
[02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:44.260]   tech TV days, Tiva would give you that information when they paused it, when they rewind, when they
[02:04:44.260 --> 02:04:49.780]   stopped watching. And it ends up driving you nuts, because you get too granular on trying to program
[02:04:49.780 --> 02:04:55.140]   to the numbers instead of just doing what you want to do. And I guess I found that as more of,
[02:04:55.140 --> 02:04:59.700]   I don't try to program to the numbers. I mostly just do what I want to do. But, but the, but I,
[02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:05.060]   but at the same time, it let us over time think about, you know, how we start shows and how we look
[02:05:05.060 --> 02:05:09.380]   at them and that's valuable. We would tell people like, Oh, by the way, when you, when you play those,
[02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:15.220]   when you do a slide deck, everyone stops watching. Yeah, like, like, you know, like they all stop,
[02:05:15.220 --> 02:05:18.900]   they all stop watching when you do that. And so I remember a podcaster who had numbers like
[02:05:18.900 --> 02:05:24.420]   that probably from Apple when the Apple started offering those saying, Oh my God, we just, we
[02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:30.820]   realized that we took 30 minutes or five minutes to introduce the panel. And everybody left by then.
[02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:38.180]   So now we get right into the first story. I, on the other hand, still take five minutes and
[02:05:38.180 --> 02:05:42.740]   introduce the panel before I start the story. So I've learned nothing from this exercise.
[02:05:43.940 --> 02:05:49.620]   I, are you fellas ready for your picks of the week? Would you like to do those? Sure. I already
[02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:56.580]   I are ready picks of the week coming up next. Let's start with you, Doc Rock your guest this week.
[02:05:56.580 --> 02:06:01.860]   What's your pick of the week this week? One of my favorite devices in content creation for quite a
[02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:09.140]   while has been these the little road wireless goes. These are basically a receiver and a transmitter
[02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:15.300]   wireless. What? That's a microphone? Yes. Now here's what's cool about these. Unlike a traditional
[02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:21.140]   lavalier pack, which I have many, the mic is built directly into the top. And so, you know,
[02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:25.940]   you clip this on your shirt or I've even done crazy things like clipping right here on the hat,
[02:06:25.940 --> 02:06:30.020]   you know, and have a full on conversation when I'm doing like a food. How's the audience?
[02:06:30.020 --> 02:06:36.580]   Is it amazing? It's road. So I'll just leave it at that. Road is extremely good at microphones.
[02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:44.580]   It's not, you know, a country man, but it's very good. Okay. Then this is the new guy. This is the
[02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:49.860]   road wireless pro two and you have there on the screen. The advantage this brings to the table
[02:06:49.860 --> 02:06:54.420]   is this actually two pieces so you can get dual channel. So you plus the guests if you're
[02:06:54.420 --> 02:07:02.260]   interviewing or a two person shoot. It can do built in recording on the receiver. I'm sorry,
[02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:08.660]   on the transmitter. So that's in case you have a situation where the audio dies or disconnects
[02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:14.580]   or somebody, you know, with an old, you know, push the top cell phone comes in and ruins the audio.
[02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:20.180]   It actually can record those elements into the packs themselves so you can download it and you
[02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:26.580]   won't have a broken audio. The range has increased. The connection capability has increased. The
[02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:32.100]   microphones have gotten better and they've made the little fuzzy guys that you sit on the top
[02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:36.180]   that sort of designed to keep them from making too much wind noise, aka dead cat.
[02:07:36.180 --> 02:07:40.500]   I normally don't use that. That's really a dead mouse. It's smaller. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:07:40.500 --> 02:07:45.940]   Feline people get really mad when you determine. I know. That's why I use it. That's what it's called.
[02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:52.900]   I'm sorry. So they made the newer version sort of not come off. So the road wireless go to right
[02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:57.540]   now, according to all the rest of my creator friends are just screaming and raving. Of course,
[02:07:57.540 --> 02:08:04.340]   mine only got here recently because well, Hawaii, but you know what? I'm not shoveling snow. 300 bucks.
[02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:08.820]   It's not cheap. But now let me ask you because I got to understand this. There's a lot of
[02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:12.820]   lir packs. Yeah, that's not bad. You're right. You're right. About the same or more. Yeah.
[02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:18.660]   So you had your you and your other person are wearing these. Correct. And then it does it transmit
[02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:24.980]   to this receiver device? Yes. And that lives on top of the camera. So does it go into the camera
[02:08:24.980 --> 02:08:30.740]   or is it recording? Yes, it comes with a cable. So you can jack it directly into the camera,
[02:08:30.740 --> 02:08:36.020]   but then you're also recording to the module. Just in case. Just in case something happens.
[02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:43.300]   There is noomer that there is a firmware update that will give the little box 32-bit float.
[02:08:43.300 --> 02:08:46.900]   And I don't want to have another Alex and Doc moment, but just know it's better.
[02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:52.740]   Now I noticed B&H is offering it with Lava layer mics. So you could plug a lav into the
[02:08:52.740 --> 02:08:57.060]   Oh, yeah, I didn't show you that because I love the lyrics over there on the back,
[02:08:57.060 --> 02:09:01.620]   but there's a little tiny puka. Sorry. I use go why words. There's a little tiny hole right there.
[02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:07.460]   I see the puka. Yeah. Yeah. So you can actually use a Lava layer like a smart lab, clip it on and
[02:09:07.460 --> 02:09:12.180]   put this guy somewhere else like a traditional style Lava layer as well. So it's you know what it was?
[02:09:12.180 --> 02:09:16.980]   These were 200 bucks, the old version, and they're highly versatile for what they did.
[02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:20.100]   And they were great. And I used to just keep them as a backup in case my real
[02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:24.500]   Lava went dumb. And then I realized I like these better, you know, because it's one piece,
[02:09:24.500 --> 02:09:28.900]   you charge it as you would be better from the base unit or the lab.
[02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:33.780]   The lab just because the mics are better because it's slightly bigger.
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:37.540]   Yeah. In most cases bigger mics normally do sound better, not always.
[02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:41.940]   Sometimes they fake it. So the things that they've done with the two with the dual channel wireless
[02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:46.100]   and things like that is absolutely incredible. And the other thing that I guess a lot of people
[02:09:46.100 --> 02:09:50.180]   wouldn't think of if you only have one person, you can actually put both packs on them and pick up
[02:09:50.180 --> 02:09:58.900]   stereo. Well, and ish. And all my my sister-in-law does yoga and she uses the the first generation
[02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:04.660]   and she's using a Samson mic. It's like a headset mic. And it goes into that little pack.
[02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:12.820]   So that's a standard. The the the puka is standard. The puka. Yes. So you could you could throw on a
[02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:17.940]   DP, you know, what is that a 446 or you could throw on a countryman or any other standard
[02:10:17.940 --> 02:10:23.220]   model there expensive show I can tell right now. Yeah, no, I'm pretty sure and he's going to come
[02:10:23.220 --> 02:10:28.820]   in like under $10 because he's good at that. He makes up for Alex and I going like way left.
[02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:34.340]   So it's a good balance. This is I had no idea this existed. These are great.
[02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:39.460]   It's a great idea. They're great. And now if we get in now that we're getting our chance to go
[02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:44.260]   back and travel and things like that, it's also very handy for us creators in the road. What I
[02:10:44.260 --> 02:10:49.300]   bought it for specifically is I realized over my long career of doing videos and tech writing for
[02:10:49.300 --> 02:10:54.660]   TUAW and all this other stuff, I never really recorded enough like pieces to camera of myself
[02:10:54.660 --> 02:11:00.740]   talking. And I'm like now that all these people are doing stuff, I wish I had more historical footage
[02:11:00.740 --> 02:11:06.820]   of myself. So I bought a funny little rig. Yeah, instead of using the phone, I got a little Sony
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:14.500]   ZV1 and record yourself because when you look at it, I got everything in Moleskine, Moleskine,
[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:17.940]   but that's not the same. I wish I had video. When you're dead, you're going to want to know
[02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:21.940]   what you looked like when you went before you died. Yeah, so we could do the thing like Andy said
[02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:25.380]   and make the video when you get to be my age. You want to know what you looked like when you were
[02:11:25.380 --> 02:11:32.180]   young and beautiful. I'm pretty closely on. Unfortunately, I have a lot of video of when I was younger
[02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:37.860]   and I was not beautiful. So the illusion is ruined. I far prefer not to know to be honest with you.
[02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:45.380]   Really nice pick. I love that. It would work with any camera that had a audio mini Jack in
[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:49.780]   like most DSLR. Yeah, so but there's the key. So suppose you have a little camera or something
[02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:53.460]   that doesn't have one, you can even use it with an iPhone. Yeah, but just record offline.
[02:11:53.460 --> 02:11:58.180]   Because it records to, you can just stick the two together in any editing software. Now,
[02:11:58.180 --> 02:12:02.420]   stick in the audio and video together. Just stick it up. It's super simple. Nice.
[02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:10.100]   Wireless go to from Rode R-O-D-E. Andy and I co, I hope your pick is cheap.
[02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:17.940]   Five bucks or free. I love it. You know, see, that's why you're always thinking here.
[02:12:17.940 --> 02:12:21.380]   If you want to make sure there's some cheap picks, make sure that there's like a freelance
[02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:28.100]   journalist on there because I got no money. It's perfect. So the, I just discovered this
[02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:32.740]   website and like collection of apps for iOS and Mac just last week. And I've been really,
[02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:38.500]   really loving it. It is the animated knots website. You go to animated knots.com. And they are just
[02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:44.260]   tutorials on how to tie pretty much every kind of knot, including like surgical knots, horse knots,
[02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:49.460]   decorative knots, every sort of knot you could possibly imagine. And they're really, really
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:55.620]   easy to follow instructions. And they're, it's sort of like a, it sort of gives you a power up.
[02:12:55.620 --> 02:13:04.180]   Because I've, I only learned to be be chiefly because of the number of times that I went with my dad
[02:13:04.180 --> 02:13:09.620]   to the lumberyard to buy materials to do whatever project we were going to do. I only learned how
[02:13:09.620 --> 02:13:14.820]   to do like a half hitch and another kind of hitch just to like secure loads on top of like, on top
[02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:19.780]   of the car. And I'm always known that, oh, well, isn't there this kind of an other knot for this
[02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:24.980]   application where it's, it holds securely? But then if you tug on one end of it, it just simply flies
[02:13:24.980 --> 02:13:29.300]   loose and you can easily undo it. And this will show you what that knot is. It will show you like
[02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:34.740]   all the common ways to tie a necktie. It will show you like ways to like, if you need to like put a,
[02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:39.780]   put a bind around a, around a pot so you can hang it up. That's the, that's the way it'll work. And
[02:13:39.780 --> 02:13:44.340]   also it's just fun to like tie these knots and it makes it really, really easy to follow. It's,
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:50.340]   it's not a video. It's more like a stop motion thing. So as a result, it's very, very easy to
[02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:55.540]   like, okay, stop there. Where is that cord? End of that cord going? Okay, it's going around and behind
[02:13:55.540 --> 02:13:59.940]   not around and through. Okay, I got it. It's a lot easier than the dog goes in the ditch and then
[02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:05.220]   comes up over the loop and then the cloud forms above. And I can never figure those out. I find
[02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:10.180]   the story is harder to remember than the actual car. So I don't really work with me. And it's free.
[02:14:10.180 --> 02:14:16.340]   If you go, if you go to the website, it's free. They also have a $5 app for, for a desktop and for
[02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:21.300]   the phone. I bought the app chiefly because it was one of those, I really want you to have some money,
[02:14:21.300 --> 02:14:26.580]   please take some money from me because this is so cool. And also I do imagine that at some point,
[02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:31.220]   I will, I will have forgotten all about this app that's like buried in a folder on my phone
[02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:35.940]   until like I'm in like a tough situation, like stranded with the car and like, Oh, wait a minute.
[02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:40.500]   I know, I know exactly how to create how to create a hammock knot because it's probably here on the
[02:14:40.500 --> 02:14:45.300]   web, here on the website or here in the app. So if it might consume five bucks to conceivably save
[02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:52.660]   your life, that's a good value when any entity really good. I feel like I'm a little less manly
[02:14:52.660 --> 02:14:58.500]   because I don't know how to do a close hitch. So I'm going to go there today. Animated knots.
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:03.940]   Dot com. I have to admit, I use, I keep it around you. You're absolutely right, Andy. I have another
[02:15:03.940 --> 02:15:09.620]   one that's called, I think it's a knots 3D or whatever. And it same thing. I'll be somewhere and I just go,
[02:15:09.620 --> 02:15:14.980]   Oh, I need to figure that. I need to not. And I totally have it on the phone is totally worth it.
[02:15:14.980 --> 02:15:20.020]   Like having a not app on the phone. Yeah. This is a genius. Yeah, I forget all the knots we had in
[02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:25.700]   the military in the army, except for a couple. And like, these are coming super handy. So this is
[02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:37.460]   super dope. I watch a reality show called below deck. And it's all about yachting. And invariably,
[02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:42.340]   I don't know why every single season, there's some newbie who doesn't know how her to do her knots.
[02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:49.060]   And then the bossing is spending days. Come on, you could do this teaching them nuts. So, you know,
[02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:54.980]   if you've ever seen as the YouTube algorithm ever shown you people who are just super super
[02:15:54.980 --> 02:15:59.860]   super experienced deck, and so you are tying up a boat by not by leading leading down to the cleat
[02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:04.180]   and like wrapping it like that by just simply standing up, flick risk and get a loop, flick
[02:16:04.180 --> 02:16:07.700]   risk to get another contrary loop, flick list, you're gonna have a third one that locks the
[02:16:07.700 --> 02:16:15.140]   old knot like, okay, you're an airbender only with rope. Yes, exactly. That's crazy. Alex Lindsey's
[02:16:15.140 --> 02:16:20.420]   gonna wrap it up with his pick of the week. I went the other way. It's about an Alex. It's maybe two.
[02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:27.220]   So I think I showed this earlier, but it's just such a great piece of hardware. I decided to make
[02:16:27.220 --> 02:16:34.260]   it a pick, artificial pick, which is the ATEM, the new Blackmagic ATEM mini extreme. I so there's
[02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:39.380]   it's more mini. It's it's it is more mini. So so here's the let me I can actually.
[02:16:39.380 --> 02:16:45.620]   So here's the this is what's funny. It's very meta because it's the this is the switcher actually
[02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:51.060]   sending this is the switcher actually sending you the signal that is coming into it. So so what
[02:16:51.060 --> 02:16:56.100]   they did is they added of course they added, you know, four more inputs, but they added a lot of
[02:16:56.100 --> 02:17:00.580]   other things to a lot of buttons, which I thought I thought there was too many buttons and I found
[02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:05.940]   that there's not just the right right amount, except I don't use any of the audio. So this whole section
[02:17:05.940 --> 02:17:12.260]   is not used to audio is not great on it still. But what I will say is that they have super
[02:17:12.260 --> 02:17:17.540]   sources now. So the four ups and two ups and three ups can all be done out of here. And it is
[02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:22.020]   just an incredible piece of hardware. Someone who's been buying switchers for the last 15 years,
[02:17:22.020 --> 02:17:29.540]   the fact that I can buy this, this is $1300 comes with eight input super sources. It will stream. It
[02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:39.620]   has an encoder built into it. And it is, you know, it just there's so much you can do, you know,
[02:17:39.620 --> 02:17:44.500]   with it, I think is the is kind of the crazy thing. And it acts as a webcam. It's like an ultimate
[02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:50.740]   webcam. Oh, and the last thing is it'll record all of these isos to a to an external drive. You
[02:17:50.740 --> 02:17:56.740]   can literally plug a USB C drive into it. And it will record all the isos and save an XML file
[02:17:56.740 --> 02:18:00.980]   that you can open it in Resolver vinyl cut. And it'll all come in with all the isos and the edits.
[02:18:00.980 --> 02:18:04.100]   So you can just kind of fix your edit as you as you go. So if you didn't like the edit that you
[02:18:04.100 --> 02:18:12.100]   did live, you can you can fix it all later. And so it is a it's just more of it. They added a
[02:18:12.100 --> 02:18:19.220]   couple of things that the ATEM didn't have the smaller ATEM needs. I can't buy any more ATEMs.
[02:18:19.220 --> 02:18:26.180]   So this is and to give you a I'm gonna I'm gonna ATEM hold my wife with me.
[02:18:26.180 --> 02:18:30.420]   This was the little that's the mini. Yeah. Yeah. And and I still use it. I don't have it hooked up
[02:18:30.420 --> 02:18:35.940]   right now. But and then but this is the big one. And so it definitely is a little bit of a beast.
[02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:42.580]   I have to build print new right now. It's the this is the my Scorpio, which is that's it. That's
[02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:46.900]   that's a pick for another day, Alex. I've I've already mapped out my credit card. So anyway, so the
[02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:53.860]   but just an incredible piece of machinery. I can't believe that like what we have available
[02:18:53.860 --> 02:18:58.020]   to us now to make like I was talking to somebody about making the TV. They're gonna make a network
[02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:02.820]   about education. And I was like, it's never been better. There have been better time to do this.
[02:19:02.820 --> 02:19:08.900]   You remember that as a grass valley switcher or yeah, well, million dollars.
[02:19:08.900 --> 02:19:19.060]   Well, I bought it. I bought a Panasonic HS 450 in probably 2008 or nine for $26,000 that
[02:19:19.780 --> 02:19:24.100]   can't keep up. I don't think it'd keep the switcher. And so and that was considered like the low end
[02:19:24.100 --> 02:19:28.660]   cheap, you know, as inexpensive as it gets to do with those things. And it's got,
[02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:32.100]   you know, it's got a green screen here and you can it's got a still store that you can load in.
[02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:36.900]   It's probably a tricastic and downstream key. It has both in that one. Well, it's got
[02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:41.620]   yeah, it's got tons of them. You know, like it's got it's not just one. It's got a couple
[02:19:41.620 --> 02:19:45.700]   downstream keyers, a bunch of upstream keyers. It's got DBEs. It's got, you know, a lot of stuff in it.
[02:19:45.700 --> 02:19:51.540]   And again, it's it's a little, how much is it $1,300? $1,300, just a little under two
[02:19:51.540 --> 02:19:57.540]   galaxies. That's not bad. Yeah. And and it again, it's it's it's a monster. I want to show you,
[02:19:57.540 --> 02:20:03.380]   though, what we're doing, I have a mini and I tasked Burke to put it in a pelican case.
[02:20:03.380 --> 02:20:09.540]   So we're going to so and this the lid will have a screen. The idea is that this is going to be a
[02:20:09.540 --> 02:20:15.460]   portable four camera switcher that I can just carry around an a pelican case. So that'll be
[02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:20.980]   this is in process, but it's we're doing a much nicer job than I thought. I didn't I didn't
[02:20:20.980 --> 02:20:26.260]   kill a bike as a dope video on that. Make it either kill a pike or Gerald undone made a video.
[02:20:26.260 --> 02:20:31.860]   That's exactly where we got the idea. Yeah, it's so genius. Yeah. So this will be in an
[02:20:31.860 --> 02:20:36.500]   effectively case this size, I'll have a switcher, a screen, everything I need.
[02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:41.300]   Yeah, we've built them into the 15 10s in the past, you know, not with that little one,
[02:20:41.300 --> 02:20:45.380]   but that little one makes it really available. So we built switchers into the into the 15 10,
[02:20:45.380 --> 02:20:50.020]   you open it up and you got a big screen. Well, you know, my, my imagination is that I will have
[02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:58.180]   two boxes when we'll have my sky, sky link internet access for the boat. And the other one,
[02:20:58.180 --> 02:21:02.180]   this little thing will have and then I can just I guess I'll have to bring some cameras to and
[02:21:02.180 --> 02:21:09.300]   I'll be able to do the show anywhere. I just realized I'm going to Barbados kids. See you later.
[02:21:09.300 --> 02:21:13.220]   Just realize that Starlink is going to transform. Oh, it's going to be amazing.
[02:21:13.220 --> 02:21:18.100]   Ship cruises. Yes. Cruises always have no bandwidth. Right. I don't know if that's going to be good or
[02:21:18.100 --> 02:21:22.980]   bad. People are going to be like, now you can't get away. Well, right now, the Starlink satellite
[02:21:22.980 --> 02:21:28.740]   dishes that you know, it's a few, it's foot or two. It's big. It's meant to be fixed. It's not
[02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:34.180]   meant to be carried around. But I'm sure we'll get there. Yeah, exactly. Sure. Welcome to the
[02:21:34.180 --> 02:21:38.980]   Twote Network. I am Leo LePorte. This is Twitter on the boat. Twitter on the boat. The Twitter,
[02:21:38.980 --> 02:21:43.220]   Twitter on the boat there. And we have and we have a title. I love it. Thank you, Doc.
[02:21:43.220 --> 02:21:47.780]   For national waters. And I've already eaten three dangerous species. Come and get me.
[02:21:47.780 --> 02:21:55.380]   Those are our picks of the week. Thank you, everybody for joining us. We do this show
[02:21:55.380 --> 02:22:00.740]   every, every Tuesday 11 a.m. Pacific two p.m. Eastern time because we have sprung
[02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:08.500]   forward ahead of the rest of the world. Apparently it is now 1,800 UTC if you want to watch.
[02:22:08.500 --> 02:22:14.420]   We get to vote on me slash live. How do we get to vote for to get rid of? I would literally,
[02:22:14.420 --> 02:22:18.980]   I'm a single issue voter. If someone said I'm going to, that like I could not vote for
[02:22:18.980 --> 02:22:23.780]   somebody who votes against there's a bill going out, I think to get rid of it. And I could not vote
[02:22:23.780 --> 02:22:28.580]   for someone that voted against that bill because I would just think they're too stupid.
[02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:35.220]   I don't smart enough to be ready to vote on anything else. That's Alex Lindsey catches
[02:22:35.220 --> 02:22:42.900]   office hours live starts around five or six a.m. The meat of the matters seven or eight a.m.
[02:22:42.900 --> 02:22:48.340]   That's Pacific time. You can watch the recorded portion, but that's only a fraction of the total
[02:22:48.340 --> 02:22:55.380]   at youtube.com/AlexLindsay. If you want to zoom in invite to watch the to participate,
[02:22:56.580 --> 02:23:01.540]   that's at the in the comments of the youtube videos and the best part to register is just

[02:23:04.660 --> 02:23:08.980]   even have to go to the zoom thing. When you sign up for the zoom registration, you get an email
[02:23:08.980 --> 02:23:13.540]   every day of like here's the agenda for the next week. And so you get a sense of what's actually
[02:23:13.540 --> 02:23:20.900]   happening to nice. The man works insane hours, but it's by choice. It's fun. Thank you Alex. Always
[02:23:20.900 --> 02:23:25.300]   great to see you. Andy and I go when are you going to be on GBH in Boston next? Looks like my
[02:23:25.300 --> 02:23:29.300]   English thought it's moved up to Thursday because too many politicians keep asking for time on
[02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:37.300]   Friday. But so Thursday at 1 p.m. go to wgphnews.org to stream it either live or a few hours later.
[02:23:37.300 --> 02:23:41.700]   Very good. Great to have you Andy and Doc Rock filling in for Renee Richie.
[02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:47.780]   Doc, this is your chance to plug a polusa. Thank you. First of all, I'm going to build a
[02:23:47.780 --> 02:23:51.940]   time machine and go back and find George Hudson and William and Len and then slap them around
[02:23:51.940 --> 02:23:57.460]   about this day like saving time because Hawaii doesn't have it. You guys are cool man. You guys
[02:23:57.460 --> 02:24:02.660]   move and then I got to adjust accordingly. So I'm over it. Leo, since the last time we've been on
[02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:07.540]   besides the YouTube channel, I had a wonderful life change. I am now the community manager for
[02:24:07.540 --> 02:24:15.860]   the Ecamm network. I mean legitimate like paid job. So I am gainfully employed. However, if you
[02:24:15.860 --> 02:24:19.460]   you know want to learn more about that kind of stuff or live streaming or whatever, you can always
[02:24:19.460 --> 02:24:25.300]   find me on my YouTube channel or running the Facebook communities and brand ambassadorships
[02:24:25.300 --> 02:24:29.860]   for Ecamm. So that's what keep you busy nowadays. And I just appreciate you guys for being here.
[02:24:29.860 --> 02:24:32.340]   We could change lower third if you want. It's a little late, but
[02:24:32.340 --> 02:24:40.020]   you can you can eat. Can Michael uses Ecammel? I think I think Rosemary uses a lot of our
[02:24:40.020 --> 02:24:46.980]   remote team during pandemic has been doing their own switching using Ecamm live. It's incredible.
[02:24:46.980 --> 02:24:51.220]   It is very incredible. And it works really well with something like the A to mini or A to mini
[02:24:51.220 --> 02:24:58.900]   absolutely. Ecammel.com if you want to know more. That's correct. C A M M.com. They also have
[02:24:58.900 --> 02:25:07.060]   eyeglasses which we've recommended before. This is a really smart way to stream. It's again,
[02:25:07.060 --> 02:25:13.540]   like you said, Alex, there's never been a better time to just be a broadcaster. Man, I kind of hate it.
[02:25:16.580 --> 02:25:25.300]   Be honest with you. You guys eating my lunch here. Thank you, Doc Rock YouTube.com slash D O C R O C
[02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:28.180]   K really appreciate it.
