[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.400]   Welcome back to Mac Break Weekly. This is Leo LaPorte.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.400]   I'm not going to fool you out.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.400]   It's not Leo LaPorte.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.400]   This Alex, Leo is still somewhere.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.400]   Parts unknown in Europe having a good time.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.400]   And I'm here trying to make sure that we continue to have a show.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.400]   Fortunately, I'm not here by myself coming in from the northeast, Andy Naco, Handy.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   Leo's whereabouts are unknown only to God and Instagram.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.400]   Exactly.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   And viewing his Instagram makes me say that he's gone to a far, far better place
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   if his pictures are.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   Are people.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.400]   And coming in from Silicon Valley, Jim Dahlriple.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.400]   Hey, Jim.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   How you doing, Alex?
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   Hey, good to have you here.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.400]   I think we were talking about it before the show.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   This is the first time that Jim and I have actually been on the same show.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   Usually when I'm somewhere else, then Jim's here, but we've never actually been on the same show at the same time.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   So we're excited.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   This is an exciting day.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   And speaking of that, you know, I haven't been on the same show with Tanya.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   Ank Stuy there.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.400]   Hi, Tanya.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   It's great to be here coming in from a very hot day in upstate New York from Ithaca, New York.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.400]   Yep.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   It seems like it's hot everywhere.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   I think that this is, you know, for some reason, I remember it being cooler anyway.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   So we'll get into that as a whole other show.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.400]   So anyway, we've got a lot of news.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.400]   Leo really actually missed one.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.400]   He always complains about not having a lot of news.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   But today we actually have a lot of things because products are now in the wild.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   So first being Mac OS Hi Sierra, have you guys, has anyone installed Hi Sierra on their computers?
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   I've been using the latest.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   You know, I think it's always worked well for me.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   I didn't install the first beta, but I installed, I usually wait for the first two or three.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.400]   And it's worked great for me.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   Next week, the GM came out for developers.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.400]   I installed that.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.400]   It's been great.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   What do you think is the thing that is going to be the, Andy, what do you think is the
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   thing that's going to make this stand out the most for folks?
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   Is there really anything or most of this is really kind of back office making everything
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   right a little smoother?
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.800]   Well, absolutely the new file system because in the year from now, it will mean that everything
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   works better.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   A year from now, it means that we'll see a whole bunch of new features in the operating system
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   proper that will give practical tangible events, whether you're looking for files, organizing
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   files or backing files up or just realizing, or just not realizing that the catastrophic
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   hyper meltdown of all your data that would have happened if you were still using Apple's
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   1983 derived operating file system has been averted.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.800]   But it's also really important today because it's the reason why you should be a little
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   bit wary of installing it if you don't really need it.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   I myself don't see any user facing features from myself as a user that make it something
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   that I must install today.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.800]   And the fact that you have a brand new file system that has been pretty poorly documented
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   to developers because remember that Apple is building this all the time while it's trying
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.800]   to explain to developers, here's how you should support the new Apple file system.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   There's going to be a lot of stuff that isn't going to be problems that aren't going to be
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   discovered until you do literally have millions and millions of people using it as opposed
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   to tens of thousands of people using it.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.800]   You also have the problem where everybody who has an SSD, which now means pretty much every
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:28.800]   laptop user and even probably more desktop users than not maybe, you don't have the option
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.800]   of not installing it.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.800]   It is a non-negotiable default for people using SSDs.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   So normally I would be saying that if there is a full on integer plus one release of an
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.800]   operating system, hold off for at least a month just to make sure that all your apps are working
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   fine with it, just to make sure there are no barn burning problems with it.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   This is one where I would extend that by a couple of months.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.800]   It's not just day to day stuff.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.800]   I'm also concerned about what happens when my regular backup utility gets introduced to
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   this, what happens when I try to do a full restore for the first time.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   So there's a lot more that I need to learn as a user before I'm going to trust it.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.800]   Yeah, I know that I'm oftentimes I wait for one whole cycle.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.800]   I get the last version a couple of weeks before the new version comes out.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   But in this case, on my home computer I went ahead and updated it.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.800]   And so far everything's working well.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   Tanya, what's your experience so far with the upgrade?
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   Well, I take a three computer approach to upgrades.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   So I have a lovely iMac on my desk with two huge monitors and that is usually one or
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   two operating systems behind.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   I then have two laptops.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.800]   One of them is like the sacrificial victim.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.800]   It takes all updates.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   Everything, something new comes out great.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   Click the button.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   It's on see what happens.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.800]   I don't really try to do work on it because it's always, I'm always like, okay, I need to know exactly what
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   the default is.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.800]   So I wipe the whole thing and install the default operating system and then none of my stuff is on in.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   So it's just the sacrificial victim.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   And then I have another laptop where I try to keep it free up to date and actually do work on it too.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.800]   So I've actually been running high-sea era on both of my laptops for a month or two now.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.800]   And it's been completely fine for me.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   But I have this thing.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   There's some people who always break stuff.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   Maybe some of you guys are the people who always break stuff.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   I'm the person who stuff always works for.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   This is because a long time ago I actually worked for Microsoft in product support.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   This is like 20 years ago.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   And my job was to make Microsoft Word work correctly.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.800]   And once you got good at that, you can make anything.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   It's like I subconsciously just avoided the problems.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   Whereas I had a really good buddy over in the testing department.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   He could basically look at a computer and break Microsoft Word.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   Well, and I think a lot of it has to do with being methodical about how you operate.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   I know the, I have this, we were just doing a bunch of live streams in Germany last week.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:15.800]   And the funny thing about it was that we, the operator that I had handed off to was suddenly having a bunch of issues
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.800]   that I hadn't seen before.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   And I was like, well, let's do it exactly the way I do it.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.800]   I don't know why that works.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   I just know that I'm very superstitious.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   Like, oh, you never do this.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.800]   You never touch this button and you never do this.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.800]   And you never, like I have this whole set of rules that, that, for some reason make it run better.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.800]   But I don't know exactly why.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   Like, and it shouldn't.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   And it's subconscious for me.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.800]   I mean, the thing with high CR is people who like to talk about Mac operating systems,
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.800]   which I'm sure is everyone on this chat right now.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   We like to talk about APFS and we like to talk about all the little things it does and what everything stands for
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.800]   and everything.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:55.800]   If we were at an old time, you know, Apple user group meeting, we could spend like two hours talking about this stuff,
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.800]   right?
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   But your average, you know, Apple computer owner is just going to install high Sierra and be like,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.800]   hey, nothing's changed at all.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   But, but, you know, that, that is what it is for them.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   Obviously, there's a lot of great stuff coming.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.800]   But to give you an idea for anyone like listening to this who hasn't really been working with high Sierra or
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   Redbury much about it yet, the tidbit staff here on our internal Slack board spent some time this morning talking
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.800]   about this infinitesimal difference we discovered, which we were really excited about because it's something
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.800]   different.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:37.800]   And our infinitesimal difference that we discovered this morning is that on a Sierra computer, in a default
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:44.800]   finder window, there's this thing called all my files, which you can click and then it shows you like probably,
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   if you're lucky, all your files.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   But that is called something different in high Sierra.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   We discovered today.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   It's called, I believe, recents.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.800]   What's it called?
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.800]   Like recents.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.800]   Oh, recents, interesting.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.800]   So like, that is so trivial.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:06.800]   And yet, it's like, it actually took brain space for us all this morning because it was just something new to talk about.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.800]   So that's the one.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   It doesn't really affect it.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.800]   It just something new.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.800]   It's a tiny difference.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.800]   And we were like, hey, we didn't notice.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   Everyone was surprised because none of us on the crew had exactly, you know, had noticed that before.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.800]   So we were excited.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.800]   I think that the level of tininess of the changes that normal end users are going to notice.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:31.800]   Now, of course, with this, there is a report that there is a, what sounds like a pretty nasty vulnerability,
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   which is the third party apps access to plain text keychain data.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.800]   And I don't know if you guys have looked at it.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.800]   Jim, does this seem like a real threat?
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   Well, it's not.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.800]   From what I understand, I took a quick look at it this morning.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   From what I understand, it's not only on high Sierra.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   Right.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.800]   So that shouldn't be a reason to, you know, make a difference.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:04.800]   That shouldn't be a reason to, you know, not upgrade to high Sierra.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.800]   But I think all of these threats, you would have to watch out for.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   I mean, it would be silly to just ignore any kind of a threat.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   But the fact is the actual vulnerability to make this happen hasn't been released.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:29.800]   And the guy that figured it out won't release how to do it until after Apple fixes it.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   Right.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   So he's taking one step, which is to publicly say, hey, there's a problem here.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   But without, and I think a fairly responsible step of, I'm going to tell you that it's all
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.800]   there.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.800]   My guess is he probably privately said something a little while ago and no one did anything about it.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.800]   So the next step is to publish it and say, and that's the way it goes.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.800]   And so I think that that's helping to kind of move that forward.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:59.800]   It doesn't look like you do, or it doesn't look like you need to give it admin access to
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   have it be able to do this according to the developer.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   Right.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.800]   That's right.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.800]   Andy, is this something people can avoid?
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   Is something we should avoid?
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.800]   We haven't seen it in the wild, correct?
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.800]   Right.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.800]   It's due diligence.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:22.800]   And it's actually a really good sign of the integrity of this developer that he's pointed
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   it out because one of the problems with security problems is that they're so damn valuable
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.800]   to everybody.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.800]   It is a commodity.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   You've basically discovered gold in your backyard.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   And actually, maybe the better thing is that imagine that you found like a big, big port
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.040]   of like Roman gold coins in your backyard.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.640]   And you know that technique and you're British.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.880]   And technically this belongs to Britain and you're supposed to like report it and they'll
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.760]   put in the British Museum.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.680]   Or you have the ability to simply melt it down and basically pour it into muffin tins
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:00.040]   and then say, oh, my, my, my, my uncle, Horace died and he was an eccentric and we found
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.880]   this in the walls of his house because remember that anything.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.920]   Remember that this is this is part of this.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.880]   These security problems are part of inventory.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.920]   They're people who are bad people, but they're also governments.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.360]   There are investigative agencies that have this big, big stockpile of here's how you
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.360]   can get into this Mac.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.440]   Here's how you can get into this phone.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.360]   And so on the open market, you could sell a vulnerability like that.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.920]   I mean, a vulnerability that gives you access to the entire key chain, that's got to be
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.640]   worth mid six figures easily.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.400]   This is the people writing about this over the summer that their apple and other companies
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.440]   provide huge bounties for discovering bugs like this, but they're not offering enough
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:45.520]   money to get people who people who are in this business to tell them that, no, we're
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:51.840]   going to, we're going to, we're going to tell you to, for $150,000, do not have this tool
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.080]   that you don't know that anybody else has.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.760]   Do not have the ability as a consultant to charge $200,000 a crack to be able to get
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.200]   into any phone that you want.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:07.480]   Or if it's a lower level hack, the problem of, remember that level stage one is to simply
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.760]   get into the device.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.600]   So if you have a hack that says, I get to basically get into the front door of this device,
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.320]   that's the most valuable thing of them all.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.920]   So if you answer your question, no, you shouldn't be worried about this.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:24.560]   If this is, if you were really, really, for some reason that I can't really understand,
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.640]   excited to get into high Sierra immediately, it wouldn't really.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.880]   And again, the mug is, the mug is only.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.560]   It's just that it hasn't been fixed in high Sierra.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.480]   The mug is still has, it sounds like it's been in the wild for, for a while.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.680]   It's not, it's just someone hasn't, but high Sierra doesn't fix it.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.040]   The big, the big problem is that, I mean, I even had to go, well, you were talking,
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:48.560]   I had to go back to apple.com just to see, is there something about high Sierra that I
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:55.040]   have forgotten about that is amazing and really even, even, even Apple's page, I mean,
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.360]   I've got it in front of you right now.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:01.240]   It says, number one, it tells you about, hey, we've got this new file system, which again,
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.960]   is kind of an SO, important, but an SO, Terra feature.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.800]   And then second, second marquee feature that we want everybody to know about.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.640]   So they get really excited about it.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.560]   We have a new video file standard called H E V C. Okay.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.240]   Well, and the third one, the company metal to high speed.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.240]   Okay.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.760]   Well, you're not, you're not, you get, and then you scroll down and you get into, well,
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.880]   the photo app has more features and the mail app has more features.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.640]   And you're not talking about, it really doesn't seem like stuff that we're seeing like an
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.680]   iOS in the new iOS, which totally transforms how you use your iPad.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.880]   But, well, in a lot of ways, this is like, this is like snow leopard, right?
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.800]   I mean, this is the snow leopard update, which in my book is one of the most important updates
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.440]   that they had before, which is that, you know, there was a bunch of things in leopard that
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:51.160]   were messy, you know, and we have to, I will say that both on the new iOS 11, which we'll
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:57.320]   get to and with the Mac OS, it's a lot in the operating system that has been pretty messy.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.960]   And also a lot of these problems are really, really hard to fix.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.720]   I think it was iOS nine, was it?
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.280]   It was a few years ago, where they just wanted for years and years and years, they wanted
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.840]   to fix the behavior of you want to eject a volume, but there's a file in use somewhere
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.360]   and it's going to prevent it from from unlocking the most annoying thing in the world.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:22.360]   And two Apple engineers were excitedly to their ex, they really wanted to know me to
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:27.160]   know how hard it was for them to fix that problem and how much attention, how much time
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:33.200]   it took to how many things it's some of these sometimes changing a feature is like changing
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.840]   the rug or the rug in your living room.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.960]   It's like, you think, oh, well, you just change them.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.960]   You changed a red rug into a red and blue rug.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.120]   Yeah, but you don't understand that we had to take every piece of furniture out of that
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.440]   room and find a place to put that furniture while we were pulling up the old rug.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.160]   So it's it can be deceptive.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:58.960]   But I do wish that every and also creating a brand new file system that in itself, that
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.760]   is like changing the mix of gases in the atmosphere in Earth.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.760]   It changes.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.760]   It affects everything.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.440]   Now, however, I wish there was I wish there were a couple of things that were really user
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:15.800]   forward that makes the entire experience that much more innovative, that much more interesting,
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   that much easier.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.800]   I don't see it.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.600]   I think they did.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:26.280]   And I think that they've been doing this for the last several versions of iOS and Mac OS.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:34.040]   And that's the the integration between the two that to me is where the genius of Mac OS
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.480]   and iOS is right now.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:43.680]   I know when I sit down at my iPad that a file that I've been working on on my Mac is there.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.360]   You know, I don't need to email it to myself.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.360]   I don't need to do anything to myself.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.360]   Everything is sync.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.040]   That's the way I like.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.840]   I have to admit, just with notes, I know that it syncs with everything, but I find it this
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:18:00.240]   fast anything that I keep a bunch of thoughts and notes just I've kind of gotten used to
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.320]   using it because it's just immediately everywhere.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.800]   You know, and I know it was just a very light app that I can draw in and I can do whatever
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:07.800]   I want.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.480]   And it just shows up on all the platforms so quickly that, you know, whether whatever
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:16.360]   phone I'm on or my iPad or my computer and I can just keep on and I don't do anything
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.760]   serious on it.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.400]   But I do find that the tighter that integration, you know, works.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.680]   And I have to admit, I was very slow coming to the the airdrop.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.840]   But now I'm just totally addicted.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.840]   It works a lot better now.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:35.200]   It seems like every for a long time you try a airdrop and it just would hardly work at
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.200]   all.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.200]   It couldn't find anything.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.880]   Nobody could figure out why and you'd go through and you'd make sure you're Bluetooth
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.040]   and you're Wi-Fi and all that was adjusted right.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.080]   And it still wouldn't work at all.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.400]   So, but then it kind of started working some of the time.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.880]   And now it's actually working most of the time.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.040]   So I may be moving like screenshots sometimes from computer to computer with it because
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.000]   it's very efficient.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.080]   That said, it was very efficient for a couple of weeks, but the last two or three days,
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.520]   it kind of stopped working.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.240]   So they're getting there.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.240]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:11.000]   And as Terry Kay says in the in the forums, the updates to notes really moving closer to
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.120]   some of the capabilities of Evernote, which is which is a good thing, which I kind of
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:18.760]   feel in some ways it is kind of this internal, you know, Evernote process.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.080]   Now, moving on.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.800]   Oh, well, and one the one thing I will say is that HEVC is really important.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.280]   I know that it's brand new for people who aren't paying a lot of attention to it.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:33.560]   We've been talking about HEVC within my community for about five years of wondering when it
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.360]   was going to get to a point where it was because it's so much more efficient, but really held
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.320]   it up was the licensing around it.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:44.080]   So this is the all the MPEG licenses and, you know, both, you know, a lot of the large
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:49.240]   CDN platforms like YouTube didn't want to use it because of the, I think, but I don't
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:55.560]   know for sure, but because of potential licensing issues and they're using not that.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.320]   So BP9 is really where they've gone, which is we'll talk about a little bit here coming
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.320]   up.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:07.880]   But the so the, you know, I think that HEVC is going to be a huge as we look at the larger
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:13.000]   file formats, you know, as we really start moving to 4K and being able to watch 4K, the
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.680]   problem with 4K is, of course, being able to actually see it, you know, is because it
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.520]   cuts you it's so much more efficient when you get to 4K, you just can't start sending
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:30.840]   people the same quality per bit at H.264 and still be able to make that work.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.640]   So anyway, so we'll see how whether people will have makes a big difference.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.040]   I do believe there's some support.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.360]   Does anyone know about the support for VR?
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.360]   I believe that there's some additional support for VR or just some of the metal to is going
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.720]   to make that more available.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   Yeah, they're essentially they're using that as a way to promote the new iMac, next iMac.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:57.400]   They're essentially saying that support for SteamVR, the Vive HR, Final Cut, Epic Run
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.000]   Real, Unity Editor, essentially they're on the on this page.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.880]   They're just talking about how the tools that you're using to create content are now
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.160]   going to be enhanced compatibility.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.720]   Partly, I imagine through making sure all this stuff interfaces directly through metal.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.120]   Well, and that's and it's been way behind.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.000]   I mean, Apple has been way behind in this area.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.920]   And fortunately, they're coming back up with a vengeance.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.120]   But also they're also moving some of the searches away.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.480]   Now, they're moving from Bing to Google.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.040]   How did they start in Bing?
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.040]   Was this just an Apple Google thing for when it started?
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:32.920]   Jim, do you know what the story was on how Apple began with the Bing search engine?
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:39.080]   I don't know what the backstory was of all that, but clearly it was something to take
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.760]   a shot at Google and bring Bing in there.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.120]   I'm glad they're moving back to Google, to be honest.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:52.040]   I think 99% of us use.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.680]   I use Google search if I need to search for something.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.960]   So yeah, I'm happy to see it.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.720]   But that means a lot of money for Google, too.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.080]   It means a lot of money for Apple, too.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.240]   I think that they're just for the iOS support.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:16.160]   It is reported, and this is from, I think this was on CNBC, $3 billion a year just to
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.200]   make sure that it's the default for your iOS app.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.360]   So it's not an insignificant amount of money.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:28.880]   I don't have insight information either, but I imagine that Bing made them a better offer.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.120]   Whether it was monetary or whether it was just simply here is the privacy, here is the privacy
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.920]   protections that we're going to extend to people who do searches in this mode through
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.040]   Bing that Google has not prepared to offer you.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:44.560]   I don't think that Apple would zing Google's, Google just to zing Google.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.240]   I think that would either be an immediate reason, again, like money or it allows them
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:53.720]   to do features that can do otherwise, or they just simply think that they'd like to diversify
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.600]   and make sure that they don't have all of their search eggs in one basket.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.560]   But yeah, there was a John Oliver last week of the week before.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:08.080]   I made the joke about how Bing was claiming that they have a, about their search integrity
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.760]   saying the new slogan is Bing America's favorite way to Google something.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:16.640]   Yeah, that's not exactly a big, that's not exactly a value add.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.920]   God bless them, but no.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.880]   I still, I can still remember on, I've been pretty good at calling things in the distance,
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.520]   but I can still remember when, when, when Google came out and I was like, why would anyone
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.080]   try to compete with Yahoo?
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.120]   You know, it was like, yeah, it was like, it's got a whole page and it's just a simple
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.120]   page for the search.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.120]   I don't understand.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.840]   I don't know how this is going to, this is actually going to turn out for them.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.360]   I mean, this is, this is stupid.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.160]   But why would I want to search for something?
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.160]   I can go to Yahoo.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:44.000]   There's a page that has every single webpage about the Red Sox all organized and rated.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.720]   I didn't, didn't quite figure that one out.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.760]   I think we're all showing our age now.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.760]   I think, I think Google was just feeling lucky.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.760]   Right.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.200]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:03.920]   It does look like Apple's HomeKit is starting to sink in with some of the streamlines and
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:09.040]   some of the reduction of, of overhead that they have, that they have added.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.920]   This is according to the Verge, that the HomeKit devices are suddenly booming.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:19.160]   The question it really is, is it, is this a result of the them reducing some of the restrictions
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:26.320]   or is it just that this is how long it takes for these kinds of products to get developed?
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.400]   I think, do you, do you want your opinion?
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.120]   I think that it's, there are a lot of variables in this.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.600]   And I think that one of the largest ones is just simply the popularity of Amazon Alexa
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.800]   and Google Home.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.680]   The problem, I think that with most home automation stuff has been you're trying to sell someone
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.640]   on the idea of, you give somebody their big, that big demo.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.720]   Like if you don't have Alexa, you give someone the big demo about how, look, and I got, I
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:55.800]   off to use, take out my phone and use a fingerprint ID to unlock it and then launch this app.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.960]   And then by navigate to that button, then K of this, and then someone just look at you
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.560]   and not say, or you could just reach up and turn it on like that.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:09.120]   It's the, this, you really have to have people who understand how good this can be with the
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.120]   potential is.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.240]   And when you have the ability to say, hey, Alia, turn off the lights in the bedroom,
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.800]   and suddenly you're in bed and there are no lights on, that's what get people.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.240]   So it's, it's not, it's not the sort of thing where it's going to be, it was ever going to
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.680]   be a revolution like the iPad or the iPhone.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.840]   It was going to be the slow grinding of hard boards.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.400]   It was going to be little by little more and more people find themselves in a position
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.600]   where home kit is relevant to them.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.200]   And toward that end, the fact that Apple has made the pain of entry for developers so
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.440]   much less than before, you really need to get to the developers, oh, what the hell, let's
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.160]   do that factor where they don't have, they're not going to have to spend several months and
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.480]   I can have to spend thousands of dollars of their own money to just simply get the ability
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.120]   to do the stuff, give people the ability to simply say, hey, wouldn't it be cool if my
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.920]   app did this or wouldn't it be cool if my always on, always connected toaster was able
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.400]   to, able to talk to HomeKit and just let them do it.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.000]   And that's how the awesome happens.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.640]   Now, Jim, in, in a fragmented market, does this, does this look like the smart watch environment
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.560]   where, you know, Apple kind of came into a fragmented market, started slow and now has
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.000]   kind of a dominant position with iWatch?
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.040]   Do we think that HomeKit has the, the chance of kind of doing the same thing into that highly
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.520]   fragmented market?
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:30.120]   You know, when I look at home automation and HomeKit, I'm kind of like the person that
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.040]   Andy was just talking about.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:40.960]   I, I, I see the potential of HomeKit, but if all I have in HomeKit is one light bulb,
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.560]   then I'm not, I'm not going to bother with that.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.320]   I can go and buy a light bulb now and hook it up to my phone, but no, I want to be able
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:55.560]   to, when, when it hits its potential, that's when I'll go in and say, okay, redo my Home
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:01.240]   so that it knows when I walk into this room and I say, do this, it's going to lower the
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:06.480]   shades and it's going to turn on the TV and it's going to, my Apple TV is going to come
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.640]   on and the lights are going to dim and everything happens because I'm there.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.080]   That's the potential.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.440]   And that's where I'll jump in right about there.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.280]   Well, I'm not going to jump in beforehand.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.240]   Yeah, I just don't see the point.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.240]   Go ahead, Tanya.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.360]   I was going to say I've been thinking about HomeKit a lot recently and also thinking about
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.200]   why it was in my own home.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.720]   There is not very much in the way of HomeKit devices, although I think there will be soon.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:38.840]   And I think as the devices have gotten a little better over the last couple of years and as
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:43.840]   I've gotten cheaper, people have also started to get to the point where they might be replacing
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:48.280]   something that a HomeKit thing could be the replacement for.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:54.360]   So if you, house already has 25 light bulbs that you bought in the last five years, you
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.000]   don't need another light bulb.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.320]   If your lawn sprinkler already has one of those manual gizmos where you can tell it
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:06.840]   to sprinkle for 25 minutes and then stop, you don't need a hose stopper.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:13.400]   If you already have your furnace installed with a built in, wired in thermostat, you
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.600]   don't need a thermostat.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.600]   There's like all this stuff.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:21.200]   If you already have it, it's too expensive to replace it just because it's cool.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.640]   But it's stuff starts to wear out.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.640]   Speak for yourself there.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.440]   I'm very capable of replacing things because it's cool.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:32.200]   But it's tough to wear out or like, my gosh, if I was having a new home built right now,
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:38.680]   or if I was 22 years old and just getting started with acquiring stuff, now is a great
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:43.920]   time because the stuff is more affordable, it's not quite the first ever products in some
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.160]   cases.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:52.200]   So I think it just really is going to take a period of time for people to reach a point
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.600]   in their lives with their purchasing decisions where it makes sense to get your first home
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:01.000]   kit saying and then it, or it makes sense to sort of do a room or you're redoing your
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   lighting.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.480]   But I do think for your typical consumer, it's just too expensive and sort of too fussy.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.960]   Or almost like too weird with a home kit door lock.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.800]   It's like, well, yeah, and if it breaks, then why?
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.280]   So it's just going to take a little more time.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.440]   But I think it will continue to evolve in like five years from now.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.000]   It will have this conversation.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.320]   Everyone in the room will be like, oh, yeah, I've got a whole bunch of that stuff.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:35.200]   I think that one of the things for me is that it has to just get to a point where it just
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   works.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.400]   It's like an apple way of doing things where I got the Philips early on and I have a lot
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.560]   of Philips bulbs in my office.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.360]   I kind of replaced everything with them so that I could kind of play with it and I'd
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:51.200]   set it all up and I made the mistake of this great idea that I would be able to change
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:56.040]   the ambient light based on the mean value of the TV, which is I almost gave myself an
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.360]   epileptic fit by connecting the two together.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:04.640]   We watched Raiders of the Lost Ark and the whole room is like, you know, and it didn't
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.640]   go well.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.440]   But just getting them to work, you know, you have a little hub and you got to plug it in
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.480]   and you got to get an app and then you got to, you know, I can see where you're going
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.840]   to get to a point where your phone already has whatever it needs.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.120]   I just, I buy the, when I get to a point where I buy the bulb, it's not significantly more
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.640]   expensive than a regular LED bulb.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.160]   And I just, and I screw it in and immediately my phone, you know, sees it and it's just
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.640]   part of that, that environment.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:32.000]   I think that that becomes one of those things that becomes very hard to compete with, you
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.960]   know, in other, you know, whether it's, you know, a whole different platform and so on
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:36.960]   and so forth.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:41.920]   As far as the, you know, like the thermostat is a good example of something that, you
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:46.240]   know, I put in a nest and then of course moved and I haven't replaced it yet in the
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:54.400]   new house and keep on looking at it because I just, it's so funny how badly thermostat
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.400]   are.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.400]   The thermostat controls.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.680]   It is, it's kind of an amazing confusion of interfaces.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.280]   It's on schedule and what's held and whatever.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.400]   And being able to just do that on my, on my phone is something that I kind of miss and
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.960]   we'll probably go back to.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.120]   But anyway, I also think with home kit, just with home kit, one thing to keep in mind is
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:21.080]   it's not all about like fun sort of things or changing the environment because you're
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.280]   in it that there are really practical things like monitoring the temperature in your freezer
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:31.080]   or your refrigerator or, you know, monitoring whether our door is open or closed when it
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.080]   matters.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:37.840]   So there are really, I think there are important practical uses that may peel more to budget
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.840]   conscious people or may be really where the foothold start really being taken into people's
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:46.480]   homes where those homes where people would otherwise say, you know, that that's frivolous,
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.480]   that's ridiculous.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:52.160]   Well, and I think I definitely, you know, a good, somehow ended up with a lot of doors
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.480]   in the house that I have now.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.480]   And the thing is, is it time to do which ones?
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.520]   I mean, like the exterior doors, there's a, there's all these exterior doors.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:04.440]   I don't know why there's so many of them, but anyway, so, but I, it's, it's this thing
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.640]   to like walk around or remember which ones to click off and, and all this stuff.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.640]   It's not a very big house.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:12.840]   It just has a lot of doors, you know, and, and I, and I, I definitely thought about the
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.040]   fact that, that I just want to be able to say, you know, how good night house, you know,
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.680]   like, you know, kind of like good night friends, good night moon, good night house and have
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:25.320]   it lock all the doors, turn on the alarm and turn off, turn on and off all the lights
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.480]   that I want to have turned on and off, you know, and, and to get back to what Jim was
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:33.080]   talking about is you just kind of want that to just kind of go away and be able to say,
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.080]   I'm going to give you a command.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.080]   I want to give you that command.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:40.360]   I just need to do all these things at one time and, you know, and kind of set it to that,
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.080]   you know, that state.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.560]   And I think that, but I do think that we're not very far from that.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.000]   I think that it definitely feels like that.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.680]   Anyway, we're going to go ahead.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.680]   Good.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.560]   Quickly, also the industry is helping us out by giving us sort of smart home features free
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.920]   with a lot of the stuff that we're buying.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.160]   We're not interested in that feature, but it comes with the fridge or comes with this
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.280]   new heating system, just like DLNA.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.560]   You don't know that this audio receiver you have has DLNA.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:08.600]   You never use them until two years later, you launch this app that uses it.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.280]   Oh, wait, why is like, Oh, wow, I can actually stream through this device everywhere.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.040]   So it'll catch up with us.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:19.640]   And I find it amazing how my kids just completely, my kid, you know, my eight nine year old kids
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:25.280]   will immediately, like they talk to Alessio's we'll call all the time, like just there's
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.720]   constant questions of everything from what time is it, how odd is it, or is it, you know,
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.360]   like they're just kind of used to it.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.680]   If for some reason they can't figure out why the TV isn't working, we have like one of
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.080]   those harmonies that works most of the time, but not all the time.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.320]   You'll just see them over there.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:40.720]   They'll just be looking at the little, you know, show and just like watching, you know,
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.240]   watching this little screen and they doesn't, you know, 70 screen or 10 inch screen doesn't
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.640]   matter to them.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:52.080]   But anyway, we're going to, we've got an iPhone shipping, iPhone eight, we're going to see
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:55.440]   how well it's shipping, Apple TVs and so on and so forth.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.600]   That's all coming up.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:01.480]   But I think that Leo has some important words that he'd like to share with us.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:05.800]   If I could just to interrupt for a moment to talk about our sponsor, shall I quick and
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.360]   loans, you know them best mortgage lender in the country.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:14.040]   I wish I had gone with them the last time I bought some one with the other guy, the big
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:18.960]   bank and it took them a month or more and we can't keep, they kept asking, it was kind
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.960]   of weird.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.600]   They kept asking for more stuff.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:26.440]   We had a fact, we had to go through and find papers, facts and took forever.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:32.240]   We got to the point where the guy was selling us our house was, said, what's going on guys,
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.640]   I'm going to have to sell somebody else.
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:34.640]   We almost lost the house.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.640]   I'm glad we didn't.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.640]   We love it.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.800]   We've been living there for four years and I could tell you if we refi or we're going
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.240]   to buy a new house, we're going to quick and loans because they've got a product for
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.200]   us geeks called Rocket Mortgage.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.440]   That's awesome.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.320]   It's an entirely online mortgage approval process.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.960]   There is no going anywhere.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.640]   You can do it from your phone.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.600]   You can do it from your couch.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.560]   You can do it from an open house.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:01.760]   You don't even have to go into the attic to find papers, you know, bank statements or
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.760]   pay stubs.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:06.400]   It's all in the app because quick and loans knows everybody.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.440]   They've got trusted partners in all over finance.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.880]   All you have to do is say, here's who I am, I give you permission to get my bank statements
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.960]   or whatever and they'll do it.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.360]   There's no getting up in the attic and faxing stuff to them.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.160]   In fact, because it's all online, it's all computerized.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:27.840]   This takes not months, not weeks, not days, even not hours, not even minutes.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:32.360]   Yes, literally, you could do it in an open house and be approved for a loan before you
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.760]   leave with Rocket Mortgage from quick and loans.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.280]   Based on your income, your assets, your credit, they can analyze all the home loan options
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.720]   for which you qualify.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.320]   Find the one that's just right for you that fits your needs.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.320]   It's completely transparent.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.000]   You'll know every step of the way what's going on.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.240]   You will understand everything that's going on.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.760]   It's simple and you'll have the confidence you're mortgaging with the right people with
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.280]   the right loan.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.440]   It's really great.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.120]   I can tell you it's how we're going to do it next time.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.960]   You should do it that way.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.560]   Go to rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:09.680]   If you're not buying a house today, don't worry about it.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.320]   Just book markets so you'll have it for next time.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.120]   Rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.680]   Equal housing, lender licensed in all 50 states.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.600]   And MLS consumer access.org number 3030.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.600]   Rocket Mortgage.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.920]   They're from quick and loans so you know they're good.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.960]   Rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.680]   Now back to the show.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.640]   The iPhone is now shipping.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.040]   Now people are able to actually get hold of them.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:39.520]   It seems Andy like it's relatively easy compared to a lot of the other announcements.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.080]   It's relatively easy to get to the iPhone 8.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:46.360]   Yeah, I mean I checked out the store on launch day and I would have had to wait all the
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.520]   way until today to receive them.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:53.920]   So it looks like a lot of naysayers are jumping to, oh look not many people are very interested
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.520]   in the iPhone 8 and that remains to be seen.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:01.080]   But I prefer to think of it as for the first time in a long time if you want an iPhone you
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.240]   don't have to wait a crazy stupid amount of time to get it.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.240]   So yeah.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.240]   And I think that a lot of us saw this.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.000]   I think that the interesting thing is is that and Jim would you, what do you think of
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.120]   the fact that a lot of people are just waiting for the 10?
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:17.160]   Well I think that there's a couple of different things going on here.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:25.840]   One is that the actual design of the iPhone 8 is almost the same as the iPhone 7.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:32.400]   So there was none of that process of having to retool to do a lot of the exterior work
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.360]   so they can ship them a lot faster.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.560]   We don't know what the pre-orders were.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:44.320]   So pre-orders could have been very good and they just ship them all out, you know, the
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.960]   people that one of them got them.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.120]   And then there's the iPhone 10.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.200]   That's certainly part of this too.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.280]   I think a lot of people are waiting for the 10.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:59.280]   Tanya, do you think that the 10 is for everyone or do you think that there is a large group
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.480]   of people that the 8 is going to be enough?
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.480]   8 is a big group.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.480]   Oh certainly.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:08.720]   There's a large group of people who even the iPhone 7 on that phone, the price is lower
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.720]   now.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.400]   So there's a lot of people who that's going to be great for.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.280]   I think that people who are going to wait in line at an Apple store are much more the
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.760]   iPhone 10 crowd.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:23.280]   And so I think that may be why it looks lackluster if you're just looking at a crowd volume at
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.280]   the Apple stores on launch day.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:30.200]   Yeah, and I think that it is interesting how complicated.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.960]   I've been trying to break down the like which phone to buy.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.440]   You know, if you look at for the average consumer, it used to be, well, there's the old one and
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.440]   then there's the new one.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.440]   And that's really all we have now.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.320]   And it seems that Apple has kind of really broken up this.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.480]   If you want a small, very inexpensive one, you've got the SE.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.480]   If you still want a headset, you've got the 6.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.480]   You're the 6S.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.720]   If you're just want something a little less expensive and you're willing to stay back,
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.720]   you still have the 7, which is the older one, then you have the 8.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:01.440]   And then it just seems, you know, and again, does anyone feel like the product line has
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:08.480]   gotten too complicated or does it does each serve a specific need that is important?
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:13.680]   I think it's going to be a little bit hard for people to, it is complicated.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.000]   It's maybe the wrong word.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.320]   I think that I suspect that Apple really is going to be taking a good hard look at what
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.960]   people buy over the next year to decide where the cuts need to be made.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.240]   I wonder if they just looked at the numbers and said, look, we've got the manufacturing
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.280]   costs down so far that we've already got the tool in.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.160]   We've got the assembly lines all set up.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.960]   We can basically support this entire line for another year while we figure out do we
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:45.400]   need to, is there really a market for a really good $500 iPhone or is that just not something
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.480]   that iPhone people care about?
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:53.040]   The most interesting part is the keeping both the 6 and the 7 in the line at the same time
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.440]   because those are so close to each other.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:02.360]   Well, there's a huge gap between the two and one has a headphone jack and the other one
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.360]   doesn't.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.480]   I mean, I think that's the reason that you keep the 6 is that you want a larger phone
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.120]   and a headphone jack.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:12.520]   Well, I mean, it's not the reason why you would do it last year.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:20.080]   I mean, it seems it seems odd to me, particularly a company that is they were so they were so
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:26.840]   clear on the on the lead in the headphone jack last year that they that they did this
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:32.840]   really kind of embarrassing spiel about how do you know that copper has been an element
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:34.680]   for over 2000 years?
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:39.320]   We're using a material that's 2000 years to listen to our music and you're just sitting
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.920]   there like I'm going to stop talking.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.800]   I'm going to stop typing in the audience.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.960]   Just look up and say, did he really say this bunch of garbage that I thought he said?
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.040]   That's how big they were invested in.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:56.760]   And they also have the much less expensive iPhones in the lineup to cover that.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.520]   I think that there's more to it than that.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:04.280]   I really think that there's an element of we don't know how best to price these things.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.440]   I think that the fact they've got so many models out there, particularly as such comfortable
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:17.760]   price nates indicates how a level of awareness that the ability to buy a really superb Android
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.960]   phone for $400 and $500.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:25.720]   It's not it might not necessarily be damaging iPhone sales, but it's it's interesting enough
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.840]   to the people who are following these numbers inside Apple that they want to see is it really
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:34.480]   important for us worldwide to make sure that there is a really low entry point for for
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:39.760]   the iPhone without going so far as to create something that is not we couldn't happily
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.280]   call an iPhone.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.280]   Right.
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:49.240]   And I will admit that I hadn't lost it recently, but I had an SE and and I loved it.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:53.160]   I loved having a little phone like if I'm going to go somewhere, although I think that my
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:42:00.560]   watch hopefully will take the take over that that holding of the littlest iPhone of all.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.000]   Has anyone gotten any watch?
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.880]   You could swallow it at border patrol.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:08.280]   My watch is on order.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.880]   Hasn't come yet.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:15.920]   And I get a watch after the the event of watching an iPhone eight and eight plus that
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.320]   I've been testing.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.600]   And what do you and what do you think of the watch?
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.680]   I love the watch.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.600]   So I'm a huge huge fan of the watch.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:29.400]   I mean, you know, it's it's really helped me over the past couple of years lose weight
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:37.120]   and just, you know, kind of understand what I do on a daily basis as far as exercise
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.120]   and stuff goes.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:44.360]   But there's always that component of, well, if I go out, I can listen to music because
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:50.680]   you can sync playlists onto your watch, but I still can't get a phone call or, you know,
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.360]   I can't really keep in touch.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:43:01.320]   But now you can and and that was that was a pretty big thing because like most tech people,
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:07.280]   anyway, I'm if we're away from our phone, if we if I forget my phone at home, I will
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.520]   drive a long way to go back and get it.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:21.160]   But when I was testing out the watch, I purposely left my my phone at home and drove away.
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.400]   And it was hard.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:27.480]   It was really hard to do because, you know, oh my God, I wonder if my phone's okay.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   It's at home.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.480]   What if somebody called?
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.320]   Okay, I have my watch with me.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:36.200]   It can now take phone calls without my my phone being there.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.920]   And I made some calls.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.280]   I received some calls and you were using your AirPods for that.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.440]   So I tried a couple of different things.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:51.480]   I wanted to to go to, you know, I didn't want to stand in an isolated area.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:44:00.560]   So I went to San Francisco with my father who was visiting and we went to the financial
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.440]   district but not around Market Street.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:07.320]   You know, where all the horns are blazing and everything was down down off the Embarcadero.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.320]   And so it's still a busy area.
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:14.520]   But, you know, not as busy as that whole downtown mess.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:23.440]   And I made a phone call to him and I have my phone up around my chest.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:27.240]   And he said, I can hear you perfectly.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:29.040]   It's coming in just fine.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.400]   And when we get out of the car, he walked one way.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.000]   I walked another about two minutes later.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.960]   We started calling each other.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:42.520]   It is amazing, the noise reduction that goes into any of these phones but also to the watch
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:45.080]   has been kind of astounding.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:52.720]   So after that call, while I was on the call, I said, okay, I'm going to start walking.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.280]   So I put my arm down by my side and I walked as I normally would.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:01.960]   He was still on the call and he said, I can still hear you.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:07.640]   He said, I hear a little bit of wind noise and I assume that's when my arm was swinging
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.360]   because I was walking.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.000]   But my arm was down by my side.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.760]   He said, I can still hear you.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:21.960]   I had a bit more trouble hearing him because my arm was down by my side, but I still couldn't.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:28.440]   And then I hung up, I put in my air pods and connected those.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:33.200]   And when I called him, he said, oh, now the sound is just amazing.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.560]   That's great.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.040]   So and that makes sense.
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:42.960]   Obviously you have the air pods with four microphones right beside your face.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:51.040]   Yeah, I had to admit last week on Twitter that I like the air pods.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.040]   Okay.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.440]   Like I put them off for a long time.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.280]   I even bought them and had them sitting in my bag.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.320]   I decided to go ahead and play with them.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.800]   And they actually work really well.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:03.800]   It's all I have to say.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.800]   Yeah, they do.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:05.800]   They do.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.800]   I'm completely with you.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:12.840]   I got a pair just about two weeks ago, it had held off for a long time and they're
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:13.840]   pretty good.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.320]   They pair really easily.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.120]   I can run with them in.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:19.280]   They're more comfortable than I thought they would be.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.080]   It's pretty good.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:26.240]   I still, I haven't given up completely on my wired ones, but I'm.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.840]   I'm spending more time on my airplanes.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.280]   I think it's different for different people.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.000]   And I've said this before.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:41.800]   If I'm going to sit down and seriously listen to some music, I'll use my future sonics,
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.520]   my any or monitors.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:47.240]   There is nothing better than those.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:51.880]   That's the premier thing to use if you're going to listen to music.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:59.600]   But for convenience, if I'm just taking a break and I want to take a five minute walk
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:05.160]   around, I'll just or I'm getting a phone call, I'll just pop in the AirPods and it's
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.520]   quick and easy.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.520]   They turn on.
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:12.040]   I can tap them and music starts playing and then I'm done and I pop them back in the case
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.680]   and put them in my pocket.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.320]   I always have them with me.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.320]   They're always in my pocket.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.120]   That's really my best feature for two.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:27.360]   And keep in mind the highest compliment I can pay this thing is that my AirPods are my favorite
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.520]   pair of earphones and I'm an Android phone user.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.800]   So I don't get the full benefit of it from it.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:37.080]   But yeah, I mean, the ability to and really it really is about just the ability to have
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:42.160]   this tiny, tiny little thing that I can just slip in my pocket, which is something that's
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:47.040]   not as easy as excuse me, even the wired headphones aren't as easy to simply keep in
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.600]   my pocket all the time.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:49.760]   It's like every morning I get dressed.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.960]   I take out my wallet, I take out my keys, I take out my phone and I take out my AirPods
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.920]   and put them in my pocket so that even if I don't listen to them for like three or four
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.480]   days, they're actually going to be there.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:06.000]   So yeah, this is probably if there are five, let's even say if there have been like, if
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.040]   there have been five perfect Apple designs in the history of the company, I think this
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.040]   would be one of them.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:14.360]   It's amazing the fit and finish of that entire experience.
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:20.360]   Like I am just like kind of, that I think that they do epitomize Apple's attention to detail,
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:24.360]   the way that the case closes, the way that they snap back into place, the, you know,
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.200]   like all the little things take away all the little stresses about having headphones.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:34.320]   I think that in a way that you don't see in a lot of other, I mean, I have a lot of Bluetooth
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:39.240]   headsets that I've tried, which is why I was so like, oh, another wireless something
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.240]   or other that isn't going to work.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:44.800]   And I mean, I have almost all of them and I've spent hundreds of dollars, thousands of dollars
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.120]   on these trying to figure out one that will work because I really wanted to be not dealing
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.360]   with wires and everything else.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:53.960]   I just couldn't find something that actually that I thought was acceptable.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:57.400]   And these are the first ones that I've definitely felt like it, like it works.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.560]   Has anyone used the Beats version with the W1 chip?
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.960]   No, I like good sound.
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.960]   You like what?
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.960]   I like good sound.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:07.960]   I like good sound.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:09.960]   That's not beats.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.960]   Okay, we're going to move on from there.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:20.880]   Now, now some people are having trouble with the watch as far as the way the LTE works
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.520]   and the Wi-Fi have.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:25.920]   Do we think that that is something that's widespread across all of them or is it something
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:31.040]   that is specific to a certain number of certain situations?
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.760]   So here's the problem with this.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.680]   People have said that this is an LTE bug.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.000]   And it's not an LTE bug.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.440]   It connects to the LTE network just fine.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.120]   The problem is with Wi-Fi.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:53.480]   Now, what the watch will do when you have an iPhone 8, it will, first, the watch will
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.840]   connect to your iPhone.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:03.440]   If your iPhone is not around, it will look for an authorized network, a Wi-Fi network
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:09.480]   that it can connect to and do voice calls over IP.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:12.000]   That's the next thing.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.240]   If it can't connect to a known Wi-Fi network, it will then connect to a cellular network.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:20.360]   So those are the three steps that it makes.
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:25.160]   Where it's running into a problem is that on your iPhone, if you've gone to Starbucks
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:30.760]   or McDonald's or one of these places and connected to their Wi-Fi network and come up with that
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:35.760]   interstitial page where it says, do you agree and accept the terms and you have to click
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:41.360]   a button on your phone, then you can surf the web.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.880]   On your watch, you don't get that page.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:50.200]   So your watch is getting stuck on that interstitial page where you don't actually have access
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.880]   to the internet.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.920]   But it won't move on.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.320]   So that's where the problem is.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.320]   Is it a bad problem?
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.720]   Yeah, Apple should have known that and they should have fixed it.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:09.120]   Now, I never had that issue when I was reviewing and testing my watch because I don't join
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.480]   those networks.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:16.840]   So I didn't have Starbucks in my phone or my watch.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:21.560]   So it never tried to join that free Wi-Fi network because it's so insecure.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:25.520]   I never joined the McDonald's network or any of the other ones.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:32.800]   The only networks that I had in my watch were networks that I knew and that were authenticated.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.040]   So my watch worked fine.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:41.640]   So people were coming up with this problem when the reviews posted and I thought, I never
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.360]   saw that.
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.880]   I don't know what these people are talking about.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:49.960]   And people were asking me because I posted my review and said, yeah, it worked great.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.960]   And they said, well, what about this problem?
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.000]   Then when it finally came out, I said, okay, well, that's why.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   Because I don't join those networks.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Well, I have to admit that I think this is a problem for many operating systems and but
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.840]   also a problem on iOS and Mac OS is this idea.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:05.880]   I'm going to jump onto a Wi-Fi.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:07.600]   I feel like it's a jump onto a Wi-Fi.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:13.080]   And if I can't get to the internet in literally 30 seconds or a minute, I'm just going to
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.080]   get off of it.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:19.040]   I'm going to turn that thing off again because it is a constant problem for me is that I
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:26.280]   do use some of the insecure networks like the United Lounge or United Wi-Fi on the plane
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:27.800]   or all of these things.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.160]   And what happens is my devices jump right on.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.400]   They're like, hello.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:36.400]   And they get on and then they hang on there and I don't have any internet.
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:41.080]   And so then I have to turn off Wi-Fi and everything else, just until I want to use it.
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:47.720]   So I think that that is one of the things that I wish Apple was smarter about is that I'm
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:52.520]   going to get on, if I can't ping something quickly, I'm going to get off that Wi-Fi network
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.440]   because it's got something that's stopping me from getting.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:00.520]   Does that seem like it makes sense or is it more complicated than that?
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:07.320]   The Apple Watch has to know from now on that, okay, this network requires an interstitial
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:13.360]   page, skip it and go to LTE.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:17.480]   Once they figure out how to do that, then it's going to be fine.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.480]   Yep.
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.160]   You want to say, Tanya?
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:24.400]   Well, I was just going to say, I believe Apple will be able to fix this on their end.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.840]   I'm sure they're working on it.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:29.360]   But something that I think people should just think about before they get on the Starbucks
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:35.160]   network or whatever it is, is if you can get your bandwidth situation under control, just
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.520]   tether from your iPhone.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:40.760]   That way you're going over the cellular network and it is going to be a lot more secure for
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:41.760]   you.
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.520]   It's more expensive, especially if you're downloading big files.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:49.960]   You need to think about, "Oh, is my Dropbox going to connect and download 2GB of stuff?"
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.520]   Or whatever.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:56.160]   If you just need to check your email for two minutes, it's really a better idea.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.160]   Absolutely.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:01.800]   I spent most of my time, I have a Verizon Wi-Fi that sits in my backpack that usually just
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:06.120]   kind of serves up everything that I want.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.120]   It solves that problem.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.640]   But when I'm downloading, a lot of times I'll be at an airport and I'm like, "Okay,
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.960]   now I'm going to download a bunch of movies or TV shows."
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:18.480]   It's usually for me like, "Oh, I got a bunch of Alton Brown goodies that I want to watch."
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:21.320]   But I'll hit download and that's what I use it for.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:31.960]   I also have the advantage of VPN so that I can log on to pretty quickly and bypass the
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:34.200]   more dangerous part of that work.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:39.480]   It's surprising that their Wi-Fi is around for so long and there's so many pain points,
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:43.800]   no matter what platform that you're on.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:48.640]   The number of times I've stood on a sidewalk because I needed to look up something or get
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.880]   something off of my notes app or whatever.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.640]   And why are you connecting?
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.640]   Why aren't you connecting?
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:59.760]   You're saying there's four bars of service, but, "Oh, that's right.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:03.000]   I can see the logo of an AT&T store two blocks away."
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:08.200]   The sign, the signal is just strong enough for the Wi-Fi to want to connect to that for
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.200]   the internet.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.880]   And the damping off.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:17.240]   You really have to, there should be utilities that let you say that do not automatically
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:21.560]   connect only to these Wi-Fi hotspots that I'm going to tell you.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:27.440]   And not only that, but if I am telling you to connect to an iOS and macOS, there needs
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:32.960]   to be the ability to say, "By the way, this Wi-Fi hotspot is actually a cellular connection.
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.040]   It is metered."
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:39.480]   So, please, if you see any other Wi-Fi hotspot that I've told you about, do not keep the
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.800]   connection to the metered connection.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:49.480]   And iOS 11, I'm still really disappointed that I can't just long press on the Wi-Fi icon
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:53.440]   and then pick from a pop-up or even through Bluetooth.
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.280]   Pick a Wi-Fi source or pick a Bluetooth connection to switch to.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:03.120]   I'm still bummed that I have to go through settings in order to do that.
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:05.120]   My iPad course doesn't have 3D touch.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:08.040]   I know it's a little bit shorter if you have 3D touch.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:11.800]   But there's so many pain points in Wi-Fi that I wish that a lot of those would be addressed,
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.680]   not just on iOS, but again, pretty much in every of the devices that I use.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:19.280]   Well, I feel like there's a lot of pain points in iOS 11 as well.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:23.920]   Has everyone got an iOS 11 installed?
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:31.520]   I feel like, is it just me or is the TV app kind of like the worst app ever?
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:38.480]   Like, we could have said that a few months ago before I was 11.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:43.000]   See, the TV app for me, it's on that list of things that the first few times I used it,
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:49.720]   it made such a non-impression that I kind of forgot that it's like a stock app.
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:54.640]   It's not even aware that this is an app on my device.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:57:00.240]   And what has to happen is that I'll have to read about how the TV app connects to lot
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.880]   of varying porn sites without it being asked.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:07.040]   Then I'll launch it to see what that bug is or so and tell me how wonderful this app is.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.400]   Really, I get, I just do the Notes app.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.680]   I don't use it day to day, but I know it exists.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.880]   The TV app, it's like, oh, that's the Netflix app.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:16.880]   No.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:19.000]   Oh, you mean my sling app for accessing sling?
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   No.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   So what is the TV app doing?
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.280]   Well, the thing about it is that it's like you click on it and my general experience,
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:28.960]   if you're not connected to a fast internet connection, is that you just get a white screen
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:33.680]   and then you sit there and wait for like two minutes while it decides that, oh, right,
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.680]   you're not connected.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:37.800]   And then I'll show you some of what you downloaded, but I'm not really going to show you everything
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:41.320]   that you downloaded because I don't know if you're ready for that.
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:48.120]   It just seems like this mess of, it wants to work.
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:51.840]   And the biggest complaint I have is that as someone travels a lot, is that if I'm not
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:58.840]   connected to a really fast connection, it expects you to have 60 up and down to actually
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:57:59.840]   operate properly.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:03.440]   Jim, am I off here or is it still a work?
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.440]   No, I think it's still a work in progress.
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:10.360]   To me, the bigger work in progress is single sign on.
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:15.840]   You know, being an XFINITY customer, I was expecting single sign on.
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:16.840]   Oh my God.
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.520]   It's really work and it doesn't.
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:25.360]   And if single sign on works, then I think the TV app works a lot better.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.360]   Right.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:32.240]   So, I think we're as a Comcast customer anyway, when single sign on doesn't work and I still
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:38.320]   have to go through and authenticate each app, I just give up.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:40.680]   I think that it's dangerous.
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.880]   So a lot of the media companies, and I think the media companies, this is a whole different,
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:49.400]   probably a different show, but the stand on a soapbox, just a second, because we're watching
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:53.800]   this, I've had to be on a bunch of panels at different conferences over the last two
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:54.800]   weeks.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:55.800]   So I've been thinking about it a lot.
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:59:01.600]   The thing that I think is that Hollywood, the risk that Hollywood is in right now, is that
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:04.880]   this market could move very, very fast away from them.
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:09.760]   And you know, it is, I look at my kids, my kids don't have any, like I cut the cord
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:10.760]   ten years ago.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:18.200]   So we turned on cable access for like a month a couple years ago, and suddenly my kids were
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:22.080]   asking for a thousand things that they didn't even know existed the month before.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:25.240]   And I decided, let's go back to just YouTube.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:29.480]   So, so the, so they don't really have an experience of that.
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.760]   But what happens for me, and I don't know if this is for everyone, but when I have to
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:35.880]   do this, the sign on that you're talking about, because I'm a cord cutter, I can't get to
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.880]   that.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.240]   So that channel ceases to exist for me.
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:42.360]   So now if it's not on, you know, like I don't know what's on CBS or on, you know, a lot
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:45.480]   of these other things, because it's, you know, it's become a pain.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:50.240]   And, and then what's happened is, is that like a gel, that is all just filled in with other
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.240]   things, you know.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:56.040]   Whether it's Apple TV or my Netflix or Hulu or, you know, HBO or Showtime, you know, the
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:59.040]   ones that are, have been easy to get into and to pay for.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.160]   I don't, you know, I'm not paying for TV.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.240]   So I'm fine with paying 10 bucks a month for the things that I really watch.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.080]   That's just filled up all my time.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.960]   You know, like, and now I don't, I don't think about watching the other things, you
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:13.400]   know, and I think that that is going to be, do we see that as a, as a risk for them, for
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.400]   our media partners?
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:17.880]   You're not sure.
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:23.760]   Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's such a tricky business for Apple to get into because
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.360]   I can't think of another platform where there was such a total lack of hardware loyalty in
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.960]   the populace than TV.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.240]   They really don't care if it's, if they'll, they'll, they might even, they might even
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:39.400]   be an evangelist for their Roku box of Apple TV for all their friends for like a year,
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.520]   year and a half.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:46.880]   But then they get their first LG TV that has WebOS and a really good Netflix app.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.320]   And they maybe they didn't, they didn't get around to plugging in their Apple TV right
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.880]   away to the new set.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.320]   And it's two months later and they've forgotten they even had an Apple TV because this is
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.320]   just as soon as they get to, it's whatever gets you to Netflix, whatever gets you to
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.240]   Hulu, whatever gets you to HBO go, you just don't care about it as soon as you get there.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:11.960]   So if Apple has really got such a big challenge ahead of itself to find some way to demonstrate
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:18.880]   to itself that a $150 $200 box is worth their buying on other platforms.
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.560]   They're doing it by saying that here is your, here is your, your, your game system that
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.400]   also has a really good way to run Netflix.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.600]   Apple, I really think that it's going to, I really think that the way for them to do
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.480]   it is to sort of do the same magic they did with the Apple Watch.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.800]   I mean, for heaven's sake, the Apple TV and the Apple Watch are even the same shape.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.960]   It's a rounded, rounded square.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:44.440]   But if they basically say that here is a computer that is on 24/7, it's always connected to
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:50.400]   the internet 24/7, which means that it can be essentially your home kit monitor 24/7.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:56.000]   It can essentially be the device that acts as the firewall between all the Macs and iOS
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   devices in your home network and the world outside so that you can simply say that on
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.200]   your iPhone, use the file or your iPad, use the files app not just to sync things through
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:11.280]   iCloud, but also to if you need to share the screen of your iMac back home or even just
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:16.200]   pull some files off the hard drive there, they have to, Apple's, it seems as though Apple
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:21.200]   either doesn't have the infrastructure or just doesn't have the interest in making devices
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:25.880]   that are multi-platform for everybody, where they excel is saying that we can make a watch
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:30.240]   that only works with an iPhone, but oh my God, how well it works with this iPhone.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.760]   So they could do an Apple TV that does the same thing.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:39.000]   It's not a generic network device, but if you have a Macs, if you have iPhones, boy,
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.960]   does this make that iPhone much, much better.
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.960]   Right.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:48.720]   And then we're going to talk through the new Apple TV in detail, but right before that,
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:52.360]   Leo's got yet another couple of things he likes to say.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:56.200]   Yes, Leo's still on vacation, but he's somehow weirdly still doing commercials.
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.960]   I'll be back next week.
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.120]   I miss you guys.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.000]   Thank you for holding down the fort.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.760]   And thank you to ZipRecruiter for making this possible.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:07.560]   We couldn't go on vacation, Lisa and I, if we'd have a great staff.
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:11.120]   And one of the reasons we have a great staff is because we have a great hiring process
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.560]   thanks to ZipRecruiter.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:16.520]   The right person can make your company.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:19.960]   The wrong person can break your company because you know what a company is?
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.640]   It's just the people who work there.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.640]   That's it.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.640]   That's the whole thing.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.640]   That's what a company is.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:27.840]   So if you're in charge of hiring, do it right.
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:30.440]   The right person is there, is out there.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.880]   So is the wrong person, right?
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.720]   And ZipRecruiter is going to make the difference between hiring the wrong person and hiring
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:37.720]   the right person.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.800]   First of all, you've got to reach the right person.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.440]   You know they're out there, but what job board are they looking for?
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.880]   Where are they looking for work?
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:50.480]   With ZipRecruiter, you are posting once to ZipRecruiter, but then they post to 100+ job
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.960]   boards, plus all the social networks, so Twitter and Facebook everywhere.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:00.680]   So the chance of that right person seeing your posting goes way up, way up.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.960]   But I have to say, the wrong person will also see it.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:07.280]   In fact, many wrong people will see it, but ZipRecruiter makes this easy to screen them
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.320]   out because every applicant goes right into the ZipRecruiter interface.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.320]   It doesn't come to your inbox or your phone.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.000]   They have this great interface.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.640]   They format all the resumes so they're the same, so it's easy to read them.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.600]   You can screen them out without even any interaction on your part with true false questions, yes
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.600]   or no.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.640]   Have you ever been arrested?
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.240]   Do you know how to use Word, Microsoft Word?
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.680]   Whatever your question is.
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.280]   Essay questions too, whatever you need.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.240]   So that's going to screen out the bad people.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.520]   You then can go through the rest of the applicants, rank them and hire the right one fast.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:46.160]   80% of employers who post on ZipRecruiter get qualified candidates in the site within
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.360]   a day.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.040]   One day.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.560]   It is the simply the most effective way.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:56.080]   You're going to cast the widest net and then have the tools to really hone it down to get
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:58.760]   the right person fast.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.600]   And by the way, if you're currently looking for a job, ZipRecruiter will help you find
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:06.880]   a job in any industry, including technology, government, business, finance and more.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:13.720]   It's a great way to both apply for a job and to get the right applicant in your system.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.480]   You're going to look, you got to use this.
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:23.880]   From one business owner to another, try it.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:50.040]   After a job, you're going to find a job in your business.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:55.280]   So, we got the Apple TV as Andy started to dig into, we got some of the issues that the
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.280]   Apple TV has.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:58.180]   The Apple TV is now shipping.
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:05:59.180]   Some people have it.
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:02.120]   I'm still waiting because of course I was in the air when the sales started.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.200]   Not that I'm bitter.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.800]   But it's 4K HDR.
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:11.560]   For those of you who have a TV that can handle that, which is still a few and far between,
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.140]   I think now it's becoming kind of normal.
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.200]   But it, and this will hopefully push it forward.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.520]   Does anyone have the, is anyone got it in their house?
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:24.960]   Does anyone using it with the appropriate TV to properly enjoy it?
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.960]   I don't.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.880]   But that's actually one of my questions.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:37.560]   I have a 4K TV and I have, I use Apple TV a lot, but I use it for, you know, Netflix.
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:41.600]   So if I'm going to watch Netflix, I'll switch over to Apple TV and use that.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:49.640]   But I have Netflix on my LG 4K TV, but 4K won't come in because apparently it's the
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:52.600]   wrong kind of 4K or there's something going on.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:58.320]   So I'm not sure if my TV is compatible with Apple TV 4K or if it's not.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.320]   That's interesting.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:00.920]   I haven't, I haven't, and I don't know yet.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.120]   I don't have my Apple TV yet.
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:07.760]   I've got a Visio 4K that I, it was, you know, was on sale at some point.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:08.960]   So I bought it.
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.720]   And I've been, you know, I'm probably going to get an HDR one.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.880]   I don't think it should be a compatibility issue.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:18.920]   That's a very odd, that standard is pretty straightforward.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:23.320]   But Jim, I heard that you have to have the right, the right cable.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:28.640]   Yeah, I was about to say, what, are you using a Monoprice or an Amazon cable or is it truly
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.800]   an Apple TV cable?
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:35.880]   Well, the, the, here the Netflix app is built in to the TV.
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:42.280]   So I stopped, I didn't use the one that was with Apple TV.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.520]   Yes, you're not using your Apple TV at all.
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.920]   You're just, you're just using the built in app in your TV.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:53.760]   I, I tried using the built in app on the TV because my TV was 4K and I assumed that the
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:58.080]   app was too, but it said that it wasn't compatible.
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:01.360]   But the question is that what, what cable is going between, we have a lot of trouble
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.160]   with 4K cables.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:09.640]   So the, the question is the cable between the Apple TV and the, and the TV.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:11.000]   Do you know what cable that is?
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.280]   No, I don't.
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:19.000]   That is, so what's interesting and I, and I thought the standard Apple TV or the standard
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.160]   Apple cable, the little black one, which by the way is just there's something about that
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.440]   cable that is very nice.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:25.960]   You know, it's, you buy, they're not, it's weird.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:29.840]   Like what Apple does, like they, they pay attention to all these things and, and like
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.880]   I only carry around those little Apple ones because A, I always know they're going to
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.600]   work and they will work with 4K.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.760]   And what's interesting is they've worked with 4K for like years.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.320]   So any Apple cable that, you know, whatever they, you know, whatever standard they built
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:45.160]   that cable for, for the last two or three years, it's able to carry 4K.
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:49.480]   But we have all kinds of problems with other cheaper cables.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:52.840]   Even ones that say that they're 4K compatible won't show up.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.560]   And we do a lot of, we do a lot of 4K production.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:09:02.280]   So we, you know, you get into, you know, dealing with, dealing with that, you, this is the
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:08.120]   one place where we do tend to spend some money on, on cables because, and it's also on long
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120]   runs.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:13.640]   So once you go over, you know, six feet, then you start getting into a situation where the
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.080]   cables really matter really fast.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.960]   You can get the Corning ones do work, which are like, they're very expensive, but they're,
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.200]   they go 30 meters or whatever.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:29.440]   But they are, but those are opt, they convert the HDMI to optical and then back.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:33.440]   And but, but anything over six feet, a lot of them work under six feet.
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:35.240]   But once they go over six feet, it becomes problematic.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:41.920]   And if they're going through anything to get to your TV, that oftentimes has become problematic.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.160]   So I don't, I don't know what those things are, but, but that, I think that that's probably
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.820]   the compatibility issue.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:52.380]   Is anything 4K worked on from the Apple TV or just not Netflix?
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:55.900]   Well, I haven't tried 4K on the Apple TV yet.
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:10:00.700]   I don't have one of the new ones, but I was, I was trying this on the, on the built in.
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:01.700]   Oh, okay.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:05.060]   So you're saying the built in 4K doesn't work.
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.060]   Yeah.
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.060]   Okay.
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:09.700]   Then I'm giving, I gave, I gave a tirade.
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:13.740]   But that's good advice for when I do get the Apple TV 4K.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:22.340]   That's, that's fascinating that you're not, that the Netflix app doesn't, doesn't work
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.540]   on its own TV.
[01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:25.540]   Right.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:26.540]   In 4K.
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:31.460]   Oh, it might be the H, it could be the HEVC if they're using, if they're supporting HEVC
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:35.620]   and whether that chip is capable of, of managing that.
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:39.820]   But it'll be interesting to see if the, an external one works.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.460]   So yeah.
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:45.340]   But the, Andy, have you, have you tested it?
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:46.940]   Have you looked at it?
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:47.940]   I don't have it.
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:51.020]   I'm not going to be checking it out until, I think the problem is I don't even have a
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.020]   4K TV.
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:55.180]   So I was going to wait until that, that's on my upgrade.
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:57.180]   That's on my upgrade list.
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:03.020]   My, my good living room TV is like the first big HD TV I bought.
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:06.860]   And last night I noticed that it stopped going from just simply being a little bit darker
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:08.060]   around the edges of the frame.
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:11.500]   Now it's darker and a little bit purple.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.300]   So this is, it's good.
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:16.020]   You're getting, you're getting close.
[01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:22.140]   It's, it's, no, it's, I have to say that I'm very, very pleased that it's like, if,
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:26.340]   if it just suddenly stopped working, then like, damn it, well I didn't, I don't necessarily
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:27.820]   want to buy TV right now.
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:31.460]   I want to wait a few months until I get an HDR TV.
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:35.540]   But now it's just saying, we don't, it's like the blues mobile.
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:39.340]   It knows that as soon as it's reached by destination, as soon as like Amazon delivers
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:43.140]   my new 4K HDR TV, that's when the screen's going to dissolve.
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:46.660]   It's like a pile of like gently pulsating pixels on the carpet.
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:50.700]   But as it is now, it's a good excuse that you're really not that excited about Black
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.780]   Magic's Da Vinci resolve, you know, there's not going to be a lot of color correction going
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:56.420]   on in the, on the, on the TV.
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:57.420]   I mean, okay.
[01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:01.620]   So this is, well, this is obviously I've had this, I've had this TV for a long time and
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:07.300]   they've had this problem for a little while, I love it when there is, there's such a huge,
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:11.620]   I love it when you're able to wait until there's going to be such an obviously huge
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:12.620]   benefit.
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:19.020]   For me, 4K was going to be a plus, but not a huge plus HDR is going to be such a huge
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:22.700]   plus, a huge plus that, yeah, that's, that's the thing I'm waiting for.
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:29.220]   And also, and also, I'm not in a rush to get the new Apple TV because again, if you've
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:33.420]   got 4K, particularly if you've got HDR, oh my God, what a huge, huge bonus.
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:36.780]   Other than that, it's not, it's not going to be a very practical upgrade.
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:40.220]   I got the software update to last year's model.
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:41.220]   And that was very nice.
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:43.780]   But I'm content to wait.
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:49.860]   I might buy it in December, just so that I can get a review in play, but I haven't cared
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:54.900]   about it enough to say Apple, hi, can you send me one for 30 or 60 days so I could watch
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:58.780]   TV in my kitchen, which is the only TV that doesn't have like a smart box connected to
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:12:59.780]   it.
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:05.620]   Now, I do think that this is going to be, Tonya, don't you think that they had to do both
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:06.620]   4K and HDR?
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:09.180]   I mean, if you're going to do it, you know, you're not going to update it for another
[01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:13.340]   year, even though they're there a little ahead, it's better than being a little, little too
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:14.340]   far behind.
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:15.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:19.020]   I think it's a little bit analogous to High Sierra, where they put a whole bunch of stuff
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.700]   in High Sierra that sort of it's like in a house.
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:25.900]   They supported the foundation and they upgraded the, you know, the electrical system, but you
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:27.900]   can't really see it when you're in the house.
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:31.500]   So I think it's a little bit like that with the Apple TV, where if you're buying one new
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:36.700]   today, you probably should get the 4K one because it's going to last you longer.
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:39.460]   You know, eventually you'll get a 4K TV if you don't know.
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:41.980]   And then all of a sudden you'll kind of have what you want.
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:48.700]   And I think to just to be kind of a player in the field, Apple needed to absolutely have
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:50.220]   an Apple TV that does this.
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:53.460]   Unfortunately, I'm with Andy, have a very nice TV.
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:59.340]   It's not 4K and I'm probably going to sit this generation of Apple TV out and see what they
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:03.380]   come up with another year or two to get my next Apple TV.
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:07.540]   I think that one of the things that is the lock in for the folks that do use Apple TVs
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:14.100]   and, you know, for me, I've kind of moved away from going to movies very often.
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:18.660]   I'm part of that slide of people who just don't go, you know, and I think that part of
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:23.420]   it is when you're a parent, you have young kids and it's really expensive and you're
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:24.980]   not sure if there's really any payoff for it.
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:26.180]   You know, it's good to do it.
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:29.460]   I mean, literally, I think that there was a time in my life where I think I went to a
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:36.580]   movie every week and now I go to a movie maybe every quarter, you know, like, you know,
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:39.540]   and part of it is I feel like I got a pretty good sound system.
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:44.300]   I've got a pretty good TV and I'm like, I don't know, you know, like if it's Star Wars,
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:49.980]   I'm going to go, you know, and I think that but outside of an experience, I think that
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:52.380]   the hard part is, you know, these start to become big.
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:55.740]   So as a result, I buy a lot of, I just buy a lot of movies, you know, so that I just
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:56.740]   have them there.
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:58.020]   I don't have to worry about ordering them.
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:01.220]   I don't have to, I can download them on any of my devices and so on and so forth.
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:04.700]   I mean, would you say that, Jim, would you say that's part of the lock in?
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:09.580]   That's part of why Apple provides the Apple TV is to make sure that there's that ecosystem
[01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:12.740]   that is still existent for Apple users that even though there might be other things, they're
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:16.780]   not necessarily competing with Roku, they're just making sure that there is a great solution
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:20.140]   for people who already are in kind of in the system.
[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:26.940]   You know, Apple makes, I think, what a lot of us, and you said it earlier about Internet,
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:29.900]   if I'm not on in 30 seconds, I'm off.
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:34.380]   You know, so what we want a lot now is convenience.
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:38.860]   So if we sit down at night and say, what should we do?
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.420]   Hey, you want to watch a movie?
[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:41.420]   Sure.
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:43.180]   Apple TV, there it is.
[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:44.420]   It's all done.
[01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:48.860]   You know, 30 seconds, you can rent a movie and you're done.
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:55.700]   And they're able to keep a lot of people in the ecosystem by doing this, by making it
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:57.140]   so convenient.
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:03.260]   Are the songs that we listen to on Apple Music or buy on iTunes, the best quality music
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:06.180]   sound wise that we could possibly get?
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:07.180]   No.
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:08.860]   But it's very convenient.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:11.660]   You hear a song and say, God, I like that song.
[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:12.660]   I want to buy that.
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:14.820]   I want to download it to my library.
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.980]   In 30 seconds, there it is in your library.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:18.580]   You have it now.
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:23.580]   So a lot of what they're able to do is about convenience.
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:24.580]   Right.
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.900]   And Apple TV is the same way.
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:31.020]   In some ways, do we think that it was a mistake that Apple got out of the kind of the Wi-Fi
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:32.020]   business.
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:35.020]   I mean, you know, so I think that the, you know, they've kind of gotten, they don't really
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:37.140]   support that in the same way that they used to.
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:43.620]   I know I have a, I have a ubiquity, you know, their, their little amplifier, whatever in
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:44.620]   my house now.
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:50.140]   But it feels like that's like a hub that you wished was an Apple product.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:51.140]   Does that make sense?
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:53.140]   Makes perfect sense.
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:54.140]   Yeah.
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:55.140]   Yeah.
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:57.820]   I would really like to know the inside story about Apple and their Wi-Fi.
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:03.580]   I edited a book by Glenn Fleischman about the airport base stations for like probably 15
[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:04.580]   years.
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:09.660]   And we can, there's nothing to update in the book really because there's no new products.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:14.140]   And I keep thinking, okay, they're going to come out with like a new, you know, Apple
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:20.420]   TV, home pod, you know, base station kind of home hub thing that's going to pull this
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:21.420]   all in.
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:24.340]   Like, you know, three years from now, we're going to understand what they're thinking
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:25.340]   today.
[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:28.780]   And, and maybe they're even, you know, have some products they're working on internally
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:32.740]   that we don't know about that may never see the light of day and they're having trouble
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:34.820]   finding, you know, the right product.
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:38.900]   But I think there is a lot of room for Apple in this space.
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:42.900]   I mean, we were just talking about the AirPods and we're saying how much we like everything
[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:44.860]   about the design and the case and everything.
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:48.740]   And I think there's a lot of room with home networking for Apple to come up with really
[01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:52.100]   wonderful products, products that probably only Apple can make.
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:56.620]   Well, and I think that, you know, there's a, you know, like for the, the ubiquity is like
[01:17:56.620 --> 01:18:01.100]   the one that for me, I mean, we use pro versions of what they have big point to points and
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:03.220]   Wi-Fi meshes and everything else.
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:07.060]   And, but the home one, the interesting thing about it is it is very Apple-esque in the
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:10.460]   way that you can, I can hand somebody a code like someone comes to the house, I can give
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:13.820]   them a code that only is going to last for the three hours that they're there.
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:14.820]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:16.940]   You know, there's a lot of those little things that are, that are super easy for me.
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:18.900]   And on my iPhone, I can just kind of set it all up.
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:21.900]   If I feel like there's something wrong with my network, I just go on my iPhone and, and
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:22.900]   check it out.
[01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:27.180]   And, you know, and I, and it feels like it wants to be an Apple product that does that
[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:28.180]   Apple doesn't make.
[01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:32.380]   But when you're talking about home kit, when you're talking about tying all these things
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:34.580]   together, it feels like a place that they're not innovating.
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:36.180]   Do you agree, Andy?
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:38.180]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.180]   It's unfortunate.
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:44.140]   I, I've had a whole bunch of different mesh networks through the, in the office and the
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:46.380]   house testing them out with the past year or two.
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:50.100]   And you're, so they, there was really no reason for anybody to buy Apple networking
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:51.100]   hard bread.
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:56.460]   So it's a huge disadvantage because you don't get the, as you said, they're the ability to
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:58.660]   set up and manage a network.
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:03.980]   The apps that you get with Google Wi-Fi or with these other mesh networks, they're so
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:06.300]   easy to set up and they're so easy to manage.
[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:10.380]   When there's a problem, you just light it up and will immediately tell you, here's what
[01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:14.780]   the problem is and here's when things went south, here's what we think the problem is.
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:19.420]   And to say nothing about the connect, the fact that so many of the devices that we're
[01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:23.740]   putting in our houses work so much better if you can access them from outside the house
[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:26.500]   and port forwarding has always just been a total nightmare.
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:32.260]   I didn't, I had a, I had a Plex server in my, in my house working for a year and a half.
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:37.260]   And it did not, I did not have the ability to connect to it from the outside until like,
[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:41.940]   until like a year later, not because it was such a nightmare, but because the automatic
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:44.380]   stuff that was supposed to work automatically did not work.
[01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:49.860]   I filled with it for five minutes and recognize that I don't have the emotional capacity to
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:54.340]   spend 90 minutes getting port forwarding work.
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:59.420]   All these different ways that Apple can make, could have made a Wi-Fi network that not only
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:04.940]   solves the problem of why is it that I can get Wi-Fi everywhere except for in the sunroom
[01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:11.540]   to why, why is it so hard for my, to get my game console to work with a network it's
[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.500]   supposed to work with remotely.
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.460]   And they kind of missed the boat, they just didn't have anybody internally that was willing
[01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:20.980]   to be excited about that sort of stuff and now they've been pretty much surpassed.
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:25.100]   But the other problem that they're kind of facing because of that absence is that there
[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:31.140]   really is a need for a consumer headless network device, whether it's something like
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:36.580]   an Apple TV, whether it's something like, like the HomePod, there really has to be that
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:41.260]   sort of consumer device that is smart on the network and does wonderful things for the
[01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:46.780]   user that are, that they can't really do as well on a phone or through a keyboard.
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:52.140]   And the, having this box on your network that's live 24/7 is such a big part of everybody's
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:53.140]   strategy right now.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:56.380]   So I just, it's just too bad that Apple missed that boat.
[01:20:56.380 --> 01:21:00.180]   I hope that they, they jump on it a little bit later on.
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:03.700]   But one of the other things that we've noticed through Apple that's been consistent year
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:07.340]   after year after year is that they're really not interested in doing something unless there's
[01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:11.380]   something that they can bring that is fresh and unique to the platform.
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:12.380]   Partly because-
[01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:16.260]   And I do think that something that would be fresh and unique would be that it just works
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:20.900]   and you set it up and you know, like for instance, I think that a personal VPN for instance
[01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:24.820]   would be, you know, I have a company that we have a VPN and I just hit a little button
[01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:28.420]   and boom, I'm in that, in that encased world.
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:31.460]   But it always seems like if I had a Wi-Fi at home that could manage it, I mean, so we
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:35.100]   use, you know, the, the ubiquity thing is what I use in my house.
[01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:39.380]   We have, the company has a Meraki system which works great as far as tying all that stuff
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:41.140]   together into the cloud, but it's really expensive.
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:44.280]   You know, it's not something that you can use as a home user, but when you think about
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:48.300]   all these home services of my iCloud and sharing photos and being able to get back to
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:52.100]   my desktop and being able to do all those other things and keeping that all secure,
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:57.420]   it seems like it's something, Jim, would you agree that Apple could innovate in?
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:04.980]   Well, what's really strange to me about networking in Apple goes back to, to something
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:12.140]   that Tanya was saying, usually when Apple backs off of a product category that it's
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:18.740]   in and is doing well in, that usually means that there's something else coming.
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:23.780]   So, you know, a home pod that now acts as something or an Apple TV that now acts as
[01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:25.780]   something.
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:26.940]   And we haven't seen it.
[01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:27.940]   It's been years.
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:35.980]   And we have not seen that new product to the point where people, users of their networking
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:46.100]   products, including me, are looking at moving on because yes, I can't get my Wi-Fi network
[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:48.540]   in my backyard.
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:56.940]   I can't get my Wi-Fi in rooms that are not in the same room as the base station because
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:59.500]   the Apple stuff just doesn't seem to work as well.
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:04.860]   So, you know, as much as I'm waiting for this product to come, Apple won't say one
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:06.700]   way or another, look, we're done.
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:09.540]   We're finished with this whole networking thing.
[01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:14.380]   So move on and we're going to continue on with the iPhone, which would be great.
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:16.300]   Just do that, say it done.
[01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:17.860]   But I think it's the problem.
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:20.340]   If they don't make printers anymore, they don't make screens anymore.
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:21.340]   Yeah.
[01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:24.660]   And the problem is, is that there are so many things about what they're doing that would
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:27.020]   make a huge difference if they controlled that entire pipeline.
[01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:34.300]   Like, if they had a, you know, if they prioritize video traffic or prioritize voice traffic or
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:38.540]   prioritize, you know, those types of things that are going to make all those little bits
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:40.780]   and pieces of all their other products work well.
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:44.300]   It just feels like an ecosystem that wants to be there that is missing.
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:46.300]   What were you saying, Andy?
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:50.500]   No, no, I was just, I was just going to say, I mean, that is such a good opportunity for
[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:51.500]   them.
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:57.060]   I don't, they, they, I are also really like your idea of having a private personal VPN.
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:02.900]   That's, and that's a feature that my, my, my, my, my, my Synology server can do, but it
[01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:07.140]   is tricky enough to set up that I'm like, okay, I'd rather give this other company $50
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:11.740]   a year to do this for me and also not run it in competently as I would if I were running
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:12.740]   my first.
[01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:15.460]   I'm not, I'm not sure that I want a VPN that's been run by some.
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:18.140]   Hey, I'll do a great job because I've never done this before.
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:19.140]   So maybe I'd rather.
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:22.900]   But yeah, I mean, especially given that it's more and more important, it has more and more
[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:27.180]   traction in Apple to be able to say that if there's an Apple logo on it, you can be sure
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:30.980]   that there is a much, much higher level of security and privacy attached to this because
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:36.500]   this is part, this is deeply, deeply entwined in our DNA that privacy and security is, is
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:38.580]   a really important thing to put in everything.
[01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:43.660]   So if they were to say that we're having a brand new mesh product that gives you every,
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:47.420]   every advantage of mesh networks and really if you're buying, if you're, if your Wi-Fi
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:52.980]   Harper is more than three years old, you, if the, if you go out and buy a simple mesh
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:57.100]   network, you are going to be shocked at all the stuff that you thought was just simply
[01:24:57.100 --> 01:25:01.180]   part of humanity suffering upon this mortal plane of existence that you just don't have
[01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:05.580]   to deal with anymore because I, well, I mean, like it's, but, but, but, but, but I'm saying
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:08.860]   that if Apple were to say we have a new mesh work and it gives you all those advantages,
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:14.220]   but by the way, here's also a, there's also a switch in iOS 11 settings that says use,
[01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:19.220]   home VPN or home privacy, which means that no matter where you're connecting from your
[01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:23.260]   inner, whenever connection, internet connection is directly facing your phone, your tablet,
[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:28.540]   your notebook is just going to be used to connect securely to your personal home piece
[01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:33.260]   of hardware VPN so that not, you're not even connecting to raffle servers.
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:38.780]   So we don't have the ability to do anything but to steer the con, steer the, steer the
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:40.340]   traffic to this home device.
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.060]   Other than that, we don't see anything.
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.580]   You're completely secure.
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:46.260]   That would be something that, again, all the people, all the people that are buying Apple
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:49.860]   TVs because they've had such good experiences with Apple hardware that they don't want to
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:53.740]   really think about the three or four alternatives that were, I'm good enough.
[01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:56.180]   They will definitely embrace that sort of advantage.
[01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:57.180]   Absolutely.
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:25:59.940]   And, and, and coming back to the Apple TV, a couple of little quick notes as we, as we
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:02.820]   go through that is, YouTube won't work in 4K.
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:03.820]   It still works.
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:07.060]   It's not like the YouTube app won't work, but you, you, it won't work in 4K because
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:14.580]   it's VP9 and Apple hasn't, isn't supporting VP9, probably won't.
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:17.620]   But, but, Tonya, do you think, who, who, who do you think is going to blink or, or are
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:18.620]   they going to blink?
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:23.660]   Is YouTube just going to ignore the Apple TV or is it, or is Apple going to finally
[01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:24.660]   support VP9?
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:26.660]   What do you, what do you think is going to be the outcome here?
[01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:30.620]   Oh, well, I mean sooner or later, YouTube's going to support 4K video.
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:32.540]   So it's just a matter of time before.
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:35.820]   Well, they support it now, but they're very committed or they've been very committed
[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:36.820]   to VP9.
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.020]   The other thing is in VP9 right now.
[01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:43.700]   So switching over to ATVC and switching over to ATVC with the licensing would be very expensive
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:44.700]   for YouTube.
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:46.500]   Is it, do you think Apple TV is worth it?
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:50.500]   Yeah, you know, I think a lot of lawyers and business people are going to get together
[01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:52.700]   in a room and they're going to figure that out.
[01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:55.620]   But sooner or later, I bet it will work.
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:59.820]   And in the meantime, you know, watch YouTube's and or else.
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:05.140]   I don't, I don't think Apple TV is, is worth it for, for Google to do that.
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:06.140]   Right.
[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:10.260]   Unless, unless, you know, pricing and everything else comes in line.
[01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:11.260]   Yeah.
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:12.260]   There's just no reason.
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:21.660]   Yeah, there's just no reason for Google to put ABC, you know, on Apple TV.
[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:22.900]   It doesn't make any sense.
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:28.140]   Yeah, I mean, it's a, it's a huge investment on their part because the licensing is atrocious.
[01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:30.140]   You know, I mean, it still hasn't changed that much.
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:33.020]   It's just that the Apple have to be a licensed holder.
[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:35.540]   So, so it makes it a little, a little simpler there.
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:40.980]   But the, but that, you know, the, the, the onerous, uh, system, you know, overages of
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:44.260]   HEVC for the person creating the content or distributing that content.
[01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:45.260]   It's not for us.
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.780]   We don't pay that, but they do.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:49.300]   And when you think about Apple, I, I don't know what the flow is.
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:53.540]   Would you, Andy, would you think that Apple TV is probably less than 1% of, of YouTube's
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:54.540]   4K distribution?
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:28:00.820]   We'd say definitely even even if everybody owns an Apple TV right now was watching 4K,
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:03.420]   it would still probably be 1% of people who watch.
[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:04.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:09.980]   Also keep in mind that you, on YouTube, Apple, one of Apple's big advantages is that it has
[01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:14.180]   $220 billion in the bank, which means that the decisions that make sense for them are
[01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:18.820]   going to be very, very different from every, from every other company that could not spend
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:23.620]   the next two years perfecting their grandmother's fudge recipe and not shipping any products
[01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:25.260]   and still be okay.
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:30.180]   Google, Google has YouTube and there is no competition for it.
[01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:31.180]   Of course there's a video.
[01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:35.060]   Yes, of course there's daily motion, but YouTube is the platform where people want to
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.140]   publish on.
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:39.980]   So it's not as though they're going to use that as a competitive edge, but it's, I think
[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:44.460]   it's the reason why the YouTube app on Apple TV is good, but not great.
[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:48.180]   It's not as good as the YouTube app on, on Android TV.
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:50.820]   Again, I don't think it's because they are deliberately dumbing it down.
[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:55.900]   It's because they don't think that it's really important to have the best experience possible
[01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:58.420]   on, on Apple TV and competing platforms.
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:02.180]   So I think, so I think that it's more important for Apple to make sure that Google gets on
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:06.740]   board with Apple than is, than, than, than Google needs Apple.
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:08.100]   I'm sorry that that's convoluted.
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:11.180]   Well, and most of the content, I'm not sure if it would change the quality of the content
[01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:14.380]   or my kids would watch any more or less of YouTube if it was in 4K.
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:19.860]   Also, how much, how much, how much 4K, how much 4K content of value is on YouTube anyway?
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:20.860]   Right now, right now.
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:25.580]   When I, when I, when I go, when I go to see somebody tear down an Apple Newton message
[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:28.020]   pad, I don't really care about 4K content.
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:32.260]   I care that it's well lit, that they, they're not breathing into their microphone, that I
[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:33.420]   can actually follow the story.
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:34.420]   Right.
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:36.620]   Well, and I think that they are, you too, all the original content that's coming out
[01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:39.780]   now with YouTube, of course, is all, is all being generated in 4K.
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:43.340]   So that becomes a, you know, which is the same for Netflix and Amazon and which Apple
[01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:44.660]   already has kind of lined up.
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:48.580]   So those are the things I think that are the, when you look into the future as to whether
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:51.740]   that's going to be, whether you, you get, and I think the danger for Apple is is that
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:56.420]   it does open up this position where either someone's just using the YouTube app on their
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:57.420]   4K.
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:00.460]   That's the most likely is I'm just going to use the YouTube app on my Visio or my Sony
[01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:02.180]   or whatever.
[01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:07.020]   And then just use my Apple TV or do I get a Roku because it supports a 4K solution for
[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:08.020]   YouTube.
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:09.020]   Yeah.
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:11.020]   And then for Apple, that's a, you know, kind of a chink in the armor.
[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:12.020]   Yeah.
[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:13.020]   Also, I mean, we, we, we, oh, go ahead.
[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:16.900]   I'm sorry when you're up to the, um, Apple's extended the rental by 48 hours.
[01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:21.300]   I might actually start renting movies now because 24 hours was, I think that was a, that
[01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:22.300]   was a big jump.
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:25.700]   Um, Jim, would you, does that, does that mean anything to you, the rental increasing from
[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:27.460]   24 to 48 hours?
[01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:32.780]   You know, it's, it's a, it's a big increase for a lot of people, especially those with
[01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:34.420]   families.
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:38.980]   That's a huge increase because as we all know, when you rent a movie with a family, stuff
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:39.980]   happens.
[01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:42.900]   And you don't always get to finish that.
[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:48.380]   For me as an individual, that didn't really mean a lot to me because I don't push the
[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:55.180]   rent button until I'm, I've got my bowl of popcorn and I'm sitting down and I'm ready
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:56.580]   to watch.
[01:30:56.580 --> 01:31:02.100]   And if somebody comes to the door, well, you can come back in two hours because I'm not
[01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:03.100]   moving.
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:06.980]   So, you know, I'm, I'm very cranky and set in my way.
[01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:10.780]   So, uh, so for me, that didn't mean a lot.
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:14.980]   No, no, I know, I know.
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:20.180]   But so for me, that didn't mean as much as it did for a lot of other people, but I understand
[01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:25.700]   being a parent and, and, you know, having gone through all that, how much that does mean
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:27.100]   for, for other people.
[01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:32.780]   And I think that again, I think people like me have made very specific decisions about
[01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:34.100]   I'm just not going to go to the movies very often.
[01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:36.220]   I'm just going to watch, you know, I'm just going to buy, I'm going to go ahead and buy
[01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:38.660]   the movie and it takes a lot of the stress out of buying the movie because I didn't go
[01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:39.660]   see it in the theater.
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:45.220]   So, so it's, you know, I feel like I, I saved, you know, 85% by, by buying it rather than,
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:52.580]   you know, because taking kids to a theater and buying them popcorn and drinks is expensive.
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:56.780]   It's like 80 bucks, just in case you're wondering, that's the current, current going rate for
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:57.780]   it.
[01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:58.780]   Yeah.
[01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:01.620]   Also, what are your, what are your choices though?
[01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:04.540]   Take them to a hockey game where it's $150 a ticket.
[01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:05.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:09.740]   Plus, you know, uh, well, they wouldn't drink beer, but they would have a hot dog or something.
[01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:12.700]   But you know, that, that's going to be $500.
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:14.700]   So movies actually pretty cheap.
[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:15.700]   Yes.
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:16.700]   No, it is.
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:17.700]   And go ahead, Tonya.
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:20.380]   And a rental, a rental is just down in the basement.
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:23.180]   It's so cheap compared to the hockey game with the hot dogs.
[01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:24.180]   Right.
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:25.180]   Right.
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:26.180]   Right.
[01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:27.180]   No, absolutely.
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:28.180]   So, so I think that that'll be interesting.
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:29.180]   Also, you can only stream the 4K.
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:30.940]   You can't download them.
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.540]   Was it, were you really downloading them before?
[01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:35.580]   I didn't know you could download movies onto your Apple TV.
[01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:36.980]   That was that possible before?
[01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:39.260]   Did I miss that memo?
[01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:40.420]   I wasn't.
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:42.500]   I, yeah, I just streamed them.
[01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:43.500]   Yeah.
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:44.500]   And it always just streams.
[01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:45.500]   I don't know.
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:48.060]   Maybe it doesn't preview as much.
[01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:51.620]   You know, you know, a lot of times I'll, I'll, I'll get to the movie and start it and then
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:53.100]   pause.
[01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:55.500]   And then I'll walk off and do some stuff and come back just to make sure that there's no
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:33:01.300]   chance of a buffering, which my kids are very good at doing a big chorus of buffering.
[01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:06.620]   It's, it's, it's, it's, they're very technical about.
[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:08.300]   Let me tell you, you can grateful kids.
[01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:09.300]   Yeah.
[01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:10.940]   Let me tell you about when we had the laser disc.
[01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:11.940]   We'd only get 30 minutes.
[01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:17.180]   Then if we get off the sofa, right while they're attacking the Death Star, flip over this big
[01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:18.180]   platter.
[01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:25.180]   And we didn't have any sass mouth kids telling us that it was buffering.
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:26.180]   Yeah.
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:31.340]   I'm curious to, I don't know why there's so much RAM in the new version of the Apple
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:34.500]   TV because this is, it's Apple.
[01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:40.620]   The Apple TV has always intrigued me because it is, I, I, the, my other main streaming device
[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:47.700]   is a, is an Android TV device that is made made by NVIDIA.
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:53.260]   And it is so powerful that it can actually not, it doesn't just have a Plex app on it.
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:57.900]   It can actually act as a Plex server in and of itself.
[01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:04.060]   I can, it can record, it can record TV shows through the network devices, the antenna devices
[01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:06.140]   on my network store them locally.
[01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:11.980]   I mean, if I were to, if I were to be leaving the house for a whole week, I could simply
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:18.060]   unplug this tiny, this little paperback book like box and the power supply and an HDMI
[01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:24.800]   cable and whatever hotel I plug into, I will have about 300 gigabytes of TV shows and
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.180]   Blu-ray movies I've ripped in my entire music library.
[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:28.180]   Right.
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:30.300]   And it costs about the same amount of money as an Apple TV.
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:35.260]   Whereas the iPhone TV, the thing that's interesting to me is that it is, in many ways,
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:41.140]   as powerful as that NVIDIA box, but it really does present itself as a humble Roku.
[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:45.340]   And so I keep wondering what's either, what is it about the amount of stuff that has to
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:50.180]   buffer between game content and 4K content that requires that much RAM or what is Apple
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:54.260]   planning next year that's going to need this kind of future proofing?
[01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:55.980]   I think it's just about games.
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:56.980]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:57.980]   Yeah.
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:58.980]   I just think it's about games.
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:34:59.980]   Yeah.
[01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:10.180]   I think I'm going to make this Apple TV more of an all in one type of console thing that
[01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:11.740]   you can use.
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:14.060]   So that's all I think it's about.
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:20.420]   I mean, to me, the Apple TV needs to be more media right now, but until that happens,
[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:24.220]   I think that they're going to focus a little bit on the games too.
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:27.820]   And have you found any games that were really fun to play on the Apple TV?
[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:28.820]   No.
[01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:34.780]   I've got a lot of games and we played them a little bit.
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:40.700]   There's a little bowling game with your controller, which I almost threw through the bowling game
[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:44.740]   with that you use a small controller in your hand is a horrible idea.
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:51.260]   Let me tell you, it's a horrible idea because you're swinging right at the TV.
[01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:57.860]   And let's just say if you've got a look at it and you let go, you're just really glad
[01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:02.380]   that you swing up and and shattered it against the wall and not stuck it through the TV.
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:04.300]   I'm not saying that I did that.
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:09.780]   Alex, when I need to get together, have a few beer and do that and record it.
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:11.980]   That could be a home back break weekly right there.
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:13.860]   Just the two of us doing that.
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.740]   Also, it's a great way to mess up your TV.
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:17.700]   So you need to buy a new 4K TV.
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:18.700]   Exactly.
[01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:19.700]   That would be that.
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:24.260]   That's what I love being on with Tonya because she is the smartest one of the whole group.
[01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:26.100]   And she just came up with a brilliant idea.
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:30.100]   I got my whole plan for how we're getting a new TV now.
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:35.380]   So, the last little thing I think we're going to finish with one more thing and then we're
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:37.540]   going to move on.
[01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:40.380]   But there was one thing not connected to the Apple TV that started to come out.
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:46.620]   Apple Pay is now not, you know, it hasn't come out yet as far as peer to peer.
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:50.260]   Do we think that the peer to peer payments are going to be a big deal?
[01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:51.260]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:58.660]   So, given that almost everybody who has an iPhone has friends who have iPhones and Apple
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:05.220]   watches, the ability to do a trip and also how easily Apple Pay works, the ability to
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:08.940]   simply say at the end of a meal go, "Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh," and then just simply
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:11.660]   tap a phone or just not even have to do anything.
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:16.060]   Do sort of airdrop money to somebody else.
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:20.140]   If this is nothing that we don't have technically the ability to do right now, my banking app
[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:22.100]   can do this sort of payments.
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:24.860]   PayPal can do the kind of payments, all kinds of different systems can do with that sort
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:25.860]   of payments.
[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:29.900]   But the reason why I still settled the check by handing over cash or, you know, doing the
[01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:36.940]   usual, the usual square dancing of cards and money throughout people at a diner booth is
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:41.140]   because it's not the first time I'm going to have to do that, I'm going to have to find
[01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:45.380]   out, "Okay, do you have the proper apps to receive the money and are you comfortable with
[01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:47.940]   me sending you $11.73?"
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:51.820]   But with Apple, I'm sure that when Apple does it, it's going to be as simple as, "Here
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:56.940]   are the people who are within, maybe they'll probably do something similar to airdrop that
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:59.700]   they'll call something else that sounds more secure."
[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:04.020]   But you'll just simply tap your watch, you'll say there are three people in your contacts
[01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:08.580]   that are set up, that have basically the slot in their piggy bank is open.
[01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:14.980]   You can just simply say, "Great, put $12.88 from my separate account into their piggy bank."
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:17.700]   And suddenly it fills their money.
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:18.860]   People are going to actually use it.
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:20.820]   That's Apple's has core strengths.
[01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:24.620]   One of them is to take something that has already been there, but people don't use and
[01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:28.260]   turn to something that people are thrilled to use and demonstrate to other people.
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:30.140]   This is a great place to break that.
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:32.060]   No, Andy's right.
[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:40.580]   I mean, that's looking at the types of payments in this Apple Pay on messages and things like
[01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:42.540]   that.
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:48.380]   When you think about what could be really big, it's not going to be these large payments.
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:54.700]   It's going to be all four of us are out to dinner and Andy picks up the bill.
[01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:55.780]   "Okay, great.
[01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:57.980]   Mine was $20 bucks to that bill.
[01:38:57.980 --> 01:38:58.980]   Here you go.
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:38:59.980]   Boom.
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:00.980]   Done."
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:05.500]   That's going to be the big thing, but it's going to be used a lot.
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:09.020]   I still tell you how complicated these things are.
[01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:14.860]   I go to breakfast with some friends on a regular basis and it gets so complicated and so tedious
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:18.500]   that literally what I do, these are really good friends.
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:22.540]   Literally what I do is I reach into my wallet, I pull out literally every piece of paper
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:24.420]   currency I have in there.
[01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:30.220]   Whether it's $18 or $300, I put it in front of the person who has designated themselves
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:32.380]   as the weekly person who pays the check.
[01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:34.940]   He can take $1.
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:37.140]   He can see he's welcome to take $200.
[01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:40.820]   And he simply returns the wad back to me and I put it back in my wallet.
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:44.620]   That's how I have to go to breakfast with you.
[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:50.100]   Yeah, I go out to dinner every Wednesday night with a bunch and it's just $10 a person.
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:54.180]   It's pizza and beer and it doesn't matter how much beer you drink, how much pizza it's
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:57.140]   just too complicated with 11 people to sort it out.
[01:39:57.140 --> 01:40:01.500]   So everyone just puts in $10 sometimes waitress gets a really good tip.
[01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:04.420]   Sometimes we make sure it's okay, but basically it's $10.
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:06.340]   That's just how it is.
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:11.540]   I don't know actually with so many people in a loud bar if we would be able to coordinate
[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:12.540]   anything.
[01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:15.540]   So it'll be really super interesting to see what Apple comes up with.
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:19.020]   Also, there's always the person who wants to put it on their credit card because they're
[01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:20.900]   trying to get points for something.
[01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:26.300]   So if that's a person who has their card loaded in, hopefully they'll be able to use
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:28.900]   that and get their points and everyone else can just send it along.
[01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:29.900]   We'll see.
[01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:30.900]   We'll have to.
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:31.900]   There's a lot of questions really.
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:32.900]   Of course they're actually.
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:36.140]   Paying for the check, it's like the Eiger sanction or something.
[01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:40.740]   The amount of interlocking little, everyone has their own goals, their own priorities,
[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:45.140]   whether it's like, I just want this socially awkward thing about figuring out how much
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:47.740]   anyone to be over with all the way to.
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:52.380]   I really want to try to get the trip to Hawaii.
[01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:55.140]   And then some people are like, well, I would like a trip to Hawaii too.
[01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:57.660]   How come we're helping to send you to Hawaii?
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:02.380]   Maybe you should, maybe that Orv onion rings is on you instead of being split four ways.
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:03.380]   Yeah.
[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:10.700]   Well, I know this sounds crazy, but I do feel like Apple could be like one opportunity sitting
[01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:11.700]   in front of them.
[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:14.300]   I'm not saying they're planning to do anything like this or not, but one opportunity that
[01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:19.140]   seems like sitting in front of me is that one thing that most of us almost all dislike
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:21.580]   is our bank.
[01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:25.420]   And so, you know, like, you know, like there's like, you know, an Apple is pretty good at
[01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:29.620]   taking something that, you know, we didn't, you know, like it wasn't before the iPhone.
[01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:34.380]   We didn't like our phone. We just hated it less than all the other phones, right?
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:39.220]   And in the same way, I think most of us get the relationship with our personal bank oftentimes
[01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:44.740]   is that we hate it less than all the other banks, but it's not like we like that bank.
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:47.220]   And also all these banks are doing screwy things.
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:50.380]   They, you know, they're investing in all this crazy stuff and they might fail and they
[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:51.740]   don't know stuff.
[01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:58.300]   Apple is the one company in the world that could build a bank that literally the only
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:02.180]   thing it does with your money is loan it to other people buying their products.
[01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:06.340]   You know, for that's your interest is the fact that they're charging people to buy their
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:11.740]   products and, and they're using that money and they have enough money to back it up.
[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:12.740]   What are you saying?
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:16.660]   Andy, your acting as though your money is is in some sort. It's not in it. It's not
[01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:19.620]   here. Your money is in Leo's iPad.
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:27.660]   And Andy's I'm act.
[01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:28.660]   That's good.
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:29.660]   Sorry.
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:35.500]   But the thing is, is that it, it seems like that they're getting into all of these, you
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:38.700]   know, bits and pieces where, you know, they, they will have solved everything other than
[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:44.500]   just saying, Hey, you could actually just bank with us. Anyway, so it's, it's, anyway,
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:51.300]   it's just something to something to think about. It seems like it could. No, no, I think no,
[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:55.020]   no, no one here agrees with me. The, the, the, the only, the only problem with that is
[01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:59.540]   that they can do like payments as a service. But if they're going to try to be like a bank,
[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:02.060]   they would have to remember that when they create the Apple Watch, they started out by
[01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:06.180]   hiring away everybody in the fitness and health industries from really great jobs to
[01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:10.260]   come work at Apple when they started working on a car, they hired away everybody who has
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:15.020]   a wonderful huge careers in the audio industry. If they were to start doing things that were
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:18.940]   more like conventional banking, they would have to hire people from who are having huge
[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:23.700]   careers in the banking industry and anybody who is frozen. Exactly. They're either they're
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:28.700]   in prison or they're smart enough to have avoided prison, but they're also not when they
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:32.660]   have, they're not going to be swayed by Tim Cook taking, taking them for a walk through
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:38.980]   the new apricot orchards and saying, well, I, that's, that's an interesting idea, Ted.
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:43.580]   I don't think that we'll find a way to trick people into signing over their mortgages so
[01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:47.300]   that we can evict them and then read and then turn the, and turn the property into
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:52.740]   vacant lots because Apple, we're, we're a non-evil company and then the meeting's over.
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:55.740]   But, but, but like literally Apple doesn't need to do any housing. They don't need to
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:59.180]   do anything else. Like you buy their cars, you buy their things, you buy whatever. That's
[01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:01.500]   the only place the money goes. You know, it doesn't, it wouldn't have to go anywhere
[01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:05.980]   else. It would, it would all be like closed system. Anyway, so it's just a, and it's,
[01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:09.020]   and you'd borrow money from them to buy more things from them. And then, and then, but
[01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:12.940]   you'd all do it inside of a bank that you have them just saying, Peter, don't you call
[01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:20.380]   me? Because I can't go and I sold my soul to the Apple store. Anyway, so we're going
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:24.940]   to, we are, we're running out of time here. We've been, we've been chatting away. We're
[01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:29.540]   going to come back with your picks. But right now Leo's got the last word.
[01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:34.060]   Hey, once more, let me interrupt and then we'll get back to Mac break weekly. I want
[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:38.700]   to tell you about my ring video doorbell. As I travel around the world, I love it that
[01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:44.580]   I can see what's happening at, in front of my house on, on my, on front of my door. Because
[01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:49.300]   I installed a few years ago now, the ring video doorbell. It's got a high def camera,
[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:55.620]   motion sensors, a speaker and a microphone plus of course a doorbell. So when somebody
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:45:01.340]   rings the bell, I can hear it ring not just in the house, but anywhere. My smartphone goes
[01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:06.340]   ding dong. Actually, it makes a nice wind chime sound. And then I know somebody's ringing
[01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:09.540]   the doorbell. I can say, I can see who it is in the video. If I want to talk to them,
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:14.020]   I can't, I say, yeah, if it's, you know, UPS, I can say, I'm in the bathtub, just leave
[01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:18.100]   it there. I'll, I'll sign for tomorrow or whatever. So I never miss a package. By the
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:21.460]   way, then I can keep an eye on the package because the motion sensor, even if somebody
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:25.980]   doesn't ring the doorbell, it still notifies me. There's somebody on your front steps. And
[01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:29.300]   you get to set the zones. So I could set it all the way out to the street, all the way
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:33.740]   down the front path, if I want, or just right there, you know, I could say how far to the
[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:40.300]   left, how far to the right. It's really a cool software. It also will keep track of
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:44.900]   it so I can go back in time. And this is really useful for, you know, when, when did the plumber
[01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:49.580]   come? He's built me for eight hours. How long was he actually there? That kind of thing.
[01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:53.580]   You could see who's at your house. You could see when, when did the kids come home? What,
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:57.940]   how late did your, you know, your son come home last night? That kind of thing. It's
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:03.420]   great. In fact, they even have a neighborhoods program where you can share your ring video
[01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:07.460]   doorbell with your neighbors. They can share with you. And now you've got a digital video
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:12.540]   neighborhood watch. It's awesome. Bring doesn't just stop at the front door. No, no, they've
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:16.580]   got a bunch of products now, including the floodlight cams you can put around your house.
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:22.220]   Lights come on. You know, when people go down the back or a deer or raccoon, but you not
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:26.980]   only the lights come on, you, the camera comes on, you can see, you'll get a notification.
[01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:33.020]   You can talk to them. You say, raccoon, get away. Or can I help you buddy? You want to
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:41.820]   see him jumping? You do that. I get one question for you, punk. Do you feel lucky? And if that
[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:45.660]   doesn't scare him, which it probably will, you, and Halloween's coming. You might want
[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:52.060]   this. You, you, you can press a button and send 110 decibel alarm on that floodlight
[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:57.660]   cam and then watch those raccoons go around and I love it. The ring, that's the ring floodlight
[01:46:57.660 --> 01:47:01.900]   cam. They have, they have different doorbells. They have different products. They have, I
[01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:08.100]   can go on, look, go to the website ring.com/macbreak. You can get up to $150 off a ring of security
[01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:14.100]   kit, surround your house with cameras, with motion sensing, with microphones and speakers.
[01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:20.620]   And it's, it, it's great, especially because you could see what's going on at your house,
[01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:25.900]   even if you're not home, or if you're in bed, right? You know, oh, you know, you could
[01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:32.060]   say, well, let's see what's going on out there. Hey, you raccoons, get out of here ring.com/macbreak.
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:36.900]   Go to ring.com/macbreak and get a great deal up to $150 on a ring of security kit, including
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:41.020]   one, two or three floodlight cams, the ring video doorbell, Wall Street Journal's best
[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:47.500]   of CES 2017. It is a great product. I'm a big believer. I've used it for years. I tell
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:51.740]   everybody about it, about everybody. My family now has one. Most of our employees have one.
[01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:56.540]   Just came in to Mike Elgin. He had a great idea. He said, if you run an Airbnb, put a ring
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:48:02.460]   there. So you'll know when your guests arrive, when they leave. And of course, it, it integrates
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:06.940]   with your smart locks and hubs. I use my Amazon Echo. I could say Echo, show my front door,
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:11.380]   and I'll show my front door. I could talk to my front door through my Echo. I love that.
[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:22.180]   Ring.com/macbreak. And now I'm watching you guys. It's time to wrap up Mac Break Weekly.
[01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:27.100]   All right. And with that, we have our picks of the week. Tanya, we're going to start with
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:28.820]   you. Do you have a pick for us?
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:33.140]   All right. I have a pick. In fact, if there's time I have two picks, but you'll let me know.
[01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:34.140]   Go for it.
[01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:40.180]   So my first pick is, as a lot of readers know, for a very long time, I was editor in chief
[01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:46.020]   of the Take Control E-Book series, which covered a lot of Apple products over the years. I
[01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:52.300]   sold that part of the tidbits business last spring to one of our main authors, Joe Kistel.
[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:57.580]   So I'm mostly not working on that anymore. But the Take Control team was very busy over
[01:48:57.580 --> 01:49:04.380]   the summer. And they have made a bunch of e-books about iOS 11 and high Sierra. And what's really
[01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:10.300]   great about reading an e-book is there's not interstitial videos, there's not ads, there's
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:15.020]   not pop-ups. You could just really immerse yourself and learn stuff. In particular, they're
[01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:21.180]   all good. And the one I wanted to just share with you a little bit is the one Josh Senners
[01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:27.460]   wrote and Joe Kistel edited about iOS 11. It is absolutely packed with information about
[01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:32.740]   what's new and information about what was recently knew that you may not have never learned.
[01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:38.700]   So go for it. There's various bundles right now on the Take Control sites. You can get
[01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:44.660]   hundreds and hundreds of pages of information for not very much. And I highly recommend them
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:54.620]   all. My second pick is I finally gave in and bought a case thing so that I could carry
[01:49:54.620 --> 01:50:00.860]   my iPhone with me while I run. I've resisted this for basically the whole life of the iPhone
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:06.060]   because I hate stuff hanging off of me when I run. I finally bought one. I just wanted
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:12.300]   to share it because it works so super well. It is called the Running Buddy. And it has
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:21.260]   magnets inside of it that allow this flap here that I'm showing to go inside of a shirt
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:25.700]   or pair running shorts. You can put it on the front of you or you can stick it right
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:30.100]   over your back right over your spine, which is where I love to put it. They have different
[01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:39.180]   sizes of cases. The one I'm showing right now holds my iPhone 6S just fine. It goes right
[01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:44.060]   in. There's a separate pocket. I can stick a card key into and I can even get a few other
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:49.260]   tiny things into. When I'm running, it doesn't bob. It doesn't bobble. It doesn't blop. It
[01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:56.180]   just works. All my running friends are jealous and are slowly checking it out as well. So
[01:50:56.180 --> 01:51:01.420]   Running Buddy gets a very high recommendation for me as an iPhone carrying case, especially
[01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:07.300]   for people who run with their phones. I think the only time I run with my phone or run at
[01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:19.180]   all was missing a flight. So anyway, but that looks great for that. So Andy, what's
[01:51:19.180 --> 01:51:26.300]   your pick for the week? Kind of a double pick of the week. I've been looking at looking
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:33.500]   through the auction catalog for the Debbie Reynolds/CarryFisher auction at profilesandhistory.com. They're
[01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:37.420]   the auction houses auctioning off essentially the contents of both of their houses or at
[01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:42.260]   least anything that's semi-interesting and useful. I'm trying to talk myself into and
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:46.060]   or out of putting a bid in on one of Carrie Fisher's old sofas. There are at least two
[01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:51.180]   or three of them. They're like starting bid $200. And all year long, I really have been
[01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:57.380]   looking at my old sofa that I basically moved into this house with 10 years ago. I've been
[01:51:57.380 --> 01:52:01.580]   thinking, "I should go to the store." I'm like, "If I had that money earmarked for buying
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:07.980]   a sofa, what could be more awesome than owning a sofa that Carrie Fisher might have watched
[01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:14.460]   Netflix in? My butt would be on the same cushion that Carrie Fisher has but has been in." So
[01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:19.260]   I'm trying to talk about it. But in terms of the pick of the week, Apple related, you can
[01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:25.340]   bid on page 112 of the auction catalog, you can buy an Apple II computer owned by Debbie Reynolds,
[01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:34.220]   serial number A2S1-0082, so that would make it according to this. One of the first 100 Apple
[01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:39.820]   IIs built by Apple Computer, not the Apple II Plus. This is like the first one they made after
[01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:49.020]   the bare board Apple I. It also claims that Debbie Fisher's son purchased this directly from Steve
[01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:54.540]   Jobs. It says here, "Tod Fisher took delivery of this computer directly from Steve Jobs and
[01:52:54.540 --> 01:53:02.700]   Los Altos." So don't know what exactly that means. If that means that he was employee 0001
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:07.660]   of the first Apple store. You can show up at the mom's garage with a check for whatever. But
[01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:15.340]   in technical terms, it is an Apple II. So no floating point basic. However, there's a
[01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:21.740]   low resolution picture of it with the lid off. And I do think that there is a 16K language card
[01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:28.060]   next to the power supply. It says that the 8K was upgraded to 24K of RAM, which would
[01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:32.860]   also support the idea that this is a 16K language card. So you would be able to do floating point
[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:39.020]   operations, not to start the integer basic there. There also seems to be a disk controller card
[01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:43.100]   there in slot number six. Although it doesn't mention that you get any disk drives or anything
[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:47.820]   with it. They're saying this very early Apple II represents a milestone in computing history that
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:52.300]   launched uninterrupted Apple brand loyalty from Debbie Reynolds and her organization.
[01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:57.500]   So if you want the most probably the most glamorous Apple II vintage computer you can get,
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:01.900]   I mean, she she she started again and singing in the rain. She was the unsinkable Molly
[01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:07.420]   Brown. She had a Vegas act that went on for years and years and years. And she was the mother of
[01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:12.220]   Carrie Fisher that alone should make this the coolest Apple II ever. This bid there the
[01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:19.820]   that's thinking that it's going to go the anticipated as sale prices 1000 to 2000 dollars.
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:25.180]   They usually lowball that. So I would come basically armed with at least five or six thousand
[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:29.900]   dollars as my maximum bid to get this. But who knows? So I'm doing these two reasons.
[01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:35.740]   A it's a cool auction catalog. You download the entire PDF and you will have such a great time
[01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:42.620]   just looking at what are mostly charge keys, but also like pieces of memorabilia things that
[01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:48.060]   things that what how cool must it be to have given Carrie Fisher something that you made like
[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:53.180]   when you're saw her in an autograph line at some con three or four years ago and found out that
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:57.740]   not only did she kept keep it but it was on a shelf in her house. And so as I'm looking at these
[01:54:57.740 --> 01:55:04.540]   things all that person must be so pleased with that. Also, also, but if you're some of these
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:09.180]   auction ads are non safe for work because Carrie Fisher she was very amused by novelty
[01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:16.140]   a novelty tourist souvenirs involving male genitalia. So there are a few things of that nature that
[01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:22.460]   you can work. But it's such it's such a fun PDF to download put in your iPad and and play with.
[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:28.140]   And so if you if you like this, if you if you enjoyed this PDF, if you want to repay me,
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:33.900]   don't bid on any of the sofas because I'm I'm so at the auction is in a couple of weeks. I think
[01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:40.060]   it's like the second week in October. Where's the I'm not? It is I think it is in LA. I'd have to
[01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:45.420]   shed I'm sorry. I don't I believe it's in LA, but I don't know. But that and again, I'm
[01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:51.340]   it would be by far the most expensive piece of furniture I have ever purchased between the purchase
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:55.980]   price. Assuming that the $200 goes up to like a thousand or fifteen hundred for what is
[01:55:55.980 --> 01:56:02.060]   legitimately just an old sofa that you would pay $50 for in a yard sale. But but a conversation
[01:56:02.060 --> 01:56:06.540]   but a conversation piece every time someone comes over like that's that was nobody was turned
[01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:12.460]   down an invitation to my Tony Awards party. If I said that by the way, I did three weeks ago,
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:19.500]   it arrived, Princess Leia's sectional sofa. You can fight plus remember there was that
[01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:25.900]   documentary on HBO. So you can actually see here's where it was and here's who actually was
[01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:31.660]   was sitting there. So like I said, I'm just spending ever since I ever since I downloaded the catalog
[01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:39.260]   few days ago. Again, I've been in a I have been in a horrible Lovecraftian abyss of
[01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:44.380]   talking myself into bidding and then talking myself out of bidding because again, $1,500
[01:56:44.380 --> 01:56:49.660]   probably for the so far plus what must be six or $700 have it shipped for again a ready old sofa.
[01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:54.620]   But I'm afraid that Andy, you and I are going to have to we're going to be bidding against each
[01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:59.980]   other. I'm sorry. I'll tell you we'll choose one sofa a piece. Okay. Yeah. We'll talk
[01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:06.380]   also. This is a good place to mention my Kickstarter that is going to be nominally to produce some sort
[01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:14.060]   of revolutionary iPod tether strap. But I'm just trying to raise money to again by one of
[01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:21.020]   the two. I'm going to state that to begin with. I'll say for the the fifth, the $500 reward level
[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:25.020]   is that you can come to my house, you can sit on her sofa. There you go. Pick their taken. That's
[01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:29.580]   perfect. I want her sofa. That's all I want. I just don't know. I just want her so far. I'm sorry.
[01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:35.340]   Jim, what do you what do you got for us? Well, now that we're done with Andy's therapy session.
[01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:41.740]   Oh, you guys are done. My session continues until the hammer goes down on this.
[01:57:42.380 --> 01:57:49.340]   So mine is always very simple. And I know that the guys are sitting back there waiting to type in
[01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:54.140]   the band that I'm going to recommend because Alex, it's sent you have been on. I always recommend
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:58:01.900]   a band. So this week's band is called Fuzzy F O Z Z Y and they have a new song called Judas
[01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:10.380]   that is a great song. Now, as the listeners of the show know, I kind of like a hard rock
[01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:16.780]   type sound, but it's got to have a great beat. It's got to have, you know, a really good chorus.
[01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:26.300]   And that's what this song has.
[01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:32.300]   [Music]
[01:58:32.300 --> 01:58:41.500]   You are beautiful on the inside. You are in a sense personified. I don't think it's bad.
[01:58:41.500 --> 01:59:04.540]   I know they're scary clouds dancing the back right? That is a good sign.
[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:20.540]   Now, I have a question. Have you, my daughter, my eight-year-old daughter is actually into hard rock.
[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:25.900]   So I don't know exactly. She started because she read this book about, you know, it's something like,
[01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:30.300]   you know, women that kick butt or something like that that we got her. And one of them was Joan
[01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:34.060]   Jett. So she started watching, listening to Joan Jett, that she started to go into all, like, she just
[01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:42.300]   started, went down that path. So she's a bit of a hard rocker. Have you seen Frog Leap studios?
[01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:49.260]   Have you seen the stuff that they do? No. Can you guys pull off, you just have to show this just
[01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:59.500]   for a second. The Toto Africa. Yeah. This is a, so these guys cover generally not hard rock.
[02:00:00.380 --> 02:00:04.780]   But in a hard rock way. And it's kind of a thing on YouTube.
[02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:11.580]   I'm just curious what your expert opinion about this, because this is, my daughter
[02:00:11.580 --> 02:00:24.780]   is obsessed with, not obsessed, but really into this. So it starts off. Here we go.
[02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:30.780]   Nice.
[02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:53.660]   It's actually so good that I have a hard time listening to the old one now, which is one of my
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:58.540]   favorite songs. And now I'm like, I listened to this one and my kids will just crank this up and
[02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:02.540]   tell my wife. Yeah, she covers someone who's talking about it in the chat room. She covers
[02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:07.740]   Adele, hello. She covers, you know, they cover, he covers, and there's like a lot of, this is what
[02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:15.260]   he does. Like, he just covers it. That's awesome. Anyway, yeah, I love it. Anyway, so
[02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:23.660]   it's the same. It's a really interesting model from a media perspective. So anyway, so going back to,
[02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:30.780]   you have a back story on the band that you, no, a lot of these bands, I just find, I mean,
[02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:37.980]   some of them that I've recommended, I've listened to for years. And, you know, I recommend those.
[02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:45.740]   Fuzzy's been around for a long, long time. And, you know, it's one of the ones that I never thought
[02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:51.820]   to recommend. But then they just put out that new song, Judas. And I thought it was such a great
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:02:00.060]   song. And then, you know, when I get the email to come on the show, I think, oh, who have I been
[02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:05.100]   listening to a lot lately that I really love? And then, you know, Fuzzy was the first one to come up.
[02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:12.540]   So, you know, that's, that's how it happens. I hear a song. And I think, wow, it's been a long
[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:17.980]   time since I've listened to this. And I jotted out. And then when I come on Mac break, that's...
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:21.900]   Now, do you have a list anywhere? Do you have, do you do any kind of playlists or any kind of,
[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:26.540]   because I, you know, I usually am building out my workout tape, which is my workout,
[02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:31.980]   you know, Spotify list or whatever. And I'm always trying to add new things. Is there anywhere I
[02:02:31.980 --> 02:02:41.260]   can find your suggestions? So an Apple music, I'm on as Jay Dalwurable on Apple music. So,
[02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:45.900]   I have a playlist on there. And I think it's called Jim's Walk. Okay, very good. So,
[02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:53.180]   I like to listen. There's probably dozen songs on there. So I like to listen to songs. And actually,
[02:02:53.180 --> 02:02:59.740]   I added that Fuzzy song to that playlist like a week ago. So I like to listen to songs that,
[02:02:59.740 --> 02:03:05.420]   that are just like that, that are kind of upbeat, you know, that when you walk, you don't want
[02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:08.460]   something that's going to slow you down. You want something that's going to keep the pace up.
[02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:16.300]   So that Jim's Walk playlist are some of my favorite songs to put in my, my AirPods and just go.
[02:03:16.300 --> 02:03:21.820]   And, you know, when my workout, I mostly want to be mad. That's, that's usually my, my rule of,
[02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:24.940]   the, you know, it needs to be upbeat, but it needs to be make me mad, you know, like, you know,
[02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:31.340]   because I'm going to be mad at my, at my workout. Very good.
[02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:35.340]   Does Apple Watch give you credit for heart rate increase when it's just, you're just
[02:03:35.340 --> 02:03:38.860]   pissed off because you can't get this with this shelving installed correctly?
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:42.380]   Yeah. I do not listen to, I don't not listen to heavy metal when I'm doing shelving because I'm
[02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:47.580]   already mad. Like I don't, I don't need to be made mad to, to do it. I like, like I looked at the,
[02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:52.300]   the, the, the, their little AR app that they put in, which is cute. You know, you can put a,
[02:03:52.300 --> 02:03:56.060]   a chair in there and I was like, so for all that money that you spent on that AR app,
[02:03:56.060 --> 02:04:00.300]   I could have had video instructions on how to make that chair, which would be much more valuable to
[02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:05.100]   me than, than seeing if it fit or not. I just want to know why I'm ending up with three extra screws.
[02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:10.860]   Um, so anyway, yeah, I'm thinking that the Apple Watch needs like an emotion ring.
[02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:14.700]   It could have a different color depending on whether you were happy or sad, but if you've had
[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:18.220]   a tense emotions for a certain number of time, your, your ring will fail.
[02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:23.740]   Okay. Just now this, this is a serious, serious recommendations. It's something I really,
[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:28.300]   really want for people, the Apple Watch for people who like work out of their,
[02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:33.420]   whose, whose main job is inside their home, whether it means that they are the head of the,
[02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:39.740]   the domestic affairs of the house or they, they're self employed. I need like a, a progress ring that's
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:45.500]   or a, a badge of words says, you left the house every day this week. Here's your award.
[02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:51.420]   You left the house and you got out of your pajamas. I know I was on to say, and you were,
[02:04:51.420 --> 02:04:56.780]   yeah, you were jeans. Good job. I'll take, I'll, I'll take it. One of the things I use my fitness
[02:04:56.780 --> 02:05:01.020]   tracker for, because sometimes like I've got a, I've got a big project that's due and it's like,
[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:05.020]   I just get really, really focused. And then it occurs to me to like, I'm going to go to Google
[02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:09.500]   Fit and I'm going to see like what the step counts are like. Okay. So that verifies that I have
[02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:13.900]   literally not left the house in three days. I don't like the, I don't like to let that happen.
[02:05:13.900 --> 02:05:17.420]   Am I the only one that gets upset if my watch dies? And I feel like I took a long walk and I'm
[02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:21.580]   like, I didn't even get any credit for that. I mean, it was just, this is, you know, I'm just
[02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:27.900]   sad, frustrated. Well, as, as, as the Lord give it the Lord take it, that happens to me, but I also,
[02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:32.620]   I also have like on, on my Google Fit on my phone, like it keeps track of what, here's your record.
[02:05:32.620 --> 02:05:38.940]   It's like your, your record is that you, you, you ran for, you ran for like 11 miles on this date.
[02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:45.180]   I said, full, I never, I never ran more than like, again, I will, I will, I was about to say,
[02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:50.380]   I will run for a plane. But there is, there is almost always a cod of saying, if it's, if it's
[02:05:50.380 --> 02:05:59.100]   more than like 10 gates away, it's like, I got my iPad. I got comic books. I haven't read.
[02:05:59.100 --> 02:06:04.380]   I'll just wait to take the, take the next slide. I'm glad I'm glad I'm glad it's lying on my behalf.
[02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:09.020]   So, so every time that cheats me out of steps, I'm like, it also told me that once I biked 48 miles,
[02:06:09.020 --> 02:06:15.820]   like, okay, there is a car I've alved in that I think. So I don't, I don't actually have a real
[02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:20.620]   pick, but I do have a, a rant that I posted. I don't, I don't post many rants anymore, but I,
[02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:26.860]   I may post more because it's, but if you go up to LinkedIn, it's called ending the conference call
[02:06:26.860 --> 02:06:32.300]   insanity. I, you know, if anybody who's listening who, who is on a lot of conference calls, I'm on
[02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:38.940]   like four to five a day. It is my, my two cents on, on that, I'm not going to spend much time talking
[02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:44.540]   about it other than you can, you can look at it and, and you know, it's, it's my, it's my public service
[02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:51.580]   announcement for how to have us not make fun of you after the call. So anyway, so anyway, so,
[02:06:51.580 --> 02:07:00.140]   Jim, where can people find you? I think find me on Twitter at jdowelrimple and on the web at
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:06.620]   loop insight.com. Great. Andy, where can people find you? Spelman last name to get at my blog and
[02:07:06.620 --> 02:07:13.340]   also my Instagram and my Twitter. I'm also going to be on NPR and Boston, the WGBH,
[02:07:13.340 --> 02:07:19.340]   9.7 on Friday afternoon around noon, talking mostly, actually mostly about the iPhone X and the iPhone
[02:07:19.340 --> 02:07:26.140]   8. How's standing? Tonya, where can people find you? I'm at Twitter at Tonya angst. If you want to
[02:07:26.140 --> 02:07:30.780]   read my very occasional articles that I write in tidbits or just check out what the tidbits
[02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:37.420]   crew is at, that's tidbits.com. I will be at the MacTech conference in Los Angeles in November,
[02:07:37.420 --> 02:07:42.540]   so anyone coming there, definitely we can hang out. Awesome. This is Alex Lindley,
[02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:49.180]   sitting in for Leo Leo is, is he back next week? He is back next week. So, so that that's going to be
[02:07:49.180 --> 02:07:56.780]   wondrous. Anyway, so, but for now off you go, because break time is over.
[02:07:56.780 --> 02:08:11.740]   Hey, everybody, I should start looking forward. Hey, everybody, this is Alex Lindsey.
[02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:18.140]   I almost forgot my last name, which is, hey, everybody, this is Alex Lindsey, sitting in for Leo on.
[02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:24.060]   Hey, everybody, this is Alex from somewhere. I don't know why I said from.
[02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:33.500]   I'm laughing. All right. Hey, everybody, this is Alex Lindsey, sitting in for Leo, and we're
[02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:39.020]   I'm here with somebody, somebody and somebody who I will talk about later. And then, and then
[02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:44.300]   we're talking about the Apple Watch. We're talking about Apple's new releases, the Apple Watch,
[02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:47.820]   the Apple TV, and the iPhone 8 right here on Mac Break Weekly. I don't need to say that
[02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:51.260]   again, because I already said that. This is going to make a great outtake here.
