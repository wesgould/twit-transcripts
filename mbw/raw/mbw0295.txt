[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.560]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers Apple and Macintosh and mostly lately iOS.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.560]   And we have a special edition of Mac Break Weekly because we're at the NAB show,
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.560]   the National Association of Broadcasters Show in Las Vegas this week.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.560]   Alex Lindsey is with me.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.560]   I'm Andy Inaco, sleep in this morning.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.560]   Yes.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.560]   Alex, you are the energizer bunny in the inning.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.560]   You started -- you know, it was bunnies.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560]   I felt like I really took it easy yesterday.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.560]   So you started over the weekend giving classes.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.560]   Yeah, a couple of days of classes.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.560]   A couple of days of classes.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.560]   Then Monday we say, "Alex, go out there and record a thousand pieces."
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.560]   And you only came back with 25.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.560]   Just very disappointed.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.560]   You recorded -- basically I think Alex was trying to hit every booth at NAB and do a five minute video.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.560]   But I am so grateful to you because through your eyes we've seen a lot of very interesting stuff.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.560]   Well, and I feel like we've just scratched the surface.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   So tomorrow we're going to go out and get some more.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   Well, we have so many that we are actually going to make it special.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.560]   Alex Lindsey, energizer bunny, tours NAB.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.560]   It's so long and there's so much of it that we're just going to run it at 2X and it'll be over before you know it.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.560]   Well, Tony, we've been doing these for years for the Pixel Core.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.560]   You know, like I --
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560]   You're so good.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.560]   You're so good around it.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.560]   And so it's something that we --
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.560]   You're just -- it's like you've done it a bit.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.560]   We're usually 30 to 50 of them.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.560]   You know, so it's just kind of like --
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.560]   20's nothing.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.560]   Interviewing people.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.560]   Like the suggestion was to interview people.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.560]   It's a lot easier.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   You know, I was like, "Oh, this is -- you don't have to know anything."
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   No, I know.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.560]   Except what's been fun.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.560]   Like, for instance, when you went to the -- the guys who do the camera cards.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.560]   You -- actually, that was more in education and camera cards than anything else.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.560]   People have been saying --
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   Right.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.360]   Somebody said in the chat room, "I've learned more in this day at NAB than I learned in school about
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.360]   videography."
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.360]   Well, and I'm really glad because that's what I hope -- when I think about what we're doing,
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.960]   it's the idea is like, let's look at stuff, but let's use that as a conversation to talk
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   about what is important in production.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.360]   Well, people are getting a lot out of it.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.460]   And even if they're not interested in video production, I think it's fun to see the technologies
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.960]   that are used and so forth.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.760]   Speaking of teachers, Larry Jordan is also here.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.360]   He's the king of final cut.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.360]   Great to see you, Larry.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.360]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   Always good to be here.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.360]   Thank you for the invitation.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   Digital production Buzz is the name of your podcast.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.960]   It is the second oldest podcast on the planet.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.360]   The oldest was started by Adam Curry called All Things Digital in May of 2005.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.840]   And digital production Buzz started in September of 2005, focusing on digital video production
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.480]   and post-production and distribution.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.280]   So we're talking to the filmmakers, actually the people that attend NAB or the folks that
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.280]   listen to our podcast.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.760]   You're talking to the grandchildren now, which is really great of the people you know.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.280]   Listen, I have a 22-year-old that's been watching him since 10, so be careful how far
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.160]   you go in that direction.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.160]   Yes.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.520]   Very Jordan and associates also.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.520]   We have some final cut news.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.520]   We'll ask you about that.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.520]   You do.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.520]   In just a second.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.000]   Alan Tepper is a longtime friend and we see him every year.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.680]   He writes for the Pro Video Coalition.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.760]   Does a podcast in both English and Spanish called Technotour.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.760]   That's correct.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.800]   And it's an honor to be here, first time on your show.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.200]   And I really am honored to be here for your show.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   Thank you for coming in.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.800]   Well, and Alan and I correspond all the time because you've always had some really good
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.600]   articles lately about all sorts of interesting topics, so it's been really great to get
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.600]   John.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.640]   And one of which has you and Alex flying to the 24th century and back.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.000]   So maybe that's how Alex got so energized.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.080]   Maybe the trip back from the 24th century was somehow related to that.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.880]   The copy there is great.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.920]   No, I doubt it.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.240]   Also with this Darren Okada, who is a cinematographer, he's former past president of the American
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.120]   Society of Cinematographers and is at the ASC.com.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.120]   It's great to have you Darren.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.720]   This is probably, NAB is probably, you know, this is your business.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.720]   You come here every year.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.560]   Yeah, I've been coming here for about 10 years.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.640]   Even though in the beginning it was, you know, coming here looking at film based things that
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.640]   get broadcast.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.640]   But now it's everything.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.880]   I mean, this is like the future of what I think everyone's going to be doing.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.760]   We talked yesterday to the guy who puts this show together, they may be showed together
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.960]   and he said only 25% of the attendees, 90,000 people here this year, only 25% of broadcasters.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.920]   It isn't the National Association of Broadcasters.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.640]   And it's really a National Association of Content Creators.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:51.320]   Yeah, I mean, this is, the show has gotten to be a show about anything media.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.480]   Any way of producing, posting, getting it out.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.880]   And you know, it's been just, I would have to say for a show that has this kind of legacy,
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.480]   I'm impressed that they moved with the times.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.480]   They really moved with the times.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.280]   And I think maybe in some cases left broadcasters in the past.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:17.040]   Yeah, but for those of us who create content, this is a wonderful playground of stuff.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.360]   You must be, I don't know them.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.240]   Let me ask, are you excited about the new cannons?
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.640]   They've announced two new cameras for cinematographers.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   I'm excited with the C500.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.960]   Yeah, that's going to be, that's a $30,000 puppy.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.960]   Right.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.200]   They also do a 1D C, which is their 1D X, but it's focused on film as opposed to still
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.200]   pictures.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:47.040]   For me, I mean, the DSLR, I call it the DSLR movement because it's sort of, it is.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.200]   That's an incredible camera they use, the 1D.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:58.520]   But the 500 came out of cinematographers talking like myself to cannon and saying, "We only
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.240]   can't have everything, but could you build this and this and this and this?"
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.560]   And of course they say, "No."
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.920]   And then they come back six months and say, "Well, how about this?"
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:14.720]   And I think that's why that camera for me is fun because they're actually listening.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.640]   You can't put everything in the camera.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.640]   But then you get back into the $200,000 camera, but a camera that has attributes of, "Let's
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.080]   go out and shoot something and let's put it on a big screen."
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.080]   Is incredible.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.320]   And all these companies are stepping up to do this now.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.840]   It really started with red.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.440]   Red woke everybody up.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.400]   Whether they had a camera that, because I remember Alex was here.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.240]   We were here that first year when they had their tent.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.600]   No, nothing that really worked.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.600]   But I think the promise...
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.840]   In fact, many of us thought, "This is all bogus.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.560]   There's no way they're going to ship a product with those specs."
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   Exactly.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.960]   And if you're in a tent, you can just tear it down and sell it somewhere else.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.840]   But just the, I think just the sort of the threat, we're going to come out and do something
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.840]   incredible.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.040]   Got everybody to wake up.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.040]   Where...
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.240]   Well, I think also the excitement.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.240]   The excitement about...
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.240]   Exactly.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.120]   I think the two things that were a wake up call were A, the excitement around red and how
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.560]   many people were buying reds and how many people were excited about that.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:21.440]   And the second was the Canon, the Mark II, or the 5D Mark II, is that that one just exploded.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.600]   I don't think Canon expected that.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.980]   No, the Canon guy told me he said, "Well, we thought we'd throw in some video into our
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.300]   still camera.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.440]   We had no idea that along comes this guy named Vince LaFlore.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:38.360]   He sh- he sh- stuff with his 5D Mark II that is mind-blowing night scenes, you know, incredible
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   stuff.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.200]   And I think that was a shock even to Canon.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   Yes.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.280]   So, for the credit, it took him a couple of years, but they came back with the 1DC and
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.840]   then the 300 and now the 500, which are really aimed at filmmakers.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.160]   Yeah, they're aimed at filmmakers.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.280]   I mean, the Canon is- has made it a point that they're- they are committed to being in
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.480]   this market of professional imaging.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.480]   And so...
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.480]   Whether it's still a video.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.880]   Yeah, well, that's been very different than the past, right?
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.880]   I mean, this has been-
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.880]   Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.240]   Canon has really been, you know, stopped at about $10,000 or $12,000 and after that they
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.240]   went to lenses.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.720]   And then the other divisions, like the division that makes these cameras, did not talk to
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.280]   the still photography division.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.800]   This is- these are the VIX-E as you're talking about.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.920]   These are the consumer-grade Canon quarters we use to shoot.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:27.000]   But that the entire- the entire video development, marketing department of Canon had no idea
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.800]   what the 5D was going to be.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.520]   A good thing because they would have killed it.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.520]   They would have said, "Wait a minute.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.520]   This is a camcorder business.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.520]   It's a big business.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.520]   You're going to kill us."
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.520]   Absolutely.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.840]   So, it forced them.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.200]   I think that's how the- the other thing about the C300 and the 500, it forced them to
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:47.400]   just- both sides to like, "Hey, I work at Canon too, you know, let's start talking,
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.000]   take ideas from each other and then- and then build a thing."
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.480]   So I think that's why I mean it was a really rapid development schedule and I don't think
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.280]   they could have done that unless they all kind of got together.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.640]   One of the things that's very much a thread going out through all of NAB is workflow because
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.600]   now you've got giant, giant files.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:14.400]   I think the 500 is going to be able to shoot raw 4K video which is something like 10 gigabytes
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.240]   of minutes.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.920]   You've got giant files, you've got them manipulated them, you've got it and you're no longer just
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.080]   putting it out in one form.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.440]   You're going to have an iPhone, an iPad and you're going to do 100 different versions.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.680]   And Larry, I know that Final Cut's responding a little bit to this.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.200]   They're going to have support for the red camera.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.000]   They're going to be part of this workflow, right?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.280]   I was invited to a meeting Sunday morning with the product team at Apple.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.160]   But Apple's not here except that they are.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.920]   Well, everybody is here.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.560]   It's just that they don't have a booth.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.920]   They're locus.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.120]   And so what they were doing is they were meeting, it was an on the record meeting with Apple
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.120]   as opposed to an off the record meeting which is what we had last but it was made absolutely
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.280]   clear at the beginning that everything they talked about was on the record except for
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.240]   I got advanced look at some of the announcements from third parties which was under non-disclosure
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.720]   until it was announced here at NAB.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.440]   But they wanted to go through and sort of say this is where we are and then at the end
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.920]   of the meeting they said these are the features they're going to be adding in Final Cut 10
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.920]   in the future.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.560]   Which is really unusual for Apple.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.560]   Well I think they're still...
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.560]   They're under pressure.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.120]   I tell you what, I met somebody here.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.120]   I can't remember his name.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.560]   You would know him.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.080]   He says I'm the guy I got Hollywood to use Final Cut.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.720]   He said he's a television editor.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.720]   Everybody was using Avid.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.440]   He convinced a lot of people to go to Final Cut.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.680]   And I said come to Mac breaking he's busy right now.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.520]   I should have gotten his card.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.920]   He said the sad thing is Hollywood is turning it's back on Apple.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.720]   You're agreeing Alan this is not good for Apple right now.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:48.760]   My opinion and I'm sure Larry has his opinion which may be the same or not but I think that
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.120]   Apple is focusing on a different group of professionals now.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.120]   I think that...
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.120]   The un-professionals.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.160]   Well it depends how you define professional.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.280]   If you make money by producing video then by one definition you're a professional.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.200]   But less high end.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.360]   More corporate.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.360]   More video.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:15.600]   This guy said they've all gone back to Avid because Final Cut 10 was missing some significant
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.600]   features for us even.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.600]   We looked at Premiere.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.400]   We were a little concerned with lack of sand support.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.640]   And the lack of an updated Mac Pro with Thunderbolt has really hurt that.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.080]   Yes and I must disclose that Avid is a very good client of mine.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:34.280]   I've been doing a whole bunch of translations for them for their new products at NEB.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:40.800]   I had to translate at the last minute 10 brochures of new products.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:46.120]   And since we're on Mac break weekly I'll mention that they have even more use of the iPad now
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.760]   with Avid.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.320]   But not so much for editing.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.960]   For handling what's called the rundown and for the benefit of our viewers and listeners.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.640]   A rundown of course there's a rundown here.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.280]   I'm not seeing it but I'm sure there's a rundown for this program.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.480]   I'm just not sharing it with you.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.240]   But just to define it because many of the listeners and readers may not know what it
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   is.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:15.040]   It's kind of like a constantly changing document that shows what's going to be happening and
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.840]   things are being added and removed constantly.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:25.640]   And through their eye news and their new sphere product you'll be able to manipulate the
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.080]   rundown from your iPad wirelessly from anywhere in the world.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.560]   And that's that well flow component that I was talking about.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.560]   Exactly.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.960]   Although in this case it's not manipulating the video.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.360]   It's the order of the stories adding and subtracting.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.920]   I brought that up only because I think the fact that Apple is leaking what Final Cut
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.360]   is up to is a response to the fact that they feel like they're losing people.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.320]   Would you say Larry that that's a fair?
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.240]   I think there's something a little bit different going on.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.760]   I'm not saying you're wrong.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.440]   But I think two things happen.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.160]   One is the launch was probably the worst launch of a product Apple's ever done with the possible
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.800]   exception of mobile me.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.840]   It was blown at every possible way it could be blown.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.840]   You don't launch a product and increase your competitor's sales and you don't launch a
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.680]   product and alienate your entire user base.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.800]   If we separate the launch of Final Cut 10 from the product of Final Cut 10.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.240]   If we look at if for some reason we could go back in time and have Final Cut 7 at all
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.600]   of its associated programs live in harmony with because it does now live in harmony with
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   Final Cut 10.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.520]   And Apple if Apple had said Final Cut 10 is the future we're going to run it in parallel
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.640]   with Final Cut 7 for a year to give people a chance to figure out how to blend over.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.160]   The world would have knelt that Apple's feet said this is the future we're happy.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:47.080]   What they did is they killed Final Cut 7 provided no upgrade path.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.720]   That was the big issue.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.360]   The upgrade path finally showed up in January but by then so many people were spending all
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.600]   their time being angry with Apple.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.240]   I get about 300 emails a day which is a fraction of what Leo gets but nonetheless it's a fair
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.560]   amount of, and I would say it's split 50/50 with people saying they love Final Cut 10 and
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.560]   they can't live without it.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.120]   They're making money and they're a happy camper.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.880]   And the other half saying I hate Final Cut 10 I'm never going to go with it and Apple
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.720]   has just made my life difficult and I think both groups are right is that there is no
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.840]   one perfect tool that meets all the needs.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:23.480]   I think what Apple is doing with the, let me just take that again, Apple told me that
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.680]   they liked being able to share future features which they did when they preannounced multi-camera
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.880]   support when they preannounced the 1003 release.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.480]   They said that worked really well for us.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.080]   We want to do that some more.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.040]   So one of the reasons they had the meeting was to be able to share four new features that
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.840]   are coming sometime in 2012.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.720]   The first feature is multi-channel audio editing tools.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.120]   The second is kind of like having soundtrack built into.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.880]   I don't interpret editing tools to mean mixing.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:00.360]   So I am not going to go that far and say yes although that is clearly a place you could
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.360]   jump to.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.800]   Conclusion you could jump to.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.640]   The second thing is dual monitors.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.080]   You would call these source and record where you are able to compare two different.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.000]   It is probably not going to be what we are used to in Premiere Pro or Final Cut 7.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.800]   Apple made a point of saying that they wanted to do something quote better, whatever that
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.800]   is.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.760]   The third is support for MXF wrapped videos.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:27.280]   So you don't have to, MXF is not P2 but.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.760]   XDCam is a Sony.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.480]   So it can read XDCam natively but it has got to convert it to a quick time format.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.240]   Now it will just take that MXF wrapper that contains the XDCam format and read that natively
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.720]   without having to convert it to quick time.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.520]   So I said does that mean you are moving away from quick time?
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.520]   He said no, no, no.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.480]   There is nothing that we are moving away from quick time.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.360]   We are just supporting another format.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.400]   And the fourth one is native support for red.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.360]   Right now they have to work with quick time proxies.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.360]   Now they will support red natively.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.520]   It is interesting a lot of camera companies are doing the opposite.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.040]   They are saying we are writing into Final Cut Pro as a form.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.040]   Well one of the cool things that Apple got right is ProRes.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.480]   Even from people that hate Apple they love ProRes.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.840]   It is a really good codec.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.200]   It has really high quality.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   It is very efficient.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.440]   It edits quickly.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.920]   So these are all the reasons to adopt ProRes.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:13.600]   And if you do not have to transcode your media and you bypass that whole optimization
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.640]   step then you are going to edit faster.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.840]   One of the things I think is interesting though is why they do not.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:23.840]   To me when you are doing lots of mass work the happy medium when you are doing like two
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.440]   hour events or eight hour events or whatever is LTE where you are getting a little bit of
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.600]   savings without destroying the image.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.080]   Proxy just destroys the image.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.080]   4.2 for long form is a little bit.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:41.160]   Often times I am working on events where we have 12 records going on.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.360]   And then that all has to be backed up before we leave.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.360]   No no no.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.560]   I am just saying we get real sensitive to the amount of data that we have to move.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.960]   And so a third less data is a big deal to us.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.040]   And then having to edit it and process it and everything else.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:59.000]   And so the issue is but Final Cut does not natively you can open it and work with it.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.520]   But it is not when it saves it out it wants to go to 4.2 not 4.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.520]   It is LTE.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.280]   It is regular or proxy.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.000]   Its default setting is 4.2 which is the middle format.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   There is L2 in proxy below and there is 4.2 HQ and 4.4.4.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.440]   But can you set it to actually work in LTE?
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.200]   Because I believe it wants to go to proxy.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.240]   I believe it wants to jump down.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.240]   Oh right.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.620]   The proxy file is specifically designed for laptop editing and they went specifically
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.920]   to the smallest size to save file space.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.600]   It would have been cool if we could have a switch that allows us to select.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.560]   So you are as always flawlessly correct in that you cannot select LTE as a compression
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.760]   choice.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.640]   You could convert it but that takes you time.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.640]   So we got multi let's get to the 4.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.640]   Multi channel audio.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.560]   Audio editing tools was the specific word they use.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.640]   The second is dual monitors which is analogous to source record.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:55.700]   The third is MXF wrapper support and the fourth is red native files.
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.180]   So the red output you can edit directly.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.260]   What red does is it creates two types of files.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.420]   It creates a red native file and it creates three quick time proxy files.
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.460]   And normally you in Final Cut would edit those quick time proxy files.
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.460]   Now you are able to edit the red native which is a raw format.
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.420]   So for people that like processing lots of data and having absolute image manipulation
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.980]   control, think Alex then red native is a good thing.
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.020]   Once you want to start doing any kind of color correction to it or anything else you need
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.980]   to get a hold of the entire color.
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:31.140]   All the color information that proxy won't work because it's just a little quick time.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.180]   Now the next thing that Leo should ask is a brilliant question.
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.140]   Is Final Cut 8 in the horizon?
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.140]   I asked that question.
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.800]   See I'm as brilliant as you Larry.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:47.380]   But only it's because you read the Q sheet that I gave you before the show.
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.380]   The answer is no.
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.300]   The apple is fully committed to Final Cut 10.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.180]   There is no Final Cut 8 lurking in the wings because I asked.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.180]   This is it.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.180]   This is it.
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:20:01.540]   Now the other thing is apple very much two more things from apple than one conjecture.
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.700]   One thing from apple is I said are these the only features we can expect?
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.700]   No no no.
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.260]   They said there's other features coming but these are the ones that were highlighting
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.420]   at this point.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.020]   I then went through a litany of things that I would like to see and they all nodded their
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.180]   head and committed to nothing.
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:21.340]   I think Alan is exactly right with something that he said is that apple sees an autodesk
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.260]   I think reinforces this.
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:29.900]   Apple sees a different definition to professional than the typical Hollywood editor doing a feature
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.180]   film.
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:36.100]   If we look at Hollywood and Alex Kreckman if your numbers are wrong but we're seeing probably
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.820]   four to six thousand people earn their living editing Hollywood feature films.
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.820]   And most.
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.820]   That's a tiny mark.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:47.060]   When you look at the A level of B level films I mean you think you're down to 50.
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.140]   I mean not counting the answers.
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.180]   There's a lot of television production.
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.180]   We talk about television.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.180]   There's a lot more.
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.180]   But it's still going to be less than ten thousand people.
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.180]   How?
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:00.840]   Make their living as an editor and you to deliver mass software, mass market software you can't
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.500]   sell to a ten thousand person market and look at how many people are working with Final
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:11.380]   Cut 7 and Avid Media 3, Medium Composer 3 is still being used actively in Hollywood productions.
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.700]   If you've got a system that works you don't upgrade.
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.620]   So Apple is saying where is the world headed and who was the new professional.
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.540]   Now I think they screwed up the launch but that does not necessarily mean that Final Cut
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.100]   10 is dead in the water.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.820]   I think there's some very powerful things and speed things we can do with Final Cut 10.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.820]   I have to say I can't go back to Final Cut 7.
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.380]   It makes me angry to open it.
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.740]   Like when I open up Final Cut 7 I'm just like I cannot believe I ever used this piece
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.740]   of crap.
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:40.140]   You know like it is like you know I cannot believe I ever did this because you know and
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.700]   I'm learning Premiere and Avid because we're incorporating that in Smoke because we're incorporating
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.940]   that into some more training and I really like a lot of things.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.940]   I like the scale.
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.260]   I like certain features in Premiere that I love.
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.780]   There are scalability things that you get out of Avid that you just don't get anywhere
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:56.780]   else.
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.260]   Smoke has of course all the effects and everything else but I have to say that my day to day
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.020]   like what sits on my laptop and I have to cut something really quickly it's Final Cut
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:08.700]   10 is what I'm using you know on a day to day basis and it is an order of magnitude faster
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.660]   than what I'm doing at 7.
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.580]   And there's little things that frustrate me about how it works but when you start getting
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:17.340]   used to how you build compound clips and how you are just going to stash this together
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.620]   I'm going to detach this I'm going to move it around I'm going to and how quickly I get
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:25.500]   things done I would never ever ever go back to 7.
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.500]   And I think that gets to the big point which is you find the tool that meets your need
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.660]   and what happens is we get caught up in the religious war of I've got to support this
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.740]   or I've got to support that and that Apple has a marketing department that does a really
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.780]   good job of looking out for Apple.
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.900]   Our job is to earn a living as a business and if we earn a living like you do is you
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.380]   pick the tool that helps you to meet the deadlines with the budget that you've got.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:52.220]   And half of my consulting clients who were using Final Cut Pro 6 or 7 have already gone
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.420]   to 10 and they're very happy with it.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.540]   And the thing that I would say is that if someone asked me what would you edit a film
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.860]   on you know I would edit a film on I have it you know like I wouldn't do a long form
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:02.860]   on and find a chance.
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:03.860]   That's interesting.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:04.860]   Absolutely.
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.820]   I mean because the scalability and managing that number of objects and everything else
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.740]   but if I'm going to do ENG like a five minute ENG that I'm going to shoot out here on the
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.980]   floor I would absolutely do that in Final Cut 10.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.980]   You're going to use the design movie.
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:20.180]   It's G.C. in Toronto saying doesn't Autodesk strategy with smoke kind of mirror Apple strategy?
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.180]   Exactly.
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:27.500]   That's what really impressed me about Sunday is that what happened is Apple like red decided
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.140]   to change the market to perception of what editing is in the market and forced every
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.300]   editor to suddenly wake up and say wait a minute what are we really doing here?
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.860]   Industry are we in?
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.620]   And Smoke did exactly the same thing.
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.780]   They dropped the price from 15,000 to 3,400.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.540]   They put in a timeline interface.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:44.540]   They redid the interface.
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.980]   They made it much more accessible to timeline based editors and they are doing the same kind
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:53.220]   of disruptive thing to their market that Apple did to Final Cut 10.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.740]   And then we look at what Apple just did.
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.340]   Are they getting the same reaction from pros?
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.340]   Oh my goodness.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.340]   The doors are pulling over.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.340]   Yeah.
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.580]   The thing is that at Smoke is that people don't know what Smoke does.
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:07.180]   Smoke is an editing and finishing tool that basically allows you to bring your video in,
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:12.480]   do final grade effects, color grading, color correction, bruise coffee, slices bread, tux
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:16.140]   you embedded night and it delivers the final master for output.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.140]   So it's the last stage?
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.340]   Well it can be the last stage.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:21.380]   I think that one of the things that when you walk into a commercial house, you know, so
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:25.460]   a post house that's going to be doing this, Smoke is the kind of obviously some of them
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.180]   will have flame and bigger versions of it.
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.580]   But for a lot of the stuff where we're just going to finish off, we're going to cut your
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:35.900]   commercial together and know that when we finish and leave that day, you have a finished
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:36.900]   commercial.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.900]   You know, we were able to edit it together.
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:38.900]   We were able to add it.
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.900]   Not just finished, but gorgeous.
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:40.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.300]   And you can do all the fine editing, all the color correction, all the, you can pull the
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.020]   green screens and do all the pieces with a lot of control.
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.180]   You use something like Smoke and Smoke started, I don't even know what the price was, it was
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:55.420]   like at $60,000 or $100,000 and then it moved $15,000, which was a big step I think brought
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:56.820]   it as a bear.
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.340]   And the reality is until this new interface came out with Smoke, I don't think that it
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:07.060]   made sense to go to $3,500 because it's not or $34.95 or whatever, because it's not a,
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.540]   it was heavy lifting to learn it.
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.540]   Yeah.
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.060]   And I think that it's changing dramatically when they put out the public beta in June.
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:21.500]   I mean, I thought Autodesk was really smart in the sense that we don't care what you do
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:26.540]   your editing on, what you create on Final Cut, Avid, we'll take that timeline in and now
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.860]   we'll do essentially what the finished pass would be.
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:35.780]   Color correction, titling, any effects, and you have a platform, and I think that that's
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:41.740]   where I was always frustrated with Final Cut was that you learn your own work around how
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:42.940]   to make something work.
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:49.220]   But to finish a project, it was an empty number of plugins that never talk to each other.
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.420]   So I'd rather just, I love what they're doing.
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.860]   Take all that out.
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.820]   The timeline goes out, media goes out.
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:00.580]   Here we are in this platform where now we can do anything to make your project shine.
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:04.780]   And I do a lot of color correction work where I work on lusters.
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:10.460]   So for me, looking at that, I like, it's funny, I like the interface on smoke mode and I do
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.500]   working on lusters when I'm doing 4K movies on them.
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.420]   I should put out these are still Mac products.
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:19.540]   Is there anything Apple needs to do to keep the pro in line?
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.460]   Do they need to keep the Mac Pro and then you'd update it?
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:25.020]   The Mac Pro is so important.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.500]   Professionals need a Mac Pro.
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.500]   Yeah.
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.820]   I mean, we can't do it on an iMac.
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.020]   But actually they made smoke so you can't work on an iMac.
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.500]   And in fact, I'm told a lot of editors using a laptop.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:34.500]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.740]   I mean, Thunderbolt, I don't think we would be having this conversation today at this
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.860]   NAB with 4K and these products if Thunderbolt never got introduced.
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.900]   Yeah, I just want to make sure I wasn't the first one to say it.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:45.900]   Oh.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:46.900]   You were the only one who's ever said that.
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.260]   I was like, I was like, I was like, I'm just finally giving you two votes.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.260]   See?
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:55.700]   Thunderbolt is the biggest thing I think that's going to happen to media.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:56.700]   It's opening the doors.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.060]   You need that speed to move massive files.
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:04.260]   You need that speed, but the simplicity that the consumer, anybody who buys a Mac can plug
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:09.740]   into that and have speed and accessibility to tools that are just amazing.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.420]   So we need a Mac Pro with Thunderbolt.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:12.420]   We don't have one.
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.420]   Right.
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.420]   Yeah.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.060]   Except Leo, there's a small problem.
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.700]   And that's 4K on Thunderbolt because Thunderbolt isn't fast enough to support 4K.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.500]   We also need fiber Thunderbolt or WIP.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.180]   And fiber Thunderbolt to be able to do 4K.
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.180]   But that's coming too.
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.580]   So do you think that's what's holding Apple back is that they don't want to release a
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.940]   Mac Pro with copper-based Thunderbolt.
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.580]   They want to wait till that fiber-based Thunderbolt is ready.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.340]   I understand it's close to ready.
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:41.300]   There's so many peripherals that, you know, there's so many things that are based on the
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.300]   copper-based one.
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.220]   I mean, you can add so many.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.980]   I mean, there's at least a dozen.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:46.980]   There's plenty.
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.220]   I mean, there's actually people when you look at the camera.
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.020]   But when you look at the booth, we'll talk about that black magic camera a little bit.
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.180]   You go over to the black magic booth.
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.180]   They certainly are.
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:59.540]   I mean, there's great adapters I'm seeing for going Thunderbolt to fiber.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:05.020]   I mean, there's all kinds of great ways to get that information out of your computer.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.940]   Not that bandwidth bottleneck that's going away.
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.860]   The other cool thing is that we now have a Thunderbolt adapter, which goes to a PCI card.
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:16.820]   So you can plug in a PCI card, take Thunderbolt out of an iMac, go to the PCI card and do whatever
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:17.820]   you want to do with it.
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:22.060]   For monitoring, you can use it for ingest, you can use it for output.
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:25.340]   Not just in the black magic booth, but as Alex will attest when he was doing his thousand
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:28.500]   videos yesterday, Thunderbolt is everywhere on the floor.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:33.340]   When you start seeing these cameras, I mean, I think it's the 500 or whatever has a Thunderbolt
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.340]   cable right coming right out of the camera.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.340]   We're taking breaks everywhere.
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.660]   I do want to talk about that.
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.660]   There's new stuff from red.
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:41.860]   I want to talk about the black magic cinema camera, which is very interesting.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:47.020]   Some say it's a free camera because the software you get is worth more than the camera costs.
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.860]   So the camera will just throw that in for free.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.700]   And we finally know what Philippe Stark is working on for Apple.
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.020]   The truth finally comes out.
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:58.820]   We have a very interesting panel here at NAB 2012.
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.180]   Larry Jordan from Digital Production Buzz.
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:07.140]   Darryl Ocada from the ASC.com Alan Tepper from Alan Tepper.com and the Pro Video Coalition.
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.740]   And of course, his podcast, which I should give you credit for, which is because it's
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.940]   in both Castilian, Spanish and English.
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:16.740]   The audio, Techno Tour, the audio video and telephony podcast.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.740]   Techno Tour.
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:21.060]   Techno Tour.
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.780]   And of course, Alex Lindsey of the Pixelcore.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.340]   More in just a moment, but first I'd like to tell you a little bit about our friends
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:31.140]   at Citrix who have a great product for people who want to do online meeting.
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.260]   It's called Go To Meeting.
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:38.180]   Uses the great Citrix Remote Access Backbone that makes it possible for you to share your
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.180]   screen with everybody.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.860]   In fact, you can have meetings of up to 300 people and share your screen and they can
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.180]   share their screen.
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:48.500]   And you can work together, you can collaborate, but now you can also see them.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.540]   And for this crew, that's probably really important.
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.900]   They're all video focused.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.860]   And it's true when you're selling, when you're working, when you're collaborating, the best
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:00.660]   way to work together is to be able to see that frown, those folded arms, a smile, to
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.980]   get to know your coworkers, your clients.
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.820]   In video makes a huge difference.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.300]   And that's where Go To Meeting is just blowing the, blowing the lid off this.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.900]   HD faces looks so good.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:12.900]   The quality is amazing.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.500]   It makes a huge difference when you're actually looking at the person you're having to meet
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.500]   with.
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.660]   You want to see them frown when you're giving the budget and go, "Oh, I probably should
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.660]   have pulled that back."
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:22.660]   Exactly.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:23.660]   Exactly.
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.100]   You're missing all of that input if you're just talking on the phone.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:30.100]   For product collaboration, for planning meetings, for weekly status updates, and of course,
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.100]   for pitch meetings, there's nothing like Go To Meeting.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.300]   Everybody's got a camera now.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.580]   Oh, and one more thing.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.580]   It now works on the iPad.
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:41.780]   So you can meet with the built-in camera on the iPad, plug your headphones in, talk the
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.020]   whole thing over the internet.
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:46.500]   You could be sitting in the park and attending a meeting on Go To Meeting.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.500]   It's really amazing.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.660]   Here's the deal.
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.020]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.020]   That's all we ask.
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.380]   Not going to cost you anything.
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.140]   Visit GoToMeeting.com.
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.020]   There's an orange try-it-free button there.
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.260]   Click that orange try-it-free button.
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:03.740]   And the offer code is for this show, Mac Break, I think.
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.100]   Is that right?
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.100]   Yes.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.420]   Mac Break.
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.420]   So if you go to Meeting.com, click the orange try-it-free button.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.100]   Use the offer code, Mac Break.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:16.940]   Then download the free iPad app, and give it a try on the iPad as well.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.660]   Go to Meeting.com.
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.300]   Mac or PC, it works great.
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.820]   Completely cross-platform.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.300]   Offer code, Mac Break.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.180]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.500]   So I'm going to save the Blackmagic camera, the free camera.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.580]   I like that.
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:40.380]   But before we get to Red and its announcements, have we talked about everything about FFX?
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:44.980]   The final cut that people will need to know about the next-they didn't give you a date
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:46.540]   for release, did they?
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.060]   There were two things that I asked.
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:51.100]   One is when, and they said 2012 there, I'm going to be more specific.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.300]   That's this year, and that's this year.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.540]   You know, good news there.
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.020]   And the other said, can you speculate on what hardware is coming?
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.100]   Because I agree with Darryl that we need to-
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.100]   Mac Bros.
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.100]   The Mac Bros.
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.100]   Darryl.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.100]   Sorry, Darryl.
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.100]   You're acting like weel now.
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.100]   Did I call you Darryl?
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.100]   I'm so sorry.
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.260]   See, I just want to let you know I listened to you.
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.260]   And it's your fault.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.260]   I don't listen to my producers.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.260]   Darryl.
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:12.260]   Darryl.
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.260]   Okada.
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.740]   He's a Sima Manamaher.
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.500]   But I agree that the Mac Pro is critical, and I asked if they're going to be able to
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.620]   commit to any hardware, and they all said no.
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.780]   But there is one piece of gossip that I do anticipate.
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:26.100]   I said, are you guys coming out with any new software that's going to work with?
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.740]   Motion and compressor and final cut.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.700]   And all their faces suddenly got stiff.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.940]   Oh, that's a good sign.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.780]   So they've got something else that's bubbling away in the corner.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.140]   One thought is logic pro 10.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:41.700]   But I think the one huge piece that's missing is something dealing with audio.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.180]   It's a replacement for soundtrack.
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.820]   So logic is, of course, audio.
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.300]   Soundtrack is getting a little long.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.380]   Soundtrack is dead, not just long in a tooth.
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:49.380]   You can't get it.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.380]   You can't get it.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.380]   So we'll just have to see.
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.380]   But there's something else coming, and hopefully we'll find out more this year.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.780]   Yeah, very interesting.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.780]   And yes, that's it.
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.180]   That's it for final cut.
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:01.660]   It will be a free upgrade, a downloadable upgrade, or just so far.
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.860]   From what I've been told, there's no way to charge for an upgrade on the Mac App Store.
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.660]   They are committed to the App Store for two reasons.
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:12.660]   One, the license is more flexible with the App Store.
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:16.460]   And you can, because you can download any application you buy in a Mac App Store to three
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:17.460]   computers.
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:21.500]   But the second, Apple is committed to sandboxing, which as you know is being able to restrict
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.300]   what applications have access to our operating system for security purposes.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:29.540]   And they really want to have stuff be sandboxed to improve the security of the Mac.
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:34.060]   So Apple is completely committed to having Mac App Store upgrades, which means they're
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.660]   free in the foreseeable future.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.460]   Until they go to Final Cut 11.
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.380]   Leah, we got enough problems for the town.
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:46.860]   But the marketing campaign is so great for Final Cut 11, I'm just saying.
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:47.860]   Real opportunity there.
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:48.860]   All right, red.
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:53.500]   And now it's still, we did actually, we went out there and met with the red folks and they're
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.860]   saying they're making noises like they want to set up the studio with red cameras.
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:57.860]   I think that would be great.
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.300]   What am I going to do 4K?
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.060]   I can't, you can put it on YouTube.
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.060]   You know, YouTube can handle 4K.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.060]   I can put it on YouTube.
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.060]   You can put it on YouTube.
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.660]   All right, maybe that's, maybe that's it.
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.460]   There isn't a monitor on the planet that displays 4K.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.660]   There are monitors on the planet.
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:11.660]   There's everybody.
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:12.660]   There's three of them here.
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:13.660]   Yeah.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:18.180]   Everybody's going to have retina displays on everything soon.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:20.220]   But Leo, don't you want a future proof?
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:23.140]   Everything you're shooting at Twit so that to make sure that everyone can see every
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.140]   little detail.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.580]   Ten years from now.
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:30.340]   These shows have less shelf life than the fish you bought yesterday.
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:34.060]   There's no reason that they should be shot in any archival form whatsoever.
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.060]   In fact, I'm going to erase the tapes right now.
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.900]   Leo, there's already comment that they want to see your face in 4K.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.380]   No, they do not.
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.900]   Although actually we're shooting with these VIXI.
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:46.060]   Is there actually better than studio cameras from a few years ago?
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.740]   They're 1080p cameras.
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:50.860]   And I was looking at myself yesterday and I said, "I'm getting some makeup.
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.460]   This is bad.
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.980]   This is, this is."
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.860]   So 4K, in fact 4K is so good you can't even use makeup.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.060]   You have to do something else.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.060]   Sandpaper.
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:03.060]   Sandpaper because the makeup you see, the makeup.
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:06.660]   One of the things I did see it, I think it was in the Sony booth, is of course they're
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:13.900]   doing 4K workflows and some beautiful 216 PPI OLED displays for reference monitors.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:19.140]   And that really brought home to me even in a small screen, a 13 or a 20 inch screen, a
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:22.620]   retina display is going to transform everything and not just video.
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.380]   When I said it, you get used to looking at your iPad.
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:26.380]   You cannot.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.300]   And you keep on looking at everything looks low resolution after that.
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.300]   It looks slightly blurry.
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.860]   Yeah, blurry and jaggy.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:32.860]   Annoying.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.860]   I'm here, Alex's wife.
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:34.860]   She's fine with it.
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.860]   She's fine with it.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.860]   She looks at Sandpaper.
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.860]   What, what, you tell him story?
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:38.860]   She looks at standard depth?
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:39.860]   No, no, no, no.
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:40.860]   Curly to her watch.
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.860]   She watches standard depth.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:42.860]   Lucy, she doesn't.
[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:43.860]   She'll just watch Oprah or whatever.
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.860]   I'll walk in and she's watching Oprah and it'll be like, it'll be like, it'll be like,
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:46.860]   and it'll be in standard depth.
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.460]   And I'll go, you know it's sharper at that point.
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.260]   Let me explain something about wives.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.460]   It's not that they want to watch in standard depth.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:36:00.060]   It's that the TV system you and I have set up is so damn complicated.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.780]   They don't know how to watch.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.620]   They just, they glad they got it.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.180]   They're glad they're seeing the show.
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.500]   I admit that there are a few cables connected to my TV.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.020]   How many remote controls?
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.500]   I'm trying to get it all under the iPhone.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.500]   You know what?
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.020]   Because we all have iPhones including the kids.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.020]   So they can all control it.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.940]   It would even be more complicated.
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:22.940]   The worst is when, once you think she hasn't figured out what'll happen is I'll be in the
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:27.300]   back house and I'll accidentally select the front Apple TV while I'm doing stuff.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.940]   And suddenly I'm like, why isn't this working?
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:33.180]   And then I get this text like stop playing with your iPhone.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:35.580]   It's not just wives but spouses.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.900]   And I think it generally comes to the fact that they're just glad they could get anything.
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:40.900]   Anything at all.
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.900]   That's so fantastic.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.500]   SDHD I'm not going to complain at this point.
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.020]   But we are moving to Retina displays.
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.020]   We are moving.
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.020]   I think to 4K.
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:53.220]   I've been, you know I hate 3D so much and I've just been saying make it 4K.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.340]   What did you, didn't it feel like everyone's backing off on 3D this year?
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.340]   I mean pretty much.
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.820]   That was last year was the big year.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.820]   It was the low.
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.020]   And now it's all like what we have all this bandwidth now so we'll move to 4K.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.020]   Right.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:08.660]   Well you know it's so much, it's so much, I mean to me looking at things on a Retina
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:14.220]   display, high resolution, I get more of a sense of depth with that without having glasses
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.220]   on.
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.220]   I agree.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.220]   And then I do.
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.220]   It's vivid.
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:24.260]   Then I do having sort of an art of, well Jim Cameron's going to kick my ass again.
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:29.140]   Well even Cameron's kind of hedging his bet because his 5D system does involve 4K and
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.620]   higher frame rates.
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:36.900]   And ultimately you could forget about the, we got 4K and higher frame rates 3D.
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:37.900]   You can wear the glasses.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:38.900]   That's right.
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:45.460]   Actually the higher frame rate and higher resolution does create an unbelievable sense
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.060]   of three dimensions.
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:54.220]   And I'm happy that we've got to this point at this NAB where we're looking at high resolution
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.220]   resolution.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:57.740]   Also high dynamic range displays are going to become.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.740]   Tell me about that.
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.220]   I know about HDR still photography.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.220]   Right.
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.220]   Right.
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:09.860]   There are several companies working on something that goes beyond the sort of the Rec. 709
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:10.960]   specification.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:17.700]   So you actually can get much brighter whites with detail and really rich blacks.
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:23.540]   So that it does, remember first time you looked at a plasma display with a native HD
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:24.540]   feed.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:25.540]   It looked like glass.
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.540]   Right.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.500]   Well this looks like there's an aquarium behind it.
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.500]   It is so amazing.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.660]   And a lot of magic camera is one of them by the way.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:35.660]   So we have to upgrade everything from the beginning to the end though to get that.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:43.580]   You can't or if you're originating in sort of in raw files like you know and you have
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:48.100]   the full resolution of these cameras now you can remaster that material.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.180]   So the data's there.
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.180]   The data's there.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.300]   You can bring it up so you can display it in a way that compels the audience to look
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:54.300]   at it.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.100]   It's only when you do a raw photo.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.100]   Right.
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.460]   You don't have more images.
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:00.900]   You have so much more latitude to get off into HDR.
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:01.900]   Exactly.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:07.220]   I mean there's plenty of room to do things and that's you know that's sort of like the
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:13.540]   same the same area of repurposing content from going you know like the I love Lucy shows.
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:17.420]   Oh they can watch it in HD except it's four by three.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:21.180]   But you're seeing something that you didn't see before because you're getting more details.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:25.020]   You know where you see that is that with those old original Star Trek episodes they've
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.500]   done now remaster.
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:27.500]   Oh yeah.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.660]   They took film of course.
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.620]   So they had some extra data.
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.620]   Right.
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:35.180]   And they were able to rescan those and then redo the CGI's and it's like you're watching
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.180]   a new show.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:42.500]   Yeah it's I mean that yeah not that I mean the the old days of video production SD video
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:48.100]   production unfortunately unless you're going to do something really special and expensive
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:52.260]   with that which is like put it through like a larry type process where you're reconstructing
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.260]   pixels.
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:57.860]   That's the one like great thing about film yet.
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:03.420]   I know we talk about film a little but you can take that stuff out of the vault rescanner
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.620]   with a new technology and have it be the film has the data.
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:11.100]   The film has incredible data there and have and have a whole new product that you didn't
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.380]   pay that much to a repurpose.
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:16.980]   What I always think is interesting when you look at Blu-ray you know we open up a Blu-ray
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:20.580]   I think we've talked about this in the show but you realize how hard it is to keep things
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.580]   in focus.
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.580]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.580]   Because when you're watching it in the theater it's pretty soft.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.580]   Right.
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:26.580]   I mean the reality is it's pretty soft.
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.900]   It's fifth generation third generation something like that.
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:32.940]   And when you watch it on your standard death it wasn't but when you watch it in it's in
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:34.500]   uncom or less compressed.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.500]   Yeah.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.980]   You know Blu-ray you suddenly realize that half the half the movie was out of focus.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:39.980]   Was out of focus.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.780]   Which makes me feel a lot better when I'm trying to pull focus.
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:42.780]   Yeah.
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.940]   That was a complaint that I don't was it used.
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:47.940]   Or no it was Brent.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:54.900]   But I was having about the super 35 digital camera format is that you do have such shallow
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.380]   depth of field using great lenses.
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:57.380]   Right.
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.380]   It's very hard to pull focus.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:01.980]   Oh it says you need you need a AC and an assistant cinematographer to pull focus.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.980]   Right.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.980]   Because it's so hard to keep focus on these things.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.820]   I mean it's a fine control.
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:06.820]   It's a fine control.
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:07.820]   It's a fraction of an inch.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:12.020]   But Canon has kind of addressed that because they've got gearing now on these cinematographer
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:13.020]   lenses.
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:14.020]   Right.
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:19.740]   And what you're used to where it's much larger movement to do a much smaller change.
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:25.180]   Yeah I mean that's the difference between the sort of the DSLR model and a purpose built
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.180]   cinema camera.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:31.460]   Because yeah those tools you know pulling focus on a still lens was never made designed
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.460]   to do that.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:36.780]   But if you could you know if you're pulling focus on a lens it's geared to do that.
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.180]   You can do it more reliably.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.180]   It's like riding a bike.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:41.020]   You start to know oh Alex is right there.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.020]   I'll just go right to here and he's there.
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.020]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:47.460]   And the thing that I've been doing before it is it's just it's the creative look.
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.980]   You know you're throwing that background softer.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.500]   You're bringing the attention to where you want.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.740]   You do want that depth of field.
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.220]   It's just you have to work with it.
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:55.220]   Yeah.
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:56.740]   And it's a storytelling element to it.
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.540]   Not that you have to use it all the time.
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:00.540]   Well and to me that's 3D.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.740]   To be honest you know.
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:06.980]   Well oddly enough one of the things that not knowing about 3D.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.740]   I mean you know one of the things that you know as a cinematographer we strive for is
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:19.700]   having creating that sense of dimension in the frame where you know it's flat but then
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.140]   you feel that there's depth going on.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:27.100]   And we do it with it's either Dolly moves where you feel perspective changing lighting
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.220]   colors you know all of that.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.740]   And to me that's that's part of telling the story.
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:37.020]   Just capturing reality for reality's sake is is a sports show.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.020]   Right.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:41.940]   Speaking of sports we did go over to the Panasonic booth and see the new 3D cameras are going
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:46.260]   to shoot much of the Olympics with 3D.
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.020]   Now that could be the avatar moment for television for 3D.
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:54.700]   Because I think sports in a lot of ways I think that big sports are very complicated
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:59.740]   to do in 3D because you know the interactral distance has to be so far apart between the
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:04.100]   cameras and does it really make sense to jump from something close up to something far away.
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:11.020]   But I think there are definitely Olympic sports that you know boxing wrestling gymnastics.
[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:16.700]   I think those ones that are a smaller area where the cameras can have a natural view
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:17.700]   of that.
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:21.100]   Well finally our tree is going to be exciting the arrow coming at you.
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:24.900]   And you know they're going to put like a little they're going to put them right over there.
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:25.900]   Right in the bullseye.
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:26.900]   You can know that lens.
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:27.900]   Exactly.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:28.900]   Oh jeez.
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:34.060]   It is Mac break weekly so I suppose we probably shouldn't spend a huge amount of time.
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:36.220]   You have time on the red camera and all that.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.020]   Although they're past 4k now.
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.020]   They're 5k.
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.020]   Well another 6k now.
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.020]   I mean 6k is the next.
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:45.220]   Sony has 8k cameras but you can't do anything with it.
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.700]   It's over it's over stapling.
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.620]   Although they said they can preserve the 8k data.
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:52.620]   Yeah.
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:56.420]   So that if someday down the road we can handle 8k files.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.420]   You've got the data there.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:59.580]   This is you know that same thing.
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:01.380]   It's good stored.
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:06.740]   You know I was talking with Ned Salts who is contributing editor for Digital Video Magazine
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.900]   and knows more about cameras than most people on the planet.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:14.620]   And he and I were talking he said one of the things that's cool about 4k is that it downsamples
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.220]   to 1080p with no problem.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.060]   So that you can easily get a high quality picture from it.
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.780]   You can't easily down sample 6k and you can't easily down sample.
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:24.780]   So you go to 8.
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:28.900]   But even with 8 you're thrown away 75% of the pixels that you're shooting and you've
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:33.140]   got massive data storage and you've got a problem with file transfers other than that.
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.220]   I mean you can't store it.
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:35.220]   You can't move it.
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:36.220]   You can't do anything with it.
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:37.220]   And it's too big other than that.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.220]   I think it's a perfect format.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.580]   One thing we've learned Larry and I learned this because we did a 1080p podcast a few
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.820]   years ago go Mac break that we couldn't edit.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:44.900]   We couldn't watch.
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:49.700]   We couldn't do anything with and yet 1080p is commonplace now and that's just a few
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:54.460]   years later 4k will be ready in a few you know we you couldn't edit video out of the
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.140]   red camera for a while right.
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:57.140]   Now you can.
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:01.780]   And when we did when we did the first you know we did the first Mac break we did we did
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:07.220]   all hand so the very first Mac break was handheld and it was like on a DVC or a Panasonic
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:08.860]   you know 100 day or whatever.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:09.860]   So that was easy.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:10.860]   It was all DV.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:11.860]   Practically SD.
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.980]   It was SD you know so it was SD 60 by 9 we put it up there and then and then we shot
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:21.900]   that week we shot about eight episodes for Mac break you know with Leo there and everything
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:22.900]   else.
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:26.300]   And so and we shot them and literally it took another like three weeks to figure out how
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.300]   we were actually going to do it.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.020]   And it was like and there was there was this there was this because we shot them on F nine
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:35.060]   50s uncompressed and you know this is you know whatever five years ago six years ago
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:39.340]   and and so there was this this huge morass of us trying to figure out how to do it.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:44.860]   So then I did a I did this little the road to 1080p which was me doing like a John Madden
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:50.740]   by the way that is the most downloaded Mac break ever the road to 1080p because everybody
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.740]   wants to know how that how do you do this.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:56.140]   So I said well this is what we're doing and the only reason I was doing those by time
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:00.220]   so that I can put out the one that was because I'm still on the road I'm not but the house
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:05.220]   point being that was only five or six years ago and will be 8k in a few years it's just
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.220]   going to happen.
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.820]   We're very close now really to handling 4k no problem right.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.660]   I think the big challenge is the marketing that happened with the eight with with the
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:17.340]   marketing that happened with the TVs has gotten so many people to to buy into the 1080p that
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.460]   I think that getting the next rev of that is going to be difficult.
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:25.860]   Well there was an interesting comment made about 4k in that if you think about where theatrical
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.620]   release is they look at where the consumer is they say what can we do to make that theatrical
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:35.020]   experience better as consumers are now adopting 1080p right the 4k is necessary.
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.020]   You need it.
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:38.820]   theatrical just to be able to say go to the theater because you see something different
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:43.540]   same thing with 3d 3d became theatrical to give a reason for people to go to the theaters
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:47.180]   as that starts to move into the house again with your Olympics example we're going to
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:48.380]   have to look for something different.
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:52.580]   I like what Darren is saying about higher frame rates I think that's going to have an incredible
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:47:00.180]   benefit to making 24p which has got more motion blur than picture in it I think 48k or 48 frames
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.180]   a second makes a lot better picture.
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:05.620]   What is his camera that is going to 120 isn't he?
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:08.580]   He's talking yeah if he can get the bandwidth.
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.500]   It's all about file size baby.
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:16.500]   Yeah but it's also it's also how many how many pipes can you write from your playback
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:25.260]   server and can the server give it to you into the projection device and the smaller the
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:29.340]   resolution of course the more bandwidth the more frames you can get.
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:34.300]   But we're now operating it with Moore's Law and that means it's moving faster you know
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:38.020]   that's what's interesting that's what's really changed is that these things are happening
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:43.900]   at a huge pace that we've never seen before because now we're talking Moore's Law as opposed
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:44.900]   to physical loss.
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:50.060]   And the 4K story here at NAB is not only about the cameras it's also about a Mac related
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:56.140]   product from AJA which is the key pro 4K which is the new key pro portable that can
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:57.140]   record 4K.
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.620]   Wait a minute.
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.140]   And they have it particularly match.
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:03.540]   It's a portable it's just a key pro but it records in.
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:05.340]   It's called a key pro quad.
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:06.340]   Yeah.
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:13.300]   Key pro quad and and they're they're SSD and they are matching it with the Canon camera
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.260]   that you mentioned earlier the C500.
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:16.260]   It's amazing.
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:21.860]   In fact there are some video recordings where the CEO of AJA and of Canon talk about how
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:22.860]   well they work together.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:23.860]   In 4K.
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:24.860]   Yes.
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:25.860]   A portable.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:26.860]   Same.
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:27.860]   And here's the great thing.
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:28.860]   Same price.
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:29.860]   Same price.
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:30.860]   It's like $4,000.
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:31.860]   $4,000.
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:32.860]   $4,000.
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:33.860]   $4,000.
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:34.860]   $4,000.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:35.860]   $4,000.
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:36.860]   $4,000.
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:37.860]   Because I was expecting them to say like $6,000.
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:40.860]   With a built-in 16 by 9 monitor to preview what you're doing.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:44.540]   It's a very nice key pro which emulates a deck.
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:50.140]   I'm trying to blank on the deck but you've now got an HD STI deck and the HD cam deck
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:51.140]   for $4,000.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.140]   Wow.
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:56.420]   Instead of $70,000 or $80,000 it's now HD STI out off a key pro.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:00.540]   And that rack mount is really, really important because I know that sound devices just came
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:05.340]   out with a PIX 260 which is a rack mount version which we really needed out of the 240.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:09.140]   And then Blackmagic of course has the studio recorder that we have and we have a little
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:12.380]   bit of all of those sitting around in the office.
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:17.980]   And the issue is that the rack mount, when you start having a whole lot of records or
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:22.700]   you need it to be portable and show up with a kit that's ready to go, becomes super important
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.820]   as well as seeing all of these continue to progress to SSD.
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:30.700]   I mean SSD, the two things that make all of this possible is SSD and Thunderbolt because
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:35.060]   those are the two pieces that without those you can't even talk about this kind of bandwidth.
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.980]   And I think that again we just a touch back on Thunderbolt for a second.
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:41.540]   Now in CES we don't need to talk about it because it doesn't mean anything to anyone.
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:42.940]   This is the next firewire.
[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:48.340]   And now we're starting to see cameras, whether it's the C500 that's shipping with Thunderbolt
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:52.460]   built into it or the new Blackmagic camera which is a straight Thunderbolt output.
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:53.460]   Yes it is.
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:57.260]   I think we're going to start seeing more and more cameras at least at the production level,
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:02.300]   the 5,000 and above, start to ship with Thunderbolt connections because it makes a lot of sense
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:03.380]   from an uncompressed.
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:05.060]   And that's the new, you didn't have anything.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:08.700]   You got them that has never, never land where you had HDMI which has to be converted or
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:13.180]   you had, you know, firewire which everyone's discontinuing and now you have another option
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:14.500]   not too far away.
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:18.860]   The key benefit is the new Ivy Bridge chip that Intel is coming out with later this month
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:23.100]   because when the first Thunderbolt chips were released it took six chips to create a Thunderbolt
[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:27.620]   connection which required re-machining all of your hard disks and all of your cameras
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:29.500]   to fit that new daughter board in.
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.940]   With the new Ivy Bridge chip which ships at the end of April were able to fit that into
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:38.060]   a much smaller packet which means now the same engineering that fits hard disks or cameras
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.060]   can work with a small.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.420]   Was that one of the big delays?
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.420]   Was that that six chips?
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:45.420]   It was a huge delay because everybody had to go through multi-hundred million dollar re-engineering
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:50.660]   cost to get, the chips required an extra half inch of space and there wasn't a half inch
[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:52.300]   of space in the hard drives.
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:55.940]   So by getting the chip set down they can now put it onto the main motherboard within
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:59.820]   the hard disk or the RAID or the camera without having to have that extra half inch of space
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:00.820]   for the daughter board.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:04.620]   So I had a conversation yesterday with one of the hard disk developers to say is there
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:08.760]   a performance difference between the sandy bridge chips, the original ones and the Ivy
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.940]   Bridge chips, the current ones and the performance is the same.
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:14.940]   So we're not going to have to worry about like we were doing with the Oxford chips I've
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:20.140]   got a 911 or a 922 or a 944 to determine how fast my firewire is.
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:24.380]   The speed of Thunderbolt won't change assuming copper.
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:27.660]   When you change the chips you're just going to get smaller space which means we can put
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:28.660]   it in more devices.
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:33.980]   I got to say going from SSD to SSD like my internal drive is SSD and we had something
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:40.220]   we captured on a PIX 240 and SSD to SSD is 220 megabytes a second.
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:41.980]   You know it's like to edit?
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:48.300]   200 gigs in like 17 minutes and from the pure geeky me was very...
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:49.900]   I was just like I can't believe.
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:52.660]   I just want people to when they complain about things I just want them to know what it used
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:53.660]   to be like.
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:55.660]   We had to have scuzzy you.
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:58.260]   We were trying to get 30 megs a second out of it.
[00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:02.380]   We had to re-stripe the drives every week to make sure that we could get 30 megs a second
[00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:04.380]   out of our Media 100 and now look at this.
[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:05.620]   It's sad when you're left up.
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.620]   It's sad when nobody cares what we went through.
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:08.620]   I thought in the old days.
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:13.220]   I don't think you understand that I had to walk backwards through the snow up the hill.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.220]   Let's take a break.
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:17.420]   When we come back I do we got to talk about this black magic because I think that's a
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:19.500]   fascinating example of what's happening.
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:25.140]   In fact everything that black magic does is really pushing the bottom in amazing ways.
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:27.140]   There's a couple of other things.
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:28.140]   There's a couple of other things.
[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:29.140]   A couple of other things.
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:30.140]   All right.
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.220]   Well a little black magic coming up in just a bit.
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:37.900]   We're doing Mac Break Weekly Live from the NAB show the National Association of Broadcasters
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:42.740]   which we have redubbed NAC the National Association of Content Creators because that's really
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:43.740]   what it is.
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:46.540]   I know this is a little bit of a different Mac Break Weekly because instead of talking
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:53.180]   about iOS we're talking about stuff that you can use on your Mac.
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.180]   How about that?
[00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:55.180]   Crazy.
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.180]   Crazy.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:57.180]   Crazy.
[00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:58.180]   Crazy.
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:52:59.180]   But we will talk about those cameras.
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:02.180]   We do have some other actors also coming up just a bit before I do that though.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:07.820]   Let's talk a little bit about FreshBooks.com.
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:11.860]   FreshBooks for small businesses is a lifesaver.
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:17.100]   If you are doing, you know everybody who listens probably invoices from time to time as a way
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:18.540]   to get paid.
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:22.980]   And if you're doing it by hand or you're doing it in pages or word and you're, oh my gosh
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:24.340]   it's just the worst.
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:28.980]   In fact it's so bad that at least for me I would put off invoicing which means I'd be
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:30.820]   putting off getting paid.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:32.900]   Sometimes so long that I never did get paid.
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:34.100]   FreshBooks solves all that.
[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:39.020]   When Amber MacArthur told me about it in 2004 I started using it and now there are millions
[00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:44.660]   of people, three and a half million to be exact, who use FreshBooks to do their invoices.
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:45.660]   Take a look.
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:46.660]   Go to FreshBooks.com.
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:48.140]   You upload your logo.
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:50.420]   You upload your hours.
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:52.740]   They have a time and hours app for the iPhone.
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:56.980]   They also have time and hours apps for the web that automatically employ time and hours
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.780]   if you use those.
[00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:05.060]   You will have these invoices going out in email.
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:10.780]   And in the email there's a button that says just pay this using one of 11 payment gateways
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:13.940]   like Paypalauthorized.net first data.
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:17.980]   So believe it or not that's almost a sure way to get paid faster because frankly your
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:19.380]   clients just want to pay it.
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.100]   They just want to make it easy.
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:24.580]   You can even have an automatic payment set up and automatic invoicing set up so you don't
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.260]   even have to get involved.
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.260]   There's invoice follow up.
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:31.740]   If you don't get paid you can automatically have tickler in email sent out every 30, 60
[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:33.340]   and 90 days.
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:35.260]   It looks so professional.
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.260]   It's so easy to do.
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:41.860]   And if you have an old fashioned client who does want a paper invoice, FreshBooks can
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:42.860]   do that too.
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:46.660]   They'll print it out, stamp it and mail it for a small additional fee.
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:51.060]   By the way, any currency, this is nowadays we work worldwide.
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:54.940]   I was really happy because I was building a Canadian dollars as well as US dollars.
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:57.060]   It saved me a lot of trouble.
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:01.420]   I bet Alan would love to be able to build a Canadian dollars.
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:04.580]   You mean euros or the old pesseta which may be coming back.
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:05.580]   Is it coming back?
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:06.580]   I guess I'm late with a struggle.
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:07.580]   Well they're talking about that.
[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:10.660]   They're talking about all the countries possibly going back to their original currency.
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:13.420]   That'll be good for FreshBooks because it's automatic.
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:16.180]   It won't be good for anyone else.
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:17.660]   They'll go crazy.

[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:29.140]   I got a warning though.
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:31.540]   You're going to get to the end of 30 days and you're going to say this is it.
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.580]   I'm never going back to the old way of doing invoices.
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:36.220]   It is the best.
[00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:37.220]   freshbooks.com.

[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:43.820]   I love it.
[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:46.300]   It was a lifesaver for me.
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:48.660]   I actually didn't build somebody for eight months.
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:49.980]   That was a fun one to try to collect.
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:53.180]   I have projects I never got paid for because I didn't get around to invoices.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:54.180]   It's my fault.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.180]   I can't really blame them.
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:56.980]   I never asked them for money.
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:59.620]   Well, I'm glad those days are over.
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.380]   Now I just don't get paid at all.
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:04.140]   Everybody invoices me.
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:06.020]   It's a whole new world.
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:07.180]   So Blackmagic.
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:09.860]   What is the story of Blackmagic anyway?
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:12.180]   So I think Blackmagic started building hardware for AJA.
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:13.180]   Was that right?
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:15.420]   They were kind of the hardware supplier for AJA.
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:16.420]   Correct.
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:18.860]   And then they decided that they could do it.
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:21.660]   There is some overlap, isn't there in the category?
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:23.540]   There was some overlap, but not anymore.
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:24.540]   No, they've separated.
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:25.860]   I mean, they're very different companies.
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:27.700]   I mean, they still, there's places where they overlap.
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:28.700]   Right.
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:31.540]   But where they started was Blackmagic building cards for AJA.
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.220]   So they were building their capture cards.
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.180]   And they both make cards now and they do compete.
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:36.180]   Da Vinci.
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:37.180]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:38.180]   Well, the Kona cards.
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:41.020]   The Kona card from AJA, the Blackmagic Decklink Extreme.
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.020]   Kona, that's me.
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:43.020]   That's right.
[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:44.020]   Many converters.
[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:45.020]   They have many converters from AJA.
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:46.020]   We use those.
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:47.820]   Many converters from Blackmagic.
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:50.500]   And they both have box-based interfaces also.
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:56.300]   Either the neck via PCI-E or Express Card 34 or now Thunderbolt.
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:01.060]   And I think that what we use the incredible Blackmagic router, video router.
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:02.060]   We have lots of those.
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:03.860]   In our studio, that thing is incredible.
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:08.140]   72 in 144 out and we've already outgrown it.
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:09.980]   You can't have too many connections in a round.
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:10.980]   It's amazing.
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:11.980]   I think I've said this really.
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:14.980]   I accidentally bought a 16 by 16 and a 16 by 32.
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:16.220]   And you just kept them.
[00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:17.220]   And you just kept them.
[00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:18.220]   I was going to send one back.
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:21.620]   Within a week, we had saturated both of them.
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:29.020]   And so it is a-- but what's interesting is that while AJA really seems to focus on R&D
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:32.220]   and building the products and so on and so forth, one of the things Blackmagic has done
[00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:34.820]   is that we really have a business model that works.
[00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:37.940]   And what we're going to do is keep on absorbing companies that maybe not have a great product
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:40.220]   but not necessarily a good business model.
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:42.540]   And we're going to show them what they should have done.
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:44.540]   I think that that's part of it.
[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:47.580]   It's like the one that we saw with.
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:50.980]   And part of it is you can't do it without the Blackmagic wrap around.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:52.180]   I think that that's part of it.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:56.740]   But when you look at Tarenx, Tarenx is the state of the art when it comes to conversion
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:00.580]   tools, conversion hardware.
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:03.260]   And all of us dream of having a Tarenx in our house.
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:04.260]   I don't know.
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:05.260]   I dream of it.
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:06.260]   I dream of it.
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.260]   You're going to attach it.
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:09.900]   You're going to attach it to your high definition set.
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:12.140]   No one is going to be able to watch television anymore.
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:14.660]   And this is a scalar cross converter.
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:18.860]   It's this Swiss Army knife that lets you do all kinds of stuff with video.
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:20.900]   But they're usually $15,000 or $20,000.
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:21.900]   And then at least--
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:22.900]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:23.900]   90.
[00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:24.900]   No, no, no, no.
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:26.660]   The case is 20 grand.
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:27.660]   No, no, no.
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:28.660]   And then they go up.
[00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.660]   And by the time you add little boards to them, it's $100,000.
[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:33.660]   And so Blackmagic bought them.
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:37.660]   And now they announce this week that they're going to release the single channel one, I
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:42.500]   think, for two brand and the multi-channel for four grand in June.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:45.300]   And yeah, I was--
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:47.260]   They dropped it from 20 down to two.
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.260]   That's news to me.
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:49.260]   I haven't heard that.
[00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:53.180]   It's $2,000 for the single channel, $4,000 for the multi-channel, for the dual channel.
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:54.180]   And yeah.
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.180]   Yeah.
[00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:56.740]   This suddenly-- oh, and they're Thunderbolt built in.
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:57.980]   OK, I'm getting my checkbook out.
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:58:58.980]   I can afford that now.
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:58:59.980]   I'm going to give up the helicopter.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:00.980]   I'm going to get the tarenax out.
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:02.940]   And it's got Thunderbolt built in.
[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:07.620]   So basically, you can do all the cross conversions and then import it as if it was a multi-channel.
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:08.620]   So it's a multi-bridge.
[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:14.380]   What's nice about it, too, is what Tarenax did and what it still does, which is great
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:20.820]   for when I'm cutting on Final Cut Pro, is it takes your video in and cleans it up incredibly,
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:24.940]   better than what a lot of software tools can do.
[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:28.480]   So anyway, so let's talk about this cinema camera.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:29.480]   You keep saying that.
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:30.480]   But then you never talk about it.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.780]   I want to talk about it.
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:32.780]   It's a tease.
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:33.780]   That's what it's called.
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:34.780]   It's a tease.
[00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:35.780]   It's a tease.
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:36.780]   Teasing is over time.
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:42.700]   Now, this is the free camera because it comes with so much software that you end up-- but
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.260]   it's like $2,500.
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:45.260]   $2,999.
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:46.260]   $2,999.
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:49.900]   It's a digital-- what is it?
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:50.900]   What is this?
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:52.460]   There's been so many of us looking at it.
[00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:53.460]   It's 2.5k.
[00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:57.100]   For five years, a lot of us have sat around saying, you know, what we really need is a
[00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:58.380]   box with a sensor.
[00:59:58.380 --> 00:59:59.380]   We don't want them to go crazy.
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.380]   We don't pay for anything else.
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.660]   For something in the studio, I'm shooting some green screen.
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:03.660]   I'm doing some other stuff.
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:04.740]   I'm shooting a little show.
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.460]   I don't need you to add a whole bunch of other things.
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:10.100]   I just need something that connects well with my computer.
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.540]   Yeah, this is it.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:12.540]   With a large sensor.
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:13.540]   With a large sensor.
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:14.540]   Four thirds.
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:15.540]   Sentry.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:16.540]   Approximately.
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:21.180]   The crop factor is about 2.3 with this.
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:22.180]   But that's very important.
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:25.420]   But the thing that's interesting about this is the 13-stop dynamic range.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:26.420]   That's huge.
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:27.420]   Yes.
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:32.180]   When you record in the raw mode, which is a 12-bit raw mode, which is amazing.
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:36.420]   So most cameras are 10-bit.
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:40.700]   When we stretch to something like ProRes 422 or DNxHD.
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.540]   But before that, everything was 8-bit.
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:43.540]   8-bit.
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:48.900]   You know, we're really excited when we're able to record either to ProRes 422 or DNxHD
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:49.900]   at 10-bit.
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.260]   But now this is raw at 12-bit.
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:53.260]   Yeah.
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:55.260]   So what does that mean?
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.260]   It just the dynamic range.
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.060]   I think Darren's probably the best one.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:01.140]   It's one better than 11.
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.260]   It means two things.
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:06.420]   You've got a really rich color space for doing color correction and color adjustments.
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:12.020]   And the 12-bit means that you've got a lot of distance for exposure.
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:15.980]   So you're getting a really deep color space for color correction and color adjustments
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:20.860]   and a really deep range for color so you don't have the shadows compressed to black
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:21.860]   and the whites go.
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.340]   So this is most of our levels of gray.
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.460]   This is like shooting raw.
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:28.300]   Forgive me for it.
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:33.300]   It's like poor man's analogy.
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.300]   It's like shooting raw on a digital still camera.
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.300]   You're now, it's great, but you're going to have to do post-correction.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:40.140]   But that's how you get the 13 stopped.
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.660]   It's as if you're approaching it as exactly that.
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:44.900]   A digital still a still camera.
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.700]   In fact, they're storing them as DNGs.
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:47.700]   Yeah.
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:48.700]   It's like a negative.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.700]   Right.
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.020]   So you have full range and then you take it and make it look the way you want.
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:55.020]   That's why they're giving you the $1,000.
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:56.020]   Da Vinci software.
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.020]   Da Vinci software.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.020]   Because you need, you can't do anything.
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:00.060]   That's not the only mode to record.
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:05.380]   You can record either with that or with ProRes 422 HQ.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:11.020]   But if you're planning to do what's called grading or color correction, then you want
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.260]   to do it in the raw mode.
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:16.900]   And if you're doing something rush and you just want to get it on the air quickly, then
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.860]   you would probably go with the ProRes 422 HQ.
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.580]   And you'd agree.
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:26.620]   And the big thing for cinematographers is that this gives you a much larger target in
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:27.620]   the field.
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:32.060]   When you have that much data, the big thing is that what I think a lot of cinematographers
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:36.540]   didn't like about digital when it started was that the target is a pinpoint target.
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:40.220]   There was no correction that was available if you didn't hit it in the field.
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:43.180]   And that's not a skill of the camera operator or the DP.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:45.260]   There are a thousand moving parts on a film.
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:48.020]   And there's all these things and you have to get the shoot done.
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:51.740]   And you're not going to hit the mark every single time of a perfect exposure for every
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.340]   piece because there's just too many variables to deal with.
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:56.100]   And with digital, you were screwed, right?
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:03:03.340]   Well, digital, before it, you were locked into what was coming out of the camera, has
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:08.140]   the contrast, the color, everything exactly the way you want to put it up on the monitor.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.140]   Very little latitude.
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.780]   Yeah, no latitude at all.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.340]   It was meant to go right to air.
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:20.020]   And until the wider range cameras came out, you know, taking the signal and making it
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:23.300]   more of a log signal rather than a linear signal.
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:31.460]   So in essence, that's why the images look flat, like using the Cine-style on the D5s.
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:36.580]   It's basically trying to give you everything that the sensor is picking up, but within
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:38.820]   a manageable package.
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:42.020]   So you can actually use it on your computer.
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.780]   Leo, just another thought.
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:46.340]   The red camera shoots a raw format as well.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:49.420]   And you'd have to take that into color correction before you do anything with it.
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:53.220]   So the workflow of red is shoot it, color correct it, and then release it.
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:56.140]   Same thing with the black magic is shoot it, color correct it.
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.620]   If you use it, if you use it, if you shoot raw, anything that shoots raw, you have to
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:01.060]   take into color correction.
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:02.820]   You're not going to shoot two and a half K though.
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.500]   You're going to shoot 1080p.
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:05.940]   In the raw mode you do.
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:07.980]   What do you do with that extra half K?
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:08.980]   Crop it.
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:11.740]   You're kind of like the crop it or scale it down.
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:14.220]   And that's what we were discussing a little bit in the pre-show.
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:16.060]   Use you a little extra information that...
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:19.980]   So you could either blow up or scale it down.
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:21.220]   If you scale it down, then you're a hero.
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:25.620]   So it's a very forgiving camera in the sense if you point it slightly wrong and you don't
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:29.020]   like quite right, and all that, you can fix it.
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.140]   That's if you shoot in the raw mode.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:37.220]   If you shoot in the ProRes 422 HQ mode, then it's scaled down to 1080p right in the recording.
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:38.220]   Yeah.
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.940]   And this is another one of those cameras that we were talking about a little bit that has
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:40.940]   a Thunderbolt built right in.
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:43.660]   So you just plug that straight into your computer to do the digitization.
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:46.660]   Now, have you noticed that Leo is about to ask the most important question?
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:47.660]   Who the hell is this for?
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:50.380]   No, well that, but does it have a lens?
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:51.380]   Does it have a lens?
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:52.380]   No, it will.
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:53.380]   Twenty minutes.
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:54.380]   No, that's not.
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.460]   Here's the ad that should come out with this.
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.380]   No screwy lens mount.
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:04:59.380]   Finally.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.380]   Who's the camera?
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:01.380]   Who's the camera?
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.380]   Who's the camera?
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:05.380]   So I can use my Canon lenses and you can also use Nikon.
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:06.980]   Oh, it does have a Nikon mount?
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:08.380]   I think they've got two mounts.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:09.380]   Okay.
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:13.580]   So I know Canon lenses because I have some Canon glass or I have some Nikon.
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:20.260]   I'm also very happy that unlike most of the traditional video cameras like the ones that
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:25.460]   we're seeing in front of us, the traditional video cameras are using this old fashioned
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.420]   FAT32 formatting.
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:36.180]   And Blackmagic has decided to use the HFS plus also known as Mac OS Extended Plus.
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:37.340]   That's what they're using.
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:41.300]   So we no longer have to have this nonsense of the sequential files.
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:43.300]   Which we're ever for.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:45.460]   Approximately four gigabytes.
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:46.940]   It's just nonsense.
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:52.900]   And a lot of the camera manufacturers still do this FAT32 and I'm so glad that Blackmagic
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:54.660]   decided to do something better.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:57.020]   Basically there are two options that are very good.
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:59.460]   One is the HFS plus and one is UDF.
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:04.620]   UDF is what Sound Devices chose to use with their recorders which is wonderful.
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:10.220]   It's completely universal as far as reading either on Windows 7 or on Mac.
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:15.780]   And the HFS plus can be read obviously on a Mac and on Windows all you need is Mac Drive.
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:19.300]   And worst case scenario, $50 utility.
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:22.820]   And to know this isn't just a camera that gets connected in.
[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:25.460]   It's got an SSD drive built on the other side of that camera.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.580]   So you can just pop an SSD in, do the recording.
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.580]   Renewable.
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:29.580]   Exactly.
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:33.900]   So really this is kind of a response to the DSLR crowd.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:34.900]   Exactly right.
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:37.060]   Except it's not a DSLR camera.
[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.060]   It's a video camera.
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.060]   It's all video.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:43.380]   It'll run without having to sensor overheat which you can't do with a DSLR.
[01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:46.980]   Because you only shoot for 20 minutes and sensor overheat and you got to stop.
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:50.740]   Is it a CMOS do you still have the rubbery rolling rolling shutter issue?
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.300]   I think it's a CMOS sensor.
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.700]   I think almost everything is a CMOS at this point.
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:56.860]   So you're going to have that issue with motion still.
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:58.300]   But that's relatively easy to fix.
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:01.420]   Just about all software, Premiere, Final Cut can dial that out.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:04.940]   You know there's an interesting thing about CMOS that keeps my 950 busy.
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:07.740]   Is that my 950 is a CCD.
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:10.260]   It turns out that CMOS doesn't shoot iPads very well.
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:12.260]   No, it starts to flicker.
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:13.260]   Yeah.
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:17.260]   So my 950 keeps like any, by various houses, keeps on renting.
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.620]   You still have that 950 over there because the CCD shoots it fine.
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.620]   So isn't that funny?
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:22.620]   Isn't that funny?
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:26.740]   The other nice thing about the Blackmagic Cinema camera is that it does have balanced
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:27.740]   audio inputs.
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:28.980]   I was going to ask you about that.
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:29.980]   Not XLR.
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:30.980]   The Canon does not.
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:31.980]   Right?
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:32.980]   Which Canon?
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.460]   One of them.
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:39.260]   I know the 5D does not.
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.580]   Do the C300, 500 or XDC?
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.980]   I think they do have that.
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:43.980]   They now have balanced.
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:44.980]   I don't know what's going on there.
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:45.980]   Why is that important?
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.380]   That's important so we can use professional audio gear.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:49.380]   Right.
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.380]   And you don't get interference.
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:51.380]   Not interference.
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.580]   Or FM radio stations.
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:54.580]   Right.
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:08:00.740]   Which, if anybody is old enough to remember the Sony V04800 three quarter entry quarter,
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.740]   which had an unbalanced input.
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:05.540]   I used to get pickup radio stations in Connecticut.
[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:08.860]   I'm originally from Connecticut.
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:10.460]   So this is good to use FM radio.
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:14.700]   It doesn't have XLR but you can take an XLR to Fono adapter.
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.700]   Yes, a quarter inch.
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:17.700]   Quarter inch.
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:21.860]   Quarter inch phone TRS, which stands for tip ring sleeve, which was actually born with
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:26.980]   the telephone switchboards about a hundred years ago, but still used today for headphones
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:28.140]   and things like that.
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:31.100]   It's like what a lot of people consider to be a stereo plug.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.540]   It's just not wired as stereo.
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:35.380]   It's wired as mono balanced.
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:37.340]   And that's why there are two, by the way, there are two.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:38.340]   They're left and right.
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:39.340]   So this is good news.
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:40.740]   You can get good audio into this camera.
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:41.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:42.740]   Yes.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.740]   And I thought it was interesting for them to use a TRS instead of an XLR because it makes
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:46.740]   sense.
[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:47.740]   I mean, you look at it.
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:48.740]   It's like it saves a lot of space.
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:50.540]   It's a lot easier to jack in.
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.040]   There's a lot of reasons to do it.
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.040]   I looked at it first.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.040]   I was like, really?
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:57.540]   You put a quarter inch in there and I was like, oh, that kind of one of the first things
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:00.180]   that I'm going to be testing is the quality of the preamp.
[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:05.260]   I do a lot of comparison of the quality of preamps, especially when connected to a dynamic
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:07.540]   microphone like the ones we're speaking to right now.
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:08.540]   Right.
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:12.620]   Because you're asking more from the preamp when you connect the dynamic mic.
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.820]   So that's the way to test the preamp.
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:17.620]   And I love to do side by side of those things.
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.620]   And that's what I'll do as soon as I receive one.
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:21.540]   I'll write that up in the Pro Vodio code.
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:22.540]   Of course I will.
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:23.540]   Of course I will.
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:27.260]   You know, there's another interesting camera announcement from GoPro, which is that they've
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:32.260]   increased the data rate on GoPro to a 35 megabit data rate.
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:33.260]   Wow.
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:39.260]   Which means that we can now get high quality H.264 at 35 megabit a second record.
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:41.260]   Which is the same as XT Cam, right?
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.860]   Yes, except XT Cam is MPEG-2.
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:44.860]   Right.
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:49.580]   And the GoPro is MPEG-4, so we get more quality on the same data rate.
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:54.060]   And you know, what's interesting to me at the show is the spectacular range of cameras
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:10:01.380]   from the very low end small gopros up to the Arri Alexa's and the new Sony cameras.
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:07.220]   And I'm fascinated with the spectrum where before we had everything with $50, $60, $70,000
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:08.220]   and that was it.
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:10.940]   And now we've got a range from $500 to $100,000.
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.620]   Well, what's interesting is that everyone's using them at every level too.
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:15.540]   I mean, the gopros are being used in films.
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:16.940]   I mean, they used them in red tails.
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:21.420]   They used them, you know, and then you have the big cameras being used in web productions.
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:28.260]   Well, I was at the GoPro booth yesterday and I forgot it's one of the founders was talking
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.260]   to me about it.
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:34.700]   And we were looking at it because one of the things that they implemented, it's called
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:42.340]   Pro-Tune is what they call this mode and it's a free firmware upgrade if you have a
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:43.900]   GoPro too.
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:46.500]   But what it does, it gives you that 35 megabit.
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.540]   It also gives you 24 frames.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:56.620]   And it can change the signal to the similar to the Cine-style, the Technicolor came out
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:57.620]   to.
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.620]   It changes it to that.
[01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:01.180]   So you have a log signal coming out of the GoPro.
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:05.140]   So you can now take, I was taking material that had snow.
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:09.780]   I mean, the kind of things you do with a GoPro, snow, bright blue skies and just changing
[01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:11.460]   it around and seeing the detail.
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.820]   No, it wasn't clipping or anything.
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:17.900]   And you know, that was like a really smart part.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:21.940]   And you know, it's starting to see a lot of partnerships between different companies.
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:27.780]   Where it's, you know, it was a friend of ours, Josh Pines at Technicolor came up with the
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:35.300]   whole Cine-style log for DSLRs and, you know, experimented with the Canon first and now
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:37.500]   it's implemented into the GoPro.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:41.740]   And there's a product that they're going to put out also that you can bring that very
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:44.340]   easily into the look you want.
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:49.100]   But I think that's why you have this full spectrum of cameras now because now we can
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.980]   bring it in and use it all.
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:53.220]   It doesn't have to match exactly.
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:12:01.460]   But you can definitely, I mean, I saw a comparison of the GoPro with the Pro-Tune and a simple
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:04.020]   5D with Cine-style.
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:09.460]   And there are a lot more similarities than there were differences.
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:13.340]   Well, and the interesting thing also is that now you can, with the Hero 2, you can connect
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:14.780]   it to your via Wi-Fi.
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:19.140]   You can connect it to your iPhone and use the iPhone as your, oh, wow.
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:20.140]   Yeah.
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:21.900]   So you can use this, the Hero 2 will use you.
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.300]   This is a $300 camera?
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:25.300]   Yeah.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:28.580]   It's got this little backpack that will let you do a Wi-Fi connection to your iPhone and
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:32.020]   then be able to view the video on your iPhone.
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:35.500]   So it becomes your viewfinder and you can record and everything else on, you know, hit
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:39.340]   record from your iPhone, which is, again, these guys are so focused, I mean, obviously
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:43.700]   a lot of filmmakers are using them, but they are so focused on this action, you know,
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:47.820]   the action crowd that they just keep on looking for, you know, how to solve that.
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:50.660]   I think that that's the one thing that I kept on seeing over and over again in these
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:52.180]   companies that are really excelling here.
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:53.700]   And I think this is any company that excels.
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:58.460]   But I think that with the way that the online world has become, you know, and what you're
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:01.900]   seeing are the companies that are expanding and surviving are the ones that all they do
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:06.020]   is listen to their clients and figure out how do they be, how do they creatively solve
[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:07.020]   a client's problem.
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:13.100]   And we saw that over and over from from, you know, from K-Tech who are talking about boom
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:19.180]   poles to, you know, to GoPro, to Canon, to Red, you know, that they're sitting there
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:20.180]   listening to people talk.
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:23.500]   I mean, to smoke, you know, they listen to their clients and they're figuring out how
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.740]   do we creatively solve that problem.
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.100]   And the ones that aren't doing that, the ones that have some kind of, you know, they're
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:31.260]   pushing the bottom line are the ones that are slowly just disappearing.
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:32.260]   You know, we don't see them anymore.
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:37.500]   And it's just, I think that that process is accelerating because the consumer has so much
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:41.900]   information all the time and can make that decision so much faster.
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:42.900]   Right.
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:43.900]   Right.
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:44.900]   All right.
[01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:45.900]   We do have some Apple news.
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:52.340]   Well, all of these things have to work with, you know, almost all of them are four Apple,
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:53.340]   right?
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:54.340]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:58.500]   You can't come out with a product, a camera, anything if you can't use it on a map.
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.500]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:00.500]   And that's the one.
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:01.500]   That's where content creation is.
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:02.500]   Yeah.
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:03.500]   It really is.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:09.540]   I mean, if you talk to anybody, you know, the people, I mean, I was one of the weirdos
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:14.900]   that had, you know, was working with Max in the late, late 80s and 90s, you know, prime
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:17.420]   open, you know, SEs and things.
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:22.780]   But now it's, if you can't get it into a map, it just, you just don't work with it.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:25.580]   So everybody's addressing that, which is fantastic.
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:26.580]   Yeah.
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:29.260]   And, you know, and pro res has become the standard file format.
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:30.260]   Absolutely.
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:31.260]   Yeah.
[01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:35.380]   And then they used where they thought that that might be a, well, with the area Alexa,
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:39.900]   when they thought that might be a just a proxy sort of file, they're actually using
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:41.620]   that to finish television shows.
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:42.620]   Right.
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:46.180]   So that's the master format, but it goes right into a Mac and gets edited.
[01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:47.180]   Yeah.
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:49.660]   Think of it as a camera that has a Mac as a dongle.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:50.660]   Yeah.
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:53.300]   A Mac is just a dongle.
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:58.140]   I have at least one Mac, Mac related product that was announced here at NMB to talk about.
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:59.140]   Good.
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:00.140]   And I think Alex has a few more.
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:01.140]   That's what we'll do.
[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:03.300]   When we come back, we're going to get your NAB picks.
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:07.260]   And if they're Mac specific, that would be nice.
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:08.260]   Not a requirement to be nice.
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:09.260]   At least one of them is.
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.220]   Darren Ocada is here.
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:17.900]   Cinematographer, the ASC.com Alan Tepper from the Pro Video Coalition and his Techno Tour
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.980]   podcast, Larry Jordan, digital production buzz.com.
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:24.020]   Alex Lindsey from the pixel core.com more in a moment.
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:28.780]   I'll tell you what's a great accessory for your Apple, for your iPhone.
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:33.260]   It's audible.com, the great audio book company.
[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:39.500]   Everybody here in this show is everybody in this room is an audible fan or if they weren't
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.020]   they ought to be.
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:44.860]   Because I'll tell you what, if you fly a, you know, to get to a conference, if you spend
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:50.020]   time in a car commuting, if you carpool, if you, if you're cleaning your house, if you
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:55.020]   clean, everybody who cleans their house should have audible.com.
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:56.020]   I hate cleaning.
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:57.020]   The only thing that makes it bearable.
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.020]   I mean, I don't mind exercising.
[01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:59.020]   I don't mind traveling.
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.020]   I hate it.
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:02.660]   And the only thing that makes it bearable is audible.
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:03.900]   Just pretend you're not.
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:05.420]   You could listen to Cinderella or something.
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:06.420]   It'd be good.
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:07.420]   It'd be perfect.
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:08.420]   Kind of a nice tie in there.
[01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:09.900]   Audible.com is the place to go.
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:13.100]   In fact, I'm going to tell you in a moment how you can get a free audio book from Audible.
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:17.420]   But first go there and browse around just to see what they've got.
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:20.020]   A hundred thousand titles.
[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:22.220]   Every new book that comes out comes out on audible.com.
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:27.580]   In fact, there is a new Stephen King novel coming out in a week.
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:31.820]   The most recent in the Dark Tower series, of course, Audible.
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:34.060]   You know, Stephen King sometimes reads his own stuff.
[01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:35.060]   I don't know.
[01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:36.060]   That's a good question.
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:37.060]   Audible will have it.
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:42.300]   In fact, they've got a little promotion going on where you can win a copy of it for free.
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:47.700]   In fact, when I first joined Audible, I've joined it so long ago that they didn't have
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:48.700]   any Stephen King.
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:52.020]   They had like one Stephen King ever since they've got every Stephen King.
[01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:53.020]   Many of them read by Stephen King.
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:59.540]   I want you to go to audible.com/macbreak and you can get a book for free.
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:05.420]   You'll be signing up for the gold account, which is a book a month.
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:10.580]   You can select any book you want that's worth a credit and listen to it.
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:14.900]   And if you decide, you know, this isn't for me, cancel.
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:15.900]   You pay nothing.
[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:17.140]   The book is yours to keep.
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:18.380]   But I think you're going to want to stick around.
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:22.980]   The new dark tower novel, April 24th, it's called the wind through the keyhole.
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:24.900]   It doesn't say who reads it.
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:25.900]   That's a good question.
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:29.140]   But all you have to do to win it is to download a Stephen King novel.
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:31.140]   And there's some great ones to choose from.
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:33.820]   I've got the stand on my iPhone.
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:35.900]   That's my next Stephen King novel.
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:37.820]   I tell you, I love this stuff.
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:40.620]   Audible brings books to life for those times.
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:44.900]   You can't hold a book, but you want to read Audible podcast.
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:45.900]   This is a new book.
[01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:52.620]   It's an entry into a book called the President's Club inside the world's most exclusive fraternity.
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:58.020]   The folks who have been former presidents of the United States, they have a secret club.
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:01.260]   Did they have a secret club?
[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:02.580]   Yeah.
[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:04.420]   I can't wait to talk about gossip.
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:05.420]   Anyway, Audible.
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:06.420]   I'd love to see a meeting there.
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:08.100]   There's something about having all those guys.
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.100]   All the guys.
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:10.100]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:11.500]   And sometimes it's a small club.
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.100]   Sometimes it's a big club.
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:17.380]   People.com/macbreak.
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:22.180]   That's what you need to do to get your copy of an Audible book for you.
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:24.460]   Thank you for their support.
[01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:25.660]   So just a couple of quick stories.
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:27.900]   Then we'll get your Mac picks of the week.
[01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:28.900]   Philippe Stark.
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:30.780]   Remember we talked last week?
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:35.100]   There was all sorts of speculation about he says in several interviews, the French designer.
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.780]   Actually, we talked about it on Twitter.
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:38.300]   Said, yes, I'm walking with that.
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:43.820]   I'm going to put it on something very, very exciting, but I cannot talk about it.
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:46.620]   Turns out, what a blowhard.
[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:51.020]   He actually was working on Steve Jobs' yacht design.
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:52.020]   Yeah.
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:53.660]   That's something you could buy.
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:19:00.100]   The revolutionary project was a yacht that Steve Jobs mentions in the autobiography by
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:01.100]   Walter Isaacson.
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:06.340]   It's not an autobiography, but he jobs talks about it.
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:10.380]   He says, I probably like to live to see it done, but this is one way I keep my spirits
[01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:11.860]   up as I work on something.
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:18.700]   Apparently, Stark says, Laurene, Steve's widow will continue that project.
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:23.820]   So it's a yacht and look at it.
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:24.820]   Holy cow.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:26.700]   It looks like a Mac, except it's a yacht.
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:27.700]   Holy camole.
[01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:33.260]   If a Mac was a yacht, that's exactly what it would look like, or an iPhone.
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:37.660]   He said in an interview that he met with Jobs once a month at Palo Alto for seven years
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:43.260]   is now meeting with Laurene to continue this yacht.
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:44.260]   That's ridiculous.
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:45.260]   Okay.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:50.620]   I mean, I'm not that I wouldn't want one, or at least to take a ride on one.
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:53.300]   But see, when I was scanning that, I got all excited because I thought he was working
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:54.300]   with Tony Stark.
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:55.300]   Ah!
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:56.300]   See, that was, I was...
[01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:57.300]   Stark industry.
[01:19:57.300 --> 01:20:00.180]   Yeah, yeah, I was, I was like, what is Apple doing with Tony Stark?
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:03.220]   If you haven't downloaded the update to Java, do that.
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:08.260]   They have another update to Java that not only fixes the malware whole, but also removes
[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:10.700]   Flashback from your system.
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:16.500]   If you have malware, we know that 600,000 Mac users have been infected by Flashbacks.
[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:19.740]   In future news, Apple will be dropping Flash and Java.
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:20.740]   Yeah.
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:21.740]   Well, they did.
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:25.940]   Remember, Steve Jobs said Java is a ball and chain, and I'm not, they don't include it,
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:31.220]   but people download it because, well, Minecraft and other things need Java.
[01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:35.580]   Apple was slow to fix it, they fixed it now, and they offer a fix that removes it just
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:37.820]   so you know.
[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:42.340]   Ashton Kutcher will be in a movie, as we said before, but now we know the movie is about
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:45.420]   Steve Jobs and Apple from 1971 to 2000.
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:49.700]   Filming starts next month.
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:51.740]   Apple 2 turns 35.
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:54.860]   How many of you started this whole thing on an Apple 2?
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:56.500]   I started an Apple 2E.
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:57.500]   2E?
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:58.500]   Well, that counts.
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.500]   That's an Apple.
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:00.500]   Original Mac.
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.500]   Original Mac?
[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:02.500]   Yeah.
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:03.500]   Yeah.
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:04.500]   28K.
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.500]   I learned how to write a lot of programs.
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:06.500]   I had a 128K.
[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:07.500]   Yeah.
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:10.820]   35 years ago yesterday, the Apple 2 computer.
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:12.740]   And do you want to actually learn how to write code on that?
[01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:13.740]   It was a Franklin.
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:14.900]   Remember the Franklin D.
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:15.900]   That was the fake Apple.
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:19.700]   There was a Franklin D. There was a Franklin dealer down below my dad's law firm, and so
[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:24.100]   I was down there every Saturday hacking around on the Franklin, playing Aztec and learning
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:25.100]   how to program.
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:27.900]   And finally, I'm going to report this just because it's the best headline of the week
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:29.300]   from CNET.
[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:33.700]   Stink different, a new fragrance smells like Apple Macintosh.
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:38.220]   Three artists in Australia have teamed up with a perfume maker to create a fragrance
[01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:40.980]   based on the smell of a brand new Mac.
[01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:42.060]   What do you call it?
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:43.060]   I smell.
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:45.260]   I smell.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:46.260]   Stink different.
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:49.820]   Somehow I just don't know if I want to really smell like a Mac.
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:52.220]   How many do they have to buy and open to sample it?
[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:53.220]   That's the question.
[01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:59.540]   You could buy new car smell, which is just all the PCBs leaking off of the...
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.780]   They actually have an old spray in.
[01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:02.780]   Carpet.
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:03.780]   I don't know if it's a good thing.
[01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:05.580]   Thank you for making it sound so attractive.
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:06.580]   Yes.
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:10.940]   It's not good for you, but it smells like new Mac.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:15.780]   All right, let's go around the horn and find out what you... anything... it could be anything,
[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:18.740]   but be nice if it had something to do with Apple.
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:20.620]   Product that you liked a lot at NAB...
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:21.620]   This was announced here.
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:23.340]   I think it was announced.
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:25.500]   Oh, you did a segment on this, and I'm really excited.
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:26.660]   In fact, I think I wanted to...
[01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:28.500]   This is the tadpole, right?
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:29.500]   Love this.
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.500]   The K-Tec tadpole.
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:33.580]   So K-Tec is a... they make...
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:34.580]   They make booms.
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.580]   Microphone booms.
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:38.580]   It's a long time to take that recording.
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.980]   There was a... anyway.
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:43.180]   There's some great outtakes from that one.
[01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:44.180]   Are there really?
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:45.580]   Like you got hit with the boom?
[01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:46.580]   No, no.
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:47.580]   It was just referring to...
[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:48.580]   Booms.
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:49.580]   Things that extend and...
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:50.580]   She was kind of like...
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:51.580]   She was cute.
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:53.020]   I could tell you were kind of enjoying talking.
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:54.020]   So anyway, so the...
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:56.820]   The daughter of the guy who invented this stuff.
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:59.100]   So K-Tec is kind of known in the industry as the...
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.100]   The boom company.
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:01.100]   They are the boom company.
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:05.180]   I mean, they make the best... the best booms out there.
[01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:09.460]   And so the... anyway, so what they did is they took all that technology and they put it into
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:12.020]   an iPhone holder with a great case.
[01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:13.900]   And let's see if you can see it.
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:14.900]   So I have a poll.
[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:15.900]   You can see it here.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:19.460]   You know, as you said in your segment when you were there, there's a lot of cheesy versions
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:20.460]   of this.
[01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:21.940]   I have done so much...
[01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:26.980]   So this is in my quest of becoming a one man reporting machine.
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:28.660]   You see how I like to do those segments?
[01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:30.700]   I want to do them all by myself.
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:33.820]   So the thing is that I wanted to do interviews.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:38.300]   And so anyway, so if you check this out, Leo, see, you can imagine.
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:39.540]   You could hold this out like this.
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:40.540]   And I can be sitting there talking.
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:41.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:42.540]   You can see.
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:43.540]   I can be talking right now.
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:46.140]   It looks like you got a cameraman except your left hand is strangely absent.
[01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:47.140]   Yes.
[01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:50.220]   But you know, but literally if you held it down here like this...
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:51.220]   Then you would even know.
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:52.220]   You wouldn't even know.
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.220]   And you could be sitting there, you know, chatting away.
[01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:55.580]   I'm buying one of these right now.
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:56.580]   And it's super solid.
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:59.220]   I mean, so the thing is, that's the thing is this is the professional level of this.
[01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:00.220]   This is not the...
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:05.020]   And it's a standard ball head so you could put it on a GoPro or anything that fits a...
[01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:06.020]   Well, this is...
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:07.980]   Yeah, this is a quarter 20s.
[01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:15.540]   So you can standard mount for your non-technical term, a standard mount for your tripod.
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:18.740]   So you can turn your iPad or your iPod iPhone.
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:20.540]   Anyway, you want...
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:24.700]   And again, it just feels solid and you make it nice and small and you can put it back
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:25.700]   in your...
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:26.700]   And you can put a GoPro on the end of it.
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:28.380]   I like it putting a GoPro on it.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:29.380]   Yeah.
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:32.180]   And of course you can go up high and get over everybody's head.
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:33.540]   And anyway, but I like the idea.
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:36.260]   So now I'm just working on getting the wireless mic set up.
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:37.500]   You know, no, no, I was...
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:38.500]   Here's the worst part.
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:39.500]   Here's the worst part.
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:43.340]   So yesterday there was a long conversation with Lectrosonic about how I was going to
[01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:44.340]   attach a...
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.340]   Well, you don't need a wireless.
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:46.340]   You don't need a wireless.
[01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:47.340]   You just have a little wire coming down here.
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:49.660]   But it would be much better if it was wireless.
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:52.060]   So there was a conversation with Lectrosonic about how to wire that up.
[01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:53.500]   So that's what we're working on next.
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:54.500]   So...
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:58.900]   Actually, what you need is another K-tech boom mic pole and you can hold both of them
[01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:02.220]   like this.
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:05.220]   Or even there is someone who makes another shotgun mic that comes...
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:06.220]   A shotgun to be perfect.
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:07.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:08.220]   So that'll be the...
[01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:09.220]   How heavy is it?
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:10.220]   Let me see.
[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:11.220]   Oh, so these are really light.
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:12.220]   Right.
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:13.380]   And the other thing is, but it's not too light.
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:16.460]   The problem that I've had with the other ones that I've played with is that they're not
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:17.460]   stable enough.
[01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:18.460]   So you feel like they're bouncing around.
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:19.460]   The phone is the heaviest thing.
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:20.460]   I mean, the pole itself is really light.
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:21.460]   Yeah.
[01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:22.460]   And it's great.
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:23.460]   And they make a couple of different sizes.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:24.460]   This is like the middle size.
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:25.460]   I think this is like a three foot.
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:26.460]   They make a six foot.
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:27.460]   I think this is 115, I think.
[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:28.460]   So it is a little more than price to.
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:29.940]   And the case is like 99 too.
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:30.940]   So it's...
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:31.940]   Oh, you need a special...
[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:32.940]   But it's like machined.
[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:37.340]   Well, I mean, if this is something that you want to do as a one man reporter, you know,
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:41.100]   one woman reporter, and you want to be able to do this, there's a lot of people on the
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:42.100]   floor trying to do this.
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:43.900]   So you just shoot yourself.
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:45.460]   Right.
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:47.460]   You can shoot yourself and you can use it to get high...
[01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:49.460]   They make a mini for $60.
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:50.460]   The tadpole mini.
[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:53.460]   The tadpole mini that you can just kind of hold up.
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:57.460]   And then they make one, I think, that's like a 18 inch or 18 inch of three foot, which
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.460]   I think this one is.
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:25:59.460]   And it's just...
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:02.060]   I just think it's the solution I've been looking for.
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:05.100]   I mean, a lot of you have seen this iteration of me constantly playing with this.
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:06.980]   How do I shoot stuff myself?
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:10.820]   And this is the state of the art at the moment.
[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:11.820]   So...
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:12.820]   And it's waterproof, right?
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:13.820]   It is waterproof.
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:14.820]   It turns out that it is waterproof.
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:15.820]   Where do they get wet?
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:16.820]   What?
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:19.820]   We're just talking about the importance of waterproofing.
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:20.820]   This is waterproof.
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:21.820]   It's liquid-filled.
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:22.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:23.820]   All right.
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:24.820]   Very nice.
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:25.820]   I like that.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:26.820]   That's K-T-E-L.
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:27.820]   K-T-K-T camps.
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:28.820]   K-T-L makes those records.
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:29.820]   Yes, exactly.
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:32.820]   They don't make records, but they do make great boo-boo calls.
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:33.820]   K-T-K.
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:37.820]   All right, Larry, what did you see at NAB that you're excited about?
[01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:38.820]   I've got Final Cut.
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:39.820]   There's one thing.
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:40.820]   Well, there's nothing to see.
[01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.820]   A Final Cut has some change.
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:44.380]   They're just going to change, but it hasn't changed yet.
[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:45.980]   What I like is Thunderbolt.
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:48.740]   The thing that I'm impressed with Thunderbolt is it's everywhere.
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:52.260]   An example is G-Technology with the new Thunderbolt drives.
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:58.220]   They just released a RAID 0, which is a really high speed, two drive Thunderbolt RAID.
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:02.500]   It's four terabytes for 699 and eight terabytes for 899.
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:07.260]   You can daisy-chain the Thunderbolt together, but what's even cooler is you can daisy-chain
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:10.060]   them and they show up as a J-bot on your computer.
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:15.660]   You can then stripe them using disk utility to turn it into a RAID and you have two separate
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:21.620]   boxes connected via Thunderbolt and you're able to drive a fully saturated gigabyte a
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:25.100]   second of data from these RAIDs.
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:28.940]   They're going to do us a second single drive, which is Thunderbolt coming out in about a month,
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:30.580]   and then they're going to work on a RAID 5.
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:34.620]   For me, RAID 5 is where you want to put your data because you've got the protection against
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:35.620]   that redundancy.
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:40.180]   If you have the two drives or the set of drives that are there and they're both RAID 0, you
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:43.220]   get that nice speed, but then you can, as a J-bot, you can put them back together as
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:47.900]   a RAID 1 and then you're basically mirroring all that data really fast to both so that
[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:51.180]   you know that you always have a whole other copy of it.
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:58.260]   And because it's Thunderbolt and because of the new high speed Hitachi drives that are
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:02.180]   inside, which are now Western Digital because they can't figure out who their parent is,
[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:03.180]   the...
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:05.420]   And then we have a name for the show.
[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:07.420]   Are you my mommy?
[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:11.980]   And they're able to get about 150 megabytes a second off a single drive.
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:16.340]   So RAID 0 normally would limit you to about 50 megabytes, but with Thunderbolt you can
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:21.700]   do about 150 in a RAID 1, about 300 on a RAID 0, and you can daisy chain up to six of these
[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:25.060]   units together and you could get some serious speed coming from it.
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:29.380]   So first the ubiquity of Thunderbolt and second that G technology stuff.
[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:32.340]   Yeah, very nice, very nice.
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:33.340]   Thank you, Larry Jordan.
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:34.340]   Alan Tepor, your pick of the...
[01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:35.340]   Thank you.
[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:40.580]   I'm so glad that although my tip is also a Thunderbolt tip, it's not the same one that
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:41.580]   I'm very nice.
[01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:45.140]   I was afraid that it might be the same one when he mentioned Thunderbolt.
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:50.540]   This is another product from AJA announced here at NAB and it's called the T-Tap.
[01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:55.300]   And the T stands for Thunderbolt if you were wondering what the T stands for.
[01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:59.900]   It doesn't stand for Tepor or Techno-2 or it stands for Thunderbolt.
[01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:09.420]   And it's a $249 little device that fits in the palm of your hand that goes from Thunderbolt
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:15.100]   simultaneously to SDI and to HDMI at 10-bit.
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:17.540]   So for out only.
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:22.700]   It's for all those situations where you're doing file-based, you're not capturing from
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:26.700]   TAPE anymore, which is the case of most of us nowadays.
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:32.260]   Or if we are, it might be through Firewire if we're dealing with HDB or something like
[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:33.260]   that.
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:34.380]   But not through a box.
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:37.380]   And it gives you the proper monitoring.
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:41.900]   If you connected a proper calibrated monitor in whatever color space you're dealing with,
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:44.780]   which is in high definition television is normally Rec.709.
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:50.500]   If you have a Rec.709 monitor at 10-bit or sometimes called a 30-bit because they talk
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:54.300]   about 10-bit per color.
[01:29:54.300 --> 01:30:00.860]   Then for only $249 and self-powered, you have proper monitoring from the proper NLEs, including
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:05.020]   Final Cut Pro X, Premiere Pro.
[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:07.820]   And I'm not sure which other ones.
[01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:11.740]   But I know those two are definitely supported.
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:19.980]   And for people who are not aware of this, in order to do proper monitoring perfectly,
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:23.420]   we've always needed some hardware device.
[01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:27.620]   But those hardware devices have had a lot more features that we no longer need a lot
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:32.740]   of the times nowadays in order to capture and in order to go out to analog signals and
[01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:33.860]   things like that.
[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:39.020]   So this represents a decrease in what that normally would have cost us.
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:41.100]   It's only $249.
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:44.900]   It is an endpoint for your Thunderbolt chain.
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:49.620]   So you want to connect all your Thunderbolt storage first in any other device.
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:52.300]   And then finally put that at the end because it is an endpoint.
[01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:57.500]   And that's a characteristic basically of all Thunderbolt devices that are bus-powered.
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:58.940]   They're the endpoint.
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:04.860]   And those that take extra power are usually the ones that have a pass-through.
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:09.980]   And do you know if-- does it do proper like $59.94 coming out so that you can run the--
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:13.540]   It does the proper frame rates of whatever your sequence is.
[01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:18.460]   I'm not sure if you have to set it specifically in the AJA control panel or not.
[01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:23.620]   But I did ask a very specific question because I happen to be very fond of the HP Dream Color
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:30.020]   which does Rec.709 and DCI digital cinema and other color spaces.
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:34.340]   And that monitor although it's wonderful and I love it and it's very good for its price.
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:36.900]   It's very fussy about the signal that it receives.
[01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:39.420]   And it absolutely must be RGB over HDMI.
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:43.060]   It cannot be a component or YUV.
[01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:47.980]   And that capability is in the control panel of the TTAP.
[01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:51.660]   And it does do it at the proper frame rate of whatever you're doing.
[01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:56.540]   Whether it's 23.976, 25, 29.9750 or 59.94.
[01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:57.540]   That's awesome.
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:59.900]   It's bus-powered so you don't need to plug it in or anything.
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:02.860]   Keep it in your pocket and plug it into your MacBook Air.
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:03.860]   It's awesome.
[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:04.860]   Ready to go.
[01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:05.860]   Wow.
[01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:06.860]   With the proper monitoring.
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:09.860]   Because you know you can connect a monitor without such a device.
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:16.100]   But then you cannot completely count on seeing the color and the gamma properly and the frame
[01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:17.100]   rate properly.
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:22.020]   So my question specifically was related to the fact that you can't plug your laptop directly
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:24.220]   into a key pro if you wanted to record it.
[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:25.620]   Because it needs to see 59.940.
[01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:27.180]   You can't see the 60p.
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:28.180]   Could you use this?
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:32.540]   And that's my curiosity is whether I could go out of my laptop and go through this to
[01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:34.180]   get into a key pro.
[01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:36.340]   Or it's a night down that it has HDCP.
[01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:37.700]   I doubt it has any protection.
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:38.700]   You don't need that.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:40.940]   You just need to know that it's going to be 59.940.
[01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:41.940]   Right, right, right.
[01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:43.420]   You know it's good that it doesn't have it.
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:45.620]   Otherwise it would prevent you from recording.
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:46.620]   Yeah.
[01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:48.860]   I use a $10,000 image.
[01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:49.860]   Which I don't own by the way.
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:50.860]   People are going to ask.
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:51.860]   I don't know.
[01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:52.860]   And I rent it.
[01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:55.460]   Because just to convert from 60p to 59.940.
[01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:56.460]   What?
[01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:57.860]   $10,000 just for this.
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:32:58.860]   Now I don't.
[01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:00.220]   Because we owe six frames.
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:02.780]   Now we just use a PICs 240 to do it.
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:05.060]   Because you can just plug it right into the PICs and just record.
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:08.380]   But before it was like this huge deal to plug that in.
[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:11.140]   So you'll record 60 and then you can form later?
[01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:12.140]   Yes.
[01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:13.140]   Makes sense.
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:14.140]   Yeah.
[01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:15.140]   Thank you Alan.
[01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:16.140]   Appreciate it.
[01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:18.980]   Finally last but not least your PIC of the show.
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:19.980]   Yeah.
[01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:22.220]   Since we're talking about, everybody's talking about equipment.
[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:24.820]   I actually have a nap that I like.
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:26.220]   And is that okay?
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:27.700]   Yeah, of course it's okay.
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:29.340]   I see you have your iPad there.
[01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:30.340]   Yeah.
[01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:34.260]   I mean you guys have probably talked about this before.
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:37.020]   Because they just upgraded this version that I discovered here.
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:40.220]   It's called Storyboard.
[01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:42.540]   Cine Mark's Storyboard.
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:45.820]   And I actually used it on the last movie that I worked on.
[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:48.620]   And it works great.
[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:51.620]   Where you just need to lay out shots really fast.
[01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:55.300]   So all you do is I was taking photos with my iPad.
[01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:56.300]   And bring it up here.
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:57.740]   This will be really quick.
[01:33:57.740 --> 01:33:59.300]   It's good for you.
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:00.300]   Alex.
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:01.300]   I'm getting it.
[01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:02.300]   Yeah.
[01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:06.220]   They make the HD version which is what the new version of it is right now.
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:10.940]   But this is the old version only because that's the only one I have photos in.
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:13.260]   But you can see that.
[01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:15.180]   Oh look at that.
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:17.540]   So you use photos to storyboard your shoe.
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:18.540]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:19.860]   You can bring the photos in anyway.
[01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:23.940]   I was doing it actually linking with my iPhone at one point.
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:24.940]   And doing it this way.
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:26.180]   Or taking location photos.
[01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:28.540]   But what I like is it makes use of the interface.
[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:29.540]   You can just move it around.
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:32.100]   Whatever order you want to cut.
[01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:33.100]   Do different versions.
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:37.420]   And then you can email this directly to, well I was emailing it to the producers.
[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:38.740]   Hey you got nothing to worry about.
[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:41.020]   Ten setups are out of here.
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:43.260]   And there's an HD version of it now.
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:46.900]   And I found it to be one of the most useful things for anybody.
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:52.220]   And you know trying to create content on the Mac and stuff.
[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:54.380]   And there's one other last thing.
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:56.300]   How much is that?
[01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:58.500]   This new version I think is $29 now.
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:34:59.500]   Right.
[01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:00.740]   And that's in the name of it again.
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:01.740]   Cinema.
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:02.740]   Cinema.
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:04.780]   It's on the store.
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:07.300]   Cinema storyboard HD.
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:08.300]   But it's fantastic.
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:10.460]   You can do other things where you can time out.
[01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:11.460]   You can play it out.
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:12.460]   You can time it out.
[01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:15.660]   You can indicate a camera move here.
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:17.540]   Like dawling in.
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:19.020]   That kind of thing.
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:20.020]   So it's great.
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:22.100]   It saves so much time when you can.
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:23.100]   Yeah.
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:24.780]   And this is the first thing.
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:27.300]   I've been trying to do this on my Macs for years.
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:29.220]   This is the first thing I can use on the set.
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:33.700]   And then literally two minutes have a version of how it's going to cut.
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:35.420]   And now relay it out.
[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:37.100]   What's the most efficient way to shoot it.
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:38.460]   Let's put all the cameras here.
[01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:41.660]   We'll get these shots and go for it.
[01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:44.660]   But there's one last thing I want to give Leo.
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:46.380]   Since everything's digital.
[01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:47.380]   Yes.
[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:50.780]   And this is for another show or another story.
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:53.780]   But it's like what do we do with all this stuff.
[01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:58.220]   This is a copy of the digital dilemma too.
[01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:00.260]   It's not for sale, not selling anything.
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:02.820]   You can download it at Oscars.org.
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:08.620]   It was done by the Academy Science and Technology Council, which I'm a member of.
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:15.820]   There's two versions of it, but it talks about how long digital data lasts, what to do with
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:16.820]   all these images.
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:20.460]   And it applies to the consumer.
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:23.060]   Because where are we going with all these family pictures and everything.
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:24.060]   Huge issue.
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:25.060]   Yes.
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:26.060]   Anyway, that's for you.
[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:27.060]   Oh, thank you so much.
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:28.060]   I really appreciate it Darren.
[01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:29.060]   Thank you.
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:31.260]   And you can get this at Oscars.org.
[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:33.900]   Yeah, you can download the version of that.
[01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:34.900]   Oh, look at that.
[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:36.300]   But it's a really complete study.
[01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:41.340]   This one deals with a lot of independent films and case studies.
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:47.300]   The first version just deals with the amount of volume and how it's being stored and how
[01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:49.060]   long, really how fragile it is.
[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:51.980]   It's not just a format issue, although a good deal of it is a format issue.
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:55.380]   But it's also, there's a lot of it.
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:56.380]   Yeah.
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:58.580]   And now, I mean, this is the world we live in.
[01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:04.820]   So it's, you know, you just shoot it and assume you have it is not necessarily the case.
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:06.180]   The only big track of it is important.
[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:07.180]   Right.
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:10.380]   I mean, this applies to everything, not just images, but also banking.
[01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:17.060]   You know, but because images, everything that we do is so intricate.
[01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:21.260]   That's one reason why we, we push to do that at the academy.
[01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:22.260]   So cool.
[01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:23.260]   Thank you, Darren.
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:29.740]   Darren Okada is a cinematographer, former president of the ASC is at the ASC.com.
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:30.740]   And are you working on a film?
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:31.900]   Are you getting ready to do this film?
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:33.500]   No, I just finished shooting.
[01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:36.300]   I did five episodes of this show for ABC called Castle.
[01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:37.300]   I finished last week.
[01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:38.300]   Love Castle.
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:40.780]   And I had a movie last week that opened American Reunion.
[01:37:40.780 --> 01:37:41.780]   So that was fun.
[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:42.780]   That's exciting.
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:43.780]   So you kind of relax.
[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:47.460]   Now, now I get to play and demo all these cameras.
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:48.460]   What fun.
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:49.660]   Figure out where you're going to use the next time.
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:50.660]   Yeah.
[01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:55.860]   Alan Tepper is from the his own podcast, Techno Tour, but he also writes for the Pro Video
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:56.860]   Coalition.
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:59.180]   Where do we find Techno Tour?
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:03.300]   Well Techno Tour, the podcast is available in iTunes or at Techno Tour.
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:09.740]   But US or any of your podcatcher on any of your mobile phones just search for Techno
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:14.300]   Tour as it's spelled on the screen or else spell it T-E-C-N-O-T-U-R.
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:17.420]   By the way, our listeners are known as Techno Touristas.
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:18.420]   Aha.
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:23.980]   Even in the English version because, you know, people catch on with what Techno Touristas
[01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:24.980]   means.
[01:38:24.980 --> 01:38:26.500]   So it's both Castilian and in English.
[01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:27.500]   Yes.
[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:31.780]   Two separate RSS feeds, both available at that same website.
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:35.540]   My personal side is Alan Tepper.com with a double L and a double P.
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:36.540]   Thank you.
[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:38.140]   So good to finally get you on the show.
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:39.140]   I really appreciate it.
[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:40.140]   Thank you very much.
[01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:41.140]   It's an honor.
[01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:42.140]   Get you back soon.
[01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:43.580]   Larry Jordan, it's so funny because it was a year ago.
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:47.300]   We were all talking about Final Cut 10 and you were the Final Cut 10 guy.
[01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:50.460]   Now here we are a year later and some of the glow was worn off.
[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:51.460]   Indeed.
[01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:53.580]   But maybe there's hope left yet.
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:58.860]   You know, I think the reason, what was it the line from out to sea is there's always
[01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:01.260]   hope that's why they invented death.
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:06.660]   To kind of cut that off and then finally just say no more, no more hope.
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:12.500]   You know, I think there's always hope and it's the industry is in complete transition.
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:17.460]   The definition of professional is changing and how you earn a living with video is changing.
[01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:19.740]   The market doesn't support high priced products.
[01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:22.420]   We've seen that from Autodesk, we've seen it from Apple.
[01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:27.420]   The market is demanding easier to use interfaces and we're looking at new ways to create video
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:31.300]   and ways that didn't exist even two, three years ago.
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:34.980]   The industry is responding to that and the question is, is the response headed in the
[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:35.980]   right direction?
[01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:39.460]   The only way they'll know is to release it and get feedback and make changes.
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:43.260]   That's really why NAB exists and why we're here because the industry is in a complete
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:44.420]   state of flux right now.
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:47.340]   Well, I hope they're listening a little bit to Larry Jordan.
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:51.940]   Larry Jordan.biz for Edit Smarter, the best Final Cut Pro training out there.
[01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:54.940]   You must go there and participate.
[01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:55.940]   Thank you, sir.
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:56.940]   Thank you so much.
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:57.940]   Thank you for the invitation.
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:40:01.980]   The podcast is called the digital production buzz.com.
[01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:07.020]   We're covering NAB at 80 interviews and in-depth and all the technical details for people that
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:08.020]   care.
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:09.020]   Well, that's actually good to know.
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:13.020]   So people who want even more than they're getting can get more at digital production buzz.com.
[01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:14.020]   And then do you?
[01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:15.020]   Thank you, Larry.
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:18.020]   Alex Lindsey, are you going to stick around and do more?
[01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:20.460]   Are you going to go home and melt into a puddle?
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:21.460]   No, I'm going to do more.
[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:23.540]   I'm going to do some more segments.
[01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:25.700]   I'm going to probably shoot some stuff with my iPhone.
[01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:26.700]   That's my constant R&D.
[01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:30.980]   So I'm probably going to put that on the Pixelcore G+ page.
[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:32.780]   So they'll be just my raw little notes.
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:35.740]   And then a lot of those will get turned into real ones or some of them will get turned
[01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:36.740]   into real ones tomorrow.
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:38.980]   It's so great for all of the stuff you shot.
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:39.980]   I'm having fun.
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:44.260]   I have to admit, it's great having a large crew and people who, you know, like everyone's
[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:45.260]   working on stuff like that.
[01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:46.260]   You're all about yourself.
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:47.820]   So I'm enjoying it.
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:49.260]   And so thanks for having me.
[01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:50.980]   We are covering a wall to wall.
[01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:54.780]   We thank the National Association of Broadcasters Show for letting us be their official streaming
[01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:55.780]   partner.
[01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:56.780]   We're having a lot of fun here.
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:58.340]   I hope you're enjoying the broadcast.
[01:40:58.340 --> 01:40:59.340]   Thanks everybody.
[01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:04.140]   We'll send you back now to the Brickhouse Studios for Twitch Photo, Leo Laport.
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:05.620]   Now get back to work.
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:06.900]   Break time is over.
[01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:20.900]   [MUSIC]
