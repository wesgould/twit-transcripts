[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.520]   Hey everyone, welcome back to Macbreak Weekly.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.200]   This is Alex Lindsey sitting in for Leo.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.720]   He is again on jury duty.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.280]   And I'd love to tell you all about it.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.080]   We can't.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.680]   He hasn't told me anything about it.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.520]   He can't talk about it.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.400]   We can't talk about it.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.640]   We just tell you that he's not there.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.440]   Maybe we can talk about it afterwards.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.600]   But we do have to carry on with Macbreak.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.520]   And we've got an excellent core group here today.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.720]   Andy Nocko, of course, from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.840]   Andy.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.120]   And Lil Ylix.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.240]   And Leander Kaney from the call to Mac.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.760]   Hey, Leander.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.280]   Hey, Alex.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.800]   How are you?
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.160]   Good.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.160]   Very, very good.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160]   And we've got-- it's a lot of big news today, actually.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.560]   And one that I think Leo is probably
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.040]   hoping wanting to use his Android talk about.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.200]   Google, of course-- we've seen this in the news
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.760]   in the last couple of days.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.840]   Google has a bot or is in the process
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.000]   of buying the Motorola mobility.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.480]   So they're not buying all of Motorola.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.040]   I think some people have asked that.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.840]   But they are just simply buying their mobile division.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.600]   So of course, the manufacturer of their phones.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.440]   And then all the patents.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.960]   Of course, that's probably the most important piece of that.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.280]   And there was this guy that wrote-- there's actually
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.720]   a great article about this that I was just reading about
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.680]   from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.200]   Oh, wait.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.000]   We have that guy on the show.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.880]   Andy, what's the real gist of this process?
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.360]   What's going on here?
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.800]   Well, there are three different dimensions to this deal.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.600]   And the most obvious one, and the one
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.400]   that Google really pushed the button on pretty hard
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.520]   when they did their press release
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.720]   and had their conference call, was
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.840]   that they wanted Motorola's huge mobility patent portfolio.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.080]   And that clicks in rather nicely with all the news
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.480]   that everyone's been talking about over the past
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.520]   or three months where at this point,
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.800]   the legal and corporate industries
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.600]   have managed to weaponize patents,
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.080]   just like terrorists weaponize certain viruses
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.680]   and stuff like that.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.080]   Where if you don't have-- if there's
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.080]   a large portfolio of certain kinds of patents,
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.120]   that's just a good idea.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.200]   If you have lots of money to buy it just so
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.360]   that you have some coverage in case
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.880]   someone ever comes after you, either hold you up for ransom
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.000]   to get to the licensing fees for technology you develop yourself.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.560]   Or if they try to shut you down from selling a product
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.800]   that they think legitimately infringes on their own patents,
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.440]   they can say, well, look, we've got our own coverage here.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.040]   I'm sorry, we're not going to stop selling phones on your basis.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.360]   But there are two other dimensions to it too.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.720]   And I tend to think that that was--
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.320]   although that was a nice bonus, I
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.400]   don't think that was the real thrust of this deal, partly
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.280]   because a lot of the commentators have been talking about,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.640]   oh, well, yes, of course, because Apple and IBM have been--
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.040]   excuse me, I'm sorry, Apple and Microsoft
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.520]   have been going after Google about some of the patents that
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.960]   are associated with Android that are going after some certain
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.360]   handset makers.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.560]   Unfortunately, in the intervening time,
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.560]   we've discovered that Apple has also
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.960]   been going after Motorola for much the same thing.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.840]   So if that is the reason, it's going to be of limited use.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.560]   Well, now here's a question, though,
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.600]   is that also-- some of the stuff I believe recently
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.760]   was pushed aside in federal court.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.240]   So some of the-- do you think Motorola looks better
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.800]   from a patent perspective than HTC or some of the other manufacturers
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.680]   that are being sued at the moment?
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.200]   I think that Motorola is a better buy,
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.520]   because it's a complete package deal.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.520]   I don't think that the patents are the biggest part of the attraction.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.840]   I think part of it is just that Google needs an easy way
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.680]   to start to take more control over the Android platform.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.200]   And of all the makers, Motorola is the company that
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.120]   has 100% committed to Android.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.440]   They are 100% Android platform, both in their tablet space
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.520]   and in their mobile space.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.600]   So this gives them control over a major maker of hardware.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.880]   And so this is at least one channel where they can essentially
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.880]   create an entire line of Google Nexus 1 phones, where
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.000]   they can pretty much say, here is how the hardware should work.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.040]   Here's how you should deploy the operating system.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.880]   No, you will not replace our really nice integrated launcher
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.560]   for the web and email and replace it
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.160]   with your own stupid third party skin just to make yours look
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.200]   different from ours.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.880]   Yes, you will support our app store.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.240]   You will not connect with third party app store that works
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.680]   in a really stupid and bad way.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.920]   And you will also make sure that your camera app is the one
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.840]   that we ship, which actually is good for taking pictures,
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.840]   as opposed to the one that Samsung puts on theirs, which
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.600]   is good for pretending to take pictures while you try to wonder
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.880]   why is this thing not taking pictures.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.280]   So I really think that's a strategic move.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.640]   The third thing-- and this is something I've
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.280]   been reading about over the past couple of days.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.520]   I mentioned before that lots of the legal stuff
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.960]   is very much above my pay grade.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.000]   And so that's why I look for other blogs and also
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.200]   have certain C9 nerds that help me through it.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.680]   But the Fospatence blog has been a huge--
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.760]   has had a lot of really great commentary
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.960]   on this whole process.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.880]   And they're saying that perhaps--
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.200]   there are two aspects of the deal that really
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   perked up this commentator's ears.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.000]   One was the huge penalty that Google has to pay
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.840]   if this deal does not go through.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.860]   The overall deal is for something like $12 and $1/2
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.960]   billion.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.080]   If the deal does not go through, Motorola
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.920]   gets $2.5 billion just for sitting around for--
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.640]   That's like a boxer that loses the big match.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.560]   Is that you get to have a $1.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.400]   And this is hugely atypical for this kind of deal.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.760]   You don't play that kind of poker.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.200]   Even if you're absolutely sure that there's
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.000]   a way this deal can fail to go through, Google would not
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.280]   be--
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.400]   excuse me, according to this guy and a couple others,
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.240]   Google would not be playing this kind of poker.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   So the theory now is that Google must have been really
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.760]   desperate to have Motorola mobility somewhere
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.600]   inside their umbrella for some purpose that we're probably
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.880]   not going to figure out until later on.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.640]   I've seen a couple reports that suggest that--
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.200]   and the Android platform has been under attack over the past
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.640]   few months from the open source community,
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.640]   because they are violating the GPL
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.720]   in a number of different ways that have now escalated from,
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.680]   come on, Google, you're not supposed
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.880]   to use our free software like that.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.440]   From that point, it's escalated down to, OK, your license
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:20.960]   is revoked.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.760]   You no longer have a license to ship the Android operating
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.720]   system, so good luck shipping phones with a software
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.160]   that you don't have the right to actually distribute.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.920]   So I'm not pretending that I understand the full scope
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.400]   of the problem.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.440]   But when I've been reading over the past 24 hours,
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.720]   I'm increasingly less convinced that this is all about, oh,
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.240]   well, they just want to get this patent library.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.480]   And that's the only reason why they went after Motorola.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.280]   Leander, do you think that the Android platform is in trouble?
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.480]   I mean, do you think this is a desperate attempt
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.400]   to try to keep it going?
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.120]   You've got suits coming from both sides,
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.400]   from the open source, from Apple, from Microsoft.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.480]   Or you have a lot of--
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.160]   I would say suits from the open source,
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.480]   but a lot of people talking about it,
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.520]   a lot of people pushing hard.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.440]   Does Google have to rethink that platform?
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.080]   Is that what this is all about?
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.000]   You know, I honestly don't know.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.820]   It seems as though the tech industry managed to function
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.920]   pretty well on the past without suing each other's
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.000]   pants off.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.520]   It was just a competitive in the PC era,
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.920]   as it seems to be in this new mobile era.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.120]   And Microsoft and Apple and all the other competitors,
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.360]   Dell, Compaq managed to do cross licensing patent deals.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.800]   That's been typical in the tech industry.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.520]   So all of this infighting over patents is something new
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.280]   that I don't recall saying before.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.840]   Maybe it occurred early on.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.720]   Maybe you guys know some examples.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.680]   But it's a strange purchase because, as Andy pointed out,
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.120]   they're now a hardware manufacturer,
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.840]   and they're going to go up against all their hardware
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.320]   partners.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.000]   And their whole strategy was to give the software away
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.520]   and build a wide and broad ecosystem of different hardware
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.240]   manufacturers.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.720]   And by going into competition directly with these guys,
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.000]   their endanger killing that off.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   So it's incredibly risky.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.400]   Do you think that that points to the fact
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.920]   that they're taking this risk of making everybody upset
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.960]   that they're working with all of their phone partners
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.040]   and possibly pushing away, and then also offering
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.880]   Motorola $2.5 billion that they don't even
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.160]   if they don't even make the deal.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.080]   And then an enormous amount of money, three times as much money
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.440]   as went into the noor tell.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.040]   All right, Pat, is this something that--
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.200]   are they closer to the edge than they may appear from the surface?
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   I mean, is this something that--
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.440]   it seems like a very, very desperate move.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.920]   Well, look what happened with Microsoft
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.520]   when they took the Zoom in-house.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.000]   Microsoft tried a similar strategy with the Zoom player.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.560]   They licensed that across the board
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.120]   to a whole bunch of different hardware manufacturers.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.760]   It never took off against the iPod.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.640]   So they bought it in-house.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.440]   They sat on their own Zoom hardware.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.320]   Instantly, all of the other Zoom players
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.200]   fell off the edge of the cliff.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.000]   And then Microsoft folded the Zoom itself a couple of years
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.720]   later after never really getting anywhere with it.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.840]   Google has had a pretty good relationship with HTC.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.760]   The Nexus One is already a really good Google phone.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.640]   It's not loaded up with a bunch of crap where
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.280]   it's nicely integrated with the software.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:19.400]   They had all the advantages of having
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.160]   that sort of hardware player hardware
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.680]   manufacturing in-house with that close partnership
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.280]   with HTC on the Nexus One.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.240]   The only thing they didn't get is the sort of legal ownership
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.840]   and maybe the sales channels and the marketing--
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.440]   I'm sorry, the sales channels.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.200]   They were in charge of everything else, the marketing,
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.440]   the sales, which they tried to do online themselves.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.920]   So it's kind of hard to imagine what they're getting
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.040]   from this Motorola purchase.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.280]   It's like a risky strategy of pissing everyone off.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.600]   And of course, the real question that we have about all
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.480]   of this is how does this affect the iPhone?
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.520]   So how does this affect Apple?
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.200]   Does this give-- is this going to have the Android grow more
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   into the iPhone market?
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.640]   Or is it going to be something that is--
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.000]   does it not affect them at all?
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.200]   I mean, which directions are going to push it?
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.160]   Well, the first thing I thought when I saw it,
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.120]   I was like, oh my god, they're doing an Apple.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.120]   They're bringing in the hardware in-house.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.880]   And they want to do what Apple is--
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.600]   Would that make sense?
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:25.840]   Yeah, I think so, because at the risk of having all their other
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.760]   hardware partners fall out of the picture, it makes a lot of
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.240]   sense.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.800]   Apple, I think, has shown that vertical integration is the
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.520]   model for these post-PC devices.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.680]   And I wouldn't--
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.640]   remember when Microsoft was rumored to be buying Nokia?
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.240]   That seemed to make a lot of sense to a lot of people.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.160]   They were also going to get into the hardware game too.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.320]   But here's the question is, is Google capable of doing
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.160]   what Apple?
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.840]   Let's say Google wants to be top-down like that.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.680]   The issue is that I'm not clear from--
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.480]   I'm sitting in front now.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.760]   I will admit, as far as making things available, I'm sitting
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.920]   in front of a Google box right now.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.320]   But as far as making things work really smoothly and easily,
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.520]   I don't think that Andy--
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.120]   I don't think that Google is particularly an expert at that.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.280]   No, and I don't think so either.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.880]   And I don't think this is a real Apple move.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.000]   I don't think they want to be the one maker of Android
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.840]   devices.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.480]   But I think that the past two or three years
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.320]   have demonstrated the value of making sure
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.720]   that they can have at least one reference platform that
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.440]   shows off Android the way it was meant to go.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.640]   The second aspect to this is that Android is not making any
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.840]   money for Google up to this point worse than that.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.320]   There's real threats that Android is going to start to cost
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.600]   Google money, particularly if they lose some of these actions
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.560]   and they're forced to start paying licensing fees to Apple
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.840]   to other companies for every hand set that ships,
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.960]   they're going to need to have some money coming in.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.080]   I know that's sort of a drop in the bucket sort of thing
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.920]   when you consider exactly how much money Google is sitting on.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.600]   Again, think back to the $12.5 billion being spent for it
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.400]   to acquire these plays in the first place.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.080]   But it just shows there are a bunch of dimensions to this
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.400]   in that if this division can start actually at least making
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.440]   sure that it doesn't cost Google money to keep giving this stuff
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.280]   away for free, they can move on to phase two, which
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.200]   is Android's real purpose, which is to make sure that this
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.000]   enhances their ad business in some way.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.200]   So we'll see how it goes.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.920]   I think we've covered it as much as we need to on a Mac show.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.680]   But we'll see where that goes.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.760]   It's big enough news that we had to talk about it a little bit
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.440]   because it is going to affect our market pretty dramatically.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.920]   Also, Leaked, we're getting the tangentially connected stuff
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.680]   out of the way first.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.680]   I know people on our chat room are like,
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.120]   so what does it have to do with Mac?
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:43.000]   So also AT&T, of course, they bought T-Mobile
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.480]   or they're in the process of buying T-Mobile.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.800]   And one of the things that leaked out
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.240]   was while they're spending somewhere
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.680]   in the vicinity of $40 billion on T-Mobile,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.800]   they could have built out the entire LTE coverage,
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.600]   the same coverage for about $3.8 billion, so about 1/10
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.160]   the price.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.840]   And so the question is, is why did they buy T-Mobile?
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.600]   They said they needed it to get out there.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:10.000]   Leander, why would AT&T buy T-Mobile to get that expansion out?
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.160]   And I, as an iPhone user, am excited about the possibility
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.520]   of AT&T having 4G on my next iPhone.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.280]   But why do they buy-- why do they need the rest of T-Mobile?
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.160]   They're getting a lot of coverage for relatively--
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.240]   Is it a time issue?
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.520]   Is it something that needs to happen?
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.000]   It may only cost $4 billion to basically get almost the same
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   coverage as they're getting if they bought T-Mobile
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   or possibly more.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.800]   But the question is, how long would it take
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.520]   to make that coverage available?
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.080]   Well, the way I understood that story
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.600]   was that the T-Mobile would give them 80% coverage,
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.000]   and then they were reluctant to spend the extra $4 billion
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.720]   to bring it up to $97.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.240]   Got it.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.160]   Or am I mis-understanding that?
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.640]   Is that right, Andy?
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.880]   I think that's right too.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.640]   OK.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.240]   So they just don't want to move it.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.240]   They've spent $10 billion.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.040]   They don't want to spend the extra $4 billion
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.720]   to bring it up to $97%.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:08.600]   I think that we're going to cover 80% of the population of the US.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.800]   As far as ATTs is concerned, that's enough.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.600]   Yeah, right.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.960]   And that was only, I think, what, 20% of the US landmass?
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.880]   Or something like that.
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:26.240]   It was updating only to bring it up to that extra 17%.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.240]   To jump it from 80% coverage to 97% coverage,
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.960]   they were going to have to cover more than 50% of the US landmass.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.480]   And that means putting cell towers in rural areas under-populated.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.960]   And there are a lot of rural under-populated areas.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.280]   And so I think they're looking, and they're thinking,
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.640]   this is going to cost us $4 billion.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.320]   We're only covering an extra 17% of the population.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.400]   This is a very expensive proposition.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.440]   So they're also reluctant to do that.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:57.640]   And I guess AT&T hasn't got a history of taking care
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.840]   of its network and not grabbing it.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.340]   Wow.
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.400]   Because I was going to say, even in the areas
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.320]   that it covers really well, it's not something that--
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.600]   I mean, and of course, the problem AT&T
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.200]   as we talk about this all the time
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.320]   is that a lot of the press, of course,
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.400]   spends a lot of time in New York and San Francisco,
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.040]   and where AT&T doesn't really work.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.320]   But for us, but Verizon does.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.680]   So what are you going to say, Leander?
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.240]   Well, it's always-- it's got a representation
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.000]   being terrible at integrating as a network.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.520]   I know some network engineers here
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.200]   who work for both AT&T and Verizon,
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.160]   and the AT&T ones are embarrassed about their own company's
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.120]   inability to take care of its network.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.880]   It's sort of a neglect to get fundamental business.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.840]   Well, hopefully, we'll see.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.280]   I mean, the T-Mobile may not only expand their market,
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.760]   but give them more trans-- or more transceivers, Andy,
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.120]   in the markets that they're in.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.440]   So theoretically, you'll get all of the coverage
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.360]   that T-Mobile Hardy has in somewhere like San Francisco.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.160]   Because the hard part with a lot of these cities
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.680]   is finding places to put transmitters.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.720]   Yeah, because it's a dead sense that T-Mobile and AT&T
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.480]   have not managed to contract from the exact same church tower
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.920]   to rent out the space inside the spire,
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.600]   to put up a couple of antennas.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.600]   So yes, this immediately will add to the saturation
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.840]   of coverage in several cities.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.200]   I don't think that there's any one reason for them
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.120]   to acquire T-Mobile.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.640]   I think it came down to-- here are the five really--
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.960]   and inside that room, there was five good reasons.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.400]   And they decided, well, how much the cost?
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.400]   That little jerk.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.400]   Hey, I got that much on me.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.520]   Let's buy them.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.920]   If anything, there's also the idea of let's buy--
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.640]   if there's any major mobile carrier that's for sale,
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:40.000]   Verizon or AT&T is going to want to buy it just on principle,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.720]   if only to keep those towers and keep those contracts out
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.560]   of the hands of their competitor.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.040]   Right.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.200]   So we'll see how that goes.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.600]   Apple is-- the rumors, the rumor mill,
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.480]   is starting to turn up.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.640]   Now, we're going to skip over all the rumor mills about it.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.400]   Them coming out in September will probably--
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.720]   because that gives it a better chance.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.480]   You just say, ah, it's not coming out in September.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.280]   It gives us a better chance to actually see them in September.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.680]   But it looks like October.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.480]   And they're talking again about this low-cost iCloud phone.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.960]   Andy, do you think that this is--
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.360]   do you think we're going to see an iCloud phone, a phone that
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.600]   is probably has a lot less storage?
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.040]   Yeah, I've read these reports.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.000]   And it's another rumor based on a guest,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.760]   based on something that someone came up with.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.640]   And that's not a really good chain of evidence.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.920]   The idea is that one of the reasons-- the bullet points
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.480]   of the rumor is that internally inside Apple,
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.960]   they started referring to this new super cheap phone
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.920]   as the iCloud phone, because they hit upon the idea
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.880]   that if that RAM costs a lot of money for storage--
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.840]   so what if we simply assume that this phone is going
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.720]   to be used intimately with iCloud?
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.280]   We can just cut that to the bone.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.200]   We can ship like a 2 gigabyte or a 4 gigabyte phone.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.760]   Just basically have-- give it a flash drive
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.440]   for the storage and it'll lean on iCloud for most of its storage.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.160]   That has a couple problems with it.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:00.040]   Number one, being that you can already
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.440]   buy an iPhone for $49.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.840]   And you have to then work out how cheap
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.800]   you'd have to manufacture a phone before you could start
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.600]   giving those things away for free.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.960]   And then you have to ask yourself,
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.920]   what customers are going to be-- will
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.120]   balk at the $49 price and they're waiting for a free phone?
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.200]   The second problem is that iCloud is not--
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.640]   remember that Apple's Google-- excuse me--
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.640]   Apple's cloud idea is not the same as Google's cloud idea.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.040]   Google's cloud idea is that all of your data
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.440]   lives in the cloud permanently 24/7.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.480]   You just use a little thin little client
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.320]   app that accesses them and just slurps down just
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.880]   what you're using right now.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.200]   iCloud is all based on sync, not storage.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.520]   So if you had, let's say, 8 gigabytes
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.480]   where the files that you're syncing between your desktop
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.680]   and your notebooks and your iPad and your phone via iCloud,
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.480]   you're going to need 8 gigs to push them onto all your devices.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.080]   It's not going to be-- it doesn't look like right now.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.040]   It's going to be a situation where
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.800]   you will have the full majesty of a 16 gigabyte iPhone
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.320]   just by virtue of the fact that this thing is connected to iCloud.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.080]   So there are just a lot of failure points, as always,
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.160]   when I'm confronted with a rumor.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.080]   The last thing to say is, who knows?
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.560]   Apple is good at keeping secrets.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.960]   They're also good at changing plans.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.520]   No matter how good a rumor looks like,
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.480]   no matter how good the data is, Apple
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.480]   has been known to change their plans at the last second.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.400]   So there's just no point speculating.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.760]   That said, I don't think that this idea of an iCloud phone
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.800]   makes much sense to me.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.760]   No point speculating.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.600]   That's all the fun of following Apple.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.400]   That's all we do is speculate all day.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.160]   So what do you think?
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.200]   Do you think that an iCloud phone makes sense?
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.800]   And do you think that-- how do you think it would affect the--
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.160]   oh, here's the question.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.840]   If a lot of these rumors are true, what we're looking at
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.400]   is possibly an iPhone with less storage for gigabytes, maybe,
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.600]   or 8 gigabytes.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.200]   Maybe.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.720]   It could be up to 8 gigabytes.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.160]   Those memory cards are a lot cheaper now.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.320]   But the second question is, if Apple releases this
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.520]   with a chip that's going to work on Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&T,
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.520]   Verizon, and they get the price down
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.160]   to a point where it could be freely available,
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.800]   is that how they start coming up with 56
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.400]   million phones being sold on the next quarter, along
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.240]   with the iPhone 5?
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.240]   OK, so to answer the first question,
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.880]   country to what Andy said, I don't think this is a guess.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.480]   We had this story back in February, right
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.880]   after the Wall Street Journal had it.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.080]   And I got it from a really good source that I have,
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.520]   who called it a streaming only iPhone.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.760]   And when we did the story back in February,
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:48.320]   a lot of people brought up the point about how about apps,
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.520]   local app storage.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.680]   How do you load apps under this thing if it's got no memory
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.600]   at all?
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.800]   Streaming media from the cloud is one thing.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.960]   But storing local apps is another.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.240]   Would anyone buy an iPhone that wasn't able to run apps?
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:03.840]   So--
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.880]   We put an awful lot of apps on.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.280]   A lot of these apps are pretty tiny.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.200]   The thing is, you wouldn't need much RAM.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.200]   Because I admit, when I look at my other than applications
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.360]   on my iPhone like TomTom, which is like 2 gigabytes,
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.000]   almost all the media that I put on my--
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.320]   almost all the storage is being used by photos, music,
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.640]   and videos, right?
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.040]   So if you look at the group of my apps,
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.560]   I don't know exactly what it is right now.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.880]   But it's probably not more than two or three gigs.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.000]   Once again, if you take out TomTom, which is really big.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.800]   And I guess photos are now streamed.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.480]   Now it's streamed up to iCloud.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.960]   Media can be streamed from iCloud.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.440]   I guess the local media and the local storage requirements
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.560]   could be fairly low.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.840]   How much it'll save?
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.720]   Back in February when we did the story,
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.440]   we asked if we could save 50% of the hardware costs.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.080]   Now, the question is, so if someone gets something,
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.280]   they saved $49, or they say $99.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.640]   But now they have to buy a more expensive data plan.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.400]   Because they're pulling this stuff off.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.640]   Yeah, but they get the latest greatest iPhone.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.320]   I think one of the bigger problems with the $49 $3.00
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.080]   GS is that it's last year's model.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.120]   And people are very much aware of that.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.160]   These are as much fashion items as they are,
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.800]   sort of practical devices.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.640]   And people don't want to have--
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.480]   kids especially, they don't want to have an old model.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.600]   They want the form factor to be at least the same.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.640]   Yeah, they won't have-- it's embarrassing
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.680]   if you go to high school and you pull out an old--
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.520]   I felt like a 3 GS or even an iPhone 4, which is probably
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.000]   going to be $49 when the iPhone 5 comes out.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.640]   So look what Apple did so successfully with the iPod line.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.040]   I mean, they managed to get a range of devices
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.880]   that fit every pocketbook.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:57.480]   And coming out with a couple or three or four models
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.160]   of the iPhone is not beyond the stretch of imagination.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.720]   The hard thing to figure out though
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.160]   is how exactly they will do that.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.600]   Where will they scrimp?
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.720]   And I guess having smaller memory capacities,
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.360]   less capable cameras, and possibly
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.000]   this idea of a streaming only iPhone that was limited
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   in the amount of photos or media that it can store
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.360]   is one way--
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.520]   is an intriguing way of doing that.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.040]   It's a fascinating room to discuss
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.160]   because there are so many potential problems with it.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.960]   But it's such an interesting idea.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.120]   Andy, do you think we'll see an iPhone 5?
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.400]   Andy hates the speculates, so I love to ask him
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.720]   to throw him into the fire.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.480]   Do you think we'll see the iPhone 5 in October?
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.440]   Do you think that's a more real rumor at the moment?
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:49.560]   Based on what I've seen, I'm going to guess no.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:54.200]   But I'm not being KAG and I'm not saying, well,
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.320]   I don't want to speculate.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.960]   I'm saying that I really could see it going the other way.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.800]   I think that they could do it if they wanted to.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.960]   It really depends on it.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.840]   Do they have something that can put into the product line
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.040]   that makes people feel as though the iPhone is still
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.640]   moving forward?
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.320]   I have heard things that indicate
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.240]   that there's still a focus of real debate as to what
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.920]   sign-- what does an iPhone 5 have to be before they can
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.440]   actually bump it up from the number 4 to the number 5?
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.240]   And when I say there's discussion about the difference
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.640]   between the number 4 and the number 5,
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.120]   I mean there's a discussion between what does it mean
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.040]   when we call something an iPhone 5 as opposed to an iPhone 4G SLQ
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.440]   XT GTO.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.360]   So I really could see it going the other way.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.800]   If I had to vote money on it, I would say we would not
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.400]   see a device called the iPhone 5 in October.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.920]   But I'll put all the people's money on it, but not my own.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.680]   What do you think it's going to be the 4S or some sort of speed?
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.280]   Do you think there's going to be any hardware or it's
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.320]   going to be sort of a lesser upgrade?
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.040]   I think that we're going to see a lesser upgrade.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.560]   It'd be very surprised if 2011 ended without some new iPhone
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.720]   thingy.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.200]   If for no other reason to simply say, well, we took the processor
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.600]   that was in the iPhone 4 and we basically beefed it up.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.920]   We basically made component upgrades.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.960]   We didn't really add new features to it.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.000]   So maybe a megapixel camera, maybe faster processor,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.120]   maybe they would add a little bit more application RAM.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:26.680]   I'm not sure that they would sell whatever they've got as an iPhone
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.000]   5, though.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.120]   All right, so we'll see how that turns out.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.680]   We're going to tie this all up with Android's versus iPhones
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.200]   as far as the users go next.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.520]   But before we get to that, of course,
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.320]   we want to stop for our--
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.880]   to thank one of our sponsors, GoToMeeting.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.320]   And of course, GoToMeeting Macbreak Weekly is brought to you
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.160]   by GoToMeeting.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.600]   And GoToMeeting is from Citrix.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.560]   And now you can get GoToMeeting with HD faces.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.000]   And so we use--
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.720]   I know that Twit uses it in Pixelcore.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.480]   It uses GoToMeeting all the time.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.840]   We have tons of meetings, trainings, all of those things,
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.760]   or stuff that we use constantly.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.640]   We use GoToMeeting for.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:07.360]   And I got to say, this is we have tried almost all the options
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.920]   of how to do these kind of meetings.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.880]   And as is something that's a turn key that you can just turn it on
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.840]   and make it work, GoToMeeting really sets the gold standard.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.680]   And here you can see on the video here,
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.440]   you can see the HD faces.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.160]   It really changes it when you can actually--
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.680]   we go through a lot of trouble with the Pixelcore
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.120]   to make sure that you can actually see video combined with screens
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.120]   and everything else.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.000]   And now you can just flip open your webcam
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.280]   and go face to face with anyone.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.280]   So you can talk to anyone.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.840]   You can talk to a group of people.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.000]   And you can still be looking at your PowerPoint presentation,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.080]   or your product demo, or your sales presentation,
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.360]   or training sessions.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.920]   And it really makes a difference.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.640]   Looking at a screen, especially when you have a lot to say,
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.120]   and you're just sitting there talking,
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.600]   everyone's just kind of staring at your screen.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.840]   And they really don't have that connection
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.080]   that you have when you are looking face to face.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.040]   And so now with HD faces, of course, you can do that.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.480]   And so it really makes a massive difference
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.040]   in the quality of the call.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.240]   And you're getting great quality.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.480]   You can use IP-- one of the things you can do is use VoIP,
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.000]   which is not available on all the solutions.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.280]   And really solid VoIP.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.320]   I mean, the sound quality is very, very good.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.080]   As I said, we use this a lot.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.840]   And so the thing is that this really will change how often
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.840]   you decide you have to get everybody into the same room,
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.240]   which means driving.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.280]   It could mean flying.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.040]   It could be boats.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.040]   I don't know if you can use boats that often.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.640]   But anyway, so the GoToMeeting with HD faces, Mac or PC,
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.360]   you can go to meeting actually runs on the iPad as well.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.320]   I'm not sure if the HD faces works on the iPad.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.200]   I haven't tried that yet.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.480]   So anyway, but it's a really great solution.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.640]   And you can get a 30-day trial for free.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.880]   All you have to do is use the offer code Mac break.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.040]   So go to gotomeeting.com, use the offer code Mac break,
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.040]   and try it for 30 days for free.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:56.200]   And you can try it with product reviews, sales presentations,
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.720]   training sessions, weekly status meetings.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.800]   And just give it a shot.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.240]   Push it around and see how it works for you.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:08.600]   It's really changed our business at the PIX score.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.120]   So I know that you use it all the time.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.920]   You see them doing the sessions here as well.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.360]   So check it out.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.680]   Go to meeting.com and use the offer code Mac break.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.280]   All right, Android versus iPhone.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.320]   And now we're not talking about the actual phones.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.640]   We're talking about the users.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.720]   It turns out that there was a little bit of work done here,
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.720]   a little some research.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:36.440]   And it turns out-- there's a lot of things.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.880]   And who actually did this?
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.560]   This was put together--
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.320]   This was put out for--
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.200]   do we have that?
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.280]   I'm looking at a tech crunch.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.920]   This is on tech crunch here.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.160]   And for some reason, I dropped out here.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.480]   But this was-- basically, they put out a questionnaire--
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.480]   hunch data report-- or hunch data.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.920]   I put this out and asked a lot of questions.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.640]   Now, one thing is this is not randomly controlled.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:07.200]   So this was not something that was done by Gallup polls.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.080]   This was people who responded.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.800]   But they had 15,000 responses.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.080]   And at that point, you start to get within a fairly accurate
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:14.880]   view of the process.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.800]   So here's some of the core demographics.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.480]   Android-- 10% more likely to be men.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.240]   iPhone-- 18% more likely to be women.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.360]   17% of Android users are more likely to live in the suburbs.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:30.480]   86% are more likely to live in the country.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.480]   27% of iPhone--
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.880]   iPhone users are 27% more likely to live in the city,
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.560]   that kind of thing.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.760]   So it's a breakdown of all these pieces.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.920]   Andy, what does this mean?
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.120]   Does it mean anything?
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.720]   Well, it means that the next time we
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.200]   get into a really stupid and pointless and futile flame
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.080]   war between Android and iPhone, we can say--
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.360]   Oh, I'd expect you from--
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.520]   I'd expect you to--
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.080]   someone who's not as much of an extrovert as I am.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.320]   And that's one of the things that came up.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:30:59.760]   Android--
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.720]   I love it for a set higher verbal app.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.160]   Most likely have a higher verbal app.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.640]   It has cut your app to ribbons.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.440]   Android users are slightly more likely to be pessimists.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.600]   iPhone users are slightly more likely to be optimists.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.120]   The funny thing is that, that, of course, makes the headlines.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.040]   But you'll notice that they didn't put a percentage next to it,
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.840]   which means that it was probably within any kind
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.600]   of margin of error.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.480]   So the thing that actually got the most press,
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.000]   they didn't bother to put any percentages on because it was
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.040]   probably so close that it wasn't worth talking about.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.440]   So does this--
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.280]   Leander, here's the question.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:39.280]   One of the things about this is that it shows that,
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.480]   by a more significant margin, Android users are more likely
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:47.760]   to prefer saving their money while iPhone users are more likely
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.240]   to much more likely to spend their money.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:54.120]   Does this affect how developers experience
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.120]   the different marketplaces?
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.040]   I imagine so.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:03.200]   Yeah, I think developers love iOS because iOS users spend
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.760]   a lot of money on apps.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.240]   Right.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.880]   Android users don't.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.080]   I remember seeing another survey about that before.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.720]   There's not a big marketplace for iOS apps.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.360]   I'm sorry, Android apps.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.440]   So yeah, definitely.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.560]   I think Android users-- two things tend to come up.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.840]   I've seen over and over again.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.520]   One is that a lot of people are stuck in contracts
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.840]   with their cell providers.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.600]   And so they go with the best smartphone that their carrier
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.120]   provides.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.400]   And there's a lot more choice on the Android platform.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.960]   There is a lot more opportunities on the Android platform
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.480]   there on the iOS platform.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.560]   And secondly, I know that the one big difference that I see
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.720]   over and over again is that Android users tend to be Android
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.040]   users because they hate Apple or Steve Jobs, especially
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.560]   the sort of control for its tendencies
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.280]   that the company exhibits.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.320]   And they want to be-- they would like sort of the PC users
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.760]   of old, the Windows users.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.880]   And they want to be able to get under the hood and tinker.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.200]   And they want to be able to unlock their device
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.200]   and customize it in all kinds of crazy ways
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.840]   that would give Steve Jobs a fit.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.800]   It's this sort of perceived lack of freedom
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.880]   that they get on the iOS that drives into Android.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.920]   So they're not choosing Android because they'd like it.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.920]   They're choosing it because it's not an iPhone or an iOS.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.080]   People like their Android.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.000]   I mean, Leo loves his Android.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.240]   I don't think he--
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.080]   I think he's primarily really an Android user.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.680]   Andy, do you think that-- do you think that the phone causes
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.040]   this?
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.440]   Do you think that the phone is actually
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.440]   making people more pessimistic or optimistic?
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:41.520]   No, I think that an Android phone would teach patients.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:47.240]   It would teach you to be more of a Calvinist approach to life
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.360]   about how mankind is born to accept it
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.120]   because this really is a smart display upward.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.240]   They would promote the book of Job's, that sort of thing.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.640]   So I expect them to be more classical scholars.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:01.000]   But really, if I am to put one tag on all this research,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.280]   and this might be just me molding the numbers
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:08.040]   to fit something else that I think is more relevant and true,
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.680]   I think that the defining characteristic of an Android user,
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.840]   if you look at the entire body of users,
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.400]   you're talking about someone who walked into a store
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.440]   to buy a phone and went out with a phone.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.400]   These are not people who are passionate about the phone
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.800]   that they put into their pocket.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.280]   And that's not a bad thing.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.480]   I think that most people who buy an iPhone specifically
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.880]   sought out an iPhone, and they have a bunch of reasons,
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.040]   and specifically why they went for that,
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.160]   whereas the people who went for an Android phone,
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.560]   they've had the flip phone for,
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.720]   and they've been off contract for four or five years,
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.720]   and they go back, they're not terribly interested
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.400]   in changing carriers, so they go into
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.480]   whatever phone stores for their carrier,
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.520]   they look at a bunch of phones,
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.120]   and they walk out with one that seems attractive enough,
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.680]   seems to look the way that it wants it to look,
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.360]   and is available at the price they want to spend.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.800]   So I think that the majority of Android users,
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:04.040]   you can't really, Android's biggest advantage
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.880]   in the marketplace is simply the fact that
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.080]   there are so many companies making them
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.880]   in so many shapes and sizes.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.720]   And so many people walk out only because they're saying,
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.640]   "I need a keyboard," or they walk out of the Apple Store
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.840]   because they need a keyboard,
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.040]   they walk out of the Apple Store because,
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.320]   "Oh, I really want that high-speed 4G,
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.600]   "I've got that little dongle on my laptop
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.920]   "that works really, really great,
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.600]   "and I want a 4G phone."
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.640]   - Well, and I have to admit, I'm excited,
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.920]   I'm about to become an Android user.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.600]   I'm not gonna get rid of my iPhone,
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.160]   but I feel like I do need to play with an Android.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.120]   And I'm just waiting for the 2S to,
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:40.720]   Eileen says that the 2S is the one worth waiting for.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:41.560]   - I love that phone.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.280]   - Yeah, yeah, so I'm waiting for that one to come out
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.840]   with Verizon in another couple of weeks, hopefully.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.520]   And so anyway, so, but my thing is,
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.120]   is that I'm really excited about having to be
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.920]   a little bit more open, I can experiment with it.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.400]   It's gonna be my little phone that I get to play with
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.760]   and expand with and everything else.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.520]   And so I can definitely see people being into that,
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.120]   the ability to do a lot more and have a lot more freedom
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.120]   of how they use the phone than what they,
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.040]   what you have with an iPhone.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.800]   But I do, as a app developer,
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.280]   I, we're talking, we're working on a lot of mobile apps
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.320]   right now, or right now we're in the design phase,
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:18.680]   but we're not, the Android world just seems kind of scary.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.520]   (laughs)
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.520]   You know, I feel like there's a lot of people
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.200]   that aren't gonna necessarily buy it,
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.320]   and there's gonna be a whole bunch of different versions
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.160]   that we're gonna have to,
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.320]   we have to think about the different phones
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.080]   and how they're all gonna interact and everything else.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.800]   And so when I see stuff like this,
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.800]   the, you know, this report,
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.760]   that's the only thing that I think
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.840]   from a developer's perspective I get worried about.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.680]   I think I think more than that.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.520]   Go ahead.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.720]   - Just give it a year and you'll develop it
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.800]   from all the world exclusively, so.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.680]   (laughs)
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.520]   - And that might be something that would simplify things.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.000]   So we'll see how that goes.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.480]   Anyway, that's, I think we've taken that story as far
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.320]   as it needs to go.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.640]   (engine revving)
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.320]   - Somebody's gonna have a truck.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.160]   - Is that?
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:56.840]   - That, that, E, oh, okay.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.680]   - I think that was the center.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.040]   - So that made my truck.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:36:59.880]   - Yeah.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.720]   - That's the truck.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.680]   - It's so loud, I could even hear what you guys are saying.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:03.680]   - So by the way, this is a,
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.680]   - That's what they were about.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.720]   - We're about to find out exactly what Leo had to do
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.320]   to get that building passed code in time for the launch date.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.160]   - Right, right.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.440]   (laughs)
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.680]   - So don't take, don't screw that light bulb.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.320]   That's a structural light bulb.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.960]   - So, so in the software development phase,
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.000]   now that, Leander, this isn't actually in the Google Notes.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.040]   This is something that kind of stirred up this morning.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.520]   So on one of my, one of the other shows that,
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.840]   that we've had a twin, this week of media,
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.120]   Lon Seidman has been on a lot.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.960]   And on LonSeidman.com, there is a,
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.680]   something you posted about Visual Hub.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.680]   So a lot of us love Visual Hub.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.440]   We, it was, it was for a long time,
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.520]   the ultimate conversion tool.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:43.840]   And, and one of the things that Lon posted was,
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.000]   Kaji was, is a, you know, of course,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.560]   that's who sold Visual Hub for,
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.440]   for a long time for the developer, Tyler Lock.
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.640]   And, and so what they started posting,
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.960]   and this is after Line came out,
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.480]   there's a bit of an install process
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.440]   that's required to get, to get Visual Hub.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.360]   There's an updater that gets it working in Line.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.400]   Kaji, Kaji of course has all these customers,
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.840]   and they decided that they were gonna build a,
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:12.600]   you can get it for free.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.640]   You can get the update, you can get the update
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.440]   and install it, but it's a little bit geeky.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.680]   To install it at the upgrade for free.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.760]   You can just go to Tyler's website
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.880]   to the Visual Hub website.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.440]   But Kaji started selling an updater for $4.99.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.240]   They went through the process of making a little easier.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.440]   It is not selling Visual Hub.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.800]   They're actually selling an updater for Visual Hub.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.400]   And anyway, so there's a little bit of Bruha Ha.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.720]   This is a, you know,
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.840]   they were, you know, Tyler Lock said,
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.960]   you know, put a big thing on his, on his websites
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.920]   that TechSpansion is not affiliated with the product
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.400]   VHubUpdater by Kaji.
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:55.280]   VHubUpdater makes unauthorized use of our copy written code.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.840]   We do not support VHubUpdater
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.600]   and we do not recommend its use.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.960]   We did not consent to Kaji's use
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.360]   of our customers contact information for VHubUpdater.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:08.680]   Our official and free patch for Line is our below.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.840]   So that's what they have on their site.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.280]   Now we did contact Kaji.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.800]   So we, and we did get a response from the CEO.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:20.480]   So it's not that we, you know, we, so that's one side of it.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.200]   The other side is that, you know,
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.320]   from Key Nethery, who is the CEO,
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.720]   basically said that Kaji sold Visual Hub
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.640]   to many, many people.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.120]   And because they sold it to them,
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.760]   they've been getting, of course, many calls.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.560]   People upgrade to Line, Visual Hub doesn't work.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.640]   They're trying, and they're trying to deal
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.480]   with customer service on their end.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:43.480]   VHubUpdater, they initially directed people
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.560]   to Tyler's website.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:49.000]   But the update was a little bit more complicated for everyone.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.840]   And Tyler's not really, I mean, he's not, according to them,
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.240]   not really doing a lot of support.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.480]   Of course, he discontinued the product.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.000]   So you'll have that.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Visual Hub is a program that puts a GUI wrapper
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.120]   around open source software, FFMPG.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.800]   Now that is not copy written.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.120]   So VHubUpdater is a program that puts the GUI around,
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.720]   that puts the GUI around the process of downloading
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:12.720]   and updating existing working copies of Visual Hub.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.840]   So they're updating it and making that all work
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.680]   and making it easy.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.520]   Basically, there's code to be written,
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.640]   and I haven't tried it, so I don't know.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:25.640]   And they, and there was, as far as recommending people
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:29.400]   download it from Textpansion,
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:33.360]   the CEO here, Neat Key, said,
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.000]   I agree with this advice and certainly passed it
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.240]   onto line users that have contacted us.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.360]   But what we found was, is that it was too techy for them
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.680]   and was beyond their comfort level.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.200]   So they basically built something,
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.120]   the idea is just make it easier.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.160]   And they're charging a little bit of money, $4.99,
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.160]   to not have to think about it,
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.880]   that you can simply make that work.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.680]   Andy, do you, I'm just kind of reading through that
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.400]   to kind of set the pace.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.480]   Andy, does this make sense to you?
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:57.120]   Does this, does this, does this read true?
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.880]   Do you think that Kaji is a step,
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.880]   and this is an important issue because this is a company
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.520]   that sells a lot of software for a lot
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.640]   of independent developers.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.520]   Have they stepped over the line?
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.120]   Boy, that's hard to, it's a hard call to make.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:13.120]   They step over the line, if they broke into this guy's code,
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.240]   fix something and then try to sell something
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.240]   that was under that guy's product name.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:24.400]   However, Kaji, they sent us a couple of--
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.800]   Well, they've been, Kaji's been pretty cagey too,
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.440]   'cause they're not calling it, they're calling it,
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.960]   Veehav Updier.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.800]   Yeah, and so I've had very little time
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.680]   to really tear this apart.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.640]   The story that they're offering is that,
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.120]   like many video apps that you find that are free,
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:44.320]   it's actually a GUI, a wrapper around certain open source
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.720]   conversion utilities.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.920]   And so their statement is that we didn't
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   decompile this, create a patch for it, and then recompile it.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.320]   We simply took the free piece of code.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:57.680]   We simply created a tool that will open up the bundle,
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:01.040]   replace the open source code with the new open source code
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.000]   that makes it work and patches it again,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.080]   essentially automating the process that the developer
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:10.440]   is suggesting for making this app line compatible.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:14.440]   And they've also stated that they've chose the price point
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.560]   because that's about the breakeven price point
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.400]   to cover them for all the customer service calls
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.480]   that they're getting about this two year old
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.720]   unsupported product.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.440]   Now, there are a couple of other dimensions to this.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.200]   Number one is that you have to keep in mind
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:32.320]   that the developer had the right to stop producing this product.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.920]   That said, it wasn't a warning, it wasn't a,
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:39.600]   oh, and you've got four months for the support before we'll
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.280]   turn off a faucet.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:45.800]   It was on a Tuesday, you could go to the site,
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.400]   you could download the product, you could buy it
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.200]   and get support.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.040]   On the next day, you hit the same site, you saw a page saying,
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.600]   sorry, I'm done, goodbye.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.440]   No, you can't redial it.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.360]   Goodbye.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:54.720]   What?
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.520]   Excuse me?
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.240]   So on that basis, it's easy to imagine why
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:02.200]   colleagues' customers feel as though they're kind of minused
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.120]   by this whole action.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.440]   That said, though, I think the bottom line
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.480]   is that they're not--
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:10.320]   Coggy has now asserted that they are Coggy's customers
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.880]   and not the original developers.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.160]   And that's the point at which I think they fail.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:18.000]   I think that sadly, their best response to all these customer
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.920]   support things is, sorry, the developer is not updating it,
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.800]   they're not fixing it, it's not our responsibility.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.040]   Here's an email address where if you
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.240]   want to pest her with complaints, pest her with complaints,
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.680]   but it's not our job to develop a tool that will keep
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.600]   this other piece of software.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.880]   So they're the lander.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:38.960]   They are the best buy for this software.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.320]   They say, we can't go back.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:41.760]   Oh, OK.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.000]   That's prejudicing the jury here.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   That's why.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.160]   But they're the storefront.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.600]   They're just saying, we're the storefront.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.000]   I mean, you're saying that what probably
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.520]   was the most appropriate thing to say is, we're the storefront.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.040]   We can't go back there and retool that for you.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.040]   Right.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.360]   I don't think they're doing anything mean.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.960]   I think they said, well, look, it's easy for us
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.440]   to create this tool.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.760]   We can-- we're already--
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.600]   we already have-- given that their whole business is just
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.480]   dealing with customers, they think in terms
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.560]   of how much it costs to service each customer.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.000]   It doesn't seem evil that their instinct was
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.600]   to charge money for it.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.000]   I think that category--
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.680]   I tend to believe that their instincts were OK.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.440]   But had they thought this through another few steps,
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.640]   they would have said that we can't set the policy that we're
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.040]   going to be responsible for maintaining software
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.160]   that the original developer has walked away from.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.040]   Lander, do you think that they should have made sure
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.400]   that they got the approval from the developer
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:40.880]   before they--
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:41.560]   Well, yeah.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.080]   I guess that's the big question I had.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.560]   Did they seek that before they went ahead and made this tool?
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.520]   It sounds to me like they were doing their customers a favor.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:53.120]   And if they try to get hold of the guy beforehand,
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.760]   I would say there was no harm or foul.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:58.560]   But of course, he's calling foul now.
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.560]   So I don't know.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.240]   Did they just go ahead and do it without trying
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.680]   to contact the developer?
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.920]   Or did they try to call that a developer
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:05.920]   and they didn't get a response?
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.320]   And then they went ahead and did it.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.160]   I mean, if that was the case, then I
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.800]   think it sounds like they were doing their customers a big flavor.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.600]   Or trying to do their customers a big flavor.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.240]   Right.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.160]   I just saw the fact that the more you think about this
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.880]   and the more you talk about it, the more interesting it gets.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.960]   Because there's another component to this,
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.960]   which is after I purchase a piece of software,
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.160]   who is the owner of that software?
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.360]   If I've bought this software, don't
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.240]   I have the ability to then do whatever I want with it?
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.280]   And if someone wants to sell me a tool
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.680]   to make this work with a new operating system,
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.720]   which will add a feature to it, shouldn't I
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.400]   be pleased and grateful that this person, as long as he's
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:44.200]   not reusing code that was owned and copyrighted
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.320]   by another developer, shouldn't that person
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.560]   be able to sell me that?
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.440]   I mean, if I go to my car outside,
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.920]   I don't have to necessarily go to Chrysler
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:55.000]   to get this five or six 10-year-old car fixed
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.680]   or have a new radio installed.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:57.520]   It's my car.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.640]   And if someone wants to get sell me a new Bluetooth radio
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.720]   for this car that has not been sold for nearly 10 years,
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:06.040]   then that should be my right as a consumer.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.440]   And the other person's right as a person who
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.160]   wants to sell things to consumers.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.560]   And the one thing to say is that they're cracking.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.000]   They're changing a couple resources.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.560]   I mean, they're changing a couple resources
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.040]   in the script file.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.600]   This is the process.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:23.800]   It's right-click on Visual Hub and select show package contents.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:29.360]   Replace three included script files that they posted.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.760]   This is on the text expansion site.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.200]   @visualhub.app/content/resources/scripts.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.920]   Replace the originals when we're prompted.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.640]   Enjoy Visual Hub for a little while longer.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.760]   So basically what you're doing is
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.600]   you're right-clicking on them, opening up the package
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.480]   contents, which many people have not--
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.040]   I mean, I do that all the time.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:52.920]   But many people have not opened up the show package contents
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.480]   before.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.480]   And this is just a little backup for those of you listening.
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.120]   If you haven't opened up the package contents, the app--
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:46:59.760]   It's really cool.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.320]   You should do that.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.400]   You should totally do that.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.240]   It's fun.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.000]   Well, especially if you're doing presentations
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.240]   where you have to show big icons of like Final Cut
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.560]   or Motion or whatever.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.360]   So the giant 512 versions of the icons
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.920]   are hidden in the package contents.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.400]   And you grab them.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.240]   You pull them out.
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:14.200]   They even have off channels.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:19.760]   Anyway, so the point is that if you show package contents,
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.160]   there's a whole bunch of resources in there.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.080]   Some of them are useful.
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.600]   Some of them are not useful.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.520]   But you can open that up.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.720]   And everything that you think of as an application
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:32.160]   on the computer, on a Mac, is essentially
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:35.720]   a folder with a .app on it.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.320]   And so basically, and that tells it, OK, I'm going to make
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.600]   this a--
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:40.880]   I'm going to package this up.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:41.720]   That's the package.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.080]   And so you have to right-click on it.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:43.640]   You open it up.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.480]   And then you go into this folder.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.280]   And you just grab the scripts, drop them onto that folder,
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.440]   save replace.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.600]   And it should work.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.720]   I mean, he's made the kind of the update there.
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.760]   So what they're doing is saying--
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.320]   if you download-- I mean, they're just saying,
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.480]   we downloaded his pieces there.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.160]   We're right-clicking on the-- I mean, basically,
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:05.560]   we're just doing what you would do here by you simply open it up.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.800]   And there's a lot of developers that
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.040]   do that for their own software, where they just simply update
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.400]   something for you with existing code.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.240]   So they're not changing any code per se.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.560]   What they're doing is building an updater that simply
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.720]   automates that process.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.480]   And it's also important to note that you still
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:24.880]   need to have already a working paid up copy of this product.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:27.120]   They will not reach-- because, again, this product does not
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:27.480]   exist.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.200]   You cannot download or purchase from Coggy or anybody else
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.000]   right now.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.240]   They're saying if you have an existing working copy of it,
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.680]   this script will patch it so that it will work.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.040]   So it's not as though they've got a old binary out, recompiled
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:43.280]   it, and are now reselling this app.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:43.760]   Right.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.760]   So they're not really essentially changing--
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.960]   not changing the actual core code of the app.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.640]   They're not hacking it in any way.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.560]   They're simply automating the process of moving the files
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.200]   from one place together, because there are some people
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.680]   who are not--
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:58.040]   I mean, it's a pretty simple process to update it.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.760]   I have to admit, when I first saw the news,
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.080]   I was expecting to see you have to open up a shell
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.760]   and type in some stuff and everything else.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.640]   But I can see how some people who haven't done that before
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.520]   would find that complicated.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:12.320]   So we'll see if this blows over or not by next week.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.840]   Have you guys seen the new pictures
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.440]   from the Apple Cupertino campus?
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.160]   Looks awesome.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.600]   It's like-- I don't know.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.000]   It's like a Mac for office buildings.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.240]   I mean, it's just so shiny.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.640]   I don't really have any questions about it.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.200]   I don't have any statements about it,
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.680]   other than if anyone from Apple is listening,
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:36.160]   I just really want to invite--
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.960]   you didn't even have to be for the grand opening.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.480]   I just want someone to have me there for lunch.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:43.640]   I'll tell you one thing, that if anybody
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.040]   was working in a cubicle or an office at Apple,
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:48.320]   and they were having like pantsless Thursdays,
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.000]   that's going to end real soon.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.920]   I'm telling you, you're going to get--
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.640]   see a WGHT.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.520]   I mean, it makes a big difference.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.800]   I mean, it's not that the Apple campus now.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.880]   I mean, I think all of us have been there a couple times.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:02.800]   But it's not that the Apple campus is particularly bad now.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.240]   But this is definitely-- the more you
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.000]   see the pictures and the layout and everything else,
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.640]   the more you just feel like you're just
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.480]   going to get to work and you just be like, wow, I work here.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.800]   But when I would love to see--
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.840]   and I've never seen in all these pictures and all these plans,
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.600]   I would love to see a view of what it will be like to be
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.960]   on the highway or to be on outer roads and drive past this
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.800]   on a daily basis.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:28.640]   It's a lot of accidents.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.960]   Rubber-necking accidents.
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:34.880]   Well, I mean that when all of us saw that video of Steve Jobs
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.880]   at the planning meeting, walking through what they're doing.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.680]   And you notice, of course, that all the industrial parts of it,
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.440]   all the generators, the plants, they're
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.840]   not in the middle of that--
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.640]   they're not in the middle of that ring.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.360]   They're way, way out on the side by the highway.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:52.280]   And I'm wondering if I lived in that area,
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.800]   or if I lived in one of the communities,
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.640]   I had to drive past this every single day,
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:56.760]   what will I get to see?
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.560]   Will I get to see a sheer wall of really stupid basic concrete?
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:03.120]   Are they going to do some sort of frontage landscaping
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:04.440]   so that it looks pretty?
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:09.400]   Or am I going to be walking past a big tower of smokestacks
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.320]   belching out rainbow colored smoke
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.640]   amongst the carcasses of dead birds?
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.920]   Well, all I know is that I want to be
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:18.840]   able to enjoy lunch there.
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:23.960]   But what I really want is that when, eventually, by 2020,
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:27.600]   they decide that the earth is no longer inhabitable.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.520]   And they've decided to launch this into space
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:33.280]   and form a space station, which this is what I think
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:36.160]   is Apple's true core belief.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.360]   I think they're actually going to build rocket engines
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:39.680]   below this end.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.080]   I'm doing it.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:41.760]   You're close.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.480]   What that is is actually a docking collar
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.840]   for the larger ship that's going to land and then tow Earth
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:48.600]   to safe space.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:52.240]   We've often thought that the Macintosh and the iPhone
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.840]   are somewhat otherworldly.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.560]   It turns out that they've been--
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.880]   Steve Jobs is just an alien.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.800]   He's just been here trying to get everybody ready
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.840]   so that they can actually have the whole thing lock in
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.400]   and take over.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.320]   Either that's the sync port.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:12.280]   I'll just do a backup onto another device, replace the Earth,
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:14.280]   and then restore backup.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:14.800]   Exactly so.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:17.840]   Anyway, so groundbreaking, I guess, is happening next year.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.240]   Yeah, let's-- again, remember that this whole news story--
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.320]   oh, isn't it nice that people at Apple
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.880]   have a really lovely place to work
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.560]   that we won't ever be allowed to go into or play?
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:31.000]   Honestly, I mean, when I saw the video,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.760]   I could imagine myself as part of that planning committee
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:38.000]   saying, OK, you're planning trees.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:38.680]   That's lovely.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:40.160]   You're tearing down ugly buildings.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.360]   That's great.
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:45.040]   What do people who don't work at Apple get out of this?
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:48.000]   Is there a path in any part of this property
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.760]   that people can walk through and enjoy your trees?
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:52.800]   Or not that's not lovely to get all that tax revenue,
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.200]   but it's--
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.440]   That's a lot of time.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:59.960]   How happy we're supposed to be that your 10,000 employees
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.520]   get an exercise yard with four tetherball cords.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:07.080]   Well, I do have to say, though, that Steve Jobs, I think,
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.400]   was very quiet.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.880]   But the whole, what do you have for us
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.280]   during the Cupertino meeting?
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.720]   And he's like, well, it was basically
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.600]   the underlying thing is basically, we have a great campus
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.680]   we want to put somewhere.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:23.280]   We could put it here, or we could put it somewhere else.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.160]   And people don't think that he doesn't have a great sense
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.160]   of humor.
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:28.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:32.160]   Someone Mecley said, well, do we give us free Wi-Fi?
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.640]   And Steve smiled and said, well, we
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.400]   think that we already contribute to the community
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.960]   by giving you lots and lots and lots of tax money.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:41.680]   If you'd like, we'll keep the tax money
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.760]   and gladly buy you free Wi-Fi.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.400]   Or you could use part of our tax money
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.320]   and put your own damn Wi-Fi.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.280]   And of course, in the back of his head,
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.640]   is just like, what are you talking about?
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:54.480]   And then there's a lot of expletives and a lot of yelling.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.320]   Note to self have that one killed.
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:04.440]   So, so any councilman Sugarman, please enjoy this wine.
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.440]   Can I pour myself my own goblet?
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:07.600]   We will drink together.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.080]   I'm going back and I'm going to find out if we can fire her.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:13.520]   So, of course, she said that was all in good fun.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.600]   So, anyway, so very much looking forward to that.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.520]   I'm hoping that they're going to do some big open house.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:19.720]   And I know that we won't be invited.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:22.000]   But I just like to know that it's actually happening.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.160]   It's like there's been a lot of park land there on that space.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.200]   It'll be interesting to see.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.560]   Yeah, I mean, it's great to be able to stretch out a little bit.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:32.400]   I mean, that's always the challenge in any of these huge areas
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.600]   is just what are you going to do at lunch?
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.120]   Right.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.080]   And there's not a lot in Cupertino.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:39.080]   No.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.080]   I think--
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.600]   I think there's a Starbucks in here across the street.
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.600]   There is a Starbucks.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:44.120]   Well, there's a Starbucks.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.120]   It's not really across the street.
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:46.040]   It's kind of down the street.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:46.040]   But--
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.040]   Well, where that one is.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.840]   Isn't that like some strip mall across the way?
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.840]   Yeah, there's a strip mall a little ways down.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.480]   That is the Starbucks that I always end up in.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.840]   Because you never want to be late.
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:54.880]   I never want to be late at Apple.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.360]   So I get to the Starbucks and then I go back to work.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.480]   And then I make sure that I'm on time.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:02.200]   So, anyway, so I'll say if I were an Apple employee,
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.320]   I'd be really, really pissed off that with all that money
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.280]   that the company has in cash, we're not getting
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:09.000]   a set of Futurama-style tubes.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.520]   And now you're at the Starbucks store.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.240]   No.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.080]   So we'll see how that goes.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.240]   And hopefully we'll see some more photos.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.720]   And I'm sure that there'll be lots of spy cameras.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:21.160]   I take you pictures of the groundbreaking
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:24.160]   and putting the rocket engines into the ground.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:29.800]   And/or looking for the giant--
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:34.960]   I think that the Firewire 800 just is like a miniature test.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.960]   So I think we're just going to see
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:38.000]   a giant one right in the middle that's kind of hidden.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.480]   So you just kind of push the trees away
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:42.040]   and then just lock the whole thing in.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.200]   So coming up next, we've got--
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:47.200]   porn finally makes it to the iPhone, at least for a little while.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.800]   So we'll talk about that.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.960]   But first, I'm only catching up to the Android.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:56.800]   Another feature stolen from the Android, exactly.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.360]   But before we do that, we want to thank
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:02.040]   our sponsors FreshBooks.
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.800]   MacBrick is brought to you by FreshBooks.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:06.640]   And if you're a business owner, this
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.480]   is the thing that just--
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.480]   when I got started doing my own freelance,
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.920]   this is something that just killed me, which was--
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.240]   I was fine doing the actual work.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.320]   It was easy to get the stuff done, not easy.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:19.160]   But it was simple enough.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:19.920]   The work came in.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:23.720]   I did the work dealing with all of the billing.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:26.320]   I think there's still invoices that I never got paid for
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:29.200]   because I didn't actually create an invoice for it.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.280]   FreshBooks gets this all out of your way.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:34.320]   So basically, you can quickly and easily create your own
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.680]   professional looking invoices.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.360]   Because part of what held me up was that I didn't want to have--
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.960]   this is before FreshBooks existed, but I didn't want to
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:43.720]   have a dorky looking--
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:46.160]   I'm a visual artist, and I don't have time to actually work
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:48.840]   on my invoices.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.040]   And so I didn't have a chance to really make it look nice.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.800]   And then I was like, oh, I'll get around to it, and I'll make
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:53.600]   it nice.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.760]   I'm going to create my own station area, and I never did.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:56.800]   Well, they make it easy.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.320]   You can upload your logo and just have it appear on your
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.080]   invoice, have it look nice and clean.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:04.400]   Your clients can just simply download a PDF of it.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.400]   So you can just send it to them.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:08.480]   They can even-- you have a bunch of different payment
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:09.000]   services.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.360]   So they can use PayPal.
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:13.960]   They can use a web and other electronic payment services,
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.080]   credit card.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.040]   So those are all options of stuff that you can have them
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:18.800]   do right there.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.480]   So they don't even have to send you a check.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.080]   Of course, they can.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:24.840]   And if they don't, you can actually have an automated
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:26.040]   late payment reminder.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.400]   So you don't even have to do it.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.120]   It's not personal.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.080]   It's just business.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.840]   You can have the little machine, send them a little thing
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:32.360]   that says you're late.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:37.360]   And anyway, so because a lot of times, we, as geeks, don't
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:40.200]   want to have that uncomfortable conversation, well,
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:42.200]   just let fresh books do it for you.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.960]   And you can also invoice by the hour.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.320]   So if you can do time tracking and then have those logged
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:50.240]   hours consolidated into your time sheets so that you can
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.480]   invoice instantly, you don't have to go back and try to
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:53.960]   figure it all out.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.960]   And you can definitely send-- you can email, of course, PDF.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.680]   You can have them also send physical invoices.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:01.800]   They're like a Buck 39 per invoice to do that.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:03.800]   Unless, if you get in bulk.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.080]   And so anyway, you can also, of course, use--
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.720]   there's an iPhone app to track your time and then invoice
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:11.400]   from your iPhone, which is crazy cool.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:14.400]   So anyway, they have over 2 million users already.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:17.000]   So this is something that has been around for quite some time.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.400]   It's a solid way to put this stuff together.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:23.000]   And it just is much easier to try to sort this out.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.280]   I would highly suggest it.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:28.480]   Now you can get it for free and have up to three customers.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.560]   And I have to say, I think for the first five years that I
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:35.200]   was doing freelance, I had three customers or less.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.840]   So they were good customers.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.160]   But I didn't have it.
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.600]   So you can get started with fresh books for free.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.480]   Now if you want to have up to 25 clients, you're going to
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.240]   pay 20 bucks a month.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:49.520]   But go to freshbooks.com and sign up today.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:52.200]   And one thing to remember is, of course, whether it's your
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:55.160]   birthday or not, you can win a birthday cake.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:59:00.560]   So every day-- sorry, every week, they're giving away a
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:02.520]   birthday cake to someone in the audience.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:05.080]   And so it doesn't have to be your birthday to win.
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:08.600]   All you have to do is say you heard about it here on Mac
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:08.880]   Break.
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.160]   So tell them you heard about it on Mac Break.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:14.480]   And you'll go into the drawing to win a birthday cake.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.520]   One of our-- one of the guys that freelancers for us
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.040]   actually won the birthday cake.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.280]   And they're pretty good.
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:22.600]   In this case, you're wondering, they're kind of tasty.
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:24.040]   I think just about everybody in the office had it.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.880]   He brought it in because he didn't want to gain that much
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:27.160]   weight.
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:29.320]   And it was pretty tasty.
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:30.400]   So definitely check it out.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.560]   Tell them you heard about us on Mac Break.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.560]   You heard about Fresh Books on Mac Break.
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:36.560]   And you'll be up for the drawing.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:40.640]   So porn, iPhone.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.600]   Together at last.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.520]   So here's the news.
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:50.560]   Cinemax has now has an iPad app, not the iPhone iPad.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:53.360]   But they have an iPad app that, of course,
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:59.240]   allows you to play much of their material, all of their material
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.680]   as you like.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.920]   And of course, that has some ramifications
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.400]   because Cinemax, of course, is better known as Skinimax.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.800]   Leander, do you think that this is something
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.560]   that Apple is going to allow for--
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.520]   is this something they're going to be open to,
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:17.720]   or is this something they're going to have to pull back on?
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.640]   I understand that the HBO app does the same thing, too.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.560]   They have an adult tab.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:28.360]   You can get some kind of adult content on.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.400]   Or is it the same thing?
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.640]   That was a gig on Story 2.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:37.240]   Oh, you have the mobile Safari browser.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.640]   You get all the porn you want.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.960]   I think Apple was trying to keep the app store free from apps
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.520]   that were explicitly adult.
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:54.160]   I was having an app that's primarily for watching TV or family
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.480]   content that has streamed some adult content.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:00.880]   I don't think really is.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:04.360]   I hope Apple doesn't climb down on it.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.040]   Not for personal reasons, it goes.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.160]   Andy, do you think Apple is going to climb down on it?
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.000]   Do you think it's just kind of like, well, they're the big--
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.600]   that's just what they have on the channel.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.520]   That's not something that is not made to stream porn.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:18.320]   It's simply a we're making everything available on the channel.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.200]   If we start picking into that, it would be even more complicated
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.640]   than what we've already created.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.160]   Nipples.
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.960]   Oh, god damn it.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.680]   Sorry, I thought that was going to be funny that it was--
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:32.240]   anyway, yeah, that was pretty funny, Andy.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.160]   That's OK.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.600]   You try.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.480]   They can't all be Mazarati's, can they?
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.080]   You try?
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.760]   You think, well, that's like the--
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.600]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.040]   Yeah, no, that's exactly right.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.640]   I mean, I think that there is a certain level of granularity
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.120]   involved where something is explicitly a porn app.
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.320]   It's going to get rejected.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:52.840]   If something can be used to connect to something that could
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:56.760]   conceivably download offensive materials to certain people
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:59.160]   who are running for president, then that's
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.360]   a totally different story entirely.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:03.000]   I'm glad that Apple went through a whole bunch
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.480]   of different growing pains when they were getting their apps
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.080]   to off the ground, including banning apps that
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.240]   were just dictionaries because people could learn
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.200]   kids could look up rude words.
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.040]   And even now, if you download a comic book app,
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.880]   well, you do realize that you might see--
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.040]   Wonder Woman is--
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.920]   that's rather low cut clew-- and it's cut way up.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.400]   And when Mark Sylvester redraws Wonder Woman,
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.560]   you see a lot of butt there.
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.280]   I just want to make sure you know what you're getting into
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.240]   when you're downloading this comic book app.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.040]   So I think this is a self-serving problem.
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.120]   Do you think that this is the beginning or the end
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.400]   of Apple's porn stance?
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:40.200]   No, I think that there will never be an end to that.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.680]   They will never routinely approve an app that
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.360]   is overtly sexual content in nature.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.040]   I don't think they will ever approve a game that
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:53.720]   is overtly violent, as opposed to cartoonish violence.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.240]   They allow you to see flashes of red,
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.880]   but not the sort of thing where two people grab the leg
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.760]   of another competitor and slowly rip this person in half
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:06.440]   as entrails start dripping onto the stone floor.
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.800]   That stuff will never fly.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.720]   Apple will always set that bar at PG-13.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:15.080]   Leander, do you think that they're being too prudish?
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.360]   Well, they haven't done anything in this case, have they?
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:20.320]   I think it was-- if they ban these apps,
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.000]   yeah, they will definitely be too prudish.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:22.760]   It'll be crazy.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:27.880]   But no sign that they've taken any action on this app.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.600]   So hopefully they lay off.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.880]   And connected to this, I think, is the next--
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.400]   the next story is actually very connected to this story,
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:38.360]   which is, of course, Apple is killing plans for the iPad
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.440]   this fall.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.640]   And the report is due to the retina display.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:49.360]   So you could have been watching Cinefags at 2K.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.440]   Anyway, Andy, do you think that we were actually
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.000]   going to see an iPad?
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.120]   No, I'd be shocked if we saw a new iPad this year.
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.400]   Do you think that was really ever going to happen,
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.040]   or do you think that there was just a lot of rumors
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.000]   and now we have an excuse to pull out?
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.960]   I just think there are a lot of rumors.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.160]   My inside sources are not the best in the industry.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:11.880]   But I would like to think that if there were a real plan
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.320]   to get a new iPad ready for October,
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.400]   I would have seen more signs than what I was seeing.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.280]   I just did not see anything indicating that--
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:23.600]   excuse me, inside or outside that would indicate that.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:27.320]   Also, if that were anywhere on the boards,
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.560]   that was such a risky statement that Jobs said
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.400]   during the unveiling of the iPad 2,
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:36.520]   saying that this is going to be the year of the iPad 2.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.200]   And yes, they could have backpedaled and said, yes,
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.240]   well, this is the iPad 2 HD.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.440]   But that's already-- that went from--
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.480]   I'm not sure if they would do two iPads in one year
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.560]   to wow, they would really have to--
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.600]   we walk in on an edge here to go.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.440]   One of the things that I think is interesting
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:57.360]   is that I tend to buy a lot of Apple products.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.840]   And I'm always excited about new Apple products coming out.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.400]   But I have to admit that I'd be a little bummed
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:06.000]   if I bought in the same year that I bought an iPad 2,
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.680]   I had another iPad that I felt like.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:11.840]   Yeah, it'd be a little-- coming up a little too fast.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.200]   It makes no sense.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.600]   Yeah, so-- It makes no sense at all.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.440]   I mean, they couldn't make enough iPad 2s.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.440]   Exactly.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:22.520]   Does a 2K iPad make sense at all?
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:22.960]   No.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.160]   Yeah, eventually.
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.640]   You mean like resolution?
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.120]   Resolution or money.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.120]   The resolution.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.400]   OK, resolution.
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.760]   I think that at some point, they're
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.040]   going to love to be able to say that the number one source
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:38.960]   of HD movies, digital movies purchased on a store,
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:42.480]   is now presenting you with the number one tool for watching
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.320]   HD movies on the go.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.760]   So I think that we're going to see that eventually.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:47.840]   But I don't think that we're going
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:51.720]   to see it in time for Christmas or Hanukkah or any other--
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.000]   I love the opposite.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.040]   I like the idea as someone who builds a lot of training
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:58.000]   of being able to have a 1280 by 720 screen
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.320]   and then having real estate that I can actually
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:03.960]   build interface and other things around and so on and so forth
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.880]   to the higher resolution.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.000]   But it just seems like it's going to hurt somebody's eyes.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.240]   That's an interesting part of that too.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:16.840]   That if Apple would embrace the higher resolution
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.880]   as a way to put more tool palace on a screen,
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.360]   I would tend to think that they're
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.920]   given the direction they're taking with Lion
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:26.000]   and saying that simplified streamline cut down interface
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.640]   is now an integral part of the Mac OS desktop experience,
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.240]   that they would try to discourage people
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.960]   from making visually more complicated UIs for iPad apps.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.200]   Now, do you think that they're going to slowly
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.240]   move to a 16 by 9 screen?
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.320]   Oh, never.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:39.800]   Never.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.360]   Never.
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:43.280]   I think that it's intrinsically wrong.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.560]   Every time I've held an Android tablet,
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.720]   that's widescreen format, it's just intrinsically wrong.
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.120]   There's another one of those ideas
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.360]   where when you're talking about what you want to design,
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.920]   it sounds like, well, all movies are widescreen.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.800]   They'll give us more room for tool palettes.
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.240]   This is absolutely the way to go.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.600]   Then the first time you're holding a working one of those,
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.720]   you realize that this is just wrong.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.240]   It works kind of OK when you're holding it wide.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.040]   As soon as you put into portrait mode,
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.160]   you realize that, no, this is not how I want to read things,
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.760]   because it's just absolutely the wrong shape for reading.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.120]   Leander, do you think that they'll
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.600]   make any changes like that to make it thinner?
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:26.160]   No, just from practical aspects of having all the apps run on it.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.080]   I think they've decided on the aspect ratio
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.080]   and they're going to continue.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.600]   And otherwise, they're going to get fractured
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.960]   like they're on the Android platform.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.160]   And here's the question.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.840]   They keep on changing the resolutions.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.680]   You have the iPhone changed.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.440]   If they change this to 2K, how is this going to affect
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.120]   the developers who already have these 1K versions?
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.800]   So now you're going to have to do 2X to do that.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.640]   That's a 2HD version, right?
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.840]   Angry Birds HD, just like they did the last time.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.760]   So they'll have two apps running concurrently.
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.400]   Right, and all the text, I guess, will scale.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.840]   So we'll see how that goes.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.600]   The next on the list here we have optical drives.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.000]   This is actually from another--
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.200]   I mean, this writer, he's just so insightful.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:10.400]   He just-- you know, he always puts it right on the head.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.000]   This, of course, is from Andy talking about optical drives,
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.600]   hard drives, firewire.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:18.840]   And the fact that Apple just keeps on just getting rid of stuff.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.080]   They seem to be pretty good at sometimes better
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.960]   at getting rid of stuff than adding stuff.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.400]   Andy, do you think that they're-- you don't think
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:25.720]   that they're done?
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.000]   No, not at all.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.560]   I think that they will-- they-- at this point,
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.840]   they know that they have complete control over the hardware.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.320]   They also know that if they're going somewhere
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:36.360]   with these design decisions, they're
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:39.120]   going to get a certain amount of immediate buy-in just
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.160]   from people who trust them.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.560]   And that will give them the amount of time
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.440]   it's going to take to make these ideas work.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.080]   And I think that they're going to-- they're
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:50.280]   on an ongoing process of looking at the Mac hardware,
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:53.240]   especially, and deciding what made-- all the stuff that made
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:58.240]   sense for us back in 1991, 1992, what no longer makes any sense
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.840]   and what can we now absolutely do without.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.120]   And I think the first immediate thing
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:05.800]   is that, especially after talking with Apple at length
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.520]   about the MacBook Air, it's not for using one of the new
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.160]   errors for the past two or three weeks,
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:11.360]   now I'm pretty sure that we're going
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.000]   to see a 15-inch MacBook Air next year.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.440]   We're going to see something that does not--
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:19.080]   it's not necessarily all of the same ideas as the Air,
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.520]   but they're going to say, well, if we were
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.520]   to delete the mechanical optical drive from this,
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.360]   what would that mean?
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.880]   Well, that means that now we can make this a completely solid
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:27.520]   state machine.
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:30.240]   This means that we could make it thinner and lighter.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.640]   We could take some of that space that we're using for that drive
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.320]   and put more batteries in it and get a nine-hour battery
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:38.640]   life out of a much thinner, much more totable MacBook,
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.000]   whether they would call it the MacBook Pro still
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:41.520]   is--
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:45.060]   And I'd love to see a really high performance
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:46.640]   slapped air.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.800]   Is something that was--
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:50.120]   Well, I'm driving a tank right now,
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.440]   which is the 17-inch.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.000]   I'm doing some production that I couldn't really do on the Air.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.440]   And so I have this huge laptop that I'm pretty constantly
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.880]   swearing at, because it feels--
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.320]   it's still got a mechanical drive.
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.360]   I keep on saying that now.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:04.360]   It's got a mechanical drive.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.440]   I have to wait for five minutes for it to actually get to where
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.200]   it actually wants to be.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.720]   And so it feels after you use an Air,
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.560]   all these mechanical-based drives that are in these laptops
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:19.400]   just feel like you're off-roading.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:24.400]   And so anyway, with that kind of performance,
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.040]   it definitely seems like it's something
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:28.680]   that would make sense, just a bigger screen.
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:30.440]   And the problem is you go down to the Air,
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.640]   and they start cutting back on the graphics process.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.040]   They start cutting back on all the other pieces of that
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.760]   that make people like me sad.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.440]   So I think that 2012 is going to be really interesting
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:44.120]   when you see this sort of like that when we start to really
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.760]   see the MacBook Pros and the MacBook
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.040]   Book Airs really start to butt heads.
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:52.400]   The Thunderbolt port is such a destabilizing thing
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.320]   in the entire way.
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.600]   It used to be a very, very clear delineation,
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.400]   saying if you want to be able to expand things
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.080]   and you want high performance, you definitely
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.120]   want to MacBook Pro.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:04.760]   If you're OK with just low USB 2.0, go with the Air.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.880]   Now, this is one of the reasons why--
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.520]   in that column you mentioned, there's parts of it
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.880]   that are very much here's what I think is going to happen.
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.840]   And then there's some speculative parts of it.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.960]   But part of it is that--
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:20.280]   part of what I'm talking about is that I really do believe
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:26.400]   that every time Johnny I've gets into the CAD model,
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:30.120]   the digital model, the next one, and they have to get
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.320]   that function key that creates a graphic primitive for a USB
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:33.920]   port.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.600]   And he sees that square hole in the side
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.880]   of his beautiful, beautiful design.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.400]   It takes about 12 minutes off of his life.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.320]   It just causes him that much pain
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:48.360]   to put another hole inside one of his designs.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.160]   And I think that if there is a way in the next two years
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.680]   for them to start shipping machines that
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:55.440]   don't have USB at all, that simply say, look,
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:00.880]   here is a $29 dongle that will give you USB 2.0 as many ports
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:01.560]   as you want.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.400]   If you decide that you actually need USB 2.0,
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.200]   then by all means, buy one of these things.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.840]   Otherwise, here are the things that we're going to give you
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.640]   instead of having multiple USB ports.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.560]   And you could theoretically have a breakout, a little breakout
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.600]   that had the USB, Firewire, another Thunderbolt.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.000]   Well, there are--
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.120]   The Thunderbolt display is one hell of a thing.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:24.200]   It really does mean that you can buy a 13-inch air
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:25.840]   as your daily driver.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.400]   Then you get home.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.920]   And by the way, when we talk about MacBook Airs,
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:33.320]   we're not talking about really cheap slow processors.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.760]   We're talking about if you want to do a BTO,
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.560]   you can get high performance processors and basically
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:43.000]   get it out to be a very, very solid mid-range fast machine.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:43.960]   Then you get it home.
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:47.400]   You simply put it in a nice stylish $30 third party aluminum
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:47.960]   dock.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:51.760]   You plug in one port, one Thunderbolt plug.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:54.800]   And now you have this beautiful huge Apple display
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.440]   that has Gigabit Ethernet that has USB, that has Firewire,
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.240]   that has all this really, really cool stuff.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.800]   And you can keep everything kind of always connected to that.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:03.800]   Exactly.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.560]   And it's one wire, one wire only.
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.640]   And I think really, when you look at it that way,
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.080]   it's almost as though the MacBook Air
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.120]   is the ultimate expression of the original Powerbook Duo
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:16.280]   concept of having something that is not simply, hey, look,
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.480]   I've got a notebook.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.400]   I can also plug a VGA display into it
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.000]   and plug in a USB keyboard.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.880]   No, it's that you do one thing.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.000]   You do one dock connection.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.800]   And suddenly, it is your desktop.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.800]   Leander, do you think that Apple's ability to get rid of stuff
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:32.720]   is part of really what makes Apple Apple?
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:33.240]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:33.960]   Totally.
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.520]   Yeah, of course, this is Johnny Ives' Lotus
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:37.520]   Upper Andy.
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:38.680]   But it's also Steve Jobs, I think.
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.640]   I mean, I think that the first thing Steve Jobs came in and did--
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:41.720]   I mean, the first thing he did is that we've
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.200]   got to get rid of a lot of these lines.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.720]   I mean, that was 1997.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:47.360]   Well, remember the IMAX Jobs's first machine,
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.720]   really, when he came back to run Apple?
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.160]   I mean, that was-- people had options
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.400]   because they didn't have a floppy drive in it.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.520]   And some of the early predictions
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.520]   was that this machine was doomed.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.640]   Nobody was going to buy it without a floppy drive.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:03.720]   They've been doing this for years.
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.280]   People always have a heart attack
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.960]   when jobs remove something.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:09.800]   And they were doing it about the latest Mac Mini
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.840]   because they didn't have an optical drive.
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:19.200]   But this is obviously-- it's future is limited.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.240]   The optical drive doesn't have much of a future.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:24.000]   They're not going to add Blu-ray drives.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.920]   They're going to get rid of optical drives altogether.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.720]   I couldn't-- I was trying to remember--
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:33.640]   I needed to actually burn a disk a couple last week.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:38.440]   And I was like, I don't know if I have any blank media.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.640]   And then I was like, I don't know if I had it.
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.560]   I don't think I would want to use it because I don't think
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.160]   I've actually-- I think that blank media
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:46.080]   has been sitting there for three or four years.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.400]   I'm not even sure if that media is good anymore.
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.520]   I mean, it was just like this crazy like, wow,
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.000]   what am I going to do with that?
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.880]   You know, like-- so yeah, I don't--
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.520]   I had that exact same problem.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.000]   The easiest way for me to get TV shows off my DVR
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.520]   the way things are set up is simply
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:06.680]   to hook up a DVD burner to it and just simply like VHS copy
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:07.600]   it on there.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.720]   And after turning the house upside down,
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:13.080]   I managed to turn up one.
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.440]   And so I had to go-- I had to go at 9.30,
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.440]   find the one store that still had disks.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.720]   Because I had my DVR was up to 100%
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:21.680]   because I've been saving all these shows that one day,
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:22.920]   I'll actually burn them.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:28.440]   That's like, yeah, that's welcome to 2.11, son.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.000]   So finally, before we move into our tips and tricks,
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.600]   this was just too good to skip.
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:38.040]   It turns out that iPads are not only popular with older
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.560]   Americans, not only popular with middle Americans,
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.920]   not only popular with kids, but popular with Orangutans.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.040]   This is-- which I--
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.400]   Leander, you're going to have to give us a little--
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.440]   this is actually from Kulte-Mac.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.720]   Give us a little background on Orangutans.
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.240]   I have my shame.
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.920]   I haven't actually read this one.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.280]   Even though it's OK site.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.480]   So yeah, this is a good game.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:05.000]   Yeah, so anyway, they are giving these--
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.120]   they decided-- the thing is Orangutans are evidently
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:10.600]   very, very curious, and they also get very depressed
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.600]   and bored in a zoo.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.280]   So they're constantly trying to find ways
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:17.240]   to keep them occupied.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.720]   And so in Milwaukee, the Milwaukee County Zoo,
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:23.640]   they decided to give them a little bit of time
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:26.160]   playing a little Angry Birds.
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.440]   And it turns out they love it.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.400]   Now, they didn't play a lot of Angry Birds, actually.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:33.480]   I think that they are mostly--
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.680]   they like looking at the video.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.360]   They like-- and here's the thing that they're actually
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:43.440]   talking about is having iPads in other zoos
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:46.320]   and then letting the Orangutans see each other from--
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:46.920]   Face time.
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.000]   Face time.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.160]   And after someone who just literally last weekend
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.680]   saw Planet of the Apes, I think that's a really bad idea.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.640]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:57.440]   I just think that you need to stop this right now.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.080]   I mean, I know you're not using any drugs,
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.560]   but stop the madness.
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:00.920]   That's all.
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:01.720]   That's-- I mean--
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:02.360]   Right.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.800]   You know, this is-- it won't take very long
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.680]   before they're programming on these things.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.920]   And the next thing we know, the Apes--
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.040]   I think what's going to happen is
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.240]   we're going to see a conspiracy between the Apes and Skynet.
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.760]   And I don't even know what that'll create, but I'm sorry.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:19.320]   You'd also really want to watch that iPad after you get it.
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:22.640]   They do things with their hands that you wouldn't approve of.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.640]   Well, evidently, they have to watch them very closely
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.240]   and they only let them have it for a little while,
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:28.160]   but even the small ones evidently could--
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.160]   are pretty strong and they could just kind of go,
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.240]   pop it, pop.
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:33.360]   I wonder what this looks like folded.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.000]   And it doesn't work.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:35.960]   Is this like a coconut?
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.560]   I break it and then lick the inside?
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.560]   Ooh, the inside tastes like a rangutan blood.
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:43.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.240]   So anyway, so--
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:45.760]   Well, yeah.
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.840]   Go ahead, Leander.
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:48.760]   Well, you know, is it Purina?
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:51.280]   I think one of the dog food brands
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.360]   has apps for cats and dogs.
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:55.920]   Cats, especially the ones like cats.
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.640]   That's a laser.
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:58.200]   What was it?
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:58.720]   A laser?
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.560]   I think it's a koi pond or something.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:05.160]   Yeah, and the question is always whether the cats
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.080]   are entertained or just completely OCD obsessed
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:11.560]   and becoming very stressed about the whole situation.
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:15.720]   So anyway, so that concludes the main news.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.320]   And now we're going into the tips and the picks.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.840]   And Leander, we'll be coming to you first
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:21.880]   for your pick of the week.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:24.040]   If you have one, are you going to be ready for that?
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:26.600]   As you can see, my facial expressions.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.080]   He's like, ah, right.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.760]   Well, you can always pass as--
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.720]   This is a pick for some--
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:35.240]   It's something like an iPhone, iPad, Lion.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.680]   Anything that's related to the Mac, in fact,
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.640]   you'll find that we stretch that pretty far.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:41.440]   In fact, I'm stretching it about as far as you can go today.
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.160]   So anything that is kind of connected to your Mac,
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:44.920]   you can recommend.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.720]   OK, well, we'll come back to you.
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:48.160]   I'll give you a second to think about it.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.200]   Well, actually, I have something if you want.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.400]   We got tips first.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:58.440]   It's a-- I bought an SSD for Mild Mac Tower.
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:01.240]   And this was a first generation Mac tower.
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:06.280]   And 2006, 2007, I forget.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:09.960]   You know, it wasn't slow, but now it's blazing fast.
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:10.480]   I know.
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.640]   I've given it a whole bunch of new life.
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:13.960]   So it's like having a MacBook here.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:18.520]   The thing boots up in 13 seconds and apps launch instantly.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.880]   And it was relatively inexpensive.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.640]   It was like 130 bucks for this SSD drive.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:26.240]   And it's totally given new life to this--
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:27.480]   it's a pretty old machine now.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:31.200]   I am strongly considering moving to SSD for my Mac Pro.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:31.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:32.600]   It was very easy.
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:33.760]   Really, really easy upgrade.
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:37.040]   You know, out of the box, pop it in.
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.640]   I was up and running in 10 minutes.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.160]   Yeah, perfect.
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:41.360]   And what brand?
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.560]   It was OWC.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:45.200]   They make great ones.
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.160]   Yeah, those are the things I'm on top.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.720]   So that is the OWC SSD.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:50.640]   How big?
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.960]   Excuse me.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.440]   130 gigabytes, I think.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.800]   Fantastic.
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.280]   So there's your pick for the week.
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.680]   Now we're going to go to the tips first.
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.680]   And then we'll come back to Andy and I's our picks.
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:04.320]   So the first-- well, Andy, I'm going to throw this to you.
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.640]   We've decided in the law of three,
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.880]   it looks like I'm going to become the iOS tip master.
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.760]   And Andy's going to become the lion.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:10.760]   It's just a rule.
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:13.080]   If I do the first three in a row of anything,
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.560]   that means that that's the best, the pattern.
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.680]   You have the option, but unfortunately--
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:17.680]   I do not take it.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:20.400]   Or at least whenever I'm on a Mac tips in about three weeks,
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.360]   then I'll say--
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.120]   This is the description.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.360]   My Mac tip has to do with your iPad,
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:27.640]   which you can dock to your back.
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.800]   So what is your tip for the day?
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:31.440]   My tip is one of my earliest ones, one
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.560]   of my favorite features.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.480]   I've always been a huge, huge fan and booster of Automator,
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.720]   which is--
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:39.920]   Automator Z.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.560]   Built-in utility that lets you pretty much automate
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:45.920]   any process on your Mac involving any apps, pretty much
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.640]   any apps that you've got on your Mac.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:50.720]   As long as you can reduce this to a list of steps that
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.800]   are go from step one to three, four, five, six,
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.760]   then whatever, you can have Automator do it automatically.
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:59.800]   And then you can attach it to a contextual menu
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:02.240]   so that it's just available to any amount of-- any text
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:05.240]   that appears anywhere on your Mac.
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.640]   You can make it into a standalone app.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:08.240]   You can then send to people.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:09.840]   It just really, really works great.
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:13.040]   But there's sort of a hidden feature inside lion
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.720]   that is kind of-- that you can activate sort of buried inside
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:21.440]   Automator, which is the ability to basically take any web app
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:25.680]   anywhere on the internet and turn it into a standalone desktop
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.160]   web kit.
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:28.720]   This is using web kit.
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:32.320]   Now this is not necessarily specifically a lion feature
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:36.400]   because if you had gone to a certain website created
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:39.040]   by a certain Apple employee, you could have downloaded this
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:42.160]   about a year ago and installed it on Snow Leopard.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:44.960]   But now it's such a useful feature
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:47.360]   that it's been rolled into the regular Automator.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.320]   So all you have to do-- so if you've
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:52.080]   got the Mac world's website, or if you've
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:54.680]   got a weather site, or a webcam, or something
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:59.280]   that you just want to have just exist as a window on your screen
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:01.880]   with no other UI or whatsoever, it
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:07.480]   is so easy to build that app that I thought that I had it on my--
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:11.560]   So basically what you're doing is you're telling the Mac
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:12.560]   to go up and get this page.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.040]   It's not going to be in a browser.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.480]   It's going to be a standalone little window.
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.440]   And you can tell it to tell the website to be an iPhone,
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:24.080]   that I'm on iPhone to give me the mobile version.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.200]   Is that right?
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:26.200]   Yes.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:29.240]   All you have to do to build this is just go into Automator,
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:32.760]   create a new workflow.
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:35.720]   You can remove one step from the process just by saying,
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:38.280]   whenever you're in Safari, open up the web page,
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:41.640]   you want to make into an app.
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.360]   Drag that URL from the address bar directly
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.440]   into the Automator window.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:51.000]   And it will automatically insert the step number one of this,
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.480]   which is to tell Automator just get this URL, whatever it is,
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.240]   and pass it on to the next step.
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:58.600]   And then you simply look for an Automator action
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.960]   called Website Pop-Up.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:03.080]   And in Automator, there's a search box
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:04.960]   that lists all the different little component
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.400]   legos of features you can access.
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:10.560]   If you just type W-E-B-S, you will see something called Website
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.320]   Pop-Up.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.480]   Drag that item from the left-hand side of the toolbox
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:15.920]   right into your workflow.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:18.480]   It will automatically connect to that URL.
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:21.680]   At that point, you can set a few different simple options.
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:24.880]   You can have it open just as a regular looking desktop web
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:25.600]   page.
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:30.880]   Or you can have this little action,
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:33.720]   bamboozled the website into thinking that you're an iPhone,
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:36.240]   in which case it will actually open the mobile version
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:37.760]   of that thing.
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:40.080]   And then once you've made that setting,
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.640]   run that action.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:44.760]   And you will see open on your Mac,
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.840]   just this nice little blackboarded window
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:49.120]   that has that live website content.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:52.200]   And so it'll just work just like a regular website.
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:54.840]   And if you then save that as an application,
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.840]   then suddenly every time you launch that application,
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:00.760]   it will open up that website in its own special, separate window.
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:04.720]   I believe also as its own separate system process.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:08.040]   So it's an easy way to simply--
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:10.920]   if you want Google Reader, for instance,
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:14.200]   to act as its own app as opposed to a window in Safari,
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.440]   that's one way to do it.
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:16.880]   The only thing that's kind of missing from it
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:21.600]   is unfortunately you can't make it into its own space,
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.120]   for instance.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.520]   It would be great if you could use this
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:27.480]   to create individual apps that do nothing but occupy
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:28.880]   dedicated spaces.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:31.360]   And there are a couple of third-party utilities that do that.
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.280]   But this is free.
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:33.160]   It works.
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.160]   And it's part of line.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:37.880]   So it's not the kind of clean.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:40.320]   Hold down the option key while tapping on the help button.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.920]   And you will see a dancing penguin.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.760]   It's not as neat as that.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:46.680]   But it's a one-step process to build stuff.
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:50.120]   And every time that I'm in a position where, OK,
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:54.960]   the secret limit edition Star Wars poster goes on sale at 1.07 PM,
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:56.920]   I got to keep refreshing this page.
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:59.920]   That's where I put that little web page in.
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:02.320]   But when I'm trying to manually snipe an eBay auction,
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:06.440]   when I need to find out exactly where the killer robots are
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:07.800]   on an interactive map.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.200]   And when I just want to keep an eye on a friend of mine's
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:13.640]   parrot cam, I always whip out this automated reaction
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.680]   and just put it into a little window
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:17.080]   because it's just more fun.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:17.480]   Awesome.
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.240]   So it comes with line.
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.600]   And so you don't need to install anything.
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:24.040]   Otherwise, it would be a recommendation.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:24.840]   That would be it.
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:25.840]   That would be it.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.040]   It is not a feature.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.200]   You don't need to download anything.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.000]   It just simply works.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.240]   So it is a feature.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.320]   So Andy's-- I think Andy-- I'm going
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.280]   to have to really step up my game because Andy's are very
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.560]   complicated and very impressive.
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:36.840]   And I have little ones.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.720]   What happens is I'm talking to people at the airport
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:39.600]   and I'm talking to folks.
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.600]   And they're asking about stuff.
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:41.600]   And we're chatting about it.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:44.360]   And if they say-- by the way, if you see me at an airport,
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.280]   a lot of people see me at an airport.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.240]   And you say-- and we talk about the iPhone, which
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.520]   comes up pretty often because I'm on it and chatting.
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.200]   I usually ask people what they do with their iPhones
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:53.160]   and stuff like that.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:58.080]   And if you say, oh, that's really cool, then usually that goes
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.800]   into my back that this is going to turn into a tip.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:02.360]   So this is one that I was talking to someone about on
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:03.280]   Sunday.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:06.400]   And this is with your iPhone.
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.200]   And the fact that you can use your iPhone-- a lot of people
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:11.280]   have Apple TVs and you use that dorky little controller that
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.280]   came with the Apple TV.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.560]   You can just throw that away.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:14.520]   I mean, really.
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.320]   I mean, you don't throw it away because you might need it
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:16.880]   at some point in time.
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.160]   But really, don't use that.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.360]   You don't get out of it and choke on it and die.
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.600]   And then you'll feel really stupid because you killed your
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.640]   dog instead of--
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.760]   Well, and I have to admit that I've been using it.
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:27.600]   It was kind of easy.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.760]   It comes with the Apple TV.
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.400]   And you kind of click on it.
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:33.560]   But I found myself sitting on my exercise bike going like
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.480]   this because my Apple TV was kind of hidden behind something.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:38.240]   And then we have another one in the living room.
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:43.200]   And if we shut the doors, it doesn't work at all because
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:44.520]   it's infrared.
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:47.920]   So anyway, and then, of course, as you all know, if you're
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:50.520]   using that little controller that comes with your Apple TV,
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:54.560]   it-- you put it in your password, especially if you have a
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:59.120]   complicated password, some kind of hash, is really an
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:01.400]   experience that you don't want to do very often.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:04.560]   So it turns out, if you don't know about this, even if you
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.640]   downloaded it and don't use it very often, really get used
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.720]   to using the remote application on your iPhone.
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:12.200]   So your iPhone has a remote application.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.160]   You can launch it up.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:16.680]   It's connecting to your Apple TV via wireless.
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:21.080]   So it's actually using your 8 to 11 connection, which means
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.280]   that you can put the Apple TV anywhere.
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.360]   You can shut the doors.
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:25.640]   You can hide it, whatever.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.720]   On top of that-- and this is the most important reason to use
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:32.680]   it-- is because you can actually type in all of your--
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:35.040]   so every time you want to search for something or you want
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:39.280]   to put your complicated code in, all that stuff is stuff
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.200]   that you can now use.
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:44.520]   The typewriter on your-- the keypad on your iPhone to do.
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:45.480]   It's a lot faster.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:47.240]   It makes the Apple TV a lot better.
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:48.720]   And I think eventually you're going
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:51.000]   to see a lot more integration between the iPhone and iPad.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:51.880]   We talk about that a lot.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.160]   But I think a lot of people just sit there
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.080]   and they keep on using it because it's
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:55.800]   the thing that came with it and it was easy.
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:58.640]   And my tip is just throw that thing away and use something
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.640]   that-- if you have an Apple TV, I bet you there's
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:02.720]   like an 80% chance that you have an iPhone.
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:08.240]   So it's kind of super satisfying that sending a command
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:11.760]   via this really complicated home Wi-Fi network
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:14.520]   is actually faster and more responsive
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.720]   than this simple here is an LED that costs exactly one fraction
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:18.280]   of a cent.
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:20.440]   You aim it directly at it and fire directly.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.680]   But unfortunately, Wi-Fi is faster
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:24.080]   than the speed of light, apparently.
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:25.880]   Well, and it's just that because I've got
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.080]   this remote app for Verizon Fios.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:31.480]   And I always control-- I'm sitting just five feet away.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:33.880]   My remote is right there next to me.
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:35.720]   But I will always control it via my phone
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.160]   because it's always faster.
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.000]   And I never know why.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:38.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:41.520]   And it's just such a-- like every time for a while,
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:43.720]   I go back and forth and I'm like, why don't I ever do this?
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:46.080]   And then my kids-- the real thing that pushed me over,
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.480]   I have to admit for me using it all the time, was I have kids.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:51.600]   And so I finally found it.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:52.960]   But it was about two months later,
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:58.360]   my kids had stored my iPhone-- or my Apple TV controller
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:28:59.880]   somewhere very distant.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:00.560]   So anyway--
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:03.080]   I used to get as a surfboard.
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:03.560]   Exactly.
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.680]   I think the further GI Joe, yeah, exactly.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:09.960]   So anyway, so we have our picks coming up from Andy and I.
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:13.640]   That's, again, just use your iPhone as your controller.
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:17.480]   And first we want, of course, to thank our sponsor Audible.com.
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:20.240]   Macbreak, of course, is brought to you by Audible.com.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:22.720]   Audible.com is the leading provider of audiobooks.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:25.280]   Over 75,000 downloadable titles.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.120]   You can get anything.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:28.960]   You can get literature, fiction, nonfiction, periodicals.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:32.320]   And if you are really thinking about doing all of this,
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:35.840]   Andy typically has some food for thought in this area
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:40.960]   of a book that you might be interested in listening to.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.880]   Yes, I do.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.840]   He said tapping back over to Audible page--
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.120]   Well, he's going over to Audible page.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:51.640]   I will remind you that you can get a free book.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:54.120]   If you haven't done this yet, you can go up to Audible.
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:58.000]   So when you're listening to Andy talk about his recommendation,
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.040]   you can get a free book the first time to go ahead and give it
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:02.400]   a shot.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.000]   And I think you're going to be sold on it.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.800]   Now, there isn't one thing they want us to note
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:09.440]   is that some very small percentage, 0.5%,
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:12.440]   and it's coming up a lot because Game of Thrones is one of them,
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.480]   is two credits, which means you can't get Game of Thrones
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:16.480]   for free with this.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:18.360]   That's specifically the issue.
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:21.360]   But a lot of people are trying to download that one specifically,
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:26.320]   and you need to get one credit in 99.5% of the number one credit
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.360]   books.
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.240]   And so that's the one caveat.
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:31.960]   But otherwise, if you haven't gotten a free book from Audible.com
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:33.000]   yet, you're crazy.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:33.520]   I mean, it's easy.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:35.440]   Go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:39.400]   And you're going to be able to sign up, get a free book,
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.960]   put it on your iPhone, iPod, iPod,
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.440]   touch, whatever you have there.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:46.640]   And this is the only way I read long-form books.
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:49.040]   I mean, I have research books that are on my Kindle.
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.480]   I have my Kindle app.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:53.360]   And so that's the only thing in PDFs
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.800]   that I put on there, manuals.
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:58.000]   But outside of that, if I'm going to listen to someone
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.920]   go on about some subject matter, the only way that I do it
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:03.640]   is using Audible.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:05.880]   Andy, do you have a suggestion for folks?
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:09.920]   Yeah, I've got sort of an unusual one.
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:12.080]   I'm on the gold plan, which is really, really cool,
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:16.000]   because you just simply get a credit every single month
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000]   at a really, really discount rate.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.200]   And sometimes I fall a little bit behind,
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:23.040]   which means that if I've got two or three stacked up,
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.200]   that means I'm more than willing to spend one on something
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:27.560]   that might be a little bit off the beaten path.
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:30.600]   And so the last book I bought was actually a volume 20
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:33.920]   of the Feynman lectures on physics.
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:34.440]   Sorry.
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:37.240]   I grew up on Feynman lectures.
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:42.760]   I used to-- in college, I used to own the lecture books.
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:45.560]   Richard Feynman is definitely one of those names
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:48.480]   that most of the people who are listening to this invoke a--
[01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:50.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.200]   Because I didn't mean to be quite so geeky when I said that.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:58.120]   But he did that brilliant book of memoirs about his history
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:01.120]   as a scientist and as just a curious character,
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:04.560]   working at OSALOMOS and then becoming a lecturer at--
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:06.360]   excuse me, a professor of Caltech and all the adventures
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.480]   he's had.
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:09.920]   But he also did this absolutely brilliant--
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:14.200]   obviously, he never just simply retreated into his office
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:15.560]   and just did pure research.
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.200]   He was a teacher of physics.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:20.240]   And he was even, I think, even until the run's entire career,
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:23.800]   was still teaching the introduction to physics course
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:26.080]   for people who want to become mechanical engineers,
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:27.720]   but they've never taken physical graduations.
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:28.880]   You have to take physics.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:33.400]   But he's the guy who used to take the most complicated
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:37.800]   concepts and reproach it with such simplicity and humility.
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:40.760]   Volume 20 is subtitled of the very best lectures.
[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:42.080]   And it's a great place for people who
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:45.760]   are just interested in physics, interested in science,
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:48.400]   who have forgotten most of what they learned in high school,
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.240]   but will sort of-- they remember Copernicus,
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:53.440]   they remember Kepler's laws, but they've never
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:57.320]   had a really great teacher explain exactly how they work.
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:58.920]   And also, I think that you'll fall in love
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:02.240]   with these lectures, even just from the first five minutes,
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:05.680]   which is his first day of class and just simply addressing
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:12.040]   in this Ed Norton voice talking about the only two things
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:13.840]   I'm going to teach you in this class.
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:15.400]   One is about the status.
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:18.960]   And I can't-- I won't-- I want to insult the memory
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:20.440]   of Simon by putting up with it.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:23.800]   And I've just told-- if you know math from these two things,
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:26.120]   I've just told you in 45 seconds, you will understand.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:28.120]   You already know everything I can-- you can figure out
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.920]   everything I'm going to tell you in this course.
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:32.200]   However, it's possible that your math is not quite so good.
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.880]   So I'm going to have to explain it to you, which I will now do.
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:35.380]   Yeah.
[01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:37.240]   And I just wish that that's--
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:41.320]   I have to make growing up reading lectures on physics
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:44.440]   when I was in high school and a little younger.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:47.280]   Just that would have been a reason to go to college.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:48.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:50.680]   I mean, if you could get the--
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:53.720]   if you could get access to these in your public library,
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:57.840]   your application, the Caltech, would have been your first
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:58.760]   application.
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:02.160]   And if you've got these things when you were in freshman year
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:05.480]   and you're kind of a dumb bunny, your grads, counselors,
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:06.560]   I will, here is the grades you're going
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.560]   to have to get in order to be accepted to Caltech.
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:11.640]   OK, I'll become a smart person who actually listened.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:13.080]   I'll put that one on.
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.720]   Now, I will say the only downside to this
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:19.920]   is that it was not designed as a six-hour audiobook.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:23.360]   They did take a whole bunch of 1960s lectures.
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:26.880]   So the audio quality is not digital crystal clear.
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:29.640]   Also, you're listening to him talking.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:30.720]   It's one wonderful--
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:35.320]   then section two, like Burns' Laws of Light.
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:36.320]   OK, sorry.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:37.520]   It's the same like it was.
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:38.200]   Now, this is just--
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:38.920]   Yeah, this is--
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:39.720]   It would be the same.
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:43.360]   So we say equal areas are swept out by the radius vector
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.520]   in equal times.
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:49.040]   And that determines the speed around the orbit.
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.800]   Finally, there's a third law, which
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:52.840]   was discovered by him much later, which
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.440]   is of a different category than the other two.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:58.680]   Because this doesn't deal with a single planet like these.
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:00.600]   So I--
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:02.680]   Yeah, so I'm going to have to get that.
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:04.480]   I had no idea that that was up there.
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:06.960]   The entire series is available.
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:10.600]   And I remember my experience of liking the topics
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:11.160]   I understood.
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.840]   I liked them so much that I would buy the books
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.560]   that I didn't understand.
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:16.840]   And normally, you'd like this story to end.
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:19.920]   And so I actually got an understanding for the QED
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:21.560]   and the unified field theories.
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:23.280]   No, I kind of hit--
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:24.480]   my brain was full.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:27.760]   I had to raise my hand and leave the room.
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:28.760]   Yeah.
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.120]   I got in a lot of trouble with those books.
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:31.120]   So they were great.
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:36.080]   So anyway, I learned a lot.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.840]   So that is our pick.
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:40.240]   You can pick that book.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:41.680]   I'm going to pick that book.
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:43.200]   But you can pick any book you'd like.
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:46.360]   Go to audible.com/macbreak and make sure to go out
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:47.080]   and get your free book.
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:49.480]   If you haven't done it, you just really got to try it.
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:52.440]   Audible is the way to acquire that kind of information.
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:53.440]   You can do it while you're mowing.
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:55.240]   You can do it while you're cleaning the house.
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:57.360]   You can do it whenever you need to.
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.440]   Now we're going to jump into our picks of the week.
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:02.160]   We already heard Leander's.
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.240]   Wow, that was great.
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:06.640]   I had to throw one in there.
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:09.360]   So we heard Leander's is the SSD drive, which is awesome.
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:15.480]   And it's just pushing me to actually get one in my Mac Pro.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:17.040]   Andy just did his auto.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:18.000]   I'll jump in and do one.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.880]   And I was telling Leander that we stretched this pretty far.
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:24.880]   I'm actually going to recommend an application
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:27.560]   that you can use on your Mac if you're using bootcamp.
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.560]   I know that that's really stretching it.
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:31.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:33.560]   Now I have two recommendations.
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:34.800]   One is the iOS recommendation.
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.280]   It's a little bit more traditional.
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:39.760]   Have you guys seen almost DSLR?
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:42.080]   So there's a little book, a little application
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.080]   called almost DSLR.
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:43.600]   And I don't know.
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.480]   Do you have that overhead?
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:46.600]   I've got it for you right there.
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.440]   There we go.
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:48.720]   So this is almost DSLR.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:52.040]   And what you're seeing there is this awesome interface.
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:53.520]   And this is-- I don't know how much this is.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.040]   It's like $4.99 or something like that.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:58.320]   But it gives you an enormous amount of control
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.080]   over your camera.
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.400]   And so if you're really getting serious and you want to have--
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:04.560]   and you just find that a lot of the camera apps aren't giving
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:07.960]   you enough heads up and enough control over exposure
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:08.760]   and so on and so forth.
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:11.520]   And there's a lot of good camera apps.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.800]   But this is another great one that I've been working with
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:14.360]   right now.
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:15.720]   Of course, we can swing it around.
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:16.600]   So there we are.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:17.800]   Hello.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:20.040]   But you have a lot of the controls right on the heads up.
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:21.520]   You can, of course, do--
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:23.680]   here you have-- you can have a timer.
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:26.400]   And a lot of the things that camera plus might have,
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:27.760]   but it also just a whole nother interface
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.600]   is another thing to look at and give it a shot.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:32.160]   And I have both of them and I'm happy with both of them.
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:35.320]   But this is just a great app to control white balance exposure.
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:37.600]   You can lock your white balance, lock your exposure,
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:39.440]   have your grids on and off.
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:42.880]   You can turn on your flash, have a lot of that independent control,
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.920]   and you can do it all with the heads up display.
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:45.800]   And I really like it.
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:47.920]   So that's the one for people who are
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:48.920]   going to complain about the next one.
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:50.760]   But they're connected because you want to take pictures.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:55.400]   And I just have to recommend this because this is worth--
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:56.160]   this is a free app.
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.680]   So it's not-- no, Alex's.
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:59.000]   It's a free app.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.680]   And it's worth going out and getting parallels
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:04.720]   or doing bootcamp and getting windows just for this one thing.
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:06.200]   It's called PhotoFly.
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:07.280]   And this is done by Autodesk.
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:09.160]   And I've been having so much fun.
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:14.120]   And Eileen, I posted two YouTube links.
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:16.440]   These are stuff that I did over the weekend.
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:18.560]   And literally, when I say I did it over the weekend,
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:19.480]   I didn't do a lot of work.
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:21.760]   I took a couple photos while I was one and a-- maybe
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:22.920]   last weekend, I guess.
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:25.920]   So what you're looking at there is not a video.
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:26.960]   That is a 3D model.
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:34.320]   I mean, every nook and cranny is modeled there.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.120]   And I didn't do any of that myself.
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:38.440]   Take a photo of a picture you took.
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:39.760]   That's 17 photos.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.720]   And what you're actually-- the animation you're seeing there
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:42.880]   is going from photo to photo.
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:45.680]   It's just a nice, smooth move from one photo to another.
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:47.560]   Now, I know this is a little geeky, but here's the thing.
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:51.600]   You don't need-- you don't need to know anything about 3D
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:52.480]   to do this.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:54.600]   You can literally go up to a photo flight--
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.880]   if you search photo flights on Autodesk.
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:58.000]   But it's in there Autodesk Lags.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.680]   This is a beta.
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:02.320]   And it's really, really something you can just download,
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:04.360]   go out and take a bunch of photos.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.440]   You upload it to a server.
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:07.680]   And like 10 minutes later, it comes back like that.
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:09.560]   I mean, it's just insane.
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:11.080]   Now, they don't all come back like that.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:12.400]   You have to kind of-- the one thing you
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:13.480]   have to get good at is kind of taking
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.280]   at certain angles and so on and so forth.
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:18.680]   But this is the fire hydrant near my house.
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:22.240]   And again, this is a 3D model.
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:24.840]   And it's getting all the little edges and everything.
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:26.840]   It got the sidewalk, too.
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:28.520]   And there's little errors there.
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:29.520]   You can see below, because I didn't
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:32.000]   get my camera low enough for some of the hydrant things.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.640]   But I mean, overall, it has all of the little ridges
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.880]   from the type on the top is all a 3D model from the photographs.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:43.880]   And I literally shot this in like five minutes.
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:45.040]   And--
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:46.080]   How many pictures to get that?
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.000]   This was about 20-some?
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.200]   20-25 pictures?
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:50.000]   From all angles.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.400]   So you got that in your knees.
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:52.800]   Yeah, what you're seeing here is an animation
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:53.760]   through all the angles.
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:57.200]   So I just walked around the fire hydrant taking photos.
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.720]   I took a couple of close ones there.
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:01.240]   You can see them to try to see if that would get me more angles.
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:01.600]   And it did.
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.600]   I should have done more of that.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.200]   But the-- so yeah, this is what I--
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:08.440]   this was-- that was my kind of walkthrough of doing that.
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:09.920]   And there's a lot of great pieces on there.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:15.960]   But it is so much fun to put it together.
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:19.000]   And the reason that I posted it is because I don't think
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.800]   that you need to be a--
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:22.040]   you don't have to be a 3D geek.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:23.360]   There's just something very-- there's
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.040]   something very eye candy about that.
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:27.560]   And it's something you can do with your little point
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:28.960]   and shoot camera.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:32.360]   You can just take the pictures, upload them, and come back.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.200]   And one of the things is I think this is a preview.
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:37.280]   I would be very surprised if we don't see an iPad app or iPhone
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:38.040]   app that does this.
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:39.600]   Because they're doing all the calculations
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:42.160]   and they're not doing them on your computer.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.320]   I think that they are testing it right now
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:45.280]   from a PC perspective.
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:47.200]   But I don't think that's going to-- so I think this is something
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:47.880]   you could preview.
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:50.400]   And somewhere down the road, you'll see me recommending this.
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:52.400]   But I wanted to say, well, this is the one I showed it to.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:53.280]   And this is standing.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:55.040]   A lot of people are getting excited about it.
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:55.520]   Sorry?
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:56.360]   You can't do it with people.
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:57.360]   There are examples on YouTube.
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:00.360]   There's a ton of examples on YouTube of people doing this stuff.
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:01.760]   And it just started-- it's something
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:04.800]   they released the newest version, which is a big upgrade in June,
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:05.520]   May or June.
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.880]   And it's been taking off like wildfire over the summer.
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:08.440]   That looks awesome.
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:12.240]   And it's just-- and I know that some of our viewers have bootcamp.
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:15.240]   We have every machine-- I have to say, every machine, I think,
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:17.960]   or almost every machine we have as dual boot,
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:19.880]   so that we can do little things like add those things.
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:24.600]   And so almost DSLR was what I recommended earlier.
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:27.120]   And Andy, what's your pick for the week?
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:30.400]   My pick for the week is this new app from Autodesk called
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:31.840]   Project PhotoFly.
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:35.200]   Now, I want you to imagine.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:36.960]   It's a lot better than my pick.
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:38.840]   I've got the window open.
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:41.240]   Because I'm just--
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:42.960]   Yeah, it was a--
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:43.840]   From photographs.
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:45.600]   Remember, that's model from photographs.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.960]   I kind of want to end the show, so I can start playing with this.
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:50.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:51.600]   Back on slide.
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.760]   OK.
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.280]   It's really, really life.
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:55.640]   Like, oh my god.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:57.280]   All the way down to the big hole in the top of his head.
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:58.280]   That's amazing.
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:41:59.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:03.240]   And then there's just silence.
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:04.440]   And we're just like, no, it's--
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:05.960]   No, it's a picture.
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:09.120]   So Google's going to have to make big helmets.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.560]   You're going to have like, jungle, like, oh, wait a minute.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:13.200]   Stop sign.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.520]   And now this guy's going to have to stop.
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:15.680]   Get out of the car.
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:17.120]   Look at the stop sign from every--
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:18.920]   goodness gracious, that's cool.
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:19.200]   OK.
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:23.120]   Well, actually, this is a recent discovery by me.
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:30.080]   When we're looking at that problem of Coggin visual
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:32.840]   tool this morning, for the first time,
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:35.760]   looked at the visual hub's developer's site
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.240]   and the stuff he was working on, that Tyler locked.
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:42.520]   And he has this really cool tool called Flash Frozen, which
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:46.120]   is yet another-- it shows you how screwed up Flash is
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:48.480]   and how the damage that it does to people's computers.
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:50.480]   That there are multiple really cool tools
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:52.320]   for dealing with an in-your-browser.
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:55.040]   Now, you're probably listening and thinking, oh, I've
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:55.960]   got clicked to Flash.
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.600]   This tool's never heard of clicked to Flash.
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.640]   That's the plugin that turns off--
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:02.760]   it selectively turns off Flash for individual sites.
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.000]   It only activates them when you click.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.200]   Yes, that's true.
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:08.040]   But Flash Frozen has a different approach that
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:10.240]   is actually quite complimentary, especially--
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.480]   you can even use it alongside Click to Flash.
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:17.080]   What it is is it's a menu bar item that will simply show you--
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.480]   give you an alert as to how much of your CPU is being taken
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:20.880]   up by Flash processes.
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:23.160]   So if nothing, you'll see--
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:28.760]   I've got a screenshot here on the background there.
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:32.280]   And here we go.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:34.160]   Oops, that's a squirrel.
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:37.200]   So there's just a little tiny item right in the top of your menu
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:38.040]   bar.
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:39.920]   And when-- there you go.
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:44.440]   And when Flash is not in use, it's completely grayed out.
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:46.840]   When Flash is running, it turns black.
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:51.600]   And when Flash is using more than, by default, 30% of your CPU,
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:55.080]   it turns red to not only tell you that it's throttling your CPU,
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:56.560]   but also to warn you that it's probably
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:59.720]   starting to drain your battery, because that will deprive
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:02.440]   your CPU of its ability to use low power modes.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:05.240]   And that's how you get eight hours worth of battery life
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:06.920]   on certain malls of Mac.
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.520]   If there's a reason why--
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:10.360]   if you're wondering why you only got two or three hours,
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:12.640]   maybe four hours at a clip, it's probably
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:14.280]   because Flash was running in the background
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:16.520]   and would not let your CPU sleep.
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:20.120]   So not only will-- not only will it give you this alert,
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:23.720]   but it will also give the ability to simply just pull
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:26.000]   the plug on Flash immediately.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.880]   So what it does is it basically takes Flash the plug in
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:32.160]   and basically puts it into its own separate process
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.200]   behind the scenes.
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:35.240]   And it works with every browser automatically,
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:37.760]   except for Opera, because of the way that it handles threads
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:38.760]   or something.
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:41.520]   It's not 64 bits, so it can't really work that way.
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:45.120]   Or that's the explanation that was given in the documentation.
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:48.040]   So it means that if you're using Click to Flash,
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:50.640]   maybe you clicked to Flash because you
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:52.120]   wanted to play a certain video.
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:53.880]   But then you totally forgot that you would actually
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:55.720]   activate it Flash for that web page.
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:57.240]   And now it's been running in the background.
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:58.800]   You can just simply click on that icon,
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:02.440]   click on the Click to Flash menu bar item,
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:05.320]   and just simply terminate all Flash operations.
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:08.640]   So the Flash simply is not running anywhere on your machine.
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.840]   And then when you need those CPU cycles back,
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:12.640]   you can turn it-- or when you-- at a site
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:14.280]   where you need to actually access Flash,
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:16.600]   then you can then go back into the basement,
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:21.720]   go into the control panel and put that big lever switch back
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:24.320]   into the opposition and turn Flash back on.
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:28.960]   I believe it's 99 cents.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:32.240]   But as a sign that I have forgiven him
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:35.400]   for pulling the plug on Visual Hub, I decided to buy it.
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:39.560]   And also, Flash continues to be the bane of my and every other
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:40.920]   person's existence.
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:43.400]   And I think that Click to Flash plus this tool
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:46.000]   are the really good "Wensy 2Z" approach
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.160]   to making sure that Flash is not going to incubate
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:50.440]   any of your life anywhere, so that it absolutely has to.
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:53.080]   I find that I'll be sitting there working on text
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:54.960]   at it, and suddenly my fans turn on.
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:56.960]   They're just going full tilt.
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:59.320]   And I'm like, what is going on?
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:01.760]   And I realize Firefox is open, and there's a flashlight open.
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:03.560]   And it's doing something.
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:05.320]   I don't know what it's doing, but it's doing something.
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:08.520]   It is not a subtle problem.
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:12.360]   When I got my new 2011 MacBook, I had been testing this thing
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:15.360]   out for-- I had a loan from Apple for a while.
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:16.960]   So I knew exactly what the battery life was.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:18.840]   You can get five or six hours with a battery.
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:20.960]   On my old machine, because it was three years old,
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.480]   I was getting 40 minutes of battery life.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:24.520]   So I was looking for a great--
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:25.920]   I'm going to go to the coffee shop.
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:27.440]   I don't need to take my power brick,
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.080]   because I've got five hours with a battery
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:31.040]   and after two and a half hours.
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:33.080]   And because this was a brand new machine,
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.480]   I hadn't really outfitted it yet.
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:36.560]   The reason why I was getting only two hours
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.560]   with a battery was because I had yet to install
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:42.440]   Click to Flash or any other sort of Flash neutralizer
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:43.240]   technology.
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:44.960]   Where can I go behind that?
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:47.360]   It's available from the App Store.
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:50.440]   You can also go to flashfrozen.net.
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.320]   But obviously, if you have the opportunity to buy it
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.080]   on the App Store, you should buy it on the App Store.
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:55.480]   Man, that's the only way to get it.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:57.680]   Anyway, so definitely check that out.
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:02.360]   And Andy Naco from the Celestial Waste of bandwidth.
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:03.640]   And the Mighty Chicago sometimes.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:04.320]   Yes, very good.
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.920]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:06.640]   Thanks.
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:09.120]   And the ender, do you have anything
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:14.000]   that you'd like to plug at the end of our fine show here?
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.720]   You know, the last time I came on the show,
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:17.720]   I was like, OK, I'm going to get something to plug.
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:18.920]   The next time I come on the show.
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:20.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:21.320]   Very good.
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:24.160]   So Leander Kehney from the call to Mac.
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:26.040]   Thank you so much for jumping in.
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:26.520]   Thank you.
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:27.440]   Thank you for having me.
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:30.040]   This is Alex Lindsey sitting in for Leo, hopefully
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:31.560]   we'll be back next week.
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:33.680]   Until then, break time is over.
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:35.200]   Get back to work.
