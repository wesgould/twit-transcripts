[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.440]   Will have been worth. Let's not forget Fiddy Sense has promised 50 cents for every dollar pledged

[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.840]   It was minus 40 in Montreal so I came to Winnipeg to warm up
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.040]   What is it Winnipeg?
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.960]   It's like - 11. I don't know what's happening the world is upside down really got that cold in Montreal. You're paying you're paying for
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.760]   Whoo, yeah for December. Yeah, I know Wow
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.880]   also hear from
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.200]   the Indiana Jones warehouse for biblical artifacts
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.360]   Mr. Alex Lindsey
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.400]   Thank you. Thank you very much the pixel core glad to be here. Yes. See the guys working moving
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.180]   There you there moving artifact back and forth Wow at Alex Lindy's overstocked furniture
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.520]   2016 sofa sleeves are coming and we gotta make room for them
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.760]   You know what that deals
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.160]   Mostly made out of speed rail, but they're
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.360]   We put some we put some sound foam over top of them and some moving blankets. It's our ice tip of the hat to
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.640]   Iliad of the user-friendly comic for some reason. He's rerunning
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.480]   Comics that must seem baffling to many of his readers today
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.400]   This is the cartoon for February 16th, but it's a it's a it's a return. See he's been like that for days
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.520]   I don't know if you should do this sit, but it might help well and your head be on it tech TV
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.840]   The wound wasn't open enough for you
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.920]   too soon
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.760]   That is a
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.000]   That is a ten-year-old comic. It's got to be still a very hip reference
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I you know, I wonder how I
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.920]   Somebody tweeted it to me. Thank you for letting me know
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.880]   But I just wonder how many of Iliad's readers. Thank you Doug Ferguson for letting us know about that
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.800]   Know what they're talking about maybe if you do that would be ones that matter Leo. That'd be sweet
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.200]   Yeah, the ones that mattered it's a chibola
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.040]   What the hell's a chibola
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.760]   Wait a moment. Yeah
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.120]   It's so it's yeah, it's a word I know from the West because they use it in the West Wing
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.840]   It's like when they're when it when people have a certain religious order were being persecuted
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.560]   There was sort of a secret word that if you use in conversation only the people who belong to this order would know it
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.080]   And so it's safe to talk freely because you're among friends. It's a chibola. Perfect. Yes
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.160]   Or in modern-day politics a dog whistle
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:09.760]   Faith is the only chibola. Thanks to beef team and the gang at the Purdue University Department of Animal Sciences for sending us
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.360]   Not one not two but four pairs of livestock judging gloves
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.440]   Please tell me they have beef team like baseball jerseys
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.040]   $50 for one in an excel
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.520]   Dr. Ron
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.120]   Lemon and Joe and Scott who is the beef extension specialist and Scott Radcliffe who is the swine nutrition expert and
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.840]   Phil Reed from the Distance Learning Coordinator and they're putting together a swine at Purdue University and they're putting together a
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:46.320]   Yeah, studio much like ours for distance learning and so they came over and visited and they sent the entire team livestock judging gloves
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.720]   So we're ready
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.160]   bring on
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.400]   The gloves to judge the livestock. What part of the livestock are you judging?
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.960]   These seem fairly heavy weight infected even says these gloves work
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.760]   I bet you I bet they do you know, I'm where I think father
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.800]   I'm gonna save a pair for father Robert. I'm wearing these from now on they just I think they have that look about them
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   So judgy. I mean nip. I manipulate a per I think there's a certain amount of tactile feel that you still have to have as yeah
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.280]   You know inspecting stroking the withers cough cough pick off
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:31.600]   We do have some
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.960]   With that because that it looks like you might have laundering problems
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:41.400]   Yeah, it's a it's gonna be part of my new delegates load so
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:48.880]   John Gruber kudos to John Gruber on the talk show scoring one of the biggest Apple interviews you can get
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:56.320]   Not just Eddie Cuba Craig Federighi coming on his showed talk about many things. I I'm sure you all listened
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.800]   Yeah
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.720]   I tell you my my where I thought it was an interesting John to his credit brought up
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.680]   The number of articles including what Marshburg's article about Apple software being clap and
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.800]   I was I thought
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.680]   Eddie and Craig didn't quite get the criticism
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.480]   Eddie said well
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.120]   It's cuz we're trying new stuff. You know nobody likes change and
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.560]   But we're making it's better. It's getting better all the time
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.920]   But just a lot of us want change that's the
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.720]   We just want change in places that they're not changing. That's the issue
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.400]   Like iTunes it's yeah, it's kind of a sh
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:43.960]   He made it sound like a project management issue like when you change final cut everyone gets super upset and iTunes in many ways
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.440]   Is more important than final cut to more people and if you just change it there's huge ramifications
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:54.440]   So what at least to my ears it sounded like they were carefully staging things like I Apple music now starts moving iTunes
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.000]   To the cloud and you do that step before you move the rest of it because if you just try to move it all at once
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.960]   All you have is a bunch of broken workflows like Jim Dalrymple who ripped his 10 million songs suddenly doesn't exist in that world anymore
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.000]   And they have to actually manage it's a window
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.920]   It's a Microsoft problem
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.720]   You have to manage a massive installed user base as you transition
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.240]   Do you feel it's responsive though?
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.040]   I mean for instance my biggest beef besides iTunes is is the new photos
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.880]   Which is just constant a constant pain and has not worked at all on any of my machines
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.760]   Now I know that's not I'm not the only one and I know it's not universal
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.000]   So that's less acceptable to me because that's a fresh start
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.880]   It's brand new
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.200]   Yeah, they're starting fresh late that thing should perform and he implied that it was because I didn't like change
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.040]   Oh, you just not used to the new no, we can't lose my photos
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.680]   I had a problem with that as well
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.760]   I thought of for instance
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:47.160]   I think that that was a good point to make and the change from final cut to final cut 10 where it was there
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.720]   Pretty much throwing away what existed and creating a new pretty much a brand new product
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.280]   I'm moving too, right?
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.120]   But yeah pretty much
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.080]   But I'm movie pro if you want to say but not in a denigrating way
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.320]   But what people are having complaining about while my Mossberg every all these commentators are not that gosh
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.320]   This doesn't work for my workflow anymore
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:10.800]   But that you're say what it says on the side of the box is that it will do this and it's not doing that or it's doing that in such a sloppy
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:17.080]   Way that it's almost unusable and that this has become such a bad product for me that I'm trying to find other
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:24.840]   Ways to any way possible to avoid using this app. So it's it's it's it's not it's not likely that a manager is going to say
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.840]   Yes, our app is total garbage
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.440]   No, I don't think that's that
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:35.400]   But it's it's hard to find a way to phrase in terms of we appreciate that this is a perception and we are eager to address that
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:42.760]   That perception through through rapid updates. I didn't really hear that in the interview Steve jobs very famously
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.000]   when malt Mossberg
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.320]   properly savaged mobile me brought the mobile me team into the
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:58.120]   Auditorium and said our good friend Walt Mossberg is turning against us you guys are destroying my company and you're all fired
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:03.360]   Now we don't know what internal what things internally Eddie and Craig might be saying
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.000]   but
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.200]   I've I would have loved to hear at least some acknowledgement
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:14.360]   You know even Microsoft which has had a horrific problem with its surface the surface book and the surface pro 4
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:21.640]   And and as acknowledged that yes, there's a problem. We're working on a fix even they you know, they said there's their answer was
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:27.480]   It's a tough computer science problem, but at least that's acknowledging there's something wrong. Yeah
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:36.280]   Yeah, that's I'll make the chipotle analogy where so long as you admit that you have sanitization problems at your stores
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:42.040]   And so long as you acknowledge that's a big enough problem that you're willing to do extraordinary things to address them
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.000]   that's how you get people to not write them off completely and
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.240]   right now
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.600]   I think that Apple really needs to have a
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:58.720]   almost an iPhone 4 antenna sort of response to this saying that where definitely here is here is the
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.480]   The faults that we have found in this here the weaknesses
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.680]   We knew there's gonna be rough points
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.360]   But here is what we're working in order to address them because right now it looks like there's there for a few years
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.800]   I think there's been a perception at least that there are
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.720]   Products that in strategies that Apple
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:20.800]   Absolutely cares about and then they're the products and strategies that they don't care enough about to cancel outright
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.880]   But they're willing to let them continue to go
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.680]   So when you have major app suites that haven't been updated
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.760]   Haven't had a major update in two or three years
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.640]   But you have major services that kind of work, but kind of not
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.320]   You feel as though
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.360]   Well, look if this were something they could mill out of a block of aluminum
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.440]   This would not they would not have these problems or if it had that problem it would be fixed immediately
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:45.120]   But the fact that this is simply a word processor that they haven't put in a commercial or haven't really talked about in years
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.640]   Means that they're just willing to let people suffer
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:53.920]   I'd also argue that from Apple's point of view that there's a perception of a problem should be a problem even if they internally believe that
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.480]   We understand what's wrong. We're managing this transition
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.560]   We we think that people are misunderstanding this part
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:05.680]   But we know why that there is this massive perception from Walt Mossberg down should be treated as though the software is absolutely in that state
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.920]   Like that that that perception should be treated as reality regardless. Yep
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.040]   The fact that so many people who really get Apple are making these or making these accusations
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.320]   That's such a huge warning sign
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:22.160]   Well, and I think that the part of the problem is is that they're they're not touching the thing that everybody talks about
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:29.040]   Which is iTunes and then they are you know twisting around things that we're working relatively well before which was iPhoto
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.040]   And now it's not very frustrating. I mean I find it very frustrating as well. I mean I find photos
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.560]   To be annoying
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.560]   To say the least I
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.040]   Tunes is totally understandable because like and I go back to they gave iTunes an impossible job
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:48.800]   There is it's hard to argue that one app can do everything that iTunes does and the answer is to stop at doing all those jobs
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.240]   But that means what do you do with Windows people thinking iPod nannos that don't have Wi-Fi connectivity?
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.920]   What do you do with billions of dollars and transactions that are being gone through that store every day because you can't just you can't just destroy it
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.120]   And build another bridge if you very carefully build a whole bunch of new bridges and then move people over
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.720]   But that that is a process and they're not managing expectations of that process
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.600]   We have a really good breakout app coming if you're not a Windows user
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:18.640]   I mean I don't know how much I mean I'd go into iTunes maybe once every couple weeks by accident because I put my I plugged my phone into
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.160]   My computer. I mean you know I think for a lot of us
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.440]   We've kind of you know we're watching on Apple TV or watching our iPhone or I mean I don't I guess I don't really view my lap
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.520]   My laptop hundreds and millions of people still think iPods on Windows. So that's a big that's a big micro
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.520]   to do
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.520]   right, but they're but they're used to paying
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.760]   This is probably also that Apple
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.800]   Historically is a hardware maker first and foremost and
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.640]   Even though you know it's key that software work well
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.360]   I mean as Steve Jobs said you want your software to work you got to make the hardware, too
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:58.520]   I think there probably is internally a little bit of a feeling like well we make our money on the hardware
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.160]   We'll do what we can on the software
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.440]   Software as we said I was we talked about last week software is hard to fix you can't throw money or people at it
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.040]   That doesn't help that makes it worse often and maybe what's happened one
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.120]   I think it's fundamental if you look at the if you look at the iWork platform
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.800]   You know all the the keynote and pages and everything else in many ways that's Apple's defense
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.400]   You know they they were you know that was a historical thing of them being very very
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:28.800]   Exposed when it looked like Microsoft office might leave the Mac platform
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.480]   And so they they want to make sure that they can continue to provide those those tools
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.520]   They want to keep on building that out, but yeah
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.640]   I don't think that they're they're not putting in the kind of energy that that Microsoft puts it
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.560]   Yeah, software is only there to defend to defend your platform. That's not motivation
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.200]   No, I think so but I think that and I think that like for instance if you look at the the iWork
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.640]   You know all of those things the only thing that is really that everyone really wants is true collaboration
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.880]   I mean that's what keeps everybody on Google Docs is being able to we're all open a doc at the same time
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.920]   We can all work on it at the same time. I mean that's what I mean
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.520]   That's why we use Google Docs is not it's definitely not because of the quality of the editing tools
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:08.720]   You know it's it is because you know or the picture is different if you're a writer. It's not about collaboration
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.800]   It's about the quality of the tools just depends well then it's then it's about responsiveness the problem if you're a writer
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.520]   It's about responsiveness which pages does not give you you know, you know, you know, so that's the issue
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:24.160]   There's an interesting thing like with a lot of these apps any any workflow that does not fit your use cases indistinguishable from bloat
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.880]   So if you use iTunes just to listen to beats one radio
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.560]   You don't understand why also the crap is in there
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.600]   And if you use it just to sync your iPod nano, you don't want all that Apple music stuff
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.800]   Why is that even there?
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.720]   And then you factor this in that iTunes isn't isn't made by the software organization
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.400]   It's not made by by Craig Federique's work. It's made by eddy q so is iWork
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.360]   So it's a bunch of other stuff
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.920]   So you have when you say apple software that doesn't mean just apple soft right where maybe someone in in
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.200]   Federique's organization would do a totally different job with the same task
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.120]   Well, and you know, we've we've kind of we've been talking
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.520]   I look like hunts haul over years
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.040]   We've been talking about this for years. Yeah
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.840]   And
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:10.560]   It's absolutely not a new suggestion that maybe it's certainly time I think for apple to break up iTunes into task specific apps
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.360]   I mean like like like you said that
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.720]   People use iTunes on windows to sync devices
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.320]   It's such a great opportunity to create a bespoke app just for that purpose and optimize it for that purpose
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:28.560]   Just just last week. I was doing a thing that involved me having to dip into iTunes and find the iTunes store
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.480]   I've been using this interface regularly for a couple of years
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:39.840]   And there's still that if you ever had that that moment of interaction where your hand has literally paused above the keyboard because
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.320]   You have to scan every single
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.560]   Dingbat on the entire user interface to think about where do I click to get to hear and it's always wrong
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:54.800]   And so it's just I mean it's there there. No, but no user should care about the complexity of apple's problem
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:01.200]   It's all about what experience am I going to get with this app and they're just getting bad experiences. Yeah
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.840]   apple has issued a
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.080]   Recall for their usb
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:11.920]   See charging cables actually it's a replacement program. I don't know if that's quite a recall
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.080]   And it doesn't affect all Mac books, but it is for the 2015 Mac books
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.800]   You can tell if your cable is affected if you look at your Mac book
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:25.040]   And it says designed by apple in california assembled in china and does not include a serial number
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.360]   After that text
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:32.880]   If you registered with a with a mailing address they'll mail you one by february automatically
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.680]   And if you didn't you couldn't go to the apple
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.400]   Retail store and make an appointment with a genius and they'll do the replacement
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:46.480]   As what a nightmare USB C cables have turned out to be I know it's it's it's flabbergasting we talked about it
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.480]   On twit. I think when was it that we talked about or a twig I guess
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:57.600]   Uh last week because of course benson huang who is and i'm sure i'm i'm sorry benson. I'm ruining your last name benson hong
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.880]   I don't know
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:03.760]   Uh who is a google engineer has been going on amazon. It's been wonderful reviewing USB C cables
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.880]   Uh because some can actually this the this recall doesn't mean that cable will damage your macbook
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.280]   It looks like it just won't charge or charge in a minute. Yeah
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:19.360]   Uh, but there are cables usb C cables are that out there that will damage your macbook by drawing too much power from it
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.280]   Uh, they don't there's there's there's not they're not all up to spec
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.800]   So, um, we were talking about this on wednesday. I should mention it here too since macbook users use type c cables
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.280]   um always make sure that you
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.520]   If if you're buying a cable online look for the look for benson approved
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:42.000]   Yeah, but that's that's such a hostile user experience. I know it's it's just it's flabbergasting
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.560]   We just told them why the mitt the apple store. Yeah, of course if you get him from apple you're not going to have a problem
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.320]   He said uh
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.840]   That he doesn't really test c to c cables because those all
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:19:01.040]   Um, those are they're they're not poorly made. It's the it's the it's the adapters that take go from c to old usb and stuff like that that are problematic
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.880]   They don't regulate the power. I think is the yes
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.480]   The reason just draws far too much power and that can actually hurt your macbook
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:12.080]   So don't charge something for instance, but but a c to c cable, which is actually what apple's replacing
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.720]   Uh those generally are okay
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.200]   So, um, you could if you're using somebody else's cable, i'm sure it's fine
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.840]   I don't know if it's fine, but you could I used I got every c
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.560]   Because I have a type c phone
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.200]   The pixel c is type c
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.640]   The pic cr the crumbok pixels type c and my macbook's pixel
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.400]   So I have enough c stuff now that I have us all the usbc do hickies
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.560]   It's sort of like that old comment. Don't use a rev-a board like we're so excited to get usbc
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.920]   But now we have to hash out all the problems with it same time. I'm I'm hoping to get a new mac
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.800]   I'm hoping they're gonna. That's a new macbook. I would really like so the thing is though that like the more you see about skylake
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.960]   The lesser is I know that's where uh, microsoft's problems are with skylake, right?
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.720]   And at the best of cases it sounds like the performance boost you get is negligible
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.880]   a few percent it's a single digit percentage point increase in in certain tasks and that to me like
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.860]   Problems plus that um, I'll be happy with pro
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.640]   Um
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.120]   Yeah, I wouldn't mind like I just want type c on both sides, right? That's all I want
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.240]   That's what the crumbok pixel does then you have you could charge on one side
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:24.560]   I even have a c cable for my um andi I bought that and I love it the samseling t-boy. Oh, yeah
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.400]   Yeah, oh man. I I bought the terabyte one. I have my my whole life is on this thing
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:35.520]   Yeah, I mean, it's it's it's been a bit of not I wouldn't say a game changer, but I've gone from
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.560]   Bringing a terabyte external drive if I think i'm gonna need it to just always having it
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.680]   I should I should point out that uh some uh twitter followers
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:50.720]   Pointed out that samselong has announced but not ship or given a price yet on a usb c version of that same drive
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.080]   Uh, but I can't imagine it's gonna be cheaper than 165
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   Or two terabytes
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.760]   Yeah, but come on and do you know you want it?
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.200]   I think you should definitely buy one. Oh, I will
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:08.960]   You should definitely buy one and tell me how you like it. I even have a minecraft server on here in case I ever want to just play minecraft
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:15.280]   Yeah, that's a ter that's all my documents from my uh, my 5k macbook mac uh retina. Now. I
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.400]   A number of people tweeted after you recommended this
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:23.920]   Uh and appropriately that was it 95 max somebody said as you did
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.960]   Uh, I'm not a mac observer mac observer
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:33.200]   I don't trust this thing because you have to tell samselong drivers on it on the mac to use it and on windows by the way to use it
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.280]   Well, you don't but you don't have to you have to to wipe it though, right?
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.600]   Well, what it is is that this is a standard it's a standard drive
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:49.440]   However, it supports two brand new uh, uh storage feature low level storage features that macOS does not support yet
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.920]   So if you want smart, if you want smart if you also want this new
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:01.120]   Uh, s this this new uh, solid state protocol that will make certain kind of rights and reads faster
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:07.680]   But not necessarily in all cases then you want those two drivers the stupid thing that I think samselong did was making it
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:13.840]   So that the only visible partition on the ship drive is the 128 megabyte partition that just has the installer on it
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.600]   Well, I can tell you why they did that. I know why they did that for the encryption
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.720]   So that's so but that's that's something standard for pretty much every drive
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.760]   But there's so many drive almost every drive that has supports encryption
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.520]   Will have some sort of thing that it wants you to walk through in order to get the encryption working
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.520]   And I initially took it off. I did what you did
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.680]   Which is I installed it on just one mac wiped it made it terabyte drive
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:41.600]   And then I looked at all the whole this encryption solutions out there and it ended up putting the samselong software back on it because
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.560]   Uh, it's you certainly you don't want to carry around. I mean I got the big one which means my whole life is on here
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.880]   I don't want to carry that around unencrypted
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:54.960]   Be easy enough to why and does it does it affect speed to have it? No, I looked at benchmarks. It does not
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.400]   That's another reason you use a samselong kernel extension
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.480]   I agree with you and he may be nervous to put a samselong kernel extension on my mac
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.600]   But they say it's based on apples open source drivers
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.240]   Yeah, I looked at the I looked at the drivers
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.680]   I don't know if I don't mind knows in front of me
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:15.120]   But I wouldn't put it on my own computer if I weren't able to trust the drivers or weren't able to remove them
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:20.640]   There are actually instructions on how to remove the drivers right in the read me doc that comes up on the on the samselong installer
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.480]   So if you don't want it
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.720]   It is it is annoying you run the installer
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:30.800]   It'll be then the entire terabyte will be visible and then at that point you can just simply run disk utility reformat it
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.120]   It also ships. It's a fat volume, which is what most
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.560]   Uh drive ship as you can reformat as a mac OS journal
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.640]   Uh volume and then at that point if you want to remove the drivers by all means remove the drivers
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.560]   I decided I opted to stick with the drivers. I put it on all my max
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:50.880]   Uh in fact, I like hfs plus so much that I formatted it that way and bought paragons
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.240]   Uh driver for windows so I can use it on a windows machine
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.240]   Um, and so you'll see here what's happening if you look at my screen
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.960]   Uh, you plug in the t1 and you get this little it's this is the 128
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.760]   um, meg gig part when is 128 gigs 128 mags. I can't remember
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.840]   Meg partition
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.680]   Uh, then Annie said and that's what all you see
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:18.800]   Because what's on there is the mac and windows uh software to unlock it and then you enter your password here and it unlocks it
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.280]   And you don't you can show it because it's salt. It's just dots
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.840]   Uh, and then and then at that point you see it mounts the full terabyte, which is awesome
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.440]   And now it's transparent and I can continue to use it until I unmount it
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.160]   Um, I think it's just really
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.120]   Yeah, the only the only advice I always
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:44.000]   The advice I give to anybody who encrypts an external drive is make sure you're only using that for data that you are religiously backing up
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.240]   Oh, yeah, because the only thing you you don't think especially on an ssd
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.000]   You're not giving up a lot of speed, but it's something that is a problem with a mechanical drive
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.760]   But it does mean that if you do lose the password and remember you might put this in storage for a couple of years and forget about it
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.760]   But then want to get it back
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:03.360]   Uh, you you really can't get get data back off of an encrypted drive if you don't have the password or if something happens
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.240]   That's what you want. I mean, that makes me happy to know that
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:13.120]   I do have I do have certain volumes that are encrypted because I will have like financial data on them
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:18.960]   But there are number like literally like 10 feet away from me. I have a briefcase and a briefcase that has
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:23.280]   Just nothing but like a dozen dozen and a half different like pocket and external drives
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:29.840]   Because I do I try to be careful about migrating photos and documents from one machine to another when I upgrade hard drives
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.080]   Upgate great computers, but the number of times where I need something from
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.880]   2007 and if I were a lot more clever, I would have a folder on a server mark
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.280]   2007 photos, but I'm not clever
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:47.360]   But thank goodness I have a firewire external drive that is unencrypted that I have I don't need to get the password for
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.600]   That can just plug in
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.600]   And get back everything that I had in 2007
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.880]   So it's it's it's fun
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.520]   You have to manage all of the problems that might be in your workflow
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.520]   One of them might be dropping your fat drive and getting it stolen another might be
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.920]   forgetting that
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.840]   That that prawn salad cocktail is supposed to be your password, but you keep getting the
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:11.520]   You see the the number ones and numbers zeros wrong and so you keep thinking that you're gonna have to lose all your data
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.800]   I'm just so happy it's not a portable platter with a super high failure rate anymore
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.000]   Which used to happen all exactly and it's bus powered terabyte
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.240]   I mean you don't have to get the terabyte. I you can get there's 256 and 512. I think or what actually they
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.880]   Kind of nicely
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:30.240]   I had three fail in a month once it was just unbelievable and that's it. This is so much better. See gate. Yeah. Yeah
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.520]   Well, this is the Samsung evo 950 850
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:40.000]   This is an SSD that is considered widely considered to be the best on the market or at least one of the top two on the market
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.680]   And has been used happily in many of my systems
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.600]   For years a couple of years. So it's a good. It's this a good drive
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.600]   My failure point
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.360]   Is has been ever since I started using backbooks that have internal SSDs
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.720]   I'm used to just being able to pick it up and carry it off without
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:02.800]   Having to look for a blinking light to stop and the number of times I've almost lost like a half a terabyte of data
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.680]   Because I forgot that I had a spinning hard drive full of like backed up photos connected
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.960]   I'll actually lift it up. I'll be half off the sofa
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:17.360]   They're like if not for the fact that I plugged in a three foot long USB cable. I'd be very very sad right now
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.880]   Yep
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.520]   But you don't you have to care about it when the external is an SSD as well
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:26.720]   Yeah, especially traveling in bags and going to shows and things those discs we just get battered around and now it's so great
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:32.800]   I keep my bitcoin wallet on here my one password vault on here my pgp keys on here
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:38.640]   So it needs to be encrypted, but that yeah having that in your pocket is great and my minecraft server
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:45.040]   I need to be encrypted definitely because no one wants to be no one wants to mess with your pyramid
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.960]   Hack them hack in my pyramid man. Don't be hacking my pyramid
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.000]   I even have
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.920]   Images for my windows 10 install. It's so big
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.920]   It's
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.000]   Yeah, we have a when you have a terabyte you can also put like virtual machines for just about everything
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.200]   Yes, and so it's like I love this is why when I bought the ipad pro
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:13.600]   I didn't even consider getting anything less than the largest amount of storage I could have because the real power of
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:19.680]   Of these devices is when you don't even have to ask yourself should I have this data on here
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.640]   When it's like I can definitely have a windows 10 and a windows 7 virtual machine
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.200]   On this on this drive because who knows maybe I'll want to actually run either one of those
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:35.920]   If I had like the 256 gig or the 512 or maybe thinking okay, well that might leave less room for movies or what if I get known of
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:40.640]   Forget it. You're getting it. This is the this is the this is like a wish that gives you infinite wishes
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:47.280]   I probably should have brought this up in the pick section, but uh, I just I've
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:52.960]   Just so thrilled that you recommended this and I and I just looking after looking at the mac observer column and everything
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.760]   I'm gonna I'm just I know it's a stupid thing to do, but I'm just gonna trust the same sunk extensions and
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:03.360]   Put them on all my machines and and live with that. Yeah, I I was called my attention was called to that
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.200]   Again, I've got people listening people are nice enough to like offer comments or something
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.000]   Yeah, we appreciate that by the way that was that's great. No, that's that's absolutely but the minimum two brains
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.880]   On a problem will definitely make things better
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:20.800]   I had to notice that the main column was written like january of last year
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.760]   January, February of last year also
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.840]   Um, I wish that the author had gone into a little bit more depth
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.120]   About saying well here's what I noticed so I tried this and this is what happened
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.640]   It really seemed like I was scared off by custom drivers so I stopped
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:39.680]   Right, and i'll follow it will follow up later on and unfortunately the article itself didn't have a link to the follow up
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:45.360]   Uh, but that's the problems that he the problems that he or she brought up are things that anybody would be thinking of
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.360]   Uh, and I hope that I had addressed them when I talked about it last week, but apparently not
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.560]   Well, no, you did. I think you absolutely did but but sometimes you have to kind of underscore
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.840]   Well, and also I think it's what kind of thing you loop back you go. Oh now I know what any was now I oh
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.600]   Oh, I see what he's saying. You can't mount this
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:10.560]   It's it's like when we were talking about sous vide and we had to say yes, you're cooking chicken at 140 degrees
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:18.080]   Which is 25 degrees below the safe level. I'm telling you it'll be okay. Okay. Yes, it's pink looking chicken
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:24.640]   But i'm telling you it's safe to eat you're okay if you if you get skeaved up by this, but i'm telling you it should be safe to eat
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:31.680]   Uh, let's say let's take a break and come back with more andy and i go here from the chicago sun times rene richy
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.480]   from imore.com
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.760]   And the lovely and talented alix lindsey from the warehouse
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:45.200]   Is uh, you should really have some of these uh, these livestock jugging gloves there in a warehouse. Yeah, we can get some
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.720]   cattle right out the other side took the digits there. You don't want to get
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.640]   Want to leave behind any finger prints the things that you can go in on
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.400]   Promet
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.400]   I showed it. They brought to you by fresh books man
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:05.360]   They were a revelation for me when I found out about fresh books 10 years ago since then five million people have adopted the fresh books way
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.640]   Yes, the fresh books way if you're a freelancer a small business you're sending out invoices
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.200]   You got to keep track all this stuff
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.720]   Man, oh man. It's I know it's no fun on the other hand
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:22.880]   Don't invoice then you don't get paid and as much as you love what you do. You don't want to do it for free
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:28.160]   Uh, when I found out about fresh books I started using it to send out my invoices. I got paid faster
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.560]   It helped me do multiple currencies
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:36.320]   Which is it could do all the currencies automatically for you translate them if you're keeping track of hours
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:42.240]   You can use the fresh books app to track the hours get it right into the invoice same thing with the receipts
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:49.120]   Now I always had to bill for expenses. That was another pain to go to the pick up all the receipts and figure them all out and put them in a spreadsheet now
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.760]   Fresh books just does it
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.840]   It's awesome
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.200]   You'll be creating and sending invoices in minutes. You'll get paid online
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:02.640]   Right away with fresh books payments built into the invoice that your client just picks clicks a button
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.800]   And takes their pick of online payment, uh, you know all the big online payment
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:12.000]   Procedures which is nice because they want to it's a pain for them too. They just want to pay you
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.840]   You get paid faster with fresh books. You can even get paid up front now
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.880]   They have this new feature you can request a deposit in fresh books
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:24.400]   And they kind of hold it for you. No more covering costs out of pocket or waiting to the end of the project you get paid
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:29.280]   They just announced their card reader. This is great for people who work in the home like a plumber or
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:36.480]   Contractor home inspector installer, uh, you know, you set up. Let's say you set up a home theater systems
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.880]   You get the fresh books software on your phone
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.000]   You can actually present the estimate to the customer right there get their approval do the work
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.560]   Present the invoice to them right there and get paid right there with their card reader
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.640]   It's emv enabled which means it does chips as well as a stripe
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:59.280]   So you can dip the chips wipe the stripe your client can and pay you right away
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:05.520]   It's of course email and amble too. So you do that you do the the uh, you know the invoicing they send it send you the receipt
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.520]   And it's just it's so nice
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.840]   This is the way to work
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:14.000]   Fresh books calm. I love it because fresh books really is out there to empower the freelancer

[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:52.080]   So, uh, let's see here let's move along to something else on the rundown. Thank you Jason clanthes for lining up all of our
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.880]   articles today
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:34:00.160]   Apple is going to uh step into fashion actually some would argue apples already stepped into fashion
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.960]   Oh, they stepped in and all right

[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:41.920]   the costumes
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:46.240]   And uh apple, I guess because of the apple watch which has gotten them into the uh business
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:50.000]   They have a lot of fashion people on staff now at every level of the company

[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:49.760]   Tim Hortons joke to all the Americans watching no one knows what you're talking about but it got us all talking like that for a while
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:55.520]   Here's uh, he's saying me acky's flying saucer dress machine pleated
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.600]   I
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:02.640]   Want to think that if you look at you know, I think the watch is getting 90s. Yeah, looks like rainbows
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.280]   Right
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.880]   Yeah
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.960]   And I think that we could we the watch is probably the beginning of wearables for apple
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:15.920]   It's probably not the not the only thing that they're they're thinking about at least whether it actually comes out or not
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.880]   I think that you know wearable technology and uh
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:25.120]   Connected technology I think is going to be something that we're going to see a lot more of glasses watches even you know stuff on arm
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.760]   I'm excited about herables. We had somebody on the on Saturday on the new screen savers who
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:37.440]   Used uh laser to scan my ear in sides and made in a throughout a 3d printer made the mold
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:42.960]   Uh for the uh here the earpiece, but this company uh, it's doing this
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:49.360]   Uh, and they did that all in kind of like within the hour of the show the company that there's the uh, there's there's my ear
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.960]   There's a model of my ear
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:56.560]   But the company that's doing this is going to do a kickstarter in the next month or so where they'll do the same thing
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.040]   But it will have a eege
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.680]   Monitor built in and I was I was talking to the founder and he said, you know, you're so close
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:10.160]   to the uh, uh, very thin membrane to the blood that it's easy to do things like blood oxygen
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.600]   eege
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.360]   He says we can do a glucose monitor that's noninvasive with this
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.920]   Technology we can do
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.160]   Of course heart rate blood pressure
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:26.160]   Uh, I think I and I like this idea. I like the idea because we all wear headphones all the time
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.680]   Of a headphone and in your headphone. That's also
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:35.200]   Everything of apple, you know fitbit or apple watch could do from the health point of you and more
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:40.640]   Well, it's interesting organization that does health not like so his his mandate is not just apple watch
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:46.720]   It's health products in general and there's a decoupling of watch from health because you have to get a lot of government approval for that
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:52.240]   So a watch goes to market. Yeah, as soon as you're measuring that stuff you've got to get FDA approval if it's going to use
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:57.120]   Yeah, so there might be devices that they're working on that do require that stuff that now that they're decoupled from the watch
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.720]   There's no pressure to get them done. They'll just they'll be done when they're ready and they'll get all the prerequisite
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.720]   And now we understand why they bought beats
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:08.080]   Well, I mean there's that there's wearables and there's projectiles and both those are going to be huge because you start like
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:13.440]   When you start taking screens software can live anywhere does not to live on the device that it's resident on and once you have those two things
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:19.360]   Your watch has a very tiny screen, but you walk into certain contexts and maybe that watch can take over the big display in your car or something
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.960]   And then you start having a really interesting future where you're not bound to any one device
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.880]   Yeah, and as you as you pair, you know, and a lot of times we think of these as hearing aids
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:31.920]   But they're really you know these hearing devices, you know right now most of us when we have our you know some kind of headset
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.080]   That's blocking off that ear. What if that is actually something that doesn't block it off?
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:40.960]   It's something we leave in a lot as you would with you know, so you're with healthy hearing
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:45.120]   You just have you have healthy hearing, but you also have an ear, you know an earpiece in there
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:49.520]   And it's getting everything from the outside world in the same way that your other ear is getting it
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.680]   You have control over it with your with your watch
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.280]   You you know so you can decide what you know where you want it to go
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:00.320]   But when someone makes a phone call it kind of keeps you being ever present to all the other things
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:04.960]   You might want to use headphones for whether it's watching a movie or watch it. You're not like oh, I'm gonna put a hit
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.800]   I'm gonna put my earpiece in I'm just you know
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:11.920]   It's just going to you know pair to whatever it needs to pair to or whatever I choose to pair it to to
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.440]   You know to get that alternative audio track for my life
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.280]   The coder press is a button and all of a sudden his noise canceling he can go back to work
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:26.400]   Right. Yeah, if you combine if you combine something like that with you know with some kind of augmented reality for your eyes
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:30.640]   You know at least over one eye or or over both it becomes something where you're kind of half in
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.240]   You know it starts to blend the real world and the virtual world pretty seamlessly
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:40.880]   Motorola had a really nice product last year called the Moto hint that was a super super small
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:45.120]   Blue tooth earpiece so small that you really had to look
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:49.040]   At the right angle to even notice that someone had it in and even there
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:54.640]   It didn't look like a guy with a it earpiece in and part of was not just that was a bluetooth earpiece
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:59.760]   But also that it had a capacitive pad on it so that you could kind of like a start-track communicator
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.040]   Tap it and then talk to serie or tap it and then talk to
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:09.360]   Google now and that is a real natural way for you to interface with the stuff particularly serie
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:14.880]   When you think about it not just as a voice command system, but as a platform for running apps that have no
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:21.280]   Touch or visual user interface so much of what we can do can be done just simply by tapping that button
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:26.960]   Activating serie and just saying serie, please do this thing for me or serie. Please give me this one scrap of information
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.760]   So you think about
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:33.680]   situations in which just holding looking at your watch is even too much to ask for
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:38.000]   All I want to know is what's the temperature right now as i'm getting dressed
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.240]   And that's a good that's a good fit for so much of what's being done
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:47.120]   I for one i'm really looking forward to it. I think
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:52.160]   In-ear monitors since we all listen to music a lot will be the least obtrusive
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:57.840]   Of course, there's you know laws against driving with them and so forth. Maybe just one ear or yeah
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:03.360]   They'd have to they I think they'd really have to get it perfect to make it completely audio transparent when you want it to be
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.600]   Right. I can't remember did Christina Warren once right about these new headphones
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.760]   She had where it was exactly like that where it's passing it's blocking your ears
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.440]   But it's passing through
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.920]   Sound from the outside with filters if you enable them
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:22.800]   Uh, and so that essentially that's completely transparent to whatever outside sound is because number problem number one is
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.920]   Making an earpiece that's comfortable enough that you would want to wear it all day long
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:33.920]   Problem two is making it safe so that you could wear it all day long without pushing earwax deeper deeper into the ear canal
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.120]   But then number three would be I would certainly not wear it
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:42.320]   Unless I had a specific instance in which this was the perfect solution to the problem
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.280]   This is the same situation which I have with my google glass over there
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.280]   I do still wear it and still do still use it
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:52.000]   But only in those situations in which I would absolutely know that this is going to be
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.680]   A good google glass situation and this sort of tech is only good
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.520]   If it just like a wristwatch is something that you pick up and you put on every day
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.440]   Whether you think you're going to need it services or not
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:06.640]   Uh speaking of beats
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:15.200]   Uh, it looks like there's another reason why apple acquired beats for their extremely fabulous relationship with dr. Dre
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.120]   He's going to be filming
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.800]   Or is filming right now apples first scripted television series what?
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.640]   You've talked about this a lot, Alex in fact we talked about it on tWitt on sunday
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.840]   So I I beg your pardon for asking you to repeat but
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:35.440]   This is app something we've thought apples should do all along with all their cash is do what netflix did do what amazon's doing is
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:41.680]   Absolutely, and it looks like they're staying very it looks like they may keep this not focused on apple tv
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:47.600]   Or or any of the other product but really music and having possibly an exclusive content just for music
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:53.600]   Which if they use this as an example and then use it as a sell piece between the stuff they did with taylor swift and and
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   In this case
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.760]   It really starts to build up a you know if they're willing to throw money at building content for bands that is exclusive to to apple music
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.120]   That is going to be something that I think is going to be very compelling
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:13.040]   That's a good point. This really is aimed at at the music fans at the drei fans. In fact, it's going to be
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:17.200]   uh written and produced by the creator of uh empire
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:23.680]   Which is a fictional show about a rap mogul. This is apparently going to be kind of based on dr. Dre's life
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.160]   six episodes
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.840]   Each
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.480]   This is weird, but we'll have to see how it works each episode
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:35.600]   Not a comedy by the way. This is a drama. No half hour based on an emotion
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.160]   and how
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:43.680]   A different emotion for each episode how drei's character deals with it sam rockwell will be in it momer cray will be in it
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:49.440]   Uh and and this is kind of a surprise from apple. It's going to be adult
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:55.120]   Um, no shortage according to the hollywood reporter, which got the scoop of violence and sex
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:44:03.280]   The reporter said an episode filming last monday and tuesday featured an extended orgy scene with naked extras simulating sex in the
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.080]   in a mansion
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.280]   Dr. Dre was not there, but his wife nichole young apparently was
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.640]   Dr. Dr not a surprise from dr. Dre a surprise from apple
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.800]   Yeah, I mean here's this is the company that banned any kind of adult
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.520]   content on its app store
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:24.000]   But on its app store, but not on but definitely not on the on apple tv
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.400]   But it is very odd that this they picked this as one of their first things. I maybe I feel like it's a signal
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.680]   Yeah, it's a signal. I think it's a positioning to the bands like, you know, you know
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.000]   We're gonna come to you and talk to you about stuff and nothing's really off
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.080]   You know off limits nothing bothers bands more than this notion of being censored, right? Right? Right?
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.000]   and
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.160]   Yeah, I mean apple apple pioneer the explicit tag and I actually give them a lot of credit for that
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:51.920]   Because in most cases you have a choice. This has always been the case in rap music you get the radio version or the album version
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:59.680]   Um, but even for podcasts, you know, and we try very hard to uh, not have the explicit tag because we want to make it family friendly
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:05.360]   For give me a sense of this one said before but this seems very similar to an flicks or hbo model where you want to have programming
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:11.600]   That is so good that people come and subscribe to your service and they need mo they need uh apple music subscriptions
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:18.080]   And if adres show or a drake thing drives those subscriptions and it's absolutely worth our while to produce that content and apple
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:23.280]   There is a music video component to that and the music video could quickly become a short form serial content
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:27.920]   And then people want to watch dra they have to watch it on apple music suddenly apple music subscriptions go up
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.280]   One and and it makes sense at the beginning of this go ahead
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.840]   Well, it makes sense as a music product
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:38.800]   Because if you already have a relationship with them with the the music product that apple
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:45.680]   Creates and if you are bringing fans of a specific genre and fans of a specific creator
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:50.640]   That makes a little bit more sense than the scenarios that we've been talking about for a while before
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:55.360]   I still find it difficult to understand a pitch that apple could make to uh, uh, uh, uh,
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:02.000]   A well-known established producer or well-known established actor to say here is why you want the relatively narrow audience of
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:09.280]   Of apple users as opposed to netflix and get everybody or hulu and get everybody or youtube and get everyone
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:16.720]   Everybody, uh, youtube was a google was a very very loud last night of the grammys about talked about its original
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:20.160]   Uh, youtube red content which are original series
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:26.080]   Mostly based on people who are already very popular youtube contributors. That's a natural
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:30.240]   Extension for youtube to get into to start sponsoring their own content
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.160]   Like I said, I I don't think that's a silly idea for apple to get into this
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:40.800]   As I said, I just have difficulty imagining the pitch that apple can make to someone who has not yet been turned down by netflix
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.600]   And hulu that here is why you should take our money
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:49.600]   It would have to be a big truckload of money and it would have to be to the right creator that would be even
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.400]   Valuable for apple to get
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:57.600]   The other way like what if they they said like we want to drive subscription is apple music we have dreons dapp
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.760]   Let's see what we can do with dre. We have a relationship with dreke
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:03.680]   Let's see if we can get some people to make a dreke like I think instead of trying to find a creator
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.320]   And then seeing if they'll be willing to make something for apple tv
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:11.920]   I think they're going to very carefully spec out what they think are the biggest opportunities to convert apple music subscriptions
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.960]   Then design programming around the personalities. I think they can do that
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:22.000]   And I think that they're going to also look at at at the at the specific audiences that have very very intense
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.960]   Followings, you know, so um, you know that there's there and there's some bands that can command a lot
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.520]   You look at a band like fish, which isn't really super well known
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:34.160]   But has people that are paying for every one of those concerts to watch, you know to watch their shows
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.560]   You have obviously taylor swift
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:42.480]   You could see a katie parry fitting into that model and you could see a variety of other folks that if you can add
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:50.480]   20 30,000 subscribers even for a month to to watch some exclusive content then some percentage of them are going to forget to turn it off
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.000]   They're going to decide that music is is cool
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.600]   Um, you know, I mean the biggest selling point for music in my opinion
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.880]   It's just the fact that
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:04.000]   Effortlessly you can ask your phone to play something, you know, you know, and and it's really changing the world
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.680]   You saw if you watched the the grammys you saw them pleading
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.160]   Not to stream music
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:14.080]   We only get a fraction of a cent. What was your guys reaction to that?
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:20.960]   That was historically funny because the way they let into that is that and we need to take a stand against business practices that are
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.200]   That don't put money in the hands of creators
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:28.080]   And i'm like, let's go to their history of music since the days of the wax cylinder
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:33.600]   Your entire business is based on seeing what you can charge against the car the accounts of the creators
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:38.000]   Making sure you cheat them out of their royalties cheat them out of their copyright and now you're saying
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.040]   Yeah
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:44.640]   Just because this just because streaming is preventing you from buying your third boat as an as a music executive
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:48.000]   Now suddenly you're really concerned about creators. Nice one
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.960]   I'm really wondering what
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:56.000]   Normal people thought when they saw that I mean is that going to make people stop using apple music and spotify and
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.400]   and what does apple do by the way because
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:03.760]   Apples wants to be tight with the musicians with apple music, but they're doing streaming
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:07.360]   But they're arguing they're they're they're they're they're
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:13.680]   They're only charging for it. I think a lot of those folks that you know when people said so it's the free streaming tier. They don't like
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:19.520]   Yeah, I mean that's no, it's not because they said here's a penny. Here's what we get of that penny
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:26.160]   That's the paid tier they're talking about. Well, so the thing is that what everybody uses an example is
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:34.000]   Is Pandora, which is the lowest paid which by the way is looking for somebody to buy them because they are working
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:40.080]   It's hard. We're gonna lose Pandora. We're gonna lose sound cloud. We're we're gonna lose title or something
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.080]   I don't know what's happening over there
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:48.160]   New streams to counteract the cost the only companies it'll stay in this are amazon google apple
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.040]   And maybe micros up because they don't need to make money on it
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:58.240]   Maybe like a samseung eventually someone who's I don't know, you know, uh, nokia got out of sold off their mix and now line killed it
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.760]   today and
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.840]   Uh, I I won samseung's killed its milk music store. I think that the
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.520]   I go when we
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:10.320]   When we think about the number of times we've listened to an album, you know, there's certain albums definitely that that I've listened to
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.080]   And you think about that someone getting paid per play before I made it
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:20.240]   You know, I made an agreement with the band for, you know, $9.99. I bought zinnyadamandata from the police
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:25.920]   And I then proceeded to listen to it a thousand times, you know, and they weren't getting paid every single time I you know, listen to
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:31.040]   You know man in a suitcase. They they were they were learning they were you know getting paid once
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:36.160]   And so you know and and part of the reason that the money, you know, we're kind of in this middle ground
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:42.240]   Um, where you know the free the free tiers. I think we're probably not good for the artists. I think that
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.480]   Oh
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.480]   Oh, we lost how so many people
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.680]   Somebody in the warehouse the music industry got
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:55.680]   It's funny though because you hear this from all the universities all the time like teachers don't have enough money
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:59.440]   You know the first responders don't have enough money and now artists don't have enough money
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.840]   It's almost like the world is and I don't want to i'm a creator
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.960]   I want to get paid for all the content that I create but at the other hand it is, you know
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:10.640]   This is a problem every industry have they had so much money for so long a period of time that the idea of normalizing is
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.400]   Paralyzing they do remember Leo at one point when it went to digital they were like
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.800]   Well, if you want to listen in your car, you've got to license it again
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:21.680]   They want to listen on your own player. You got a license and they thought that was justified and the world is telling them no
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:25.040]   We like we like listening to your music, but this is the new value
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.520]   We're going to ascribe it and we're sorry that it's not billions
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:32.560]   But again, look at what teachers get paid. There's uh, I just learned this uh economic term
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.760]   Uh called rent seeking
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:41.200]   It's uh means seeking to increase your share of existing wealth without creating new wealth
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.360]   It's essentially what the record labels do with with their catalog
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:50.480]   We've already spent the money to make it. We've already gotten paid for it. Let's see how we can make more money
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.480]   I've bought star wars in so many formats exactly
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:01.120]   Uh, it's rent seeking and once you start seeing this you see it in all over the place and it's really uh not good
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.000]   for uh society
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:12.000]   Um because it's it's uh economic efficiency is reduced by it's it's really interesting. Anyway, I'm just there
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.960]   We got Alex back. What happened? Do you have a power outage there?
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:18.960]   Oh now he has no audio we just uh
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:25.520]   Or Alex
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.560]   I wonder if lifetime customer value has really changed that much though
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.160]   Because like you some people just wouldn't buy it
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.560]   They'd buy it once like Alex said and just listen to it over and over again
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:38.160]   And that ends up being pennies for us play. Yeah, but nonetheless it's there's there's different dynamics to this
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:42.480]   Uh, if I the the vhs that I bought of the original star wars
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:49.840]   It still works. I can still put it in a vhs player and still play it in in beautiful two channel high fi
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.320]   Uh at vhs resolution
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:59.760]   Uh, they if it's it's not dumb or it's not dumb or uh or or scummy for them to say
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:03.520]   Now now that there is a dvd format that's more convenient
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:07.280]   We're going to sell this in dvd format and then when there's a high definition format
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.880]   Now we're going to sell it on blue ray
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:13.600]   And because now they're people who would much rather simply not have to deal with physical media at all
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:17.120]   We will sell it to people who want to buy it as a digital title and have it streaming
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:21.520]   Um, it's when you it's the the trouble is when a company is not
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:26.000]   Taking taking notice of how people have changed their relationship to the product
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.800]   Uh, those early days of digital music. I mean when sony had their digital locker system
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:37.040]   Where the first thing it did when you you needed it's special to use the special new sony digital music player
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:41.760]   You needed to install the sony special digital music library app and when you install it
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:45.920]   The special library app the first thing it would do is say oh, I see that you have 600
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:46.960]   And uh
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:51.680]   mp3's we're gonna we're gonna transmogrify without asking you to our special locked up format
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.880]   And if you want to use it on the player, we're gonna have to make you lock it out of the desktop version
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:02.160]   And that was nothing more than their attempt to say well, we can finally we can finally remake this industry
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.120]   So we have more control and they'll have no alternative
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:12.240]   But to buy several different copies for each different to form every different place they want to listen to it and and the people said wow
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:17.600]   If only it's just too bad. There's nothing that there's no source for us to download music and like hey wait a minute
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:21.600]   There is so we don't have to deal with your your bull great. Goodbye
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.560]   And so this this is the sort of stuff that happens when they simply try to ask people pretty please
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:31.920]   We know that every every scrap of data that we're being given says that you don't want to buy music anymore
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:36.800]   You want to buy access to a library, but pretty pretty pretty please don't do that
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:42.400]   Or at least the the other half the argument that they're making that made sense was that they're trying to make deals
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:46.080]   So to make to make sure that they're not just simply letting you have the white album
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:51.200]   Uh, they're not they're not letting uh apple music or a service have the white album for for for nothing
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:55.920]   That there must be a way that if something is responsible for you know half of the plays
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:00.560]   Of a given month there has to be a proportional amount of money that they're getting for it
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:06.000]   That's not that that that offsets the the amount of money. They're not getting for actually doing physical album sales
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   It has it has to be worth their while
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.440]   It's funny. John august was saying that uh, it's best for a screenwriter if you rent and not buy because their deal
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.960]   They make more money on a rental than they do if you actually buy the thing. Hmm. Yeah
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:23.200]   That's well, that's that's just double crazy when you every time there's a brand new negotiation between the different creative unions
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:26.960]   And you find out all the different things the industry is demanding that
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:30.160]   Writers and performers give back to them
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:36.960]   Uh, the the last big writer strike was all about how we don't think that we don't want to we don't want to pay you for any
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:42.320]   Digital retransmission of anything that you do because we're gonna determine that that's just it's all promotional
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:46.000]   And meanwhile they're investing the these networks are investing
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:52.960]   Hundreds of millions of dollars and new streaming services because they don't make any money off of that. It's all just promotional
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.280]   Uh, and if it's just terrible
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:00.480]   Well, and I think the the pay per view it. Am I coming through? Okay now? Yeah, I sent great. Yeah
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.920]   Um
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:07.360]   The uh, the pay per view is going to eventually make a lot of sense. It may not make sense right now
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:14.480]   Um, but it is uh going to eventually pay off. I think when you have a hundred million people all in one service or a hundred
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.480]   Million people in two services
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.240]   Uh in the current way of we're gonna cut it up every different way we can possibly do it
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.600]   It's not making it's not working, but it's still a brand new market
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:27.680]   And I think that you know they figured out how to make money with advertise and they just haven't figured out the other
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:34.560]   The other parts yet, but I think apple coming into it and getting I mean apple's gonna have 20 million users by the end of the year
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:38.480]   You know and I think that you know and probably 50 million by the next the end of the next year
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:42.000]   I mean it's it looks like I have to say apple music is a success isn't it?
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:48.560]   It is and they have 11 million subscribers now is that the number now the pie? It turns out you subscribe success
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:52.480]   That's true. I mean like that's true
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.880]   It's definitely they're much bigger than they were
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:58.160]   Yeah, it's definitely not and yes, not a fair. Yeah
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:03.840]   Just the convenience of it will get them to 20 million. I mean regardless of whether the features work
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.160]   I mean, I'll tell you there's a couple things about it. Uh the
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:11.600]   Search, you know, you're listening to a song and you want to see other bands like this band spotify is still
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:15.520]   Way better. That's my argument. Okay. Maybe you're only getting a penny
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.400]   But you didn't get much for radio airplane either
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:23.920]   Exactly. Uh, this is how people find you and I think the record industry has decided that
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:28.320]   Streaming isn't as good as radio airplane. Well, you better start to sit up and
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:32.000]   Take notice because I think it's a huge background problem
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   There's a huge background problem too because if you remember they were going to sue best by an apple
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.200]   For the use of their cover art on on the store shelves
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:43.760]   Uh, which is crazy when you think about it, but they they got so little money from the labels
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:46.240]   And they felt and there was no way they could get more money from the labels
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:49.200]   They were desperate to get it from anybody and you still see that today
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:53.600]   They they were so maltreated by the middle people in that business relationship for so long
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.040]   They're desperate to get any sort of revenue
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:59.600]   They can and apple and the other streaming providers are a new source of you know opportunity for that
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:02.560]   So if they're saying buy it that money is not really going to go to them anyway
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:05.440]   But it sort of prevents the frustration they've had with their legacy system
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:11.040]   Well, and I think the other thing is we have to remember that these these artists are getting a fraction of what the labels are getting
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.680]   So the label is getting paid x amount of pennies per
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:20.000]   Perplay, you know and then and then the artist is getting a hundredth of that or or or at least a fifth or a sixth
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.920]   Or whatever very very small numbers of that
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:29.280]   When you have a service like apple that could actually fund development when you have people who are actually producers that work at the company
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:35.760]   Uh when apple gets to 20 30 40 million how quickly are they going to start saying we can do your album
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:40.560]   You know, we can you know, we can go to a taylor swift or maybe not taylor swift immediately
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:45.280]   But to a to an artist that is well known and say we'll just introduce the album
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:51.680]   Yeah, exactly you'll but what happens when we give you the package where we'll record your album. We'll pay for that
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:54.720]   We will do your you know video
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:57.280]   We will do a special movie about you
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:02.480]   You know, these are all things that that could be you know that that apple is uniquely positioned to
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:07.760]   To pay for and it'll be a long time before apples and i'm in opulent position, you know
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:11.520]   Um in this in this area so you know spotify succeeding and
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:15.600]   You know a lot of the other services is you know allows apple to kind of
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:20.400]   Experiment in that area in a way that they probably can't if they were you know 90 percent of the market
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:26.240]   I keep wondering if maybe the music industry maybe even later the the tv and the movie industry
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:32.400]   Are going to go in the direction that say web comics went into where uh for the entire history of comic strips
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:37.200]   It would be you have to get signed by a major syndicate because they control access to the readers through
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:41.840]   Selling your strip to newspapers and then newspapers started going down the toilet
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:45.520]   And and hope but people still liked the product of a comic strip
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:50.080]   So you have creators like scott kurtz with pvp online and the folks who do penny arcade
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:55.440]   Who had the ability to given that they have the ability to put the product directly in front of the reader's eyes through the web
[00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:00.800]   Uh, they don't need to they don't need to sign up with some sort of a middleman that wanted to start
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:06.000]   Creating a syndicate of web comics. They could just simply create a one-to-one relationship with their reader
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.760]   They typically team up with somebody who's not an artist but is an MBA who really knows how to run a business like that
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:17.440]   So i'm wondering how long it's going to be before the people who are growing up right now or are getting into the business right now
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:23.040]   Are thinking that the very last thing that I would ever want to do was sign with a label because why would I want them to take
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:26.960]   That much out of my out of my pocket every single time I make a sale
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.920]   Assuming that they actually let me have any of my money when I can actually start
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:39.040]   I'm right now in a position where I can make a I can I can feed myself and and and clothe myself and house myself
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:43.600]   For $18,000 a year because i'm 19 19 years old and and full of vinegar
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:49.440]   Uh, it's okay for me to think that a big success is making $45,000 $65,000 a year
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.080]   Uh, that's and so on that basis
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.360]   What what can you offer that person that would guarantee them?
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:01.760]   uh, Taylor Swift sort of audiences, uh with, uh, Charles foster cane scale problems
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.720]   Right and and when you have when the numbers are much larger when you have
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:12.160]   Uh, you know when once you have a service that's 30 40 50 million, uh, users all paid
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.760]   All money coming back to the and and as people start to
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:21.600]   Go past the the labels where they're only getting a fraction and going directly to the I mean, you know
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:27.440]   It wouldn't it be great if you actually had a had an app had a piece of software that people can actually create their albums on
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.880]   Um and publish directly to your publishing service
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.560]   and so
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.320]   And of course apple is is uniquely set up to do that
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.840]   You know, so that you know, there's they really can cut everybody out out of the middle
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.360]   You know, one of the things I think we had in the studio a long time ago. We had peter hillman
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:46.000]   um, you know, um
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.800]   Come and play a little bit and talk about it. I think after one of the twits a while ago and then he came over and played at my house
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.840]   and
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:56.480]   When they gave him when sony gave him a lot of money to to do an album. He didn't go to a studio
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.440]   He bought all of his gear in the early 90s
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:04.480]   Wasn't that and never was you know recorded it in his little own home studio?
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:10.400]   Um and instead of doing all this up and it was just when that technology was coming out now the technology is everywhere
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.240]   You know and and it for a fraction of the cost you can produce a great album
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:20.000]   You know the big thing that they that they provide that the studios provide is the right producers and
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:25.120]   You know the the backing bands and the extra pieces and you know all those things so if you're self-sufficient
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.640]   There's a lot you can do and I think those opportunities are going to get continually get better
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:32.480]   So I have to correct myself because I
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:36.160]   Pointers in the chat room said that they were talking about this
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:41.200]   ad supported streaming when they said we aren't getting any money and in fact I've looked at the quote
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.440]   and uh
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.440]   And it was in fact saying if you subscribe to a music service, thank you
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.320]   So that was they want they don't hate paid
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:56.960]   Subscription services and they shouldn't because that's as much as they're going to get from anybody 10 bucks a month
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.520]   I mean if I bought a CD a month
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:02.000]   You know, that's it. That's yeah
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.600]   I would think they'd be happy if everybody won again america bought a CD a month
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.240]   and when everyone moves to
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.160]   actually
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:15.120]   You know everybody's on a subscription service that they're actually paying for the money could actually be at least
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:20.080]   Equal to what right to what they're getting so they're not against apple apple streaming
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:24.720]   They're for it as long as you pay up Kanye Kanye is against apple. You're apple. I'm working Kanye
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:30.640]   What the hell's going on with Kanye? He's bright. I think he's having no no. I think he's having um
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:38.480]   He's a little tailor equipped as brutalized him. So I mean like I feel like he's not making a lot of sense at this point
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:43.520]   Especially saying mark zuckerberg you have to call me tomorrow and give me a billion dollars. I feel like
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:47.520]   Kanye may have lost touch with reality. I think it may be a serious
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.360]   situation not
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.360]   He's always been a little strange, but I
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.680]   Feel like he might have there this might have been a like a psychotic break
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:01.280]   Nothing to laugh at it's something serious. I think it's been coming for a long time. Yeah
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:06.160]   He says mark zuckerberg. I'm the greatest artist of all time
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:11.760]   And you need to give me a billion dollars so I can continue to make my art
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:17.680]   And I think only a crazy. I mean like a mentally disturbed person would say that. I don't think that that's normal
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:23.040]   He's got us all talking about it, but yeah, maybe maybe I mean maybe there's some maybe it's conscious on his part of something
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.080]   but
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:27.760]   Um, I actually think that that's cause for the concern about Kanye not
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.240]   Not mockery of Kanye. This is something not not apologize
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.120]   Well, I don't know
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.640]   He's easy to mock
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.800]   He said i'm going all in on title and you'll never see me on apple music and I seem like an awfully
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.600]   But then he changed things like he said, okay, you're gonna I mean he
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:48.240]   Yeah, no, he clearly doesn't like apple, but he but he bought title
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:52.720]   And he's apparently he says 53 million dollars in the hole from doing so
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.160]   Um
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:02.000]   But as somebody pointed out he's also buying the house next door be for two million dollars because he doesn't want neighbors
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.120]   So I don't I don't know what's going on
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:10.720]   It's just I hope it's still better on you. It's the kind of car wreck that twitter really is well suited for
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.680]   And it's not the first Kanye car wreck on twitter either
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:18.080]   There are times where I have to I see news like this and I've reminded myself that I have
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:22.560]   Not only do I have a net never met this person. Not only do I have no idea of who he is or what he's about
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:28.560]   But also I have no idea about that world that he lives in of hyper celebrity and being a musician
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:34.960]   It's like I I'm not in a position to say good, bad or indifferent it would make you crazy if you weren't over yes
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.160]   I know it's made me crazy
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.800]   Uh apple should share of notebook market
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:46.800]   Boy, you know, I we all remember the days it was two three percent of the it was like oh, yeah
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:51.520]   We're just such a weird don trot minority 10 percent of the notebook market
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:55.040]   They're going up while everybody else is going down
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.600]   uh macbook sales continue to gain
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:04.160]   And it's also interesting because apple is only making premium products still so their share of the profit from that industry is again
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.160]   Empire. Yeah. Yeah
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:10.320]   Well, and I think that again, so is this unit shares? Yeah, it's market share. Yeah
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.600]   And that translates into immense profit share and profit share
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:18.640]   Yeah, I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that notebooks are giving way to tablets
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:24.000]   Whether it's apples tablets or microsoft tablets. Yeah, and these numbers which is weird do not count things like the surface
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.560]   the convertible tablets
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:30.240]   Because it's a bit of a racket the way they count this stuff has always been a bit of a racket
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.280]   Yeah, like they had apple that ipads classified as media tablets for a while
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:39.360]   Right in a separate division and that's just because of who's paying the analyst bills. I think it any given one maybe hp
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:46.480]   Uh still number one as they have been for the last three years with a roughly 20 percent market share. It's actually they're they've gone up
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:50.800]   Lenovo also has gone up. They have 20 percent market share
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.720]   Dell
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.440]   They've gone up 14 percent market share a sus
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.560]   10 apple 10
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.840]   Then asir Samsung and toshi because she was getting out of the business. I think
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:09.200]   With 1.6 percent of the market 11 percent to others
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:17.840]   So good for apple and yeah, I'm good for mac and I really want apple to make money on a mac and touch because I want them to continue to support it
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:20.880]   Because uh, I still I still love my mac
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:28.960]   It's my a lot a lot of the worries that we have when we point out that oh look how much money that apple is making off of iPhones
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:32.880]   What happens if that the those sales actually stop or what about if
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:38.880]   They they're not going to put a lot of a lot of effort into software and services because they make all their money off of iPhones
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:46.000]   But the fact matter is that they keep the the fact they keep making a a line of products that takes an immense
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.400]   Amount of engineering resources to keep innovating and keep improving
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.760]   And the fact that they've been doing so much to not just
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:08:00.560]   Say hey, guess what we come up with a new color medal to put in the 2016 mac book
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:06.640]   But coming up with something as different as the two as the 2015 mac book that is that's an indication of how
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:12.320]   How much faith they have in the mac and tosh and how long live that uh that our operating system is going to be
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:18.080]   We're gonna take a break ios 9 coming soon to a phone near you. We'll talk about that
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.120]   Uh, there are several
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:24.880]   Mac security warnings we will have for you in a few minutes
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:32.160]   And I think we've talked about error 53, but there's more to say, uh, I guess there's no there's more and less more and less
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:38.720]   Yeah, uh, less from apple more from everybody else our shonday brought to you by audible.com audiobooks
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.600]   gosh darn it. I love audiobooks, you know, thanks to
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:48.000]   When I was watching the grammys and watching the uh the wonderful scene from hamilton the opening number from hamilton
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:54.720]   Of course, one of grammy for musical soundtrack and and because it's hamilton. I don't think they normally broadcast that award
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:59.680]   But because it was hamilton. Let's put that on tv. That's good stuff
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:04.240]   And uh as the cold bear said now it's going to be really impossible
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:13.680]   To get to get a ticket to see hamilton, but I i'm ready because i've been reading an incredible biography of al xander hamilton that i'm told kind of inspired
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:18.320]   Um the the play certainly helps you understand the play
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.480]   Uh by uh ron charna who runs writes wonderful uh auto
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:28.320]   Wonderful biographies effect. I'm gonna get his book on washington a life 41 hours

[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:50.400]   And that's one of the things that makes audible so remarkable
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:57.520]   Is uh, they don't just kind of mechanically read a book. This is not a robot reading a book. This is a performer
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.960]   Bringing a book to life. I read i listened to I should say
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:07.200]   Team of rivals when the lincoln movie came out. I said i want to read darris kerns good one's famous
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:11.840]   uh book that was the inspiration for uh spielberg's lincoln
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.720]   And uh man that was good 41 hours of lincoln
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:20.560]   There's so much good stuff at audible.com
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.200]   the john adams
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:27.600]   Uh biography now I read it abridged first because I wanted to hear david mcculler read it
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.600]   I love his voice and then I got the unabridged version so I could hear the whole thing
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:40.080]   audio books from audible there's of course biography in history, but there's also science fiction. There's nonfiction. It's a great way
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:45.520]   to spend time in the car during your commute or at the gym on the treadmill or
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.720]   Walking the dog or doing the dishes. I actually now
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:54.960]   Audible has sold a a bunch of amazon echoes for me because I can listen to audible in my echoes. So I have now
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:11:00.560]   I've purchased my fourth amazon echo because I want audible everywhere
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:06.960]   Audible.com we're gonna get you a free book and one of the reasons we mentioned so many books when we talk about audible is to help

[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:14.240]   Had the exact same pick as you
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.840]   I actually
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.200]   The that wonderful biography of hamilton because yes, I'm good
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:25.200]   I'm one of those boring people who has never seen the musical but can never stop talking about it
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.080]   On my i'm playing it all the time
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:33.200]   And actually but it just to the other cool thing about audible looks is that i've been reading the kindle
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:39.120]   And they have a sinking between the unabridged version and the book version so I can
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.680]   Come back home after like reading
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:45.600]   Reading it for about 45 minutes an hour on the train and then
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:50.400]   Macco can pick up exactly where I left off as I go into the kitchen and start making dinner
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:54.080]   And it's like this is exactly what this is what I don't know
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:58.560]   I can't define what 2016 was supposed to be like back when I was a kid in the 70s and 80s
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.720]   But it was something like that where
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:06.000]   That things like that could happen. So i'm pretty happy with and by the way, I I too am about to buy my second
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.680]   My second my second amazon echo because yeah, isn't it great
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:16.400]   You just say yeah, you literally say echo read to me and it picks up where you left off
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.800]   And if you want a different book you can tell it and the nice thing if you have multiple accounts
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:24.720]   Lisa and I have multiple accounts you can switch to another account and then say read to me
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.200]   So it is amazing
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:30.320]   And that's that's hard to say you just say you know
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.640]   Alex a
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.840]   Read my book and you'll have to remember you don't remember the other other
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.760]   Other systems you have to remember the title if you remember the author and say in the right order
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.920]   It's like it knows that by my book. I bet he means the book that he was reading just now
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:48.720]   Okay, it even picks up where you're left off and actually I love this it goes back a few sec like 30 seconds
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:53.120]   So you can get oh, yeah, I remember yeah, and now you're back in the flow of it
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:56.080]   You can just say skip ahead or skip back. Yeah. Yeah
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.200]   I'm kind of in love with audible
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:08.400]   Yeah, I love when i'm driving and my navigation kicks in audible stops. Yeah, that's dependent on your platform

[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.440]   I
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:30.880]   Think you're gonna love it. You're absolutely so great. It's so great. Oh, you listen to I
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:38.480]   When I when I started listening to mac break I heard an audible at us. I used code. I got it. I don't know what's the audible. I haven't stopped since it works
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.680]   I think it's probably hurting our uh downloads, but
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:46.800]   It's people don't have time for podcasts anymore, but that's i'm okay with that
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:52.960]   Look at this william shatner. This is new. I didn't see this has written a book about
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.960]   Let it neem away my 50 year friendship with a remarkable man
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.520]   Spock Spock
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:00.880]   Spock
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:04.400]   They first crossed paths on the set of the man from uncle
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:14.160]   Young actors getting started in television. He is now and always will be his friend. Oh, you're gonna make me cry knock it off
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:17.840]   Shatner narrates that one too. So it's gotta be in it
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:23.440]   Oh, let's just play a little bit. So what tree all are william shatner? That's right. Good Canadian boy
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.120]   often
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:28.880]   It's simply a matter of being in the right place at the right time having some
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:33.280]   often undefined quality or desirable look
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:40.800]   In many situations, it's as much marketability as it is acting about. Oh man. I gotta listen to that
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.440]   Just so I can get the voice just so I get the voice
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:49.440]   All right, so boston he's gonna be the he's gonna be the headliner at the boston comic con in uh in august
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:55.520]   That's now isn't wozniak doing silicon valley comic con
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:00.640]   Yeah, he's doing some sort of comic. Yeah, he's he's like funding it
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.440]   uh, seeb wozniak the founder of
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:07.520]   uh apple you might have you might have heard of him
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:10.080]   He's march 18th to the 20th
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:14.800]   Uh, I you know, he's a comic fan remember he did the us festival
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:23.200]   Uh jobs said stave don't waste don't and of course wozniak lost his shirt on it didn't matter because woz isn't about money
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.200]   woz is about stuff
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.440]   But he loves and he loves comic books
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.320]   And uh here he's doing
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.360]   comic con
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:36.240]   I I my sense is he's putting the money up for it
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:41.520]   Well, you got stanley and shatner for for an inaugural comic con that's pretty
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:44.960]   That's top shelf so nobody owns comic con
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:48.160]   It's not like some company's brand
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:54.880]   Yeah, I think san diego actually owns it they were fighting between themselves and chicago comic con for it
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:58.640]   And I think it actually comes down to do you put a hyphen in it or do you not
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:05.840]   Steve wozniak and friends present silicon valley comic con 2016 and there's a picture
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:09.280]   woz and oh I love this and of his let's go back
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:14.480]   Of his nixie he's got a nixie tube clock on the front page with the countdown
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.320]   Michael jfox and lea tomseter also going to be there
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.520]   Back to the future
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.520]   I'd like to have him on stage
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:29.760]   Talking to stan lee because I feel as though there are two people cut from the same cloth where they have lots of stories
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.240]   They enjoy telling those stories and they know the role that they play with their fans
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:39.360]   And they're only too happy to play that role here's what was right
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.920]   That's what I get
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:45.680]   Here's what was right. He says when I was growing up as hard to be a geek it definitely wasn't cool back then
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:50.960]   But i'm happy the things have changed because now being a geek or being different is cool
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:54.720]   And silicon valley comic con celebrates being a geek
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:59.200]   I love it
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.640]   Thank you woz once again. We have to say thank you woz. I guess we should go down there Jason
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.840]   I've I've never been to a comic con in my life
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.880]   What are the dates on it again?
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:15.280]   It's in march 30 days from now 18th to 20th at the san jose convention center
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:19.120]   Silicon valley that will be a fun one to go to because of the people
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:22.880]   By the way, I think they're already sold out. I mean tickets sold very quickly
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:28.080]   That's that's what happens even I I tweeted out the news about boston comic con because
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:33.600]   It started off as something that could be held in the hallways of a downtown hotel
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.400]   Just not too long ago to biggest
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:41.040]   Almost the biggest convention space boston has and sells out you can't buy a three-day pass
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:42.960]   You can now you can't buy a saturday pass
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:47.680]   You got a you kind of jump quick used to be san diego was the only one where you had to make plans eight months in advance
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.240]   amazing
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:57.440]   Uh, let's see all right. Should we talk about error 53? We talked about it last week. This is the error that the guardian first reported
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   uh, where if you get a
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:00.960]   iPhone
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:05.280]   repaired by a third party not by apple and they
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:09.120]   Replace the screen even if they don't replace the fingerprint reader
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:15.840]   The screen and fingerprint reader tightly combined apple says they are the secure enclave is now
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:21.200]   Not trustable and whether it's intentional or not when you then update your phone
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:24.480]   You will get error 53 and it will be bricked
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.560]   Do we know rene if you can bring your phone back to an apple store at that point and get it fixed
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:37.760]   For if you're under apple care absolutely if you're not under apple care it might depend on the how you how you talk to the geniuses and other people
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:40.080]   There or whether apple internally escalates it or not
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:44.800]   Uh, it's it's one of those things that again like if you go to apple to get the repair done
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:49.680]   They will get this error sometimes too, but if it happens in the back of an apple shop they will just swap out your phone
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:51.680]   You know you you
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.680]   It's it's bad, but it's recoverable
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:20:00.640]   Is it your sense? This is just a bug that this wasn't it's both it's it's two things like one like an error 53 is not a user facing error
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:07.520]   So it's probably not something anyone at apple ever intended anyone in the real world to see the security protocols are absolutely real
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:11.920]   But the way that they were surfaced and the way that they reacted following the update was probably not predicted. Yeah
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:16.800]   Uh, and what do you think the upshot is there's now class action lawsuit?
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.800]   Uh, I mean there's a class action all that's meaningless apple does yeah, that's me
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:24.560]   It was a really good post by a microsoft engineer. I forget her name, but I'll find it
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:31.120]   Um, uh and tweet it and she went through step by step about why this kind of problem exists like from an engineering standpoint that
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:35.840]   Anytime you create like well, you should just turn off touch id well, then I could attack it this way
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:39.120]   Well, you should just do this well then like you could just swap it in for a non-touch id
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:44.240]   But well, then I could attack it this way and she sort of went through why from an engineering standpoint this makes sense
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:50.320]   Uh, but that from a human point of view is horrible and there's got to be a better way of surfacing explaining and handling this when it does happen
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.320]   Yeah
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.720]   Um
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.720]   Now there's some other bugs
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:59.200]   Not created by apple
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:01.760]   Software is hardly okay. Yeah
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:03.760]   That's the I think that's the takeaway you
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:08.800]   It's everywhere. I mean microsoft can't fix the surface book because
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:11.600]   They say software is hard
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.880]   Um
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:17.040]   And now adobe with their created they updated the creative cloud by the way I think this is no long
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:23.120]   You don't they stop the update. So you if you didn't get bit by this you won't be but they updated their creative cloud
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:28.560]   Thing that runs in the menu that updates all the other stuff a photoshop and lightroom and premiere and everything
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:35.040]   And uh, the update did a weird thing it deleted the alphabetically first file in your root directory
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:38.160]   without warning without notice and
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:44.000]   The way we found out is that backblaze which is as you probably know well-known backup company
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.560]   uh keeps a
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:54.000]   A file in the root directory dot bzvaul which can has information about the backups the state of the backups
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.960]   And people were calling backblacing my backblaze stopped working
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:04.800]   And I don't know how they figured it out, but somehow they figured out that the adobe creative cloud update was deleting dot bzvaul because on most people
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.600]   That's the highest alphabetically file
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:13.920]   I remember about 10 years ago listening to you and steve on security now when adobe was doing some form of copy protection
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:18.640]   And they were writing over the sectors that I think true crypt or something else used and messing up everyone's encryption
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:22.320]   So this is not a first from them. Oh, they're sort of they're horrible
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.560]   Yeah, and yet
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:29.120]   I tell in fact they just told my son get the get the subscription of the lightroom and photoshop
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:32.240]   It's a great deal at 10 bucks a month and the photography subscription
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:37.040]   So apparently they fixed this last night of course if they needed a file on your directory
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.680]   It's too late if you didn't have backblaze
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:45.920]   It would have deleted an apple file dot. I can't remember what is vt or v100 or something which is a versioning
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:51.520]   Index and I don't know what the consequence would have would that of that would have been
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:54.720]   And my question is whether that on restart would get repopulated
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:23:00.480]   You know because it was missing my sense from reading ours technica's report is that it would cause problems
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:07.760]   Yeah, um, but I but I don't know what I did and when we told everybody to do on saturday was open terminal
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.000]   CD slash
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000]   Let's go to the root directory
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.160]   Type pseudo touch
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:17.440]   Dot a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:24.240]   Although I loved uh, backblaze's suggestion was dot adobe don't touch my bz ball
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:29.440]   Anything with dot a in enough a's is going to alphabetically sort of first
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:34.640]   And I wondered whether it was something where for a while the first file was always dot adobe
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:39.200]   Something or others so that it must have been someone writing something, you know the way I
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:42.000]   That's a stupid thing to assume, right?
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.200]   No, what it sounds like and I have no idea what it actually is
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:50.320]   But what it sounds like is as a programmer you were like working on something and you just knew that the first file that you're working on
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:54.960]   Is your file and you just kind of did it as you were testing and then it just worked then you forgot about it and then yeah
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:01.120]   The version was 3.5.0.206
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.280]   Adobe released an update to 3.5.1.209
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:10.320]   Uh, the weird thing is
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:15.680]   In order to put a file there, I had to I had a usudo. I had to authenticate
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:19.280]   I guess you can delete a user file there if you created it
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.000]   I don't know
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.320]   I think you authenticate as part of the install process for
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:29.680]   You give it you give it a permission. You escalate. Yeah, I wish that that shouldn't
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.640]   That's not please don't
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.280]   and speaking of uh
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:38.240]   Files having uh applications having too many permissions
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:41.120]   sparkle
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:46.640]   Well, this wasn't permitted so this was they they created this framework and some people deployed it without using htps
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:50.640]   So they were sending things over an insecure channel which opened them up to a person in the middle attack
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:55.040]   It's mis implementation of it sparkles an open source framework for updating applications
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:59.200]   And you could use http or htps for that channel
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.480]   But if you use an unsecured channel, well, somebody could just say hey
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:09.040]   It could be in a coffee shop. Oh, let's grab that and put something else in there and inject some code onto that person's machine
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.440]   It's hard to fix
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:15.120]   I forget the guys i'm gonna mispronounce Andy's last name when I apologize and he mentioned something like that
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:18.720]   He was he did sparkle and then he went and worked at apple at ui kid and now he's at
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:26.000]   A con academy doing a lot of really really cool stuff super super bright guy makes this great stuff
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.760]   But then it's up to the developer to secure this stuff once they're implementing it
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:33.280]   And in this case it didn't happen so people figured out how to get into it
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.960]   So there is an updated sparkle updater, but the problem is
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:44.160]   It's hard for sparkle to update itself. I guess I don't know well though theoretically you can't trust so again all of this is theoretical
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:49.120]   I don't believe any of this has ever been found in the wild and there's no evidence that anyone's actually had an attack performed using this
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:53.840]   But the problem is you can't trust an update then if the update process is susceptible to attack
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:59.760]   You never know if you if you're getting a real update or someone has created a fake update to sh*t this end to you to get even great
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.080]   And it it does provide code level access
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:07.920]   So it's one of those things where you have to disable automatic updates go to sparkles website and install the new version
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:12.800]   Or whatever the not sparkles website. Sorry the developers new website and install the new version of the app
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:15.440]   So many programs use sparkle
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.040]   And so many unfortunately use htp
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:23.120]   For the so vlc is the one that most people will have
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:26.640]   I had a bunch of apps from mac fun
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:29.360]   I'm not clear
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:34.000]   You know you can you can quickly do somebody putting in the arse the comments in the arse article look
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:42.560]   A find command terminal command with grep that would show you everything to use sparkle in what version but it what doesn't show you is whether it uses a secure htp connection
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:48.240]   So you don't know if you're vulnerable, but a surprising number of applications do it do it wrong
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:52.080]   Um and a lot of you sparkle why wouldn't you?
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:57.520]   So there's two things one is mac app store is not affected by this obviously because they have their own software update mechanism
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.840]   So if you're using mac app store apps, it's not a problem
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:05.440]   And also things like apples new app transport security which is forward looking and sort of insists on TLS level protection
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:08.160]   Will hopefully make this kind of thing less likely going forward
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.880]   Yeah fingers crossed. Yeah
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:15.360]   Anyway
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.040]   And also don't set your iphone to january first my oh that yeah, I tried you know
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:21.040]   I started it, but it's so long
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:26.000]   George did it, but she didn't reboot thankfully and she did it live and it was just very stressful for everybody
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.880]   It take how long did it take her because you have to you can't just like set it
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:33.280]   Seven minutes or eight minutes. We got a scroll scroll scroll scroll scroll back to january first 1970
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:41.520]   Which is the beginning of the unix epoch unix was invented late 1969 and so uh in in all unix based machines
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.400]   Including the macintosh and I presume android as well
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.840]   um
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:47.840]   the uh date and time are
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:53.120]   Calculated as the number of seconds since the beginning of the epoch january first 1970
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:58.880]   If you set your iphone or your ios device back to january first 1970
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:02.000]   Uh, what happens is it crash?
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.880]   I kind of know what happens, but I think it's never safe to tell people what happens in the other situations because
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:13.440]   Ricks it. I don't understand it. Yeah, so but there it creates a math error that on reboot does not let the machine probably function anymore
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:17.520]   Now there's an easy fix. It just takes time. You let the battery die
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:22.080]   Yeah, and apparently that if you just let if you just leave it on and it's
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:25.760]   Ununusable but booting state eventually it'll go
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:30.880]   And then apparently it works. So I don't know why I guess it recents
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:35.280]   It's slow, but then if you go back and reset the time it works again. So it's yeah
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:38.480]   You got to work your way out of that all why people would do this like I don't know
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.160]   But my concern immediately was like we we covered it on i'm where it wasn't that oh my god
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:46.400]   You can't do this is don't let anyone trick you and like don't make a bar bet over how long it'll take you to
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:48.720]   Set your time to that date
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:51.200]   Because people be pranksters
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:57.680]   But seven or eight minutes is anything like that. Yeah, if it were easy, it would be problematic, but yeah
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:05.920]   Math is hard software is hard. Yes, enough said and Intel showing the chipsets are hard. I mean we can't we're not having a good week. No
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:09.440]   Um, iOS 9 should be here
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:14.000]   Spring this is this is uh, we're in winter still, but spring starts March 21st
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:23.440]   9.3 9.3. I mean yep, obviously we have iOS 9 and that coincides kind of nicely with a march 15th apple event
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:26.480]   and availability of a new ipad
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:34.240]   Uh air and maybe a new iphone 5s. See you think we will get 9 3 at the same time as we get those new devices
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:35.840]   Yep
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:37.760]   Might even before spring then
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:41.120]   Because the one of the rumors is that the new phone will be available like the next day
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:46.720]   It's one of those things where like I liken the new phone to the ipad touch update that was last year
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:48.720]   It's like you know a lot of people use the ipad touch anymore
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:51.600]   But the people who do use it really love it. It was falling out of date
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.920]   So apple said if we put the modern chipset at the time in it
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:58.000]   Those people will just have a much better experience and we can keep this product on the market for longer
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.400]   So the iphone 5se is saying a guy phone 5s is still for sale. It's the lowest end thing
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.880]   But there's certain features we can't do like apple pay on it
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:08.880]   But if we upgrade it to all the like the latest chipset the latest iSight all these things
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:13.040]   Will have a phenomenally good phone that's at four inches that covers that segment of the market
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:17.520]   Is also at our bottom tier where people who you know, don't can't afford or don't want to pay that much for a phone
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.040]   Have something that's really great now
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:22.560]   So we can give everyone a better experience by making this variant of that device
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:25.600]   And it's a pretty it's an interesting strategy that apple seems to be doing more now
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:31.680]   Well, and it's it's with the ipad it was you know, they had pretty much a $50 to $500
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:34.960]   They had increments that you could decide when you wanted to get on the path
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:38.720]   So I think that it's a it's a model that they that they know well
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:45.120]   Yeah, plus it'll straight up the fix that they're in that they they do have to make every phone that everybody
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:49.760]   Uh that that because every phone that it makes sense for them to make given that they're the old
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:53.920]   They're the only makers of iPhones. They don't have to make if someone wants a 7.2 inch iPhone
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:55.200]   They don't have to make it
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:00.400]   But if they're if they're if it's clear to them they're leaving money on the on the table because they're people who just can't afford
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:03.920]   Uh, and iphone 6 or they're leaving money off the table because they're people who
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:10.080]   Will buy any phone that is more pocketable because they don't necessarily need to have a tablet sized phone
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:15.360]   Uh, it falls to them to make it or just not get that money from those people so
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:21.040]   And that's how you grow I mean when you're selling when you're selling a few devices you can have one when you're selling a lot of them
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:24.960]   The only way to increase that is to start uh doing adding addressable markets
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:27.600]   So you made the bigger phone everyone bought that some people want the smaller one
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:31.040]   Maybe it's only 10 but 10 percent of a hundred million people that in a year
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:34.800]   That's a lot of people and a lot of phones you can sell and that's how you grow another 10 percent that year
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:37.680]   And it also takes a lot of the oxygen out of the system
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.560]   So when you you know right now, there's a lot of room for people to work
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:45.360]   Uh, you know whether it's Samsung or or LG, um, you know in an area that is well below
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:48.640]   Uh, what the iphone is selling at if they take if they
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:53.200]   Provide a lower cost one. There's a high probability they could take a bunch of that market away
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:56.320]   Well, let's talk about iOS 10
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.080]   So
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:04.640]   First of all, do you uh think that that's a credible rumor that the new devices which will be announced on march 15th rumor
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:07.040]   Will be available march 18th rumor
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:12.080]   Sure anything that's not a flagship like their biggest problem is handling a launch of a flagship
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:17.200]   I because just the euchira mountain popularity of that but this any time they've had to update like an i
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:21.520]   Sometimes manufacturing gets in the way, but when they've been able to update like ipods or things like that
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:25.840]   They've always been very very quick if they do an ipad air for with it works with a pencil
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:31.280]   So great that would be that would be I bet you that would sell like hotcakes
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:37.360]   My only question about is let's say the do the smart connector and the smart keyboard apple has never made a tiny keyboard
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.840]   I think the ipad air so the iphone air
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:42.240]   Anything they saw on mac air
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:46.800]   MacBook air 11 inches is like the smallest or the back book 12 inches like the smallest keyboard
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:51.680]   They've ever made and the ipad pro keyboards about the same size. We've never seen a teeny tiny keyboard
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:55.600]   They do apple so would they do one or would they just let logic tech and other companies make their
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.160]   it's kind of what they did with the
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:03.040]   iPad pro they made a keyboard but logic tech was their day and date with their creative keyboard
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:09.120]   Talk to imagine it really is going to tell us a lot about what they think the ipad is for
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:13.120]   The 9.7 is sort of the misfit of the lineup right now
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:19.120]   Because it's I think the success of the ipad mini has shown that most people want ipad apps
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:21.200]   But they don't want something as big as an ipad air
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:25.600]   The relative success of the ipad pro has shown that there are a lot of people for whom they
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:30.640]   They they were using the ipad air because it was the biggest ipad available
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:35.840]   But if you give them something they're productive, they're so into productivity that they really do want something a little bit larger
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:40.800]   so if they were to start to position the ipad air is sort of the
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.000]   uh
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.240]   More total and more affordable version of the pro for people who want everything except for screen real estate
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:53.120]   That would be interesting, but I kind of I'm hoping that they won't put pencil support
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:56.160]   on the on the lesser size ones because
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:01.360]   I'm not sure that people will have as good an experience with it on a smaller device as they might on a larger one
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:06.320]   I would love it
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:10.960]   I would love to have a big workbook and then the notebook and then eventually on the mini would be like my uh field notes
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.120]   And I would just carry those things
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:16.160]   Just more apple stuff to get
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:22.400]   So iOS 10 would be this fall with a new iPhone of seven
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:26.080]   Yeah, they showed off at wdc and then it would launch with i4 and seven
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:33.440]   Yep, apple insider article apple maps vans operating around the clock and run up to iOS 10 debut
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:39.520]   Um lots of people are seeing these uh, these vehicles drive around
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:46.640]   Uh and apple has acknowledged that they are doing this it even says apple maps on the side of the van
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:52.400]   This is what I understand they've been driving around for years and maps is decoupled from like unless he has an interface level change or a new feature
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.440]   They want are they associating their essentially decoupled. Yeah
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:58.320]   It's a line r gps. Yeah
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.840]   Yeah
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:04.640]   Yeah, so if they're gonna do street view for example and street view is gonna be a front facing feature in iOS 10 and that would make sense
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:07.840]   But otherwise they're just gonna keep updating stuff with better stuff every day
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:11.200]   This is also mapping that would be useful for autonomous vehicles
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:14.480]   And that's this too far ahead
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:19.040]   The very simple fact is that you it's no good to simply map the world and then say good
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:21.200]   We've done that you know to keep these things refreshed
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.920]   Uh for for a pointer of that go it's it's fun to sometimes take a drive around
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:32.240]   Uh google maps and look at the signs in front of gas stations to see how quickly the numbers change
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.440]   on the thing
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:35.280]   And sometimes you'll and sometimes i'll see like a
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:39.120]   Gas station that's four dollars a gallon so I can pinpoint when it was taken
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:40.160]   Oh, oh, sorry
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:45.120]   See it sometimes you'll see it like cheaper and cheaper that just gives you an idea of how quickly and how frequently
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:49.200]   I've actually I've actually like checked out my own house and I can say oh, that's right
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:53.840]   That's that time that I had that I had that lumber delivered and I had to leave it in the driveway for a while
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:56.240]   Before I was able to like move it inside for that project
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:58.080]   Okay, so that was definitely to stay in the state
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:01.360]   Uh, so they you really have to keep those cars moving
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:04.720]   It's it's like painting a bridge once you finish once you get from one end to the other
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.440]   It's time for you to go back to the first end and start all over again
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.760]   so
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.760]   an update maybe on the uh
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:16.000]   iPhone 7 lack of a jack
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.880]   scandal
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.320]   um
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:26.960]   Here's apple insider has claimed that they have obtained a bark lays bank research memo
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:33.840]   That says uh, this will for the first time give the iphone seven stereo audio and what?
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:39.120]   Don't we have stereo audio in our headsets? It's only one speaker so oh
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:44.720]   The phone I get it two speakers and that's because there's no headphone
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:48.240]   So your hamster will get beautiful audio separation from those
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:54.480]   It's like all the atmos is gonna bounce everything on the walls now i'm in the left now i'm in the right
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:37:02.480]   Okay, and most of us watch video sideways anyway, so it'll be one hand will get like beautiful top bottom
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:07.120]   I do that all the time with my phones is cover the speakers and then you go. Why can't work or
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.840]   Oh, I am mad on it
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:12.640]   Um
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:15.520]   Just looking to see if there's anything else
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:17.520]   It's like people at apple drink
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:20.640]   Um
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:26.640]   Vivo and else is a native app for apple tv content curated by your taste vvo courses the music
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:29.680]   channel that's uh labels labels love
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:32.960]   Was originally on uh
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:35.680]   YouTube, but I think they kind of I don't know how they're related
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:42.880]   Apple paste coming to china now that it's in canada china and this week and france later this year
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:48.640]   We've translated this into franche
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:54.880]   Pay do they call it the palm palm palm to pay?
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.840]   Pompey
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:01.040]   Um
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:08.160]   Vulcan you want to talk about that nothing much to say I put a bookmark in there because I this is the replacement for open gl
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:11.600]   Uh Vulcan it's called vlk an
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.400]   Uh, alas doesn't work on apple
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:20.880]   I mean that's an implementation detail. I'm sure like I don't believe there's anything restricting it other than someone has to go and do it
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.480]   Yeah
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:27.040]   But uh, I don't maybe they need to do a system level. I don't know not a graphics person, but it's like the it's
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:34.240]   Apple's got metal now apple metal is apple's low level right next uh framework and Vulcan is what people who aren't apple and one app
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:41.360]   Apple was this big supporter of open gl and um, but it never worked. Well apple drivers are terrible
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:44.240]   They implemented it from more of a math science perspective
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:49.040]   They didn't ever implemented it for gaming which has different parameters, but more so apple is not good at waiting
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:50.000]   It's sort of like you know
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:55.360]   They they play well with open standards when they believe that those standards are sort of established when they need something
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:58.880]   Uh, and they don't they're not gonna wait three years. They're just gonna roll out metal
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:02.000]   Uh that's sort of like they're they're an urgent sort of company
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.520]   Apple is
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:09.680]   A lot of the a lot of the os also was based on used use the open gl for a lot of things and as a result apple was unwilling to
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:14.640]   Let those drivers be developed by anybody because of you know while theirs is behind for games
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:19.120]   What they were really worried about is making sure that everything else that they're using it for is is working
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:24.800]   You've got frames per second. You've been buying apple stock now. Let's buy some apple bonds apple is
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:32.400]   issuing more bonds a new bond series to raise money for further stock buybacks and dividend payments
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:39.040]   You might wonder why a company with more than 200 billion dollars in their pocket is borrowing money, but it does make those bonds
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:42.320]   A plus certified
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.960]   They uh in 2013 raised 17 billion
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:48.880]   12 billion in 2014 8 billion last year
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:55.440]   Uh, they have executed get this they've been planted by 200 billion dollars in stock
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:58.240]   Back they have executed 153 billion dollars
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:01.040]   And stock buyback already
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:05.680]   They could only repatriate all that money. They would not need the bonds. That's the problem, isn't it? Yeah
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:11.040]   They should maybe issue the bonds in ireland
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:18.160]   Well apple ireland has a lot of money apple america has been spending money so they're not borrowing because apple ireland has all the money and they can't bring it home
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:22.400]   Oh, you see i'm wondering you know, we're seeing that they're opening a research firm in in hydro baud
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:26.400]   Which I think that there's rumored to be upwards of 4500
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:32.000]   People working there eventually and i'm wondering whether that also it allows them to
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.560]   Spend that international capital somewhere outside of the united states on rnd
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:40.400]   And I think that one of the things we have to be kind of careful of as we look at at you know
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:46.880]   Right now, you know things are designed in the us or designed in at you know in california
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:52.480]   But but then produced you know in china and it starts off because it's cheaper that they did it
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:55.440]   You know the people did it in china, but now it is true that
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:58.560]   Capacities a big issue, you know that you can only have
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:01.440]   This many people in in those areas
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:07.760]   I think that the issue that you that you may get into as think people keep on moving this work to india
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:14.560]   Is they started and and a lot of this the cost the the the advantage of programming in india the advantages of
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:19.120]   Of that those types of things have not have reduced they're not the same cost advantages
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:23.200]   They used to be but the amount of sheer number of people being trained for that
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:28.320]   Again could put india in a position that that china's in now, but in the area of programming and development
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:35.040]   Um, and as you see more more folks going that direction it you know, it's something that people thinking about us jobs should
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:41.920]   Should worry about it's a new office in in canada too. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, autowa. Well, you know what?
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.920]   All that money can be there's good program. I
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:47.600]   There's good programmers. Uh, they're easy. Maybe easier to find good engineers
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:53.040]   There might be a q and x office down the street that that may not be as employable as it used to be
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.520]   Maybe maybe
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:58.080]   But I think I think that that's you know that but we should just look at you know
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:02.960]   The both the tax policies and immigration policies in the united states are helping to really pick that you know
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:08.560]   accelerate that process of you know keeping money overseas where you want to keep on spending it overseas and also
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:11.120]   uh, you know
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:16.000]   You know having it harder to bring people in just means that you it doesn't mean that that we start hiring more people here
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:20.960]   I think that almost every useful programmer if they're not if they don't have a job working for a company
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:23.040]   because they don't want it or they
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:25.520]   There's something else going on
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:28.880]   I mean, it's you know, there there you know, it's there's so much demand
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:31.280]   uh for programmers
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:36.320]   I think that that's and I know that may say harsh but uh, but it I think that um
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:41.840]   What we're doing right now. I think it's gonna be problematic. Um in the not to we can't find enough progress
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:44.880]   We can't find a program. Yeah
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:48.560]   That are capable of doing what we need to do, you know, like, you know, that's we can find programmers
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:51.520]   We can't find the ones that can program, you know, um
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:54.160]   Cleanly and quickly
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:59.920]   It's time to talk about square space and then uh we will get your picks of the week fellas

[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:17.280]   um
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:25.200]   Just remember leo that when you have one finger that glove pointing at someone else. It's got three fingers pointing at yourself. You that's right
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.920]   Whatever that means

[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:36.400]   Unless you're pointing like this and then it's only two fingers our show today is brought to you by squarespace.com
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:44.160]   The place to make your next website whether you're a business a band a restaurant a plumber a blogger a
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:50.160]   Photographer there's a squarespace template with your name on it. Well, not literally your name, but boy
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:52.560]   It is the best way to start your site
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:57.200]   You're using the state of the art not only the best designers, but the best engineers
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.520]   So in that template baked in
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:04.800]   ecommerce that looks as good as your site does it looks just like your site because it is
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:08.320]   Uh, it's mobile responsibilities. You don't have a separate mobile site
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:15.680]   You have automatically you have you know a site that works on any size screen that's built in it's baked into the templates and of course
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:21.680]   Uh, I love the cover page. I used that that was the first thing that got me excited about squarespace is creating a cover page
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:25.120]   But now I want to show you a nice little treat
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:27.920]   We've mentioned that you can of course make a site without being a
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:33.360]   At html guru, but look over here this i've logged into my squarespace site if you go to the settings
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:38.400]   And you go to the advanced settings. There's a there's a box. You're going to want to check out if you're a developer
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:46.320]   squarespace developer platform turn that on and you have access they they leave it off so that you know
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:53.520]   People can create squarespace sites without any expertise with any html or css or javascript, but man you turn that on
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:45:03.040]   Suddenly you have all the code in your developer template you can use get or sftf tf tp to connect and edit your html
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:09.920]   You can do so many cool things for instance. There's a Jason api to output content from the cms
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:14.800]   You've got access to html css javascript you can start with one of the existing templates fact
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:16.480]   It's a great way to learn
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:21.040]   Is to look at those templates and see what they do or use the base template and get all the features
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:26.320]   Just register as developer flip the developer toggle and you're in and you're coding
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:32.080]   And that makes means that squarespace could even be and I know a lot of people that do this a business for you

[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:55.600]   Let's start with Renee Richie from because he's from the great white north
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:01.040]   So yeah, so north so north if you go to a game of thrones were a little bit north of that wall
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:06.720]   It's perfect windows coming winter never left winter is here. Yeah winter never goes stupid winter
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:12.800]   So this is a pick I've picked many times before but they've got a new program out today that I really like and it's one password
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:15.520]   I know some people use last pass some people use other things whatever you use
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:18.000]   This kind of stuff is awesome a few months ago
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.720]   They rolled out one password teams which would let you share passwords with other people in your company
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:27.600]   And people started asking for a version of that for families so today they launched one password families
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:31.360]   So I think it's like five bucks a month and everyone in the family gets a copy of
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:37.120]   One password and you can choose which passwords you keep just for you and which passwords you share with the family
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:40.880]   And this has been a really big problem we get a lot of mail about this kind of thing because people
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:44.960]   You know they like the netflix password and there's a bunch of passwords that they just for convenience sake
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:49.200]   They don't want to leave out in the open but they do want everyone to have access to
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:54.880]   And with this you know they're on many many different platforms. So if you have a mixed technology family
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:56.640]   It works really really great
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:00.160]   You just get one password you store all your passwords for everything that's important
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:05.840]   The ones that are just for you you keep in your sealed vault and the ones that your whole family needs access to
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:10.640]   You put in the family vault and that way how do I get that because I I want to do that
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:16.960]   It's a subscribe so i'll be using the upgrade subscription. Oh, okay. Yeah, so there's a if you go to the one password blog
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:22.080]   They have a there a big article on it this morning that went up that explains sort of the process
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:28.160]   Because this is really really a great thing to have last pass has as sharing as well
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:32.880]   And you need that because you exactly as you say some stuff's yours
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:37.280]   But you but the netflix password my son's always asking me to text it to him. I don't want to do that
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:38.960]   Yeah
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:42.560]   Or the in some families the kids are old enough and you want one you want everyone to know the itunes pass
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:46.320]   Right and I want my wife to have access to all my stuff my accounts
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:49.680]   It's the easiest to safest way to do that. So that's good five bucks a month
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:50.320]   That's great
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:55.120]   And then if you update it because there's some problem with it and it says you have to update the account then she she'll know about it immediately
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:58.320]   It'll be updated in her vault too. She won't have to call you. Oh, did you change the password?
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:02.640]   Or get afraid that something's happened someone's trying to hack the account. It just makes life better for everybody
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:06.400]   You know the thing that's can that's really convinced me in one password
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:07.760]   the
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:15.040]   Almost all the other vaults keep a track keep a copy of your vault on their servers because it's more convenient
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:22.960]   Uh and one password's one of the few that and like the open source key pass that that let you put the vault where you
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:27.040]   Want to have it so it's not on their servers. It's on whatever and I so I keep it on
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:33.760]   Uh, well, not only on my secured Samsung, but on my on a highly secured cloud. That's my own cloud
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:36.400]   Uh, and of course, it's always encrypted anyway
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:41.840]   So even if somebody got it and that I think that really lowers the attack surface because instead of saying oh gosh
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:46.960]   We'll just go to the password vault company and download everybody's vaults and just hammer on them
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:50.320]   They'd have to go one. They'd have to attack you go onesy-toozy
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:55.600]   Figure out where your vault is and download it. I think that that's really good now on the other hand that their androids support
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:01.600]   Uh, I wish it were a little bit better. Uh, but well there's a long time that company who sort of realizes they have to be everywhere
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:06.560]   So that's like the growing pain is that they're moving. I've talked to them. I said look you got to support this new op vault
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:11.040]   This that's the only thing missing by the way. You got to support the op vault format for android
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:15.680]   Uh, I mean you can use the agile vault the old vault agile bits is are they Canadian?
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:18.160]   Yeah, they're from toronto there
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:21.840]   Rousdom and dave and what I like to say they're super responsive
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:25.520]   They're always at wc. They're always at these places and like the fingerprint technology comes out
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:29.440]   And now one password on my phone is better than my mac because you press the action
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.120]   When paul's web pops up press your thumb on it. It authorizes you fills the password and you're done. Yeah, it's great
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:39.200]   Yeah, it then supports the android fingerprint too. Um, so
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:44.880]   They have an sdk so apps can actually add it in because some apps don't give you access to share sheets or any other way to access
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:49.840]   That's sort of a trigger, but they can put a little one password button on there and then you just press that and you're in again
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:53.200]   I also love it that you can
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:56.000]   uh
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.840]   keep
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:04.880]   Keep the vault so I keep the vault in my private store. No one else can get but if you want there's a you could have your phone
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:08.560]   Log into that or you can do Wi-Fi syncing
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:14.640]   Yeah, it's really interesting because they have a service called watchtower and I go through this every year it shows you
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:18.400]   Yeah, yeah, it shows you all your your week passwords it shows you duplicate passwords
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:21.360]   It shows you passwords from companies that have had attacks in the last year
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:24.320]   And they might have gotten your password even if you weren't notified about it
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:30.880]   And then just every every couple months I do a security audit and update all that stuff. It's great. Yeah, I love seeing competition now
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:36.560]   Uh because it the all of them are getting better and better all the time and I think it's really good and I have to say
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:42.480]   Uh, if you're not using last pass one password, it's definitely it and actually I'm starting to think maybe one password
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:45.040]   Is the way to go here? Yeah
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:50.960]   Uh, I I used to use I used to use apple keychain for all my like secure notes and secure passwords
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:55.520]   And that was the last apple app that I just I realized that I don't want to stand
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:52:01.360]   I don't want to standardize a really big resource on uh one certain symbol platform
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:06.640]   I switched to one password and I've not regretted it one moment. It's just really it's so easy to use
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:09.920]   I could use keychain because I only I only have apple technology
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:13.760]   But what I don't like is that there's no there's no master password which one password offers
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:18.080]   So you're like you have to put in a thumbprint or a password to get access with apple keychain
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:22.480]   They just assume that once you've unlocked the device, that's fine and I might be someone on the street going help
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:27.040]   I'm locked out. I need to call my mom and I want to be able to give them my phone without giving them my credit cards my password
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:28.960]   Right
[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:33.600]   Yeah, I I have been uh, I've been very impressed. I have to say very very impressed
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:35.920]   um
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:39.520]   And I you know, I have to say I've been looking at it after uh last pass got
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:41.200]   acquired
[01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:45.840]   The simple fact that last pass has my database on their servers and one password does not
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:49.680]   Yeah, by itself is probably a good reason to switch
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:53.200]   And if you're worried like I've convenience it's something like you can put it on iCloud
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:56.160]   You can put it on Dropbox. They give you all those sorts of options
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:59.520]   So it just depends on your comfort level and what you want to security convenience
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:03.600]   I keep it on my file transporter. That's that that's the personal cloud thing
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:08.480]   Uh, and no one has access to that that's encrypted and transit encrypted at place
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:13.520]   And it's in my office and it's at my home and they sync but it's never in the cloud
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:16.240]   Um, and I think that works pretty well
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:18.160]   All right
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:20.160]   One password
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:23.040]   How about you, uh, Alex Lindsay? What do you got for us?
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:25.680]   so so i'm actually
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:31.920]   All this talk about apples products that that um that people don't like I actually and then someone picked on one of them
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:36.160]   And I just had to say that I have to make it a pick just so that I can defend it, baby
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:37.360]   Refuted
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:42.000]   So someone was talking about how bad preview is and I don't know I guess for them whatever they were doing causes it to
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:45.200]   But I use preview every day for one thing
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:45.840]   Me too
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:49.680]   I mean I look at stuff but I use it every day for one thing and that's to sign documents
[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:54.960]   So I want to make sure people understand how you know this is a little tip a little bit of a thing in preview
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:58.160]   All you have to do is go to your tools to annotate
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:03.200]   Signature if you don't have a signature in there you take a sharpie or anything or pen
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:06.640]   Then you sign a white piece of paper and you show it to your webcam
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:07.040]   Yeah
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:10.880]   And you show it to your to your little eyesight and then your signature is now in
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:15.280]   You know is is there and I did not I have to admit I did not know about that
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:20.400]   That is I know so the thing is is that it and so I have so actually I did you know I see my signature is in it
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:23.840]   It used to I forgot
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:25.520]   It used to be a nightmare people would be like
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:28.880]   Send this back to me signing. I'd be like oh now I have to
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:33.280]   Figure out how to use a fax machine and I have to do this thing and I have to arrive to sign it
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:35.920]   And then I have to scan it and then there's and there's pdf
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:39.280]   You know, there's you know, there's um, you know, whether it's reader or whatever
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:44.800]   But they're all heavy the thing is is there is nothing easier or faster than you get a form you open up and preview
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:49.760]   You can add a couple of text things really easily like oh, I'm gonna fill in the date and type my name
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:52.640]   And and then I throw my signature on and then I just save it out
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:56.320]   And it's done it's pdf and then I I mail email it back to him
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:59.760]   I email that kind of stuff back the only thing that slows me down out is like notarization
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:02.240]   I guess you know the notarize or the thing that's loading out
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:05.040]   But if you ask me to sign something digitally, it's like bam. I'm done
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:06.720]   Yeah, you know, and uh
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:10.480]   And it's just uh, I love it that you can so you can use a trackpad
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:13.840]   So you can actually sign the trackpad you can sign the trackpad
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:16.960]   But you can also the crazy thing is just take a you can just literally draw
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:20.480]   Yeah, you can do that or you can not a really good way to do it
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:23.120]   But it's you know what the truth is it's good enough or
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:26.240]   The other thing is you can take a picture you take a picture of it
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:30.080]   You literally just sign sign your singer trying a piece of white paper and then hold it up
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:33.120]   And you hold it up and it just boom it just it goes okay
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:38.000]   And the best thing to use for that is a sharpie because you get a nice thick dark line
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:43.680]   Um and you'll get a nice uh, there you go. And you sign here. Here we go. Okay, it's gonna be backwards
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:46.640]   And you sign can you sign it big?
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:49.360]   Yeah, you can sign it big. All right, because it's just gonna scale it up
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:52.000]   This is not my legal signature. No, it is but it doesn't work
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.640]   Anybody who uses it's but it's getting it backwards. Oh my god. Look at that
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:01.120]   Okay, holy kamole mug in a bowley and it looks just like now the one
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:06.000]   But but now but now when you when you when you have a just open up any document in there
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.920]   And you can just you just say add signature and it just pops up and you can scale it and move it around
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:17.200]   Put it right where it needs to be and and it's it's it's it's this one little feature that between this and adding text to the
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:20.720]   Uh, you know, just adding text over top of whatever's already in the pdf
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:24.160]   So i'm not trying to figure out how to deconstruct the pdf or anything else
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:27.120]   And there's lots of great tools out there, you know that a pdf
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:29.680]   You know that you can do other things with pdfs
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:33.120]   but something built into your mac that is easy to use and
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:40.000]   You know and someone was I don't know who was doing it was they were throwing uh preview under the under the bus and i was like
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.160]   Are you kidding me? I use that every day. It saves my life every day not saves my life
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:47.920]   But saves me like minutes, which you know, I have to sign a lot of things so it's
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:53.360]   Save me five or ten minutes every single time saves me like hours a day. So tools annotate
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:55.680]   Signature
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:59.440]   You pick a signature. I'm gonna now sign my del manual
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:01.520]   There you go drag it around
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:03.760]   See
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:06.960]   It's now and oh by the way hold the shift key down and you can scale it
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:09.360]   Yeah, yeah big or little
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:11.360]   That only nice job. That's nice
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:16.560]   Not only that but it's great for for forms filling too because it will sense that if you have a pdf form to fill out
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:20.080]   It will sense where the lines are so you can just click on the lines and type information
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:23.200]   And this is transparent automatically, which is really cool
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:27.360]   I use it all the time too when I get like ndas and he designed or loan agreement
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:32.240]   For hardware, it's like it used to be what back in the back in the in the old days
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:36.400]   It was you know, I kind of would like to have this new
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:40.000]   $8,000 laptop four months before anybody else gets it, but
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.400]   Oh god, I got five where did I put my fax machine into I have paper
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:49.600]   Totally I have whereas this is like it comes in and five minutes later. It goes back out again. Perfect
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:54.240]   Yeah, I used for I used pre-view for conversion. I use pre-view for rescaling
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:57.360]   It's like because you don't I've got all kinds of apps for graphics
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:02.720]   But sometimes all I want to do is get something under Twitter's two megabyte limit and that's all I need to do
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:08.240]   You're right was it Walt Mossberg or somebody was saying how bad preview was and I was kind of surprised because I thought this is yeah
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:11.280]   I love how I can actually work well. Yeah
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:12.640]   Yeah
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:15.280]   Dude, I use it to write dates too like as a signature
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:20.640]   I'll write the date out so that on the document it looks like I signed and dated the document
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:22.560]   Oh, you are one smart cookie
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:29.040]   I just when I sold my house in LA that they sent me the sign so much stuff as if and this is what's really sad
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:32.400]   Is like as if that proves that this is that that was you
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:37.600]   We have the technology we have public key cryptography
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:43.840]   You can use real digital signatures that are much harder to fake but no no
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:47.840]   We're gonna help fax you a document and ask you to sign it or you create an initial to
[01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:51.520]   Like an initial initial have an initial date and full-center. Yeah, yeah
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:53.840]   And I just went through the document I do that with PDF pen pro
[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:57.680]   Which I use which is a great PDF program that does all sorts of extra stuff
[01:58:57.680 --> 01:59:00.160]   But boy, it's nice just to have it come with the operating system
[01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:03.200]   And I have PDF pen pro too which I which I like and I use for other things
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:07.520]   It's great. Yeah, a whole library of things stamps, right? Yeah
[01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:12.560]   But but this is just for something that's already built in so easy super and people go
[01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:14.640]   Well, how do I get my signature in there? I don't want to sign my trackpad
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:18.880]   I'm like you just sign a piece of paper and show it to the computer and you're done. Yeah, it's awesome
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000]   Thank you, Alex Lindsey
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:28.640]   Mr. Andy Anaco don't give me another thing to buy because you're on a roll and I'm on a tear
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:36.000]   Okay, well, I'm sorry to tell you that I bought something last week that I've really been loved with and I'm glad that I bought it
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:39.280]   Pretty soon. We're gonna be tweeting. Mark Zuckerberg. Call me. I need money
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:45.680]   Is that kind of even watching our show? Maybe it's it maybe it's too many Alex recommendation
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:51.440]   Alex is free with zero Alex's this week. So he's redeemed itself
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:56.720]   Well, of course it runs best on a brand new 5k iMac, of course, whether you want to
[01:59:56.720 --> 02:00:03.360]   Um, I've been doing a bunch of like upgrades around the office and let talk about like ergonomic sort of things
[02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:08.160]   And so one of the things I've been meaning to get for a while is a really good keyboard because
[02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:12.240]   I had a bunch that I liked but they stopped making them like good logitech keyboards
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:18.320]   And then so I sort of like switched to just like by default using like decent, but you know notebook style
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:24.160]   Bluetooth keyboards, but I finally got like a good like a good keyboard with cherry switches
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:28.960]   This is the code keyboard from wsd. Oh, I do
[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:31.600]   I want it exactly and
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:36.880]   I could say about it is that it's as good as the free keyboard you used to get with a mac like
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:38.880]   1984
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:42.960]   Because this sort of technology they just don't give you away anymore
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:47.200]   So it has these really cool the brand name is cherry. They've been making key switches forever
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:51.040]   Uh, and the what you can get from it is that if I just type like this
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:53.680]   You'll understand what I'm talking about
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:55.680]   Oh, man. It's like the sound maybe
[02:00:55.680 --> 02:01:00.720]   Mechanical switches that don't have they don't just they're not like notebook style switches
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:05.520]   Which has like a little rubber bumper and underneath that that sort of bounces down then bounces back up again
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:08.320]   The tactile feedback is just wonderful
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:14.560]   The fact that each of these keys is like dished out you can see a little bit your fingers just find where to go
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:20.000]   There's no mistriking whatsoever. It's heavy and has like big rubber feet on the bottom of it
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000]   So it doesn't slide around on the keyboard
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:27.520]   Uh, it has backlighting and you can set the level of backlighting and even if you unplug it and plug it back in again
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:30.160]   Uh, it will remember that backlighting level
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:35.520]   Uh, it's just lovely. Uh, it's uh, the the the other cool thing is that you can decide
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.880]   It is it is completely upgradable. It is completely serviceable
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:43.520]   And when you order it you can decide what kind of key switches you want inside there
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:48.320]   These are cherry brown switches, which are the pretty much the most comfortable
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:54.560]   For the for most people the most comfortable switch if you like the really loud clacky clacky clacky clacky can get the blues
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:02:00.400]   Uh, you can also get green switches and they will actually also add like o-ring dampeners in there
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:04.400]   So it'll be almost completely silent. Oh, the only the only there's not a bad thing about it
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:11.200]   But of course, I can't use this while i'm sometimes, you know, we're all like sort of looking things up and like looking reading like the next article or whatever
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:15.280]   You can't use this while podcasting because people will listen to it
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:21.760]   Uh, but the other so it's it definitely uh, uh, it's it behooves you to like think about what kind of keys you want
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:25.840]   They will also this is on the one from uh from WASD the manufacturers
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:29.840]   But they will actually sell you a sampler pack of just key switches
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:34.800]   So this one is from a different company, but it has samples of like four different kinds of cherry key switches
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:38.640]   And it also came with like a little little bundle of uh of o-rings
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:41.520]   So you can actually test and how each one of these feels
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:48.720]   And finally say okay, I want the brown switches, but I want uh, the I want I want blue o-rings underneath it
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:50.640]   And that gives me the best response
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:55.200]   Also because it's designed I mean there these aren't like sealed up notebook keyboards
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:03:01.280]   So if it gets dirty, you can yank off the key cap it actually comes with a key cap removal tool and clean it
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:04.640]   If for whatever reason, let's say you're being a little bit too
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:08.160]   Heshin aggression when you're playing a game and you break the key
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:10.240]   You don't have to throw out the whole keyboard
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:12.560]   You can just simply replace that one key switch
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:16.000]   You can even like if you want the escape key to be a different color
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:20.320]   You can pull the escape key and buy like a red one do do exactly what you want
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:23.600]   Uh, love this to death so many so many nice little touches too
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.720]   Like this is obviously a usb keyboard. It's not wireless
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:30.320]   But they've actually like put channels underneath it so that you can route
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:34.000]   You can route the cable to go left right or straight up
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:38.320]   Uh another thing all that does it have a second usb port for the mouse
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:42.400]   No, that's one thing I like about the apple keyboard. Yeah, that's the only thing
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:45.280]   That's the only thing that's the one thing I wish it had because that keeps clutter
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:47.520]   Yeah, kind of a little bit a bit better under control
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:52.320]   Uh, but that's really the only thing that I think that you could improve this uh that you can improve this with
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:59.360]   Um, it is uh apple compatible. It's also windows compatible actually and I I'm I'm such an old geek
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:00.800]   But it made me so happy
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:06.400]   This is the first device I've bought since like 1990 where look at that dip switches
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:10.240]   Which are like for a second and you can disable the control key with the dip switch
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:16.160]   You can disable the control key you can make the caps lock key do something else if you don't use caps swap alt with command
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:18.160]   If you're on a mac and you want it to be mackish
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:20.320]   Exactly. It doesn't have it
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:23.760]   Unfortunately, it doesn't another thing it would be lovely to have but it's not a big deal
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:27.760]   It doesn't have like a double like uh if you look at the legend for like the alt key
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:33.360]   It doesn't have like two different pieces of artwork for the command key and alt it's just alt but that's okay
[02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:36.880]   I mean, it's not like your your hands know where it is. You don't have to actually go looking for it
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:42.880]   Uh, but uh, it's it's not cheap, but it might be the last keyboard that you'll buy for 10 years
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:44.880]   Which color did you get?
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:49.760]   It's only available in excuse me the key the keys I got where's uh, where the brown switches very brown
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:54.080]   Okay, yeah, and to be honest it did take me because I've been typing on nothing
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:05:01.280]   But notebook style keys for like a year. It did take me a good few hours before I got my sea legs back
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:04.480]   But after that it had the it had the weirdest effect on me
[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:08.400]   I often because I still I do almost all my writing on my macbook
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:14.480]   I often will like start something like in bed upstairs when I wake up and then like i'll make myself my
[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:17.440]   English muffin and i'll be like continuing to work like on the sofa
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:21.680]   And maybe i'll be working like through lunch on the sofa. I enjoy
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:25.760]   Typing on this keyboard so much now i'm actually going into the office
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:33.760]   And like getting starting my day like a real business person like sitting at line of desk because I just prefer this to the feel of the notebook
[02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:37.040]   Actually, I actually feel a little bit disappointed that I hacked
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:41.600]   When I take my macbook out of the house that I have to actually use the macbooks keyboard
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:45.600]   But I don't want to be one of those people who goes to like starbucks with a loud clacky
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:48.240]   Like 81 pound keyboard because that could be
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:51.280]   I got an eye back on your shoulders. It is. Yeah
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:56.160]   So like I recommend it really really highly if
[02:05:56.160 --> 02:05:58.000]   I don't know
[02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:01.120]   I just don't know if there are people who have never used a proper keyboard before
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:06.880]   And if you will just never you're just at this point you're just not even house trained for proper mechanical keys, which is anymore
[02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:10.720]   Uh, but I just got to say that I'm this is one of the best
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:16.560]   The keyboard I got they have it in this is the 87 key version or what's called the what's often called the 10 keyless
[02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:22.080]   Format where it has it's an extended keyboard only the only thing it's missing is it doesn't have a numeric keypad
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:28.080]   But it does have like all the navigation keys on it. You can also get the full like 101 Saratoga flight deck
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:32.320]   Size one, but this one is I think 145
[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:36.480]   Dollars I have to check you can go to code keyboards.com
[02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:40.800]   Uh for the the straight one you guys 150 they have a 145
[02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:47.360]   Uh, the one the one I got is 145. Oh, uh, the one that's the 87 key mechanic. Oh 87 key brown
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:51.440]   Yeah, if you get 104 keyboard is 150 just five bucks more
[02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:55.920]   But like I said, I mean I I had a problem because I loved there's a lotchetec had
[02:06:55.920 --> 02:07:03.440]   Uh, a line of keyboards. I really liked that I'm stupid for not I felt like I'm stupid for not buying them for 70 dollars when they got
[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:05.200]   Cleared out
[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:11.120]   Uh because I'll I'll it all that was brown with it my keyboard is that one key just the letter a stop working
[02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:13.440]   And so I had to throw up the entire keyboard
[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:18.880]   Uh, brass with this I love it and I like I said, I feel like if for the next 10 years if I should break a key
[02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:24.160]   I'll just fix it and because it's just so nicely made very very sweet
[02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:28.320]   Wow, I've been looking at the one board
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:33.840]   One other thing I didn't mention this isn't realized that this this keyboard cable is not wired in
[02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:35.840]   This is just a micro usb connector
[02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:41.600]   So if you want to order like a off a amazon like an eight foot keyboard to reach wherever you want to go
[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:43.440]   Or if you just need a three foot key
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:47.360]   It's not like something that's wired in where you're kind of stuck with this curly springy thing
[02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:51.200]   There's so many little detail. I did I actually did consider the doss keyboard
[02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:55.520]   Um, I didn't I only I went with this one because I liked how plain it was
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:58.160]   Uh, the doss keyboard looks a little bit
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:05.520]   stylish for what I want also you can't get it in the 87 key version you can only get it with the
[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:12.720]   Saratoga style and uh, I find that I have to reach too far from the mouse if I have the full extended keyboard plus
[02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:14.880]   I never use the numeric keypad anyway
[02:08:14.880 --> 02:08:19.760]   It does have like nice dedicated keys for volume and uh, mat control
[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:24.640]   Uh on the on this keyboard, uh, it's a secondary function. So if I want to
[02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:28.880]   Uh turned if I want to mute the audio I have to hit the menu key and
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:32.000]   Uh, this other key instead of just having one thing to slap
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:36.160]   It's funny every time I hear doss key what I always wonder if portion design made a laptop
[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:38.160]   It'd be like doss laptop
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:40.800]   Doss laptop
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:46.160]   Yeah, I can't use anything that clicks at all in the uh in my office here because i'm doing a radio show
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:48.000]   I don't want to be no i'm googling the answer
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.640]   But uh, but at home
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:53.200]   I don't care
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:54.400]   That's nice
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:09:00.720]   If you try the the blue keys are a trip because the only other there's only one other place you ever hear keys like that
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:08.880]   And so whenever I was trying someone who has like a blue keyboard, I want to say okay, and uh, we will be what's hiring a special meal on this flight
[02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:14.640]   Okay, blue louder. So blues the clickiest blue blue is blue is really really loud if you look online
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:21.920]   Um, if you look online, there's actually so there there are a lot of keyboard geeks who will have just nothing but thousands and thousands of messages on this technology
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:24.960]   Someone made the one people are so serious about this stuff
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:31.680]   Some people are really passionate about the things they're passionate about and so there's actually like cut away like animations of what each key
[02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:40.080]   Type of key looks like when it makes contact the blue actually has a separate extra little kink in the key switch
[02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:48.320]   Post that is designed to do nothing but create a clicking sound when you uh when you get when you get to the uh to the contact point
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:52.400]   It's like it's like apple extended to sound we're gonna put a click thing in it
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:56.000]   And so people just hate the people in the next cubicle and they want to drive
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.520]   It's a very Dwight shrewd thing to do
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:01.440]   Wow
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:05.280]   Now i'm tempted really i really i really feel like i'm working when my brain is just here
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:10.400]   It makes this white noise when i'm working and i type it 110 words per minute
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:16.080]   And so when i'm really working it's like white noise that shuts out everything from the outside
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:19.840]   Remember that old typewriter sounds if you hear the ting at the end of it and that just sounds so great
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:22.640]   Ting
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:23.600]   It's it's nice
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:27.600]   Especially like if you like if you if you got a if you got a spouse or if you got roommates
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:32.960]   It's good to basically say no i'm definitely not just chilling out and like binge watching tv
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:34.880]   I have actually working as you can hear
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:37.600]   That i'm making as i work
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:39.600]   It's an mp3 but you can hear it
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:43.280]   Second at least i'm taking the time to at least put up the pretense that i'm not goofing off
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:46.240]   I do wish the return key had a ding on it though that would be kind of cool
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:51.120]   The doss keyboard does have usb ports for the mouse on it
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:53.840]   Yes, which is one thing nice to recommend this people
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:58.320]   And uh almost working in our chalom says there is a doss keyboard with just 87 keys
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:00.160]   Okay, i didn't see it
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:05.360]   And there's a and doss keyboard has the sound uh bites if you want to know what the difference is on oh nice
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:08.000]   So this is the cherry mix here the brown
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.640]   This is cherry cow
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:13.680]   That's the brown here's the blue the latter one
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:16.400]   Oh jeez
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:18.640]   That almost hurts my ears. Yeah
[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:23.040]   And if and if these keyboards a little bit too pricey for you
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:28.160]   Pretty there are a lot of keyboards especially intended for gamers that use these exact same keyswitches
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:32.720]   You can find a brown a brown cherry mx keyboard
[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:35.920]   For as little as 60 or 70 dollars
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:40.720]   It might not be as nice as this but we'll have the same key kept the same keyswitch technology
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:45.920]   Uh, i'm i'm not i'm not sad that i spent the money for this one that i'd actually been using one
[02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:48.880]   Uh that a friend had i borrowed it for for a day
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:53.440]   Uh and it was like, okay, I think I can spend a hundred hundred and 45 bucks for this again
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:57.760]   It's like it's it's not just hey i had an impulse to buy a keyboard
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:00.480]   There is a movement inside this office too
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:06.000]   Well, let's take things that are uncomfortable that make it uncomfortable to like work here for eight hours and make them more comfortable
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:10.800]   Uh, and so this was one of the first things i bought and it really paid off handsomely
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:16.880]   I actually i might change my pick of the week real quickly because i just got a uh apple watch
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:20.240]   Update from the quartz app if you guys guys played with this
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:25.680]   It's really interesting. It's a news app from quartz.com qz.com
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:30.800]   Which i think is a great news site, but the app is the strangest news app i've ever used and i kind of like it
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:36.080]   So it's uh, can you have the other the shoulder uh shot there? All right, go ahead and show it. So it's um
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:40.560]   It's a you're chatting with your news guy basically

[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:02.160]   And then the next story comes up enough is enough the satties and russians have agreed to freeze

[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:14.960]   Want to read more you click the right button and it'll actually pull up the story. These are not all from qz in this case
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:16.800]   This is a writer's
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:18.800]   uh article next
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:25.040]   What else is big in the news these days the parmesan cheese and your pasta could be dosed with wood pulp
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:29.120]   And a picture of uh cheese and an emoticon. Oh no
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:33.200]   The scream of moto con anything else I say back to it
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:34.480]   I'm chatting
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:40.960]   With the news app squashing cockroaches may reveal the secret to building an indestructible robot. Hey, don't do that
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:43.360]   How
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:47.520]   There's an animated gift of a cockroach being squished but not to the point of death
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:49.360]   They actually very good at that there
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:55.280]   And then police on the isle of white suspect alcohol was involved in a triceratops kidnapping
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:57.280]   And here's a picture of the trip what?
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.400]   And then there's a destructible robots for a good idea. That's what I asked. Yeah, right, right
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:05.120]   Well, they include super destructible
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:10.320]   And the seattle quam canceled is valentine's day octopus orgy doing due to fears of cannibalism
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:11.360]   Okay
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:14.080]   By the time you get touring test yeah the end of it
[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:16.640]   It will say you're all caught up check back later
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:20.240]   And then a picture of lady gaga doing boe for some reason
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:21.680]   Uh just because it's fun
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:30.160]   So it is all the charm of an of a messaging conversation with a fast-fingered emoticon using animated gift loving friend
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:32.400]   Who happens to be up on the latest news?
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:36.480]   I think it's very interesting. I don't find myself using it every day
[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:40.000]   But it's slack-bought who pays attention to the news. Yeah, it's weird
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:45.520]   It's really an interesting thing now why they have only got it on iOS you could you could do this anywhere
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:46.480]   This is
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:48.960]   Once you get the effort, I'm sure they'll do it on other platforms
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:51.520]   But right now it's only on iOS. It's free. It's from quartz
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:54.480]   Q ar t
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:57.280]   Z and I'll save the other pick uh for next week
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:00.960]   I mentioned that
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:04.800]   Everybody thank you so much for being here. Andy and ico Chicago sun times
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:08.320]   I've now purchased a massively clicky keyboard thanks to you
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:11.920]   I hope your marriage survives it
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:15.600]   Well, there'll be no question what i'm doing in my office
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:19.280]   Your doors are closed
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:22.480]   Yeah, but i'm tight. I'm gonna talk to my mom on skype. It's not gonna be good though
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:25.360]   She's gonna know i'm not paying attention
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:29.120]   Thanks, dalix
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:36.320]   No, i say i've done podcast with with people and then i hear like click click click as i'm saying something and i have to pause and say
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:38.880]   I'm sorry. I'm interrupting you
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:43.680]   Notice i'm very careful not to make lots of clicky noises
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:46.560]   Exactly i might be playing with my gloves, but i'm not making
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:51.920]   Thanks, dalix lindsay from pixel core always great to see you and your warehouse
[02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:57.520]   It's good to be here and we'll we'll keep on playing with the background i like playing with the system
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:02.240]   This is the system i have to admit was only running for about a half an hour before the the show so um, we'll improve
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:04.240]   You know it sounds great now
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:09.120]   No, i so there was a um so when we'd lost power and i was looking at the skype tx box the
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:14.080]   While i turned off all the effects the game was turned up very high on my skype tx box
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:18.640]   So i turned that down and sounds much better. Yeah, sorry about that. Yep. Oh, no you fixed it
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:24.480]   What was the success, you know there was a pop and you went black so we have we have some very
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:30.400]   For the thing that we're working on that that's over, you know over there that fusion reactor the yeah
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:36.720]   So it takes up a lot of power in the building and um and so when we they turned it on during the show and
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:40.720]   We have to kind of figure out where all the sugar power we turn it on because it kind of takes up all the power
[02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:44.880]   And so um so anyway, so uh so anyway, so it
[02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:49.520]   We didn't have the circuits mapped out quite correctly and so i ended up without any power
[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:54.640]   So basically you're saying that the bb8 droid takes a lot of power with a song with charge mode
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:59.840]   It's just it's just there. It's on the fast charge mode that it really becomes problematic if you use
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:02.800]   I was a talker back. It's fine. It's a usb c cable
[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:05.440]   Yeah, exactly
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:09.680]   What was the fusion reactor we were looking at uh with the
[02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:13.280]   What was it?
[02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:16.320]   Stellarator that's right. I think this is what uh
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:22.640]   This is what alex is up to is the is creating his own stellarator fusion
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:28.000]   Reactors iron man suit. Yeah, we just give it a thing if you're looking
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.280]   This is this is what's really behind alex
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:39.440]   That's actually yeah, I mean they we couldn't show that part of the warehouse, you know, but we like to just call it the the bell rod
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:41.680]   That's you know
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:45.120]   Incredible mr. Renee richie from i'm war dot com
[02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:48.080]   He's in winnipeg, so you don't have to be
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:50.640]   That's true
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:53.120]   And he's he's frozen for our sins
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:58.560]   I think like again last year they had temperatures that were lower than mars and when your temperatures get extra terrestrial
[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:00.640]   They should just evacuate you you just know
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:05.600]   You live there anymore the low and wooda peg was lower than the high and mars that day
[02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:09.920]   It's freaking crazy
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:10.960]   abandoned
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:12.960]   Abandon ship immediately
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:19.920]   Thank you everybody for joining us by the way one nice feature of this stellarator nuclear fusion device
[02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:24.320]   It's pretty warm. It reached one billion. I'm sorry one million degrees centigrade
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:29.680]   So i'll move it here. Yeah, you need it. Yeah, you need it. By the way, i'm leola for it
