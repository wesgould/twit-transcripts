[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.120]   I actually been doing a countdown on my head three days away from the final
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.960]   shipping day of the iPhone unless you're New Jersey and New York Pennsylvania
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.640]   because the pope is gonna sit down you won't get it till Monday and we have a
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.920]   great panel to discuss that lots of Apple news including a kind of stunning
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.040]   report from the Wall Street Journal but we'll get to that in a second first hello
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.320]   Andy and not co Chicago Sun times great to have you great I don't know if you can
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.080]   hear me I've got them I've got the sound muted as much as I can they're
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.120]   putting in a new grotto in the back I like the old grotto but I wanted new grotto
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.840]   to face a little bit more West I I told them not to do it right now so I can't
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.120]   even imagine you can hear me over this did I only I only hope that this box I
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.440]   spent a lot of money for to counteract it is working sounds like an Audi diesel
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.360]   engine behind you with the emission control off I'm just as mad as you I
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.640]   can't believe this but but he's like the leading grotto guy in New England he's
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.280]   booked like for four years I know these things happen Andy also with his
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.480]   name Richie from i'm more dot com within it is dead quiet Montreal it is Leo we
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.480]   we sent all our construction team over to the South Bay area for some reason
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.000]   there and all that happened well you know why it's quiet Montreal because winter
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.480]   is coming it's always coming Leo
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.200]   and phones are coming and finally to the Southland we go where Jim
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   Dowrymple is is actually getting his toes done I don't know what's are you
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.040]   getting a pedicure they're trimming off the end of the beard
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.600]   from the loop at the loop insight that comments great to have you Jim and there's
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.960]   a lot to talk about I really do want to talk about this really surprising
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.200]   report in the Wall Street Journal that Apple has given a green light to its
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.040]   electric car but well you know what let's let's save dessert for last because
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:16.800]   Jim has an iPhone what do you have a 6s plus 6s both lucky dude it's not rose
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:24.520]   gold don't tell me it's rose gold it is not rose gold space grain gold
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.920]   okay and Renee Richie I bet you somewhere in there have an iPhone lying
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.760]   around new one I I do not they make very little available to Canadians and Jim
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.040]   is most of Canada so Jim owns the Canadian the beard I mean both Jim and
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.920]   the beard one thought one knows that's a big attainment for us yeah the the
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.240]   embargo lifted I would guess yesterday because I started to see all the reviews
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.480]   Walt Mossberg on the verge which is weird because Neil I Patel also had a
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.520]   review on the verge to to enter Moss Moss my art has its own atmosphere and
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.320]   gravity well doesn't matter he could he could be doing he could be doing a
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.000]   buddy comedy with David Pogue he would still get his own phones I have one I
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.800]   have one request for this community and I think every review I watch was like
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.640]   should you upgrade from a 6 or 6 plus that is not a question most normal
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.000]   people are asking very very few like I think 20% of people mostly have those
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.520]   phones everyone else has an older phone and they really want some attention to
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.360]   guys yeah so but it's not an unreasonable thing I could I could make a
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:33.120]   request to them if any yeah don't be don't be morons and we can who you
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.120]   talk again could you I'm who are you talking to reviewers oh good okay and
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:48.720]   what would you say is moronic reviewers in what what regard I just think that
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.280]   it's it's okay to find something wrong and sometimes there is something wrong
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.680]   you know there's little things that happen that are bad but you know to go
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.800]   out and and just nitpick the death that of something is just I think I don't
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:13.120]   think it gives people a good sense of what the product is about right you know
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.320]   I heard people talking about iPhone 6s and 6 and saying you know it's an it's
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.240]   an okay upgrade I I don't know if they were using the same phone that I was or
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.240]   if Apple punk them and gave them a 5s or I don't know I don't know what happened
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:38.440]   well let's not worry about them because we got you okay what is what is a I mean
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.800]   there's a full article on loop insight dot com of course sounds like you're
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.640]   very happy I am I am happier than what I thought I would be hmm yeah this is
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.880]   of course this is the iterative upgrade this is the in between upgrade
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:02.200]   the talk the talk of the tiktok cycle and if you look at the 5s that what they
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.560]   added a fingerprint reader wasn't a huge upgrade to the five this is bigger
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.280]   you know as an aside maybe it's time to stop to the setting expectations by
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.640]   tiktok because usually what we talk about is does the case design look
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.960]   different or does it not because you're really here by here if I just if I just
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.440]   if you just look at the features I mean you think about how touch IDA really
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.360]   changed a whole lot of things and made the iPhone so much easier and so many
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:33.960]   different levels 3D touch is the biggest UI change they've made to iOS I think
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.240]   practically since the beginning and that's not a talk sort of thing I even get
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.640]   the impression talking to people at Apple that even they are getting annoyed
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.320]   that people are implying that every other year is going to be a minor iPhone
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.480]   release it was just not there's no new colors it's no new shape we we we we
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.120]   we stayed with the shape we had last year but we put a whole bunch of new
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.480]   awesome into I think that's fair this is much more than just an iterative
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.680]   upgrade there is I mean it was two ways to look at it because and even with
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.160]   Intel who uses we traditionally uses tiktok cycle to with the die shrink and
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.040]   then the architecture is that some for some people it's always the talk they
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.680]   don't care at all about the take the design changes meaningless to them they
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.080]   want the maximization of that model so they want that new architecture and with
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.840]   the phone they're happy to have the new design out of the way and they want to
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.840]   see what's going to happen with the next year so I think I know I know some
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.160]   people put a negative connotation on talk but to me it's always sort of which
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.240]   which cycle do you end up falling on and both of them have their pros and cons
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:30.160]   let's talk about by the way I just parenthetically you're absolutely right
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.360]   Andy the fingerprint reader was so significant that at this point I'm I
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.200]   want I don't want to use a phone that doesn't have one that may not be an
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.560]   apple phone but I do not want to use a phone that doesn't have a fingerprint
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.080]   reader even I extend that to the iPad I got my first I bought an iPad mini
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.000]   early this year because my old hard was just so out of date I really needed
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.680]   that and my goodness every time it asked for touch ID I never thought that I
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.040]   was thought to touch it it would be of course brilliant on something you're
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.320]   holding in your hand but not necessarily in something you're using on a tablet
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.880]   it's like bacon you put it into something and it just makes it more more awesome
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.600]   so Jim let's talk about 3D touch because I have to say part of the reason I was
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.200]   a little nervous about it is I don't think it succeeds on the watch it's not
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.080]   it's not intuitive it's not clear what's going to happen
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.520]   it's okay on the laptop but again it's not too intuitive it's not clear what's
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.280]   going to happen
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.600]   I'm gathering already from all the reviews that it is is really is a
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.560]   significant upgrade on the iPhone
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.120]   yeah really is
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.000]   it really is a significant upgrade because it actually changes the way that
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.200]   you navigate on the iPhone so if you if you look at how you navigate to even
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.000]   an email message you know you go into the app you go into the message you
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.880]   decide whether you want to reply you reply to it you might want to market is
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.560]   on red you go to the menu you mark I mean there's so many steps and then all
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.880]   the way back out again so with 3D touch when you're in the app you just press
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.120]   and hold on the message and it pops up like a little peak and it gives you a
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.320]   preview of what the message is if you decide yes this is something I want to
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:13.320]   deal with right now you just slide up and a menu comes up and you know it also
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.960]   works in in Apple music as you see there on the screen when you slide up a menu
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:23.360]   comes up from the bottom that gives you some some options of things that you
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.640]   can do to interact with that right now now if you hold on the playlist that I
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.640]   have on there in the screenshot then it will pop and that means that you've
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:40.000]   entered the application as you if you had have gone all the way in the old way
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.240]   you would be at that page so it's it's very intuitive it gives you a haptic
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.640]   feedback so that when you press you know it's coming up because it vibrates a
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.960]   little bit on your thumb so you know there's it's it's interactive all the
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:07.400]   way through and more than than just a a feature that I don't know is cool you
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.040]   know and something that you you think you might want to use or you know you're
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:17.520]   gonna forget about in in the next you know month this is something that you're
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.680]   gonna use every day and it's what's gonna be annoying are the apps that
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.800]   don't have it which right now is everything but yeah
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.360]   right right and they're not even all of the Apple apps have it I mean pages
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:36.960]   numbers keynote none of those apps or at least they don't have the quick
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.360]   actions what are you guys hearing our developers gonna jump on this you feel
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.160]   I think so yeah yeah yeah developers are gonna jump in I already know some that
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.120]   are doing it there are some apps in beta already yeah that are doing it
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.560]   yeah I can't case showed off the Omni focus 3D touch already and Apple showed
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.280]   off Instagram and some others at the event and they look really keen yeah and
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.560]   and I'm hearing a lot from developers as well between the iPad Pro and 3D
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.680]   touch there's a lot of companies add features that are really really nice and
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.000]   some believe in add features that even make apps look better Apple is the one
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.840]   that consistently creates new stuff that gets developers really creatively
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.840]   buzzed about what they found hard to do or implement a year ago that now seems
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.920]   so natural and easy for them to do so so am I wrong in thinking that this is
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.080]   not really the same thing is forced touch on the wristwatch or them are the
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.800]   it's similar technologies get implemented differently because the screen size is
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.080]   much larger you can't really do it the same way but the because you have the
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.600]   bigger screen they did something really clever and it's always how are you
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.000]   going to use this new technology that matters and they made it and the best
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.920]   description I can come up with it is they made it a way to fold space and
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.560]   create like a little wormhole in iOS so instead of just tapping an app and then
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.400]   tapping a feature you press right through the icon and into that feature
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.840]   that you want to get to instead of tapping a list item and getting an email
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.760]   tapping a data detector link and getting a map preview or web preview you tap
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.840]   right through that link or that item and it popped it you peek at it you
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.320]   preview it then you tap a little more and it pushes you all the way into that
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.800]   app and it I only spent 30 minutes with it not like what Jim's had for two
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.520]   weeks but it gives you that visceral feeling of there is a layers to this
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.800]   interface and I can push my way right through them I don't have to you know
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.200]   swipe and swipe and swipe and swipe and swipe sideways swipe in swipe back
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.160]   tap tap tap tap tap I'm just basically pushing in the more I push the deeper
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.760]   and deeper I get and I can let go at any time and operate back and it makes
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.040]   everything they call it an accelerator in the framework that it makes the UI
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.440]   faster and that's really the sense I got and it's another step with continuity
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.040]   and extensibility that stops us having to hunt around home screens looking for
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.440]   widgets or apps and just brings all that content to us right where we are and
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.360]   it's a perceptive thing but humans are perceptive so that it becomes a very
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.640]   real feeling of speed it well and I think it's more than a feeling of speed I
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.000]   think it is speed because I deal with things a lot quicker something comes in
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   I press I peek on and Leo think of that you get an email from Jason that says
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.520]   important and you know you see that and the first thing you do is start you go
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:21.320]   to mail and you you have to open it yeah but if you had peak you just look
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.040]   you tap on it and it says important I lost my sock and you could say well I
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.400]   don't need to deal with that can you tell Leo those kinds of things all the
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:38.560]   time can you peek and pop on a notification no okay no but that would be
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.720]   maybe that would be nice if you get a notification of Jason's sock mail that
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.640]   if I could peek and poke on I'm just think I mean look no future
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:52.240]   yeah not not peek and poke don't poke your your mop it's like don't poke your
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:59.280]   messages show title snap crackle pop Apple iPhone 6s plus I just I just love
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:03.840]   this is so on trend on Android and other platforms we're seeing the trend
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.600]   where we're trying to get people to not have to ever launch actual apps don't
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.240]   interact with an app interact with a feature within that app and a great
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.520]   operating system will give you different opportunities to drill down right into
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.960]   that feature so you don't have to open up ever know to expose a button for
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.360]   creating a note you can just 3D touch and drill down into just create a brand
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.560]   new note and then let me back into my life so this is this is some of the
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.920]   things that I had been missing from the iPhone that it's really exciting to see
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.120]   it come to this film live in when he was still at ever note that we did a
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.760]   triangulation with him and he said because he says what I my job is to
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.480]   think about the future about trends he said we're we're headed to a post
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:47.240]   application future and I went what but that's kind of the beginning of that
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.880]   where because it is really kind of modal to and Apple's been always against
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.480]   modality from the day the first days of the Macintosh where you have to go into
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.280]   a mode to do something and then come out of the mode to do something else it
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.240]   makes much more sense to kind of interact with it that way I'm excited I
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.400]   think this is you're right this is the first new user interface feature in
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.400]   quite some time this is a good be significant it also says like power users
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:16.000]   will most appreciate it because it will allow them to do things faster but look
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.920]   at this way really only for a while we had websites and then now we have web
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.320]   services so you don't necessarily have to go to a website there's API is like
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.720]   that like to try it website you don't need the web anymore you can just go
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.880]   right to those API's within apps and do a lot of things we used to have apps
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.720]   which are these big lumpy binaries but thanks again to things like continue
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.920]   anything's like sensibility and the Android versions of those you deep you
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.240]   unbundle those things and those features and those functions can be surfaced
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.320]   anywhere with the Apple watch they're even surfacing them on different hardware
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.240]   then that that until recently the logic was running on a completely different
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.760]   device than the interface was running carplay still does that so we're coming
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.440]   into a future where developers are creating functionality and you can pull
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.120]   those photo filters in here you can use those share buttons there you can poke
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.320]   into different I'm getting the feeling that one day I'm gonna touch my iPhone
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.360]   push my finger and it's gonna pop out a gym screen I think that's just a logical
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.160]   next stop yeah
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:11.120]   care for what pocket you keep that phone in Jim okay that's 3d touch camera you've
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:18.480]   had two weeks to take pictures Jim they've 50% more pixels live photos and
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:25.920]   others what do you think of the camera so the thing about cameras and the way
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:30.560]   that people view this is that everybody looks at the same way that they used to
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.760]   look at a CPU they look at a camera as how many megapixels does it have because
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.080]   the more megapixels is gonna give me a better picture but that's not true it's
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:45.640]   how you deal with the megapixels and the images once the camera has has
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:52.000]   shot that picture so Apple's new cameras 12 megapixels but they added a bunch
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:00.040]   of technologies in there to allow the picture to actually be better so that
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:06.200]   there's not a lot of bleeding of colors into other pixels so that everything
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:13.400]   that you take is going to be exactly like you see it now for somebody that
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.960]   uses a DSLR all the time or or something like that I mean these were
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.000]   these were taking these pictures here were taken you know just in the
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.400]   neighborhood you know I always do this though I always take a picture of a
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.520]   bright red flower because red is very difficult for digital cameras to
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.120]   reproduce this looks good and look at the background of that picture
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:38.400]   where it feels it's kind of blurred a bit and if you look at the shadows on the
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.920]   red to the white and then the shadowing under that I mean it's just it's crystal
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:50.320]   clear and when you blow that picture up it's just amazing to see so I am not a
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.640]   good photographer I've admitted that quite readily over the years as a
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:02.800]   matter of fact I suck but the the pictures that I've taken with the new
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:07.120]   iPhone are actually pretty good I mean you know a real photographer could come
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.120]   out and take a better picture of of that flower than what I did or a better
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:16.080]   picture of that sunset than what I did but I cannot guarantee you the sunset
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:22.160]   there's a they could improve fun okay I'm not gonna say that you know that's me
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.000]   that's the camera that I had you know and that's the real point is even a pro
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.880]   carries a second camera if the iPhone and I'm starting to think the I this
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.760]   iPhone I'm most excited about the camera will be the the first time I won't need
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.280]   to carry a point and shoot along with my high-end camera that the iPhone is
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.800]   really in effect I may even it may be even my go-to camera it looks so good
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:50.960]   what about the 4k video my my couple actually I want to do live photos first
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:57.520]   and we'll talk about 4k video I I'm glad I ordered 128 gig iPhone because these
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:02.920]   these these the live photos are twice as big as a normal photo the 4k video is
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.520]   gonna gotta be huge as well is the live photos something you're gonna leave on
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.360]   or is it something you're gonna turn on when you want it you know it was the
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:16.280]   live photos was something that was was interesting for me because I would take
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:24.080]   a photo as I normally would oh they're back we should mention the gyms at an AC
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:31.960]   DC concert and on stage yeah I'm not I'm not pulling a Steve Jobs here
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.400]   remember when they announced the iPod hi-fi Steve famously on stage said I am
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.320]   throwing out all my high-end audio gear this sounds so good no I'm not saying
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.800]   I'm gonna replace my high-end photography gear but I have a feeling that
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.720]   I'll take a lot more pictures with this iPhone I've always thought the iPhone
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:56.240]   pictures this is a very subjective metric we're more pleasing it's been any
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.920]   other it's speed to everyday picture what Apple always optimized for was
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.640]   taking the camera from your pocket and capturing a memory in as high a
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.560]   quality in as fast as possible and a lot of cameras can take better photos but
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.840]   they can't get them as fast to you and a lot of other camera phones can take
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.240]   really interesting photos and do lots of manual work but they can't always
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.920]   grab a photo very quickly so this this technology I think you know to what
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.280]   Jim was about to say is you have that phone in your pocket you take it out and
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.360]   you get a pretty good picture more and more often maybe it was eight out of 10
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.800]   times before nine out of 10 times now and they're adding in low light because
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.200]   that was a challenge and it just every step it gets a little bit better I've
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.080]   read a number of reviewers complain though that you have to remember is
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.760]   there's a switch on the screen it says live photo if you have that turn on you
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.440]   have to remember you know a second and a half before and more importantly a
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:47.080]   second and a half after you snap the shot you and and several reviewers said I
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.200]   got a lot of pictures of me putting the phone down a lot of video me putting the
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.040]   phone down so you have to kind of get in the habit of holding it up there for
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.360]   three seconds well and and that's true and I I mentioned that in my review as
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.240]   well that you know you do have to wait and there's an indicator on the screen
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:07.640]   that says live so you know it's not like you're counting you know and if
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.720]   there's an indicator that that's on the screen it says live and then it goes off
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:17.000]   you know it's time to move so I have four or five pictures that are you know I've
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.920]   taken and drop my hands too quick and the live photo shows you dropping your
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.400]   hands right well you know I you get used to it
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.000]   apparently Apple says we're gonna do a firmware or a software update on the
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.480]   camera that will notice you've done that and just say okay forget it yeah
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.960]   how how many people how how good is the support could be we talked about this
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.320]   last week that they said on stage Facebook will support this in their iOS
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:48.080]   app obviously Mac El Capitan Mac OS 10 will support it the watch will support
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.720]   it which is interesting I guess you'll have a be able to do a new watch face
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:55.360]   you can do now yeah you can make a little live with OS watch OS 2.0
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.400]   do you think we'll see it become a standard no it's not gonna become a
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.560]   there's an API Leo so and the nice thing about iOS the way that Apple makes the
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.920]   software stack is it's becomes almost trivial to add some of these features so
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.800]   if you can add the proper code to support it and it makes sense and you're
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.160]   on an iOS device yeah yeah but even if you're not on iOS device adding that sort
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.960]   of stuff like very few people do do the abstracted code where there's one code
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.640]   base or both their iPhone and Android device and they can very easily add it
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.360]   to iPhone and it becomes something that gets them featured it gets them noticed
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.300]   or get some press or get some good feelings I was the instant grad
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.080]   supported supported for instance believe that one especially cross-platform
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.200]   it's a Facebook company and this is it you know people say well you know Nokia
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:38.880]   did this first Zoe's on the HTC one did this and I loved Zoe's but HTC one
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:44.280]   didn't have the market share in the cloud to get Zoe's in a broader sphere so
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.400]   and Apple certainly does and enough people buy these iPhones that there's
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:53.360]   maybe some hope of that how about 4k video the problem with 4k video of
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.320]   courses you don't most people don't have any 4k displays unless it's on their
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:03.080]   computer the iPhone itself even if you have the 6s is only 1080p your TV is
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:09.320]   probably not better than 1080p so are we I'm sure it looks great somewhere but
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:15.240]   where where can you see it on your 5k Mac iMac and and apparently they're
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.960]   quite big yeah it's off by default to you have to go and toggle it on so that if
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.600]   you're just casual user and you're you know you're not gonna have to worry
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:27.200]   about it you get them really wants for your 1080p 60 frame setting yes that
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.680]   would probably be the setting to use most of the time there's still bigger but if
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.160]   you really want that clarity I think for most people 1080p 30 frames per second
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:39.560]   even that sufficient yeah yeah and remember it's not just about shooting 4k
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.760]   video and then looking at a 4k display I think I think what I feel like a
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:50.200]   would be a really Apple move to do is to use that just as a really big pile of
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.680]   data they collect that the user collected so that a new version of iMovie
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:25:00.160]   can do really interesting camera moves and basically cut a like a standard
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.400]   high definition video from that but be able to basically you're the two people
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.800]   at the birthday party and cut from here to here to here to here to here to hear
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.080]   do a zoom in do things like a digital zoom that you can't do with this
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:16.360]   traditional camera amazingly you can use iMovie on your 4k video and have two
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:21.520]   two different 4k streams and editing three on the iPad Pro about that
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:27.120]   I mean I don't for years I'd go to NAB and the whole story was well we could
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:31.920]   shoot 4k video but we don't really have a workflow for 4k video and this is on
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.880]   heavy-duty workstation machines that a9 must be a hell of a process we tried a
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.360]   3 we tried a 4k podcast two years ago and it took us I think a day yeah it's
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:46.360]   impossible to edit it yeah and then the front facing camera again this is an
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.160]   example of a lot of people have done selfie cameras in fact that was briefly
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.880]   a trend last six months ago things change in the Android world to have a
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:59.520]   great selfie camera in fact the Moto X has a flash on the front Apple's doing
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.080]   something even more interesting they're using the display as a I hate to call it
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:08.600]   a flash as a brightener how does that work is it flash yeah it's got a
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.000]   three it's got a special chip that will make it three times as bright so it just
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:19.720]   lights you up briefly or like yeah and when you go to take a picture from the
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:25.400]   front from the front camera it recognizes that you're gonna do that it it it
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:31.640]   senses what the ambient light is around you and then it will flash the screen
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:36.400]   appropriately to make sure that the picture is viewable I think this is
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.440]   gonna be really interesting does it do true tone on the on the screen yes it
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:45.280]   does so that's the mixing of light matching of light to the the temperature
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:49.280]   of the surroundings right so instead of having a big right white flash in your
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.640]   face you know what Jim we're gonna do it at the ACDC concert you and me the one
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.800]   bad point about Jim's review is I weren't enough beardies in it I'm gonna
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.600]   grow beard by then it's only two days off but I will you know between my
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.440]   squirrels and Jim's beard I think that I think that Apple gonna start optimizing
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:12.600]   for life for a and black for the camera just like they could be like it
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.720]   volts they could Volkswagen the whole results okay we've done 3D touch we've
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:24.480]   talked about the camera how's been how's battery life been on on both the 6s and
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:30.520]   the 6s plus Jim it's for me it's been about what it was before you know I
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:36.200]   didn't notice a big difference one way or the other to be honest it's and when
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:41.440]   I say same as it was before that's unplug it in the morning and it just
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:49.200]   lasts all day long until I go to bed so I have to say that's the single for me as
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.680]   an Android user considering switching to iOS again switching back to the iPhone
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.960]   that is actually the single thing that Android no Android phone seems to be
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:03.520]   able to do and if I can get a phone that will just last all day that's a
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.720]   big selling point I often say nice things about Android on this show so let me
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.160]   make sure that I also jump in when there's other guy absolutely despise about it
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:17.480]   I have I have the the new Moto 360 watch oh you got yours mine comes later yeah
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.720]   and so now I'm in sort of like a dual OS hell where I have to keep this I
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.720]   keep my iOS phone for iOS 9 and Apple watch and so I've got that it's
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:31.920]   tethered via Wi-Fi with my Nexus 5 phone to support this watch yeah yeah and
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.920]   it's like it and the Nexus 5 reminds me what it was and is my daily Android
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.360]   carries the phone that I own not the one that's like on loan for 30 60 days and
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:45.640]   it's like I I said this to the phone I was so annoyed with it like yesterday
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:53.000]   like I took you off the charger at 11 a.m. today and it is I've done nothing
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.080]   with you you took take no phone calls occasionally you communicate with this
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:03.040]   it is now six hours later and you are dead screen not just oh battery low you
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:08.560]   are dead screen I do not understand how that happens yeah look at your cousin
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.000]   made technologies available to this planet just as you were you know it's
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.040]   it's the OS it's really a simple it's the it's this is a huge among the
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.520]   battery but no company can take advantage of a huge among the battery
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.840]   like Apple does and they're not even satisfied with the huge among the
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.480]   battery they will still figure out how can we at least tease another it's like
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.840]   a victory lap it's like there's no such like a high school football with no
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.200]   slaughter rule saying you know what we want to beat you guys by a hundred
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.960]   points not just 50 points so we're gonna keep our starters in the game to
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.120]   Apple's credit they seem to understand what people are looking for and that
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:51.480]   really except for one thing price this is a damn expensive phone and it's not
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:56.120]   more expensive than it was but as as competitive phones get less and less
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:01.520]   expensive that that high price tag and by the way I think we've all agreed no one
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:07.520]   should buy the 650 dollar 16 gigabyte phone right if you if you like a
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.040]   purchaser for enterprise or for education if you know that you're one of the
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.800]   generation that only ever streams and never downloads anything like it's
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.600]   almost like you used to say if you were gonna get 128 gigabytes you knew it
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.320]   and don't have to explain to you why now it's almost a reverse if you're gonna
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.720]   get 16 gigabytes is because you've made an informed decision that your entire
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:28.120]   workforce or you as a person are only using it for certain tasks I don't
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.040]   require anything I guarantee you though that's somebody buying a phone for
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:37.120]   somebody else to use right it's funny that's that's that's the gift bag size
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:42.320]   again like my mom is gonna get this like my mom only uses eight gigabytes on
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.120]   her current phone and Georgia's husband only uses nine gigabytes on his current
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.320]   phone and both of them decided that they're not gonna spend anymore to get
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.920]   anymore because they just don't need it so I mean there's not that's not that
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.760]   they bought it thinking that that's how they've used it for a year and know
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.920]   what their usage is now so it's an informed decision actually I was
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:05.320]   listening to which podcast was it was Marco and John Syracuse I guess it was
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:09.520]   Mark's a little podcast yeah ATP ATP and they were talking about a study which
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.680]   I haven't been able to find by an Apple developer that said that most of his
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:19.120]   customers you had 16 gigs underscore David Smith and then he said of those
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:24.960]   people most of them had less than a gig free yeah but he also pointed out that
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.280]   people with 64 gigs which is the next step up almost always had plenty free
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.720]   like nobody probably needs more than 60 it's a bad line but I think I'm hoping
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.560]   that the new Apple purchasing plans and things like it will make it inexpensive
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.840]   like because still now $100 is a big difference upfront in a price but if
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:44.240]   it's between 28 and 29 or 28 and $30 a month human brains are remarkable
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.800]   rationalization engines and they'll go for an extra dollar a month you know
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.520]   like it doesn't look like a hundred dollars anymore so maybe they'll just
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.280]   be inclined well and the other thing and I kind of realized this and I think
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:59.240]   this is true not just for me spending the company's money for review units but
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.920]   really for a lot of people this this this device is now the most important
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:09.080]   computer in your life and you should have a beast you there's there's no reason
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:15.120]   to under power you should get the most you can because it's the most important
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:20.360]   computer in your life that's the name YF16 plus Leo beast yeah I'm actually I'm
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.680]   so excited I mean I agree with you I mean I really especially it's just the
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.600]   fact that this is a sealed device you cannot expand in any way shape or form
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:33.200]   ever and it's not a question 15 gigabytes it's not a problem it's when you
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.920]   have 16.4 gigabytes of data that's when this thing starts to become the biggest
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.240]   pain in the butt that you've ever had and you really wish that you or your
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:46.560]   department had found an extra piddling hundred dollars to spend on just another
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:51.040]   16 gigs and 64 is actually so quite a bit more 64 is plenty you're on
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:55.960]   them what bucks more you get four times more memory and I think 64 is plenty
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.880]   yeah I kind of wish Apple would make a separate skew for the 16 the way that
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.880]   used to do for the educational max yeah so that you had you had a visual cue
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.840]   that this was something different I'm you know I'm when I when I maxed it out
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:12.640]   and by the way I'm getting pink me too it's the right it's the only acceptable
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:18.040]   for a thousand bucks with attacks yeah and to think of it in terms of you can
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:22.920]   either have an iPad Pro with a pencil or you can have this little pocket phone I
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.200]   get I know I know I know there's no like direct equivalency between your
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.840]   your paying per square inch but it's still such a disconnect when you
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.280]   thinking I know how important my phone is I know that I'm gonna be interacting
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:38.800]   with so much but if I could pay if I if I could put another two gigs of ramen
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:43.480]   I'd pay 200 bucks yeah if only Apple put a phone app on the iPad Pro we just
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.800]   solve all these problems well if they only put a better ship I feel like a
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.280]   ghetto blaster Leo you can I don't have a better camera on the iPad Pro it kind
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.320]   of baffles me a 4k camera be really nice on a device they can edit 4k video
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.920]   yeah right anything else Jim we talked about 3d touch we talked about the
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:07.120]   camera the front and the back live photos touch ID sensor is new it's
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:12.080]   faster isn't it well it's when they said it was faster I didn't realize how
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:18.720]   fast so you know before you would touch on the home button to to wake the phone
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:24.400]   up and then you just rest your finger there and it opens that's how the old
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:29.280]   one worked now you touch the home button and it opens I like it you don't have
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:34.160]   no resting there's no resting there's no delay in between you touching the
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.720]   button and the phone it's not like it was slow before but it's so you're saying
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:43.480]   it's appreciably faster oh yeah well it's so fast now I actually had to change
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:48.520]   the way that I touch the phone to see the notifications right because before I
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.040]   would touch the home button lift my thumb off and the notifications would be
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.640]   there on the lock screen right well now as soon as you touch it and unlocks so
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:01.640]   I have to use a different finger to touch the the home button so that I can see
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:06.040]   the notifications nice and as I said earlier I am I've become absolutely
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:11.480]   come around on fingerprint yeah you have to have not just for a tap tap to pay
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:18.040]   but just the convenience the security really I mean it's about the
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:24.000]   fingerprint is that your fingerprint is is hashed in a completely separate part
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.520]   of the chip that nobody else can access so it's not sitting out there where
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:34.600]   somebody's gonna steal your fingerprint it's locked up tight there is one little
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:40.200]   thing that I guess it's probably good to say which is in the US anyway US
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:46.120]   courts have held that a law enforcement can compel you to unlock a fingerprint
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:51.440]   lock phone but they can't compel you to speak your password they can physically
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.120]   force you they can force your finger on all if you're asleep your your
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.600]   second other can put your finger on it so yeah it's been held to be the same as
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.560]   taking your fingerprint you cannot if you've been arrested not convicted but
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.720]   just arrested you cannot say I'm not giving you my fingerprint the thought
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.640]   between convenience and security yeah but on the other hand if for anybody but
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.680]   the government and by the time you're in trouble with a government like that I
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:15.560]   don't know if it matters but anybody but the government this is much more
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.400]   secure I'll give you an example we talked last week about last pass and I
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.520]   love last pass I use it all the time and I usually turn on the remember password
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.520]   because I don't want to enter the password every time and it's so convenient on an
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:32.080]   iPhone or an iPad with touch ID because last pass will accept the touch ID I'm
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.400]   sure - lane in one password will do the same yep except the touch ID is it on
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:41.360]   fire Steve we were talking about how it's a bad idea and a security issue to say
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:46.080]   to last pass remember my password and I said but Steve if I use a fingerprint
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:51.760]   ID to unlock it he said that's fine that's that's as secure if not more secure
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:56.160]   than the password and so it's really it is there is a significant security
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:02.560]   benefit to a good fingerprint reader before that led to the success of
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:09.400]   fingerprint technology is that we would all use such stupid little passwords and
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.600]   you know people could guess them they could brought you type them in they could
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:19.080]   do all this or even worse you wouldn't have a password at all so you know our
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:24.240]   phones were completely unlocked and you know all the information was there so
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.920]   at least what fingerprint did was allow us to lock up our devices and then not
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.760]   have to worry about this big long password well and you don't if you're
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.320]   significant other says hey what's your password I want to see what's on your
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:41.600]   phone they have to get your finger give me your finger
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.000]   just wait for them to fall asleep
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.480]   so parents this is something they keep in mind because a lot of parents I know
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:54.360]   most parents it with the with the minor children will say you know it's fine for
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:58.080]   you to have a phone and you should have a password on it but I must know your
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:02.840]   password that's part of the deal now they're gonna have to actually and I don't
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:07.320]   think that's a bad thing the kid will know come here Johnny put your finger on
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.080]   that that's a lot of like a lot of we've heard from parents who have their
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.640]   fingerprint established on the phone as well as they bought it's there that's
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.920]   a way to do it isn't it sure it is also businesses with either I like who use
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.840]   iPod sorry iPhones or iPads good point business they don't want to give the
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.280]   password to someone who's gonna leave the company so they register an unregistered
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.400]   the fingerprints then they can use the smart yeah it works really well what a
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:34.160]   good idea in 23 LTE bands let's get just a couple little technical issues here
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:41.280]   are all the iPhones being sold in the United States the same phone you mean
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:47.200]   I'm from a technical standpoint yeah yeah they so even if you bought it from
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:51.120]   Verizon you'd be able to use it if you could unlock it actually it's unlocked
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.480]   I believe yeah they're all using those same LTE bands it's all the same thing
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:00.120]   yeah there's all is there's only one model so if you go to on cu I'm slash
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:04.360]   iPhone slash LTE there's one skew for six one skew for six plus somebody say
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.920]   in the AT and T1 has another extra oh there is no there is sorry there is
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:12.960]   two skews there are two skews yeah but that's only for that would be you would
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:16.560]   but you know what you don't he's not like it won't work on AT&T you just
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.720]   won't get that extra ban they have three they have 23 bands across and the
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.480]   thing is that radios really are they people call them a straight like as much
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.680]   magic as science and it really is because all these things are not that
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.880]   compatible you add one and it interferes with the other one so there's several
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.000]   models and each one of them has as many bands as they can manage to put
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.760]   together at any one time and if you look at this list they'll give you a go to
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:41.760]   apple.com/iphone/lt e they have all of this put down here and it might be that
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.320]   some need this band and some need that band and those bands are so close
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:48.040]   together that they have to physically separate them but the list of bands at
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:52.960]   each model supports is getting incredibly long yeah and if I travel
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:40:00.560]   this will presumably work almost anywhere I go even China so it depends
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.680]   on what and by work I mean I take a Rogers phone to AT&T in the US and it
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.720]   works but it drains a battery because they use towers and signals and
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.000]   everything a little bit differently so there are there is a lot of cross
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.600]   compatibility but it'll always vary and there's I don't know I'm not
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.760]   Sasha Sagan and not Brian Klug I don't know enough about how China and other
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.400]   countries do their LTE but there's several standards but Apple is doing
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.840]   everything they can to make it as international as possible. There's also
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:29.960]   big news there's also big news for people who are on T-Mobile because the
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:34.600]   iPhone 6 lacked coverage for band 12 so if you are in a part of the country
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.360]   where really that's the only band a coverage band you can get that's it for
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:43.040]   your iPhone so I've the iPhone 6s is both support that and so again it's
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:48.320]   limited to people who are on T-Mobile but there are a lot of I'm I'm looking back
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:52.600]   at the support communities of people who are no 700 megahertz band is very
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.320]   important and there's one in Japan the added as well that a lot of people
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:00.560]   had wanted. I have to say in the United States anyway an iPhone 6s plus on T-Mobile
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:06.040]   is as close to phone Nirvana as you can get in my opinion. Yeah I think there's
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.040]   still one for Sprint T-Mobile in front yeah so they're still a little bit of
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:14.780]   a few different CMA models yeah yeah that's too bad. Are they so they're gonna
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:19.840]   sell them in the stores Friday yes if you didn't pre-order or if you did
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.280]   pre-order in your three to five weeks out would it be a sensible thing to go
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:30.280]   to the store? Go early. Really? Yeah. You mean like 3 a.m. early? Yeah or
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:36.200]   the night before early? Or now? Or if you want the one you want like if you
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:39.200]   have your heart set on a very specific color a very specific like if you want
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:43.520]   exactly one model particularly if you want the rose gold right yeah because
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.000]   you know those are either they don't make as many because they're not sure
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.480]   what the mandal be yet or they it's the one that's in the highest demand if you
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.160]   don't care and if you're happy with usually if you're happy with space gray
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.560]   then it's much easier than getting what something like rose gold so if you have
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.920]   your heart set on a rose gold you know 128 gigabyte with this this and that
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:02.720]   just make sure you're there as early as possible but not as wondering when you
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.920]   want what was our experience I think first of all they're gonna be more in
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:10.920]   in stock than last year right yeah they were increasing orders I think they
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.960]   said they were making a lot more they're they're trying they always try to make
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:19.920]   sure that there's enough and well yeah you know company wants to have a
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.800]   customer in the store that wants to lay down plunk down some cash and not be
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:30.400]   able to sell it so you clearly want but you can demand is kind of
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.640]   impossible the way the iPhone cycle works is it's like a big blockbuster
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.840]   movie release and that everyone kind of knows when it's coming it's one big
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.400]   launch day and it's like trying to get into sea Avengers or something I had
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:47.080]   read the rumor that they had made forty five million this year that's a that it
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:50.800]   seems like that would cover at least the first week so my my real question is
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.240]   if you're flexible like well I'd like rose gold 128 but I'd settle for
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:02.000]   titanium 64 could you go in later on Friday and say you know three in the
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.120]   afternoon instead and say hey what do you got will they have anything left
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:12.280]   depends on the market the area I mean it was also like sometimes carrier
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.280]   stores have them and Apple doesn't and because or best fires in remote areas
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:20.920]   that's why they're lines because you could I mean in the past that's but true that
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:25.040]   you didn't have to get in line wander down to the AT&T store walk away
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:28.040]   there's no guarantee right that's the problem there's no guarantee right that's
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:32.680]   many right they don't go they don't get this maybe they don't get as many people
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:38.280]   like who wants to line up at an AT&T store in a strip mall in oh hi it's like
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:44.200]   I am lined up for the first iPhone I lined up at an AT&T store but that was
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.160]   the only way you can get it right there weren't there was Neil Diamond got
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.960]   people lining up for a minute at the beginning and now we were pretty much
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:55.440]   walk in against the album you know I'm not that okay I'm not saying that the
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:01.760]   iPhone is Neil Diamond okay don't you know don't give wow Andy ah no no you see
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:06.240]   I walked back on that immediately immediately without prompting either I
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:11.120]   would be excited to see a Neil Diamond concert is I am a C and AC DC concert
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:19.480]   yeah I am I said you want to know I am the moon you are the world's I am
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:25.640]   so let me see I'm a little diamond fan I am too I've seen that I'm an in concert
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:30.360]   I can't I've had that all of us have had that that's that phone call that email
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.600]   from like you're you're an insider where where's what Apple store should I go
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.680]   to for the secret shipments of iPhones and I said what carrier are you on
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.840]   Verizon is there a Verizon store near where you are yeah you should visit it
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:47.880]   and the next days yeah I was able to get the 64 gigabyte rose gold iPhone that I
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:52.320]   wanted just by walking in and out okay what is it looked like from the early
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.640]   tallies off from and this is all from the Apple website that the rose gold was
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.880]   going to be the the one everybody wanted and it looked like the big one was
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:06.360]   probably gonna be harder to get than the six S right yeah the mainstream is
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.200]   moving slow I mean it's it's taken a while but with a note 5 and the iPhone 6
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.440]   plus I think more and more people have have stopped thinking that those phones
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.440]   are ludicrous and started realizing that it really is the most important device
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.720]   you have with you and for some people they need that bigger screen either
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.240]   because of accessibility or just because they want to get a lot of things done
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:26.360]   and it doesn't look goofy anymore we're used to it now this is going to be my
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:31.200]   little plastic pal for the next year or so that's cool whoa whoa what are we
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:35.480]   talking about my 7,000 alloyling
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:40.520]   aluminum aluminum aluminum aluminum aluminum aluminum what was it was it
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:44.760]   Neelite Patel who said let's face it this thing looks like crap you're gonna
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:49.080]   want to put in the case that kind of stunned me I'm waiting for John we got
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:55.760]   say to take another photo of his armband did anybody what were the the
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:02.160]   nitpicks did anybody not like the iPhone I read almost universally the six still
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.120]   doesn't have a YS which some people really want the object should but you
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:09.680]   know what get the big one yeah that's why I got the one that was one of I'll
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:14.000]   tell you why I wanted the big one and it's not for real estate I like big
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.960]   phones but I wanted OIS and I want a better battery life see for me it was it
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:26.240]   was mostly because of my eyes you know I'm I get older and I can't see as well
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:31.680]   and I honestly that bigger screen means that I don't have to reach for my
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:37.280]   glasses all the time if I'm just you know quickly reading an email I can do
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:44.600]   that easily on the six plus success plus but you know if I want to go in and
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:48.720]   start replying and doing some stuff then I can reach over and grab my glasses
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:54.000]   so whatever I can do to to limit the amount that I need to reach for
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.640]   something else just to do a simple task on my phone I'll do it and that means
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:03.520]   getting a larger screen I have to say that I might for the first time disagree
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:08.560]   with those who said oh if you have a six you don't need a success this is a
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:13.200]   pretty big upgrade it's a huge upgrade yeah and that that's what I don't
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:18.680]   understand about some of the reviews that say you know this is it's not that
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:25.440]   significant or it's iterative yeah minor it's a normal six or a normal S release
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:31.560]   it's not if you look back into what's been done typically Apple will update
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:38.800]   components LTE Bluetooth Wi-Fi and you know make make iterative changes in the
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:44.960]   S release to definitely make that a better device but these changes are
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:50.240]   significant I mean you would expect to see changes like this you know in a
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:58.960]   whole new numbered release so they did a lot of work with this one and the times
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:03.080]   have changed a little bit people still I know many of you are still stuck with
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:07.840]   two-year cycles and the early termination fees but that's shifting
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.400]   especially with the monthly plans that all the carriers and Apple now are
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:19.720]   offering I would say that almost on just on a spiritual level if you're one
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.400]   year old phone that you paid a thousand dollars for is still working great
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:28.320]   maybe it's okay to wait a year yeah and not have a little angry because you
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:33.440]   realize that the for me the star feature is 3D touch yeah and it's gonna take a
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.840]   while for all the apps to really catch up with it so it's not like it's gonna be
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:40.640]   a critical feature outside of the Apple apps for the next couple of months and
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:45.880]   it's not like you can't do without it I get if you see your money spend it
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:50.000]   however you'd like but I I think that a lot of people seem to be on sort of the
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   automatic plan that if it is if a new phone is available to me either because
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.880]   I'm off-contractor because there's been a new release that I must have that new
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:01.040]   phone and I don't I don't want to be responsible for people just saying well
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:04.800]   if I can buy the new phone I should have it well who's not Andy on the show
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:10.480]   anyway he's spiritual no he's a spiritual leader he's a guru I actually
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:14.520]   agree with Andy that you know there there are people that will say that you
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:18.240]   all you have to upgrade because of this feature that feature it is gonna take
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.400]   developers a little bit to come out and upgrade their apps and you know once
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:29.480]   you start using something like that like 3D touch you'll want it in every
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:36.000]   app I know this because I've been trying you know and other apps so but yeah I
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.440]   mean if you're if you're locked into something it's difficult to to justify
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:45.240]   spending money and then losing money on a one-year purchase which is what I
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:51.320]   think Andy's getting that's a difficult thing yeah that I'm sorry I didn't
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:58.200]   want to review no oh but I just I just think about my own experiences like the
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:01.920]   best the best thing consumer thing I've bought in the past five years has been
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:07.160]   the my Olympus OM-D EM-1 and it's because for the three years straight I was
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:11.600]   dissatisfied with the SLR that I had and I really I had the money put away it was
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:15.560]   like almost practically in an envelope taped to the bottom of my desk the money
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:19.520]   was already budgeted and there and I came so close to buying a new camera two
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:23.080]   years in a row because I just didn't like the old one even though I didn't see a
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:26.960]   new one that really got me excited and then when I absolutely fell in love with
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:30.840]   this camera I had waited three years the technology was three years more but I
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:35.880]   also had that sort of emotional and also the rational connection to it just
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:40.600]   like I've as I to make myself look pathetic I keep mentioning that I did I
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:44.600]   was one of the people who bought like the third generation iPad the retina that
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:49.720]   has practically no memory and can't really play games really well because
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.360]   well because I had that I bought the first generation one was two years later
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.720]   and I wanted to retin on I didn't think that Apple would release two point
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:00.320]   seven inch iPads the same year and so and I've been and so for the past two or
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.640]   three years when they can get man I use my iPad so much I use as a laptop I
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:07.840]   should replace it with a new one and I saw the all the iPad air great that's
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:12.440]   really great okay it's nice but it's not oh great the iPad air - it's even
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:16.720]   faster it has touch okay I mean I could but and now that I waited two years I am
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:21.640]   in love with the concept of the iPad Pro a device I still have not even touched
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:26.080]   and I can't spend that money fast enough and it's not I keep think I keep asking
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:29.920]   myself and this is the advice I like to try to give people try to know what
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:34.360]   problem will this new thing solve or what opportunity will it create and
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:38.520]   because I'm I've waited a couple years to get the iPad Pro it is solving a
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:41.880]   long list of problems and creating a great list of opportunities that neither
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:47.160]   of the previous iPads could do so that's why I say if there's if you don't have a
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:50.600]   compelling reason if you don't if a piece of technology does not get the
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.880]   hairs the back of your next standing up an apple can make technology exactly
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:58.600]   like that don't not get it but at least think about realize that not getting it
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:02.480]   is a possibility you guys all think you're talking to normal people but anybody
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:08.360]   listens to this show is very about it they're ordering because we were talking
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:13.040]   about the I've known for people who are sensible in their spending and think
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:17.400]   about it and we're not your enablers thank you for buying our sponsors
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:21.800]   merchandise but we're not gonna enable you this is a show for people who want
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:29.360]   everything new and exciting and and now now now now now and you know and if you
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:32.120]   know you know we're not pushing you into it if you don't want to spend the
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:36.960]   money of course not but you're our people to read it enjoy let's take a break you
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:39.600]   deserve it there's so much to talk about today I don't know how we're gonna get it
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:46.120]   all in I'm so glad that you're here Jim Dalrym because you actually you know
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:50.680]   one of the handful of people who got for to have had for two weeks these new
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:57.240]   iPhones and give us a real world review of it so I appreciate your being here I
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:02.400]   can't wait to meet you and Lisa we're gonna have fun Friday night Friday night
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:07.880]   gonna have a blast ball ball the construction workers seem to be gone so
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:11.440]   lunchtime in New England now they're two drug-operate every
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:16.520]   they took ambient and they're reading them all and they're all
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:21.400]   dealer or Jim took care of them
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:27.600]   let's take a break and talk about fiber optic cables you know the word the
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:33.040]   name Corning of course Corning's glass is what makes your smartphone smarter it
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:37.160]   makes it it's more stable but the Corning is also very well known in the
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:43.480]   data industry for optical fiber optic cables they are really doing amazing
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:48.440]   stuff with the new generation of cables now they're making cables available
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:56.840]   Thunderbolt and USB 3 cables that will blow your mind we're talking data rates
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:03.560]   of of for Thunderbolt of 20 gigabits per second USB 3 5 gigabits per second no
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.320]   other cable comes even close these are not copper these are optical and what's
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:12.880]   interesting about them is they put in the ends of the cables converters because
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:19.600]   of course it is copper that's going in but they the cable themselves have a have
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:23.960]   circuitry that convert the incoming signal the bits coming in through the
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:29.600]   copper into light laser light and that's then they use the fiber optic cable
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:34.280]   they're thin they're flexible and they go a lot farther but something a lot of
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.840]   people think when we first put in fiber optics for our storage area network here
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:42.280]   in the studio the engineers said don't step on it don't bend it don't do you
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:46.320]   know you're but I got to show you these new cables Corning once again is doing
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:51.400]   amazing stuff with glass this is a laser fires a little blinking red light I'm
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:56.040]   gonna put the fiber optic cable end into that you could see that it is
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:00.640]   transmitting down the cable but watch this you in the past you could not do
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:08.800]   this this would I'm gonna tie a tie it in a bow still it's this this is watch
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:13.640]   this now this one I I don't know I every time I do this I go what I'm gonna
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:18.200]   crimp this cable crimp it enough to jam them into these little holes here
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:23.360]   this new cable technology exclusively from Corning means that fiber optic
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:28.600]   cables are much more robust than ever before this is not something you would
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:33.520]   ever do with the cables we have downstairs from a few years ago but now
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:38.840]   these cables are robust enough to be used in your home to be used in tough
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:44.440]   applications and let's see is it still blinking yeah that's kind of amazing the
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:50.000]   light is still despite the crimping the bow this is great stuff they figured out
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.200]   how to make the USB and Thunderbolt cables super strong super flexible and
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:56:03.200]   transmitting at top speed Corning optical cables 60 meters that's 200 feet for
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:10.000]   Thunderbolt don't try that with a copper cable 50 meters 165 feet for USB 3
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.600]   declutter move peripherals into another room and proof productivity increase
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:19.160]   security somebody called us on Saturday on the new screensaver said I have a
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:23.200]   fire safe and I want to put my network attached storage in there it has a
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:29.080]   little cable run and I said well you know you you should get these you got to
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:34.320]   get these cables they're 80% lighter than copper cables they're so thin so
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:39.120]   flexible 50% thinner now they're a little more expensive but you're getting the
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:44.720]   best take advantage of a special deal get $30 off the 30 meter what $30 and
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.320]   $50 off the 50 meter USB 3 cables and there's no limit you could buy as many as
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:56.000]   you want so so stock up I bought a ton of them for the house Corning.com/twit
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:06.080]   Corning.com/twit do use the offer code TWIT at checkout they are amazing these
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:12.440]   cables we're upgrading the whole all the infrastructure so reliable and this it
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:17.360]   takes it takes a bending and it keeps on sending I'm gonna coin that new phrase
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:22.760]   look at that can you see it's still blinking now I have to untie this mess
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:29.720]   I've made Corning.com/twit use the promo code TWIT
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:36.320]   Renee Richie here from imore.com Andy and Aco from the Chicago Sun Times Jim
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:43.280]   Dalrymple from his backyard where it's nice and quiet how about that lunch time
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:49.040]   it's yeah I think they just took a little time off that's good so let's talk
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:55.680]   about Marco Armin I know I'm sure you're all friends of Marcos he created one of
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:00.480]   several very popular ad blockers and of course as soon as iOS 9 came out these
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:05.520]   ad blockers jumped to the top of the charts showing that people not only knew
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:11.040]   about this capability but were quick to jump in his ad blocker piece was what
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:16.400]   99 cents two ninety nine two ninety nine nine nine yeah that's the other ones
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:21.680]   are similarly priced right crystal was 99 I think yeah they varied I bought it
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:26.560]   well everybody loves Marco Marco's a great developer he did Insta paper he did
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:31.040]   overcast he's very considerate developer he thinks deeply about this kind of
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:35.840]   yes and you know is you I was gonna be great now this was actually a piece was
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:42.880]   based on something he just cobbled together for himself and he uses the
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:47.840]   ghostry database ghost to be ghostry is a really excellent plugin for Chrome
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:51.840]   that we've recommended before I presume they've Firefox another but it's for the
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:57.120]   desktop and the cross ghostry database as you know all these blockers were kind
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:03.360]   of the same way they create blacklists sites or URLs or IP addresses that are
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:06.880]   just blocked and that's how they block ads you can't get the ad from the ad
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:13.520]   server you don't see it unfortunately his his ad blocker used the ghost
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:18.320]   tree database which blocks among other thing is ads from the deck it was
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:23.760]   indiscriminate well it's not indiscriminate it's all ad servers yep that's an ad
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:29.040]   blocker but there's a little kitchen that get along there because Marco
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:34.560]   org uses ads from the deck as does daring fireball and the loop and the
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:39.520]   loop and I have to point out they are as unobtrusive as an ad can be I don't
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:46.960]   think anybody would ever complain about the ads from the deck you're not seeing
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:54.240]   right now because I've got an ad blocker on so wow
[00:59:54.240 --> 01:00:02.480]   I'm going to be helping that knife out of your back let me just turn actually I
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.880]   don't look actually I had it turned off okay so that's good they are showing and
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.480]   I mean look there's the ad field notes brand limited edition for fall from
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:16.160]   Shenandoah ads via the deck that is not a jumping punch the monkey annoying ad
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.160]   it's not going to give you malware because there's no flash it's a very
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.680]   simple graphic that is as good as an ad can be on the internet and there is no
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.960]   tracking ah there's not even any tracking no
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:32.960]   tracking nevertheless ghost tree blocks it and Marco felt well it's kind of a
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:37.920]   conflict of interest if I took that one thing out of the ghost tree database so
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:42.080]   he decided I think ethically and probably rightly to leave it in and then
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:47.760]   after three days he wrote a blog post at Marco.org saying I'm winning a war I
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:52.240]   don't want to fight he was the number one ad blocker and he pulled it the
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:57.760]   number one app of all time of all on iTunes the iTunes store and he pulled it
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:02.320]   um knowing that no matter what he did at that point he's going to get heat
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:08.320]   either Gruber and Dalremp are going to come over and uh break his knees
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:15.360]   or uh did you notice by the way have you noticed a drop in revenue or drop in
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.360]   hits from these ad blockers?
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:26.720]   um I haven't really noticed a big difference I don't know um I don't have
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.520]   anything really to do with the the ads because it's just yeah yeah I don't
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:35.600]   monitor the ad so that's that's not how the deck works and and
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.120]   thankfully you know with the deck it's they're they don't care about who you
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:48.320]   are they don't care about tracking you um they just want to put a small ad up
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:54.080]   there and the site is designed in the same way I mean you know Jim
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:00.320]   Jim Koodle who runs the deck is very particular about the sites that he has
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:06.240]   the deck on and you know what I think we're particular about the ads that
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:11.280]   go up there so it's it's a good partnership and you know I
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:16.960]   hope people see that and in in somewhere another world will whitelist the deck
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.280]   right so that those do show up well and I feel like by the way
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:27.200]   peace did not have any capability to do that um I feel like uh you
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.560]   you can whitelist on peace no you could okay yeah I I feel like uh you need to
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.920]   if you're gonna be using an ad blocker and I completely understand why people
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.440]   do you know there's there's good reason for using an ad blocker
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:44.160]   not just privacy concerns with tracking but but the malware that's sometimes
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:48.000]   introduced by some uh ads with flash in them not
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.600]   something anybody on the Mac or iOS has to worry about but still
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:56.080]   um and these ads are annoying in many cases not not like the deck if you were
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:00.880]   gonna do that you also need to send a signal that there are ads that you
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:04.720]   that you don't want to block you want to what you want to do is is tell the
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.800]   advertising industry do this not that uh you could block by
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.680]   site but you couldn't so you could whitelist by site but not by ad provider
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:15.200]   okay so you could say not the decks okay but you could at least say
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.040]   uh you know looping looping and mark it yeah but that's a lot of like you have
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.920]   circling every site people are gonna do right let's face it people are not going
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:26.880]   to do that but I don't think it was I I have to say uh I don't think that was
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.320]   the reason Marco pulled it but you guys I don't know if he has
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:33.680]   view talked to him since he pulled it I think he's kind of gone underground
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:38.560]   yeah I think he's really he said he said but he intended to say publicly in
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.280]   his own words so it's not for me to speculate yeah
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.960]   just doesn't feel good I've pulled piece from the store but the reaction I
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.080]   Twitter was horrible at times I was gonna say I'm very very sorry for the
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.800]   reaction that he's been getting I think that a lot of people have been
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.520]   speculating about his motives either accusing him of things that are
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:01.520]   contrary to the to the facts or things that should not be stated
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:05.440]   as a matter of guesswork and it's just uncouth on social and
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.520]   frankly just mean spirited I think I you we can have uh the collective we
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:16.720]   can have a debate over the ethics of ad blocking in general that's a fine
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.640]   topic but I have to say that I am very very proud of him
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.240]   for deciding that I personally have an ethical issue with this and I'm going
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.600]   to do something that having being a creature of thought that
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.480]   that lives on the internet I know that this is going to bring me a lot of
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.800]   heat but nonetheless I feel as though this is the right
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:36.720]   thing to do I think so few times do we have these conversations
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.520]   again the second time maybe it's the fact that the pope is in the country
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:43.520]   well the second time I'll mention I'll bet you the spirit
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:48.960]   that you have to we are required to do the work that we must do
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.480]   according to what we define as right and wrong
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:56.320]   and we do not have the ability to simply say that this is profitable for me or
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.560]   this is popular for me is not it is contrary to my beliefs as a
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.200]   human being on this planet but I'm going to do it anyway
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:07.120]   it's there is nothing but a positive thing for Marco that he has said I
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:10.320]   don't believe this is correct for myself I feel bad doing this
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:14.800]   and so therefore I'm going to pull this he also in his blog post said you I
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:20.320]   suggest you use ghostery on the desktop and he linked to purifying crystal
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:27.520]   to iOS solutions on your iPhone and your iPad so he's not saying don't use an
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.360]   ad blocker he's just saying I don't want to be the guy who's doing it
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.320]   as the personal pronoun it's the most important thing of the stuff that he's
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.960]   been saying he's saying this is what I but this is
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.400]   again I have to I'm the person who has to shave my my face every day in the
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.280]   mirror I'm the guy who gets to look at myself and if you don't
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.640]   if you you have to be happy with the decisions that person is made
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.080]   and he did say I know this is going to be immensely unpopular and subject me to
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:54.880]   a torrent of unpleasantness he said you know you can get a refund
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:59.520]   initially he had his own mechanism but oddly enough apple which I he says I
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:02.800]   think I agree with him I've never heard of this happening before
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:07.680]   apple notified him that they're going to proactively refund all purchases
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:11.680]   of peace just automatically through the store yeah I saw some people saying it
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:15.040]   happened once or twice with other apps but it's incredibly uncommon
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:18.720]   fair and he didn't ask them he knew it wouldn't he said I asked him apple
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:22.960]   friends if this was even possible and we all thought the same thing
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.720]   iTunes billing works the way it works period and no special cases
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:31.200]   uh can be made developers have no ability to issue refunds
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.200]   so he had to go through a clunky process uh so forth
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:40.560]   uh he says the regular system has refunded 13,000 people
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.840]   as of his blog post which was a couple of days ago
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:48.480]   um so I think it's interesting apples obviously paying attention
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.240]   uh and decided that he the refund should be made
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:57.360]   nevertheless they are enabling ad blockers on ios
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:03.280]   i you know i i you can defend apple if you want on this i'll just i'll just
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:07.440]   throw this out there it looks to the outside world
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:12.880]   and to me that apple in supporting ad blocking on safari
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:18.640]   uh is kind is kind of pushing people to use it in apps
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.320]   which have i ads on them or some other ad network on them
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:25.440]   and apple will get a cut of the ad blocking does not block
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:30.560]   ads in apps and apple sells ads in apps and in fact i've already seen
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:36.800]   i think in my opinion a smoking gun uh wired had a front page article
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:41.520]   a couple of days ago that said you can't read this on the web
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:47.920]   until tuesday but if you'd like to read it now use the news app on ios
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:51.840]   and uh i don't know if apple talked them into that or what the deal was
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:56.640]   but to me that is the consequence of this and it doesn't make apple look good it
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:00.400]   makes apple look greedy i think the only danger though is saying that
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:03.760]   is talking about apple is as one entity like my understanding is that there is
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.840]   there are people on the safari team who have
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:08.960]   historically not like tracking they've tried to do everything they can
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.720]   uh over the course of many generations to minimize the ability to track you on
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:15.040]   the web from do not follow uh to the macro
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:18.320]   there's just a history a history of technologies and this was someone's
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.440]   idea and apple marketing does push down ideas but
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:25.280]   apple engineers can submit ideas too and they can get approved and this was one
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:28.720]   of the ideas that got submitted and there's also people in the news team who
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.920]   who want to do the best they can for news products they're busy making deals
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:35.120]   to feature content and apple has done things like remove the ud
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.760]   id ability to track between applications and i add even an ad i mean even inside
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:42.240]   apps i think ad mob and others are still way bigger
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.240]   providers than them so to me this this smelt initially like i don't add
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:49.760]   blockers was the big talk but this was a content blocker they were very clear
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:52.480]   it's a content blocker and you don't have to block ads you can block
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:55.200]   just tracking scripts you can block web fonts you can block
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.520]   images and movies and i i think the safari team and i don't want to speak for
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:03.040]   them but i i get the sense that the safari team got tired of people
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.320]   complaining about the performance this is a team that was built from the start
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.480]   to consider performance to be sacrosanct like
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:11.920]   they they had zero regression as their policy they take enormous pride
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:15.120]   in rendering the web as fast as possible and because of things out of
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.760]   their control they they were getting a bad reputation
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.400]   prominent and not gonna mention any names but prominent websites were
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.720]   publishing articles saying mobile safari sucks
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:26.160]   and you remove the and when you remove the ad
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:31.840]   it flies it flies it is so fast and i think that at the end of the day
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.480]   yes this technology can be used for blocking ads and that's the obvious way
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.120]   to use it and and anybody and everybody knows that
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:40.160]   but at the end of the day it is now indisputable uh where the source of
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.320]   mobile congestion of congestion is on the web
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.960]   and this sort of forces everybody to improve their game
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.600]   and if there are if there are ways of making this better
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.720]   um this sort of enables that technology it's like stopping
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.160]   they stop flash inside safari and they stop udid tractors and it's
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.960]   it is within the history of apple's development process the sort of thing
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.360]   comes out but i'm sure as jim will say and
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.200]   and uh uh guber will say and marco will say
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.960]   there are good ads and and the problem with that blockers is just they block
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.360]   indiscriminately well they don't block native ads or growers
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.640]   or as they're thinking we can actually have jim see what he would say
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.960]   yeah well i'm asking jim sorry
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:21.440]   no i i think that they're the the problem that we're trying to deal with here
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:28.400]   is not dealing with ads but dealing with garbage dealing with bad ads
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:33.520]   and we've been dealing with bad ads for so long and so many sites have them
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:37.600]   that you know when somebody says well here's a
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:43.040]   a content blocker that you can use to to disable this stuff and make the web
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.920]   boysingly fast as it should be then of course we're going to jump all over
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.120]   um that only makes sense and i understand that
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:56.880]   but there are some people and some sites um you know and
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:02.160]   mentioned jim koodle from from the deck that's one company that is is trying to
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:05.440]   get away from the bad ads and then you have some sites like
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:11.680]   groover and and marco and uh jason snell and and me that use use the deck
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.960]   we don't care about tracking jim doesn't care about tracking
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:21.200]   um you know i would like to see those ones exempt from that but you know lea
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.520]   you said it earlier people are not going to go through and start whitelisting
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.480]   all of those sites it's just not going to happen so
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:34.560]   um we all get punished because of sites that you know just
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:39.440]   crush the the the web with all of the stuff that they have
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:44.240]   so you know it is unfortunate but that's where we are you're also going to see
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:47.680]   sites uh i mean look we've been there before as you say
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:52.720]   uh pop-ups were a horrific problem on the web they were almost all ads
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:56.080]   every browser implemented pop-up blockers it was just and there wasn't any
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.600]   discussion about it it just said lea i heard the best story we uh don melton
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.080]   on hit we recorded his show a couple days ago it'll have it up soon but he
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:05.760]   told the story of how they got pop-up blockers into safari and it wasn't
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:08.400]   what i expected at all it was steve jobs giving a preview
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:11.680]   to walt mopster of the set can't you do anything about these pop-ups and he's
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.960]   like hold on a second don't you think about these pop-up is don't like
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:18.960]   boss we got a ship don't you think about these pop-ups all right boss
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.440]   thank you walt mopster yep i noticed that jason i just turned on the blocker on
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:28.240]   six colors uh that jason is doing this is a first party
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:31.280]   ad and will never get blocked by an ad blocker
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.000]   um but that's because probably he sold that directly to p-calc
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.880]   correct and what p-calc is not going to get is
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:42.640]   impressions now p-calc probably doesn't care that's a
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.960]   a relationship between a gym and the i'm sorry jason and the developer
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.840]   but um most people can't do that that's it most people use ad networks
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:55.120]   and uh ad networks are not are never going to be first party and those
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.960]   advertisers want at least that's how they get billed they want
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:02.560]   impressions at least and some people are talking about using c-names to make
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.520]   them appear like um first parties and some people are putting
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.240]   javascript buttons to let you see the rest of the article
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:10.880]   and even for just to be clear this isn't new there's been people who've been
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.640]   trying to fight content blockers or ad blockers on pcs for years
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.920]   uh so they've got all these technologies uh they'll do things like make a javascript
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.880]   button that says read more and if you're if you're blocking javascript you
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:23.280]   can't physically hit that button so you have to turn off your content
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:25.760]   blocker and load all that stuff up just to be able to read the rest of the
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:28.720]   article and some people are putting up intercepts saying please take off
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.440]   your content blocker we talked about last time someone's trying to make
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:34.880]   comic songs automatic if you're blocking content i wish they'd done that
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.320]   here i am on farc.com we interviewed uh drew Curtis the founder of farc who
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.200]   was running for kataki governor uh we interviewed him yesterday on
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:45.920]   triangulation and because i have an ad blocker uh i get a pop a little
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.200]   little bar of the types is farc feeds our squirrel with revenue from ads because
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:55.200]   you consider signing up for total farc they offer a paid ad free experience
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:58.560]   uh and you see this if you're running an ad blocker
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:03.680]   see net you show you show Jim how cnet uh uh handles it with videos right
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.840]   yeah yeah uh Dave mark posted that the other day where they were saying uh they
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:13.120]   popped up a thing in the video and said um we know to say you have an ad blocker
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:17.440]   on if you want to watch this video turn off the ad blocker and reload the page
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:23.280]   right yeah that's why i'm sorry but but the the re um when we posted that the
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:29.840]   re uh feedback from people on um on twitter was i'll just go somewhere
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:35.440]   else right you know it wasn't it wasn't oh okay i'll turn off the ad blocker
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:41.280]   but a lot of that i think has to do with uh the site itself i mean the cnet used
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:45.600]   to be the big news site i think a lot of people have uh fallen out of level
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:49.600]   cnet they they don't necessarily trust them anymore i'm not sure what the
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:55.760]   issue is but uh they've moved on um i would i would suspect if people
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:03.680]   as john groover or if john asked people to turn off much more likely to do that
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:07.920]   uh they see they see is seen at as a big corporation
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.000]   whereas they see you know john and myself i mean we're individuals we're we're
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.520]   trying to make a a go of it on our own and this is one way that that we try and do
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:21.040]   this it's but it also comes down to the respect
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:25.680]   issue if you respect your users uh and ask for respect and return you're much
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:30.080]   more likely to get it right i agree i agree
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:35.520]   you know it we should we should we should hope for we should hope for an ideal
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:38.800]   version of the universe sometimes that pays off
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.800]   sometimes that doesn't i feel as though this is just a simple case of i think
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:45.280]   everybody should have the right to control what happens on their own
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.680]   computers especially where the web is concerned
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:52.720]   um i feel as though uh the web was designed as a medium where when you
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:56.160]   publish on that medium you have no right to expect
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:01.520]   or control how that content is going to appear on that person's browser because
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:05.760]   they might uh have a very slow connection so they've turned off images or
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:08.960]   they might have low vision problems so they're going to take the really nice
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:13.040]   font that you pre-selected and font size and turns us a huge
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:17.120]   huge ariel or hellvetica uh they might have a you know they might even have a
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.840]   plugin that turns all reference to kardashian into
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.480]   mariciri you don't have the right you don't have the
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:26.000]   reasonable expectation that what you send is going to be what the person sees
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.200]   on their browser could be on a phone could be on a big screen could be on
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:34.640]   whatever that's why uh by the same coin the people who host the who
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.320]   create these websites who publish this stuff have the right to say
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:41.600]   i am going to i'm going to control the server by saying
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:45.280]   if you're not allowing javascript to run if you're not allowing me to serve ads
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:49.120]   you don't get my content and that's perfectly okay for them to do
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.840]   um again we all have to make our decisions on what's best for our
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.320]   businesses and what's best what's best for us
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:58.880]   ethically uh and i think that this is something that uh
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:03.920]   sometimes the war goes on for so long that all of the features of the terrain
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:08.160]   have been leveled and turned into flat mud and that's the basis upon which we
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:11.040]   build something new and better and stronger
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.240]   we're gonna take a break when we come back there's lots more to talk about
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:19.760]   uh ios 9 uh we could talk about watch os 2.0 it finally came out
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:23.600]   uh yesterday let me know what you guys think of it
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:28.320]   uh we've seen the first unboxing of a fourth generation apple tv did you
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:32.720]   get one of those two jim i did not i don't know how they got that
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:37.040]   written on clearly no i'm i think people are unboxing the developer versions
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.400]   which i mean i understand why they want to do it but apple is not the kind of
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.960]   company that easily gives out developer versions and it can
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.800]   abuse it no but if people abuse it they might stop doing it next time and it's
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.520]   a huge advantage for developers to have early access
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.880]   to hardware and i'm sure those boxes like maybe someone got a review unit i don't
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:56.240]   know about but if the box came as a developer unit with a developer nda and
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:00.800]   all those things uh and you're unboxing it i it just it feels like you're
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:05.840]   screwing people over don't do it don't break the embargo don't break the nda
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:08.880]   if you got legitimately i mean more power to you but if you didn't and you're
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:11.840]   you're hurting seem to be unlikely if you promise something you keep the
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:14.560]   promise period when is this coming out
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:20.400]   october october so it could be soon it's not far off
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.680]   it comes into your developer friend gave it to you or something but it's still
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.800]   i mean like that's yeah it's not good
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:30.800]   um it's nine to five mac if you want to
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:34.720]   i'm not there's a lot of people there was a there was an unboxing the next day
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:39.200]   um yeah it must be the developer edition
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:45.680]   does it learn so much from unboxings too well i know how big it's gonna be
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.760]   uh and uh again i don't want to cast aspersions they might have
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:52.800]   everyone who's unboxed it might have got legitimate versions but if they didn't
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:57.760]   i just urge them to think over the next years think of the chill product
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:02.480]   our show today brought to you by 99 designs if you're if you're a starting

[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:35.280]   shipping notice it's on it's it's on the fast boat from China
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:40.080]   what do they do do they they must get giant 747 cargo planes
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:43.920]   and write and fill them
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:47.600]   telepaths what i would do that's what i would do
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.400]   actually that's what Elon Musk we're talking to Jason Calicana says an
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:53.280]   investor in one of the companies who wants to do hyperloop he said forget
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.960]   hyperloop for passengers that's not the real
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:00.080]   benefit you get a hyperloop between here and
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:05.040]   a and asia because there's no human so you know the the risks are
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:09.520]   minimized and that way you can get almost instantly all the stuff that
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:14.800]   they're making in China here but you apple like that
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:17.280]   they're putting hyper loops everywhere and all of a sudden we're krypton just
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:21.280]   dissipating yeah right
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:23.840]   all right this is an article i got to get your
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:27.280]   take on this one uh a wall street journal had this article i think was
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:32.800]   yesterday um by uh dyesuki walk up by ashi
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:36.080]   who's been doing by the way really rocking the apple coverage on the wall
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:44.240]   street journal he or she he he he he he says it is
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:49.760]   a committed project to build and sell an electric car with a target date of
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:53.840]   2019 yep according to people familiar with the
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:59.040]   matter in other words a leak from apple is that possible i mean i think if you
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.600]   talk you know to jim right or anybody you like you
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.960]   you get the sense with the car where we were with the apple tv or even the apple
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.840]   watch a couple of years ago where enough people that you know that are
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:11.760]   incredibly in the community that are incredibly good are working on a
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:15.360]   special project somewhere that there has to be a lot of fire to it
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.480]   um there's just no way that this wasn't going to be a thing given
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:21.520]   how much apple has been putting into yeah well we know they've hired a lot of
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:25.520]   people in that in that area project code named titan
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:29.840]   according to the article they've been given permission to take the existing
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:35.520]   600 person team and triple it that's a company wonder they're building their
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:39.840]   gym how many people yeah how many people who work at tesla i mean
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:46.160]   1800 people that's a business apparently will not be fully autonomous i
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:49.360]   i think 2019 would be a very ambitious state to put out a fully
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:52.640]   it's a regulatory that being there'd be a that's not gonna happen
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:56.320]   but we'll have some autonomy and and we'll be in apparently is the long-term
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:00.080]   goal and it's something you have to move people towards like i remember
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.560]   we were at cesla couple years ago you know both of us were at four and they
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:06.000]   were telling us why it just scares people out of their minds if you do too many
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.360]   things too quickly yeah you've got to sort of ease them towards the future
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:12.960]   even it even that even getting in the auto industry in three years is
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:15.520]   ambitious
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:21.760]   but i'd certainly look at an apple car
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:28.000]   wouldn't right yeah i would uh you know what it had a good user interface
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.760]   yeah that's a big jump though to go for making making computers and
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:35.680]   and digital electronic devices consumer electronic devices to make an
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:38.400]   automobile they're making a computer that drives
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.520]   leo but that's that's also interesting when you
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:45.920]   think about imagine apple only making 10 000 copies of
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:48.400]   something imagine if they know that they're not
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.920]   trying to please 15 million people per quarter but
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:56.160]   10 000 people maybe even total for this entire model
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.800]   i think that's actually wrote a piece for car
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:02.000]   file the piece for cars dot com that might even be online right now
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.240]   about this and it's might be uh it might be
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:09.680]   interesting to think about apple not even necessarily
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:14.400]   making an entire and selling an entire car but sort of making the parts that
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:18.960]   other and technologies that other that other companies used to make their own
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.920]   cars benedict evins had a nice piece on his
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:26.480]   blog about a month ago talking about how
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:31.200]   you can build electric cars unlike gas cars the same way you build a phone
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:34.160]   where let's say that you want to you want to you want to have a
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:36.240]   copy that makes the most secure phone in the world
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:40.160]   you don't have to now build a phone from the ground up you can have htc
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:43.920]   build your handset htc is building the handset using chips
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:47.440]   from from qualcom you can get the operating system from google and then
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:49.680]   put whatever secret sauce you want to put into it
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:53.520]   that makes all these things into your own super duper black phone
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:57.040]   apple i'm not sure again i'm this is this even guesswork this is just
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.120]   discussion of how different electric cars are
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.080]   apple could simply say we're going to build this this wonderful chassis this
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:04.960]   wonderful rolling stock that runs this really great piece of software
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.680]   and then other companies are going to be able to build their own coach works
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:09.920]   on top of it and build their own interiors
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:13.360]   but it will be an apple made car or we will make the software that all this
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.440]   stuff runs it's there's so many possibilities available to apple for
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:21.120]   this and given the given that there's still so much money coming in from the
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:25.120]   iPhone that's causing a fire hazard inside offices with all the bales of
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:28.000]   hundred dollar bills they have the amount of time to really explore what
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.200]   they how would they how would they most like to solve the problem
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.360]   represented by cars today well and i think that's something that
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:39.760]   that's important to look at when when we're considering what will apple do
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:45.520]   next um you know apple likes to solve a problem
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:49.920]   and you know i i think i'm being strafed now
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:56.560]   that sounds like the old 1914 fucker i might have to run to the anti-aircraft
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:59.600]   gun here and it's sam's lung gem it's sam's lung they found you
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:04.720]   uh i i think we have to consider is there an industry where apple could
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:09.680]   make a difference and and solve problems and that's what they've tried to do
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:16.320]   uh if you look at the ipod the iphone the ipad
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:20.160]   the watch that's what they're trying to do with all of these is solve problems
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.040]   for people so could they solve problems with cars
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.480]   you know further to to Andy's point yes i mean they could come out and build
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:30.960]   their own car but maybe they could just build the software and and and some
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:36.240]   you know a whole component software engine that would run everything
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:39.680]   and it would be efficient and things would get updated you know an apple
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:46.400]   schedule not on a dealer's schedule you know this is the possibilities like
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:51.520]   Andy said are endless and i i think that is a good possibility
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:56.320]   the last of course tesla's the last car company america to start up the
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:01.600]   car company last car company before tesla was uh four 111
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:07.120]   14 years ago uh tesla's market cap though is only 33.89 billion
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:12.800]   dollars yeah but it did tesla started or was
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:20.240]   founded in 2003 and didn't ship a car for seven years
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:23.520]   something like that took them a while and also look at how they did that they
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:27.360]   started off by selling a super expensive sports car
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.960]   for people who not only not only early believers in the technology but also
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:35.040]   what can we do that's special today and what you can do is you can blow the
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:38.080]   butts off of every other car at that stoplight
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:42.160]   with acceleration and then they came out with a more conventional luxury car
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:45.680]   that's fitted up like a very comfortable place to sit and drive for a couple
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.320]   of hours and now they're moving more towards that we can
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:51.280]   start with now we've learned enough and we know we've got enough capital we can
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:54.240]   start building cars that might cost 40 to 45 thousand dollars
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:57.840]   they're finally in the range where if you're shopping for a car you can
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:00.960]   talk yourself into saying with all the tax credits and all the money you'll
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:05.840]   save on maintenance and fuel that might that might actually be a more
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:08.800]   likely thing for me to buy than a 30 thousand dollar car
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:12.480]   so apple can do the exact same thing they can they can simply say we're going to
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:15.920]   build 5,000 copies of this hundred thousand dollar car
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:19.360]   uh and and then sort of work down from there
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:22.400]   again again assuming they're trying to build a whole car
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:26.160]   google has actually said that i'm sorry i'd have to come up the exact
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:29.280]   quote but i believe that apple that google has indicated that they're not
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.920]   really interested in building cars they want to build the software for so
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:36.480]   that i think they can build cars yeah if you look at at at some of the other
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.360]   things that that has happened and i've heard this
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:43.360]   thing from Mercedes where Mercedes has spent the last decade working on
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:47.600]   autonomous cars and electric cars and things like that so
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:53.600]   when it comes down to a buying choice uh do you look at google or do you look at
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:57.040]   Mercedes i'm looking at Mercedes to be honest because
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:00.640]   you know they have a great safety record and and their good quality cars and
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:05.120]   all that so when when i saw there's a video out there
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:08.560]   of of uh you know it's a Mercedes video but still
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.680]   um of the stuff that they've been doing it looks
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:14.640]   pretty remarkable and if you look that they've been working on this for a
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:18.960]   decade and so is google i'm i'm still
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:22.720]   leaning towards Mercedes from yeah you know especially when you're plucking
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:25.760]   down tens of thousands of dollars on a consumer item
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:30.320]   i mean i i i thought this is uh there's a trick i was literally like in the
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:33.760]   ten minutes before the show started editing down a thousand words and two
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:35.840]   five hundred words so i'm sorry if i'm quoting myself
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:41.760]   incessantly about this but uh this was it's uh there's uh uh
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:47.040]   it's possible that the end game is to just just like a luxury car or sports
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:50.320]   car manufacturers very very proud about how we're using the Ford
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:54.880]   M41 engine the most high-performance street car engine that's that's available
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:58.240]   we're using this suspension from this manufacturer what it would even be a
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:02.240]   boon for apple if people were Mercedes and BMW and all these high-end
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:05.360]   makers were able to say very very proudly that we're running app we're
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:09.760]   running apple carOS as our intelligent control system for the for the motor
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:13.360]   that we're using and for the suspension that we're using
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:17.920]   uh tesla took five years they they but they took a lotus
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:21.840]   body and they add you know electrified it so they were building you
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:24.480]   find out people are people are attracted to
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.920]   okay granted lotus also i think didn't lotus also designed the delorean
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:30.480]   but it's like you have these coach makers these companies that are
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:34.080]   really good at designing cars that have this that emotional
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:37.200]   appeal to certain buyers you let them do what they do best
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:41.280]   people are people love apple for the connection that they can create
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:46.080]   between technology and human beings so that becomes so subtle that you
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:49.040]   forget that you're interacting with a really complex piece of technology
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:52.960]   and you look at the software that runs that runs electric cars or even
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:56.720]   regular street cars these days it is it is an integration problem the likes of
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:59.600]   which have not been seen since the space shuttle program
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:03.120]   uh and for apple to make all that completely invisible and transparent to
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:07.120]   the user and make this the word that keeps coming up when we talk about apple
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:11.360]   product make it delightful uh that's a pretty big opportunity
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:17.200]   but apple to you know to its advantage is coming at the end of
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:22.320]   uh a lot of development in this area in batteries apples learned a lot about
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:26.080]   manufacturing they can stand on the shoulders of tesla
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:29.280]   and others i mean it's not like they're stuck they have to start from scratch
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:33.920]   they've been hiring people away uh from tesla and others uh and they know a
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:38.640]   lot about manufacturers so that's the most significant thing about these
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:42.160]   they're rumors and Renee mentioned the apple tv
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:45.360]   i mean i think he was talking about the stand alone apple tv
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:50.240]   um and that was rumor rumor rumor the white hot rumor for an entire year
[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:55.760]   uh we we you might have talked to people who claimed to have actually seen
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:59.440]   an engineering sample of an apple tv that was ready to go
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:03.280]   and yet it didn't show up because apple is capable of certainly changing their
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:06.960]   minds or deciding we had to build it to find out why we can't really sell this
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:10.640]   as a product but the interest most interesting thing to me then about
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:14.640]   all these car rumors are the number of people they're convincing to leave
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:19.360]   brilliant careers with established companies to start working on a product
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:23.840]   that hasn't that apple has absolutely no public commitment to at this time
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:27.600]   that's significant the meetings that they might have had they must have had
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:31.360]   the imagine the do you want to start keep selling sugar water to kids and you
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.520]   want to help me change the world speed like time's
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:38.320]   roller exactly yeah you want to keep killing the planet planet killer
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:42.160]   or do you want to help save the planet i actually meant the apple tv box this
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:44.400]   time because we talked for years but where is it why is it not
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:47.440]   happening where is it but at the same time you go to wwc and you see all these
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:50.240]   brilliant engineers who are working on it so you knew that there had to be
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:52.160]   something there and it's the same thing exactly what and
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:55.120]   you mentioned with the car there's enough brilliant people being involved i mean
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:59.520]   apple's poaching broad and wide and deep that these people are i don't think
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.840]   they're going there to twiddle their thumbs so you've got it you got to think
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:04.640]   something pretty cool is happening that's very exciting because here's a
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:07.280]   company that's done very very well has a
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.960]   you know one of the most popular products in the world has a ton of cash
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.840]   in the bank and instead of doing something incremental has decided to
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:18.480]   enter a completely new historically very challenging market
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:22.880]   at a time when that market is being completely disrupted
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:26.480]   and uh... will be even more disrupted by a couple of things environmental
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:29.440]   concerns the cost of gasoline
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:34.560]   and uh... the move to autonomous vehicles uh... there's it is they probably see
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:37.840]   this is an inflection point in automotive history and this would be a good time
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.520]   to enter the end of the fray
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:42.640]   yeah this could be this could be a robber baron moment you you look at the
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:46.400]   robber baron's of the last hundred years where they realize that every major
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:50.400]   city that wants to be an international city is investing in subway systems
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:54.080]   and transportation and highways and better roads and better transport in
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:57.120]   and out and that's where all these people just jumped in with their
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:01.120]   complete lack of morals to try to clean up as many as clean up as as many places
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:04.240]   as possible and if you think about a future twenty years from now maybe
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:09.360]   not even ten years from now in which private car ownership is a somewhat
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:13.360]   unusual thing because why would you want to own a car when you can
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:17.840]   press a button on a device that you wear or is embedded into your forearm or
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:21.760]   something and then forty eight seconds later in autonomous vehicle comes to
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:24.480]   your door picks you up and takes you exactly where you want to go
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.240]   uh... and if you want to have like a dollar off of every transaction from
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:31.840]   everybody going anywhere that's a pretty good business to be in that that's
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:34.880]   certainly worth uh... half a billion dollars if anybody's money to try to
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:37.360]   get into
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:40.640]   or they could take that money and put it into iTunes and really get that thing
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:41.520]   to sing
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:43.680]   you'd be one percent of it
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:47.520]   and i'll just go away completely
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:48.800]   uh...
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:52.800]   let's see what else uh... this was such a fun week all that the i've had many
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:56.560]   came out in fact i you i you i i owe it to you
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:59.280]   or maybe i it's your fault rene
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:02.560]   because uh... i saw your instagram picture at the apple store of the i
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.160]   pad many four
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:06.320]   and i said what is out
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:09.840]   lisa let's go on a field trip and we almost immediately drove up to the
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:12.000]   apple store and bought one
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.440]   um
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:16.960]   did they announce that that was going to be out on one and whatever announced at
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:20.160]   the event that it was cut it was totally overshadowed by the ipad pro but they
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:23.680]   mentioned on pastel that the ipad uh... many four was coming to
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:26.480]   and that will be available as soon as they could get the orders out if you
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:28.400]   could order it that day and they would ship it to you
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:31.200]   and it arrived in stores about when it started arriving at people's homes
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:32.000]   got it
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.360]   so uh...
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:37.440]   you know like andy i had unlike andy i had skipped the uh...
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:39.440]   many three but i love the many
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:42.640]   either one in the two uh... i got the two because it was retina
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:45.760]   and i use the to allot for a long time and so i've
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:49.840]   was actually very happy since i skipped three to get the new one
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:54.640]   screen is better noticeably better uh... wider color gamut apparently
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:57.600]   um touch id of course is fabulous
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.280]   i really like it is is it exactly an air to in a
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:05.120]   smaller case almost so it's got the like you said the wider color gamut it's got
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:08.240]   the laminated screens of the three layers refused down to one the only thing it
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:12.160]   doesn't have is the apple a eight x processor has an a eight processor
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:15.200]   the same one is in the iphone and uh... six and i found six plus
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:18.400]   that's mainly because the iphone uh... the apple a eight
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:22.720]   x is a large processor it's got eight graphics cores instead of four they take
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:25.360]   up space and they're hotter and you just don't have that space
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:28.080]   or that thermal capacity of the vice a small as the ipad
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:29.600]   uh... many four yeah
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:33.840]   and i'm like you leo i love the many but i also have an air too
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:35.840]   you know and and uh...
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:38.800]   i use them for different things and
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:40.400]   each one comes in handy
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:43.920]   this one i you know i got the small one because it'll be easy to travel with i
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:46.720]   got uh... uh... lt e on it
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:50.640]   so that i'll have always on connection uh... this is the field notes of ipad it's
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:50.920]   not the
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:53.440]   yeah it's not the notebook it's the field notes
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:56.400]   and it may not be necessary since i'm getting the six plus
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:01.040]   six plus but uh... there's something it's a different experience than using a
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:04.400]   phone it's it's really interesting i actually i had money put away because i
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.720]   thought it'd be buying a large phone last year to
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:09.760]   and i wound up that's the money that i used to buy the ipad many because i
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:10.960]   decided that
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:14.800]   i don't really want to i want a larger phone but i want it much larger than that
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:16.800]   for the reasons why i want a large phone
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:21.840]   and ios 9 is such a big payoff it's apple so good at creating new features for
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:24.880]   operating system that makes all existing stuff more valuable
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:25.440]   i was
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:28.720]   spent an hour on a our hour and a half on a train yesterday
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:32.640]   uh... wrote an entire column on my ipad many with a microsoft mobile keyboard
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.600]   got to the boston public library was going to set up for another two or three
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:36.640]   hours of work
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:40.760]   for dot that i actually had a macbook it with me
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:44.200]   and just took up my ipad many on the keyboard and kept right on working
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:49.160]   and that's how good ios 9 is uh... how much how much better the experience of
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.680]   actually writing and working on an ipad many is now
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:55.240]   just with the free software upgrade so we're gonna see a lot of great stuff over
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:56.920]   the next three months it's it's it's a much more
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:59.600]   shink decision today than it was even just three months ago
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:04.320]   easy the case that the uh... like the split screen feature of ios 9 if you
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:08.040]   you do need the new many if you want to be able to resize windows a few things
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:10.080]   you can't on the you want you know on the older
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:13.760]   on the older one you can still slide it in but now the main app
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:17.680]   kind of graze out a little bit not so like so if i if i see a notification
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:20.960]   come up that someone is uh... someone is sending a me me and i message
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:23.920]   i can swipe in from the right hand side of the screen and now i've got
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:27.560]   basically the phone version of i message and i can act i can read through it i can
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:30.000]   tap my cap of conversation with them for thirty seconds
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.640]   and then when i swipe it out again i'm back in microsoft word
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:35.400]   just the ability to simply have that going on
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:37.920]   or at least swipe in check an email to cut
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:41.560]   find an email copy a piece of data out of its way back in and pasted in
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:45.240]   even without having both pains uh... active at the same time
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:47.560]   it's a huge win
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:51.080]   yeah and on the many for you can actually do all you can do everything you can do
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:54.080]   on the app that pro you got to get a bite of graphics of the only trouble
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:57.000]   with the older i-pads is they have a gigabyte of graphics and every action
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.120]   used to using
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:00.480]   but every app has grown up in an environment where they had everything to
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:02.400]   themselves they didn't have to share resources
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:05.280]   so whether it's processing time you know if they're is apple one sixty
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:08.320]   frames per second so whether they were using all those frames
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:11.600]   or they were using up as much available ram as they could right that they just
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:15.120]   never had any constraints so if you try to add those into an existing device
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:18.720]   you'll just crash back to springboard every time is the criterion for getting
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:20.200]   into that sidebar
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:23.200]   because i noticed not all my apps are there you have to support size classes
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:25.840]   and you have to opt into it in x-code so you just flag your apps in that you're
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:29.040]   compatible so any app could be in there eventually
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:32.960]   and yes so apples done this in steps so they had dynamic text and auto layout and
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:35.760]   then size classes and size classes what they used to support all the new
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:39.120]   spigot screens i-phones so basically instead of saying i'm an i-phone app or
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:43.680]   an ipad app you say i'm a regular size class or a compact size class
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:47.040]   and what they added now to support split views that you can transform between
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.440]   those so when you have a big window it doesn't care anymore how big your
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:53.200]   device is it cares how big the window is so if it sees the space it just goes
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:56.400]   wow i can fit regular size class oh i'm getting smaller i'm switching to a
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:59.840]   compact size class so it's it's like having a little i-phone app in the side
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:02.480]   of your ipad and then suddenly it's like having two ipad apps and then
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:06.080]   suddenly it's like having a full ipad app it's it's really clever i'm happy how it
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:08.640]   works yeah in fact my stuffs work works on it
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.880]   yeah
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:15.600]   uh picture in picture does not work on the older ipad mini i believe but it does
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:20.400]   work on the mini 4 it works on any 64 bit device so i think anything with an
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:25.600]   a7 in it or up okay so uh yeah i know they snuck it out
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:29.920]   and i know we're not getting a new air too but the mini 4 if you especially if you
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:33.360]   did decide it i was really disappointed with the mini 3 i thought that's not
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:37.680]   that's not worth it but if so if you skip that last year
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:40.240]   then this is an opportunity to get a new mini
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:44.160]   not that there's anything wrong with the 3 and now the 3 was just to get touch
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:48.000]   idea the 3 was to get touch idea across the line and apple pay launched
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.280]   so they just needed some it took a while i mean like people say apple's the
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:53.920]   biggest company in the world but it takes a while to take everything in an ipad
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:56.720]   air 2 and shrink it down into an ipad mini 4 and they just
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:00.400]   couldn't do it by last year so they gave you touch idea and apple pay
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:03.920]   and just to put a point on what i said uh said a while back about does this
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:08.880]   thing create opportunities and solve problems i was fully aware of the
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:12.640]   likelihood there's going to be a big ipad pro and i try to look ahead so
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:17.200]   so what a what a 9.7 inch ipad in january or february
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:20.560]   makes sense in a world in which at this time next year i have an ipad pro
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:23.200]   decided that yes as a matter of fact it doesn't
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:27.600]   make a difference that the ipad 3 is not that huge a leap from the ipad 2
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:32.320]   given that i will now have the nice paperback book sized ipad for times
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:35.120]   where i don't can't even be bothered to carry something big enough for a 13
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:37.600]   inch screen
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:43.200]   ios 9 is it time to upgrade or should you wait for a fix
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:46.720]   an update whatever if you have an ipad i say absolutely yeah
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:49.920]   i haven't had any problems the winds are huge yeah
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:56.240]   and the winds in ios 9 are are huge and you know when you look at
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:01.920]   this is when when i try to talk to people about about apple products
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:06.640]   you have to remember i think that it's it's a software and a hardware
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:10.480]   uh and that come together to make this ecosystem and it's great
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:13.920]   it really is so if you have a device that can run
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.000]   ios 9 you're going to see some uh there's some improvements and some great new
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:25.600]   features so do it ios 9 downloaded by wow in one week more than 50% of active
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:29.200]   devices yeah the more users than any other
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:32.560]   software release in apple's history says phil shiller
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:40.160]   all you can say is wow that's just you apple people really like your
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:43.360]   operating system upgrade it made it easily it was like one gigabyte
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:46.480]   and right a lot more people could do it this time yeah
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:49.760]   yeah you gotta you gotta have a real good reason not to
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:53.120]   it's always smart to wait two weeks after a major o.s release because there's
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:55.040]   always going to be bugs they don't discover
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:58.160]   but you have to after those two weeks have passed and all the big bugs have
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.200]   been found in quash you have to have a really good
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:05.520]   reason on the order of i have an iphone 4 i don't want to upgrade and it's going
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:09.440]   to run like a slice of cheese if i try to install ios 9 on this
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:13.520]   to not go for an ios update if you have a recent model you should
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:16.960]   you should i put ios 9 on my iphone 4s and my ipad
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:20.400]   mini sorry my ipad 2 and it worked fine the biggest caveat i have for people is
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:23.360]   that if you have an app that is integral to you running your business
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:26.000]   your household or something else just check the app store
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.240]   and make sure that that app doesn't have any warnings on it because there are
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:31.680]   a couple apps that say we discovered a bug and we need to fix it so don't
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:35.520]   update yet and if that app is crucial to you like if it runs your home security
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:39.440]   or your office whatever double check that first and if you don't see that
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:42.640]   then go right ahead banking software is the same way
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:47.040]   i got i got i got i got borked in a pretty bad way because i could not update
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:51.520]   my banking app and i use it to keep an eye on my accounts and also to move
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:54.240]   money around while i'm traveling so of course i'm traveling and now
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:57.840]   it's there the the bank now requires an updated version and i could not
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:00.960]   update it and yeah that's a lot of fun so make sure if they're
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:04.240]   make sure you know what apps are critical and make sure those are going to be safe
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:10.160]   you said that you you need uh your app to move money around while you're
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:13.280]   traveling is that laundering money while you're on the run
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:18.000]   so kind of what you're saying i fixed i fixed the problem you're going to get
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.480]   the payments okay and frankly the video the video you sent me
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:25.520]   to the ipad pro you know i'm looking for something more
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:29.120]   hd than your camcorder i just want to warn you don't we come back from
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:31.760]   commercial i'll hide i'll hide this resentment but
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:36.880]   southbound 128 don't carry that 30 000 in cash shall pull you over they'll take
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:42.400]   it they know hey uh xcode ghost let's talk about that
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:46.000]   briefly uh we we'd learned about this a while ago
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.720]   that there was a version of xcode floating around that had malware
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:54.480]   in it and i'm not sure why you'd use a version of xcode that you didn't get
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:57.200]   from apple there's somebody said the great firewall of china blox yeah
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:00.240]   and it is incredibly so basically if you're a developer in china it could be
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:04.160]   incredibly slow if not uh terrible to try to download from apple so what you do
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:08.800]   is search google looking for xcode and you'd find a repository on a local
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:12.000]   chinese site that would download quickly and because people know that that's
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.880]   what happens they got a hold of versions of xcode and inserted
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:18.800]   malware into it that then i compile time and search it into the apps
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:22.160]   uh how many apps ended up on the app store with is it mostly there were
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:25.520]   chinese apps uh but some significant chinese apps right
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:28.240]   like we chat we chat which is dominant software
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:32.080]   the there's an uber in china i can't remember the name but that their app
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:35.520]   was affected what's scary about this is like there's a lot of times that we'll
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:38.480]   tell people just you know make sure you download from trust and source is
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:41.840]   keep gatekeeper on and this is all advice that could stop
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:45.200]   things like like um xcode ghost from from working
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:48.160]   but this is not your control this is under the developer's control they're
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:51.040]   the ones who have to follow those principles and you never know if the
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:54.320]   developer is using a consultant or a contractor or they have a friend who
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:57.360]   passes them a bit of code so i mean apple
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:00.480]   can do things like trying to make a proxy in china that let's them download
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:03.280]   faster or do things that that make it much harder to
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:06.640]   turn off gatekeeper when you're compiling software or make it easier to
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:10.240]   check because apple put up an article today uh giving developers a way to
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:12.960]   easily check if their version of xcode had been compromised
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:15.440]   but at the end of the day we're all in this together and we all have to make
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:17.920]   sure that even if it's significantly inconvenient if you're making
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:21.680]   software that your your customers depend on that you do
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:24.000]   everything even if it's inconvenient even if it's
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.760]   significantly inconvenient to make sure that software is as rock solid and
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:32.800]   secure as possible um yeah 39 apps uh infected those were
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:35.360]   all pulled immediately i mean it's easy to detect it once you know
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:38.720]   they're there right so yeah the cat and mouse game though the
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:41.440]   mouse always gets to move first so that's why we see these stories
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:47.280]   right so they're gone um if you downloaded uh an infected version of
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:51.760]   we chat it what should you i mean uh what should you do and what
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:54.560]   what could you be exposed to is it a complete uh
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:58.400]   takeover of your system no it's it's relative i say this you know with
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:01.520]   all do it it's relatively minor at this point it's a little bit of uh data
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:04.480]   mining uh and they're trying to pull what they can out of
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:07.520]   what you're doing with it i haven't been a lot worse i'm that's that's a
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:10.720]   relief actually yeah the thing is that it's getting it's
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:13.680]   getting really hard to get information out of apple's ecosystem they really
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:16.960]   built it to be secure and they they built it to be secure in a way that
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:19.840]   and rich legal uh not rich yol here rich mogul had a really good write up on
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:23.440]   tidbits about this that it's an economic war apple makes it expensive to try to
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.280]   attack ios and looking at things like compiler exploits is a way to try and
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:34.160]   more cheaply um attack ios dd kawaii d it's the one i was thinking of
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:39.200]   uh but by now that's a car hailing app net ease which is a music app
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:44.480]   and we chat's easily the biggest affected um i wouldn't worry about it
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:48.720]   chinese is only a very big market watch it was 2.0 your thoughts we're
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:51.520]   running at times so i'm going to move quickly through these final ones but
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:55.280]   this was such a big uh news week uh nine pieces awesome
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:59.360]   i read it this morning well everybody just go to imore.com and read the watch
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:03.520]   o_s give us a give us a thumbnail. Jim had an excellent i've loved
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:06.560]   Jim's coverage of the apple watch and it out fits his lifestyle and he had an
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:10.880]   excellent write up on it too. uh i i went to run he's in red his too
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:15.280]   so is it gonna make me want to wear it again
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:18.960]   because i'll tell you i'm i mean certainly there are people and i
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:23.040]   absolutely acknowledge this for your lifestyle is a great thing
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:27.040]   uh but i just i don't need those notifications on my wrist
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:31.280]   i actually use other exercise trackers that i i feel like are more accurate
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:35.360]   more flexible and it does a lousy job of telling me what time it is because
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:39.520]   it's always off so is this gonna make me more an
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:42.320]   excellent job video telling you to relax a little yeah maybe i shouldn't
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:49.360]   worry so is this gonna make me uh change my mind on watch uh on the apple watch
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:54.240]   actually i know one thing it will many of like i'll launch uber on the watch
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:58.080]   and i go okay now i gotta wait a minute so i'll pull out the phone
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:02.960]   hail the car so this will make a difference presumably if
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:06.720]   apps start moving to the watch the launch time is much faster right if your
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:09.520]   pain point was a launch speed of apps it absolutely make your life better but
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:12.400]   you're listing pain points that are fundamental to how the watch was designed
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:16.080]   not just the apple watch to all all smart watches yeah so i mean this makes
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:20.160]   everything about it better faster stronger it is in many ways like and i
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:23.520]   hate saying this cliche it's like it's what the apple watch was meant to be it
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:26.960]   just it rounds out every feature that they introduced and return some they didn't
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:30.560]   have time to ship so it's the it's sort of like the the launch version is this
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:34.480]   apple watch hardware as it was meant to be but if that still isn't for you that
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:36.640]   still isn't for you it makes everything about it better
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:39.920]   faster more convenient but you still have to buy into the initial premise what's
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:44.640]   the killer feature watch o_s_2 box uh sorry um
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:47.520]   complicate a third party custom complications custom
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:51.680]   complications my biggest disappointment with with
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:55.200]   with apple watches that you usually you have to interact with it before it
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:58.880]   will give you any information or be useful uh so the ability to you
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:02.640]   mention uber i would be checking the apple watch app just to find out okay
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:06.160]   how many minutes out is the car right now and so if they could add that as a
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:09.760]   complication so i just do this and i see four minutes with a little uber
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:13.120]   logo around it in the corner that's perfect how are we seeing third party
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:16.640]   complications yet yeah there are a couple that are
[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:22.240]   of yet like what uh carrot um weather
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:25.840]   see once you can get snotty complications good okay
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:30.480]   straight complications snark i i think dark skies i'm glad it
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:34.640]   and good yeah there's gonna be a lot i mean they have to push them out as
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:37.200]   fast as the app store will let them yeah yeah and for the only problem with the
[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:40.960]   watch stuff right now is that uh ios 9 is launching at the same time and
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:44.080]   developers have often indie developers have limited resources they've got to
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:47.440]   decide between getting their apps updated for us 9 and getting their
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:51.600]   watches updated in a lot very rightly prioritized ios 9
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:54.960]   if they even just move and some people say it's super super easy
[01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:57.840]   some people say it takes a little longer but even if they move the app to living
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:01.200]   on the watch it's a significant boost for the customers because it just launches
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:04.800]   so much faster and is so much more responsive Jim do you uh is time travel
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:07.600]   a big deal for you or is that does that get you
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:12.080]   a lot of travel was was pretty cool i mean it's cool like grant yeah
[01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:17.760]   but you know for me the watch is about a lot about fitness too you know i
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:21.520]   so i'm looking at that and you know that's
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:25.360]   that's important to me and like you mentioned earlier the accuracy of
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:29.200]   fitness i find it i find the app a watch to be very accurate
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:35.200]   um i i use it all the time for for fitness and for tracking and that's
[01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:39.520]   that's very important you must walk or run i walk and
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:46.560]   yeah i do the the other workout which is uh you know lifting some weights and
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:51.120]   it doesn't know you're lifting weights though no but it knows it tracks your
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:54.720]   your heart rate right so it knows that um you're
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:59.280]   exerting right uh so yeah we'll track and and
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:04.320]   track calories and things based on uh you know how how much your heart rate goes
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:07.440]   up i'm gonna put it back on and just strap it on and
[01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:10.960]   wear it because i got the new uh when the new iphone comes and wear it for
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:13.920]   a while and given the shant shot that points out the
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:17.760]   other advantage of watch was 2.0 developers can actually get access to
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:20.640]   accelerometers and all that and heart rate and all that sort of data
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:24.000]   so although the built-in apps don't really support weightlifting if someone
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.440]   wanted to create a weightlifting app that will help you track your reps track
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:30.160]   your whatever the things that people who lift weights want to track
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:32.960]   uh they can actually get they can actually get get access to hardware and
[01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:36.560]   actually make that happen now of georgia down serenity called well
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:40.080]   who's the better artist you think jojor does not draw at all
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:44.160]   serenity but even i i know that that's cartman so
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:46.800]   at least i can recognize that although those are the ones i sent them
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:52.800]   oh this is you drawing yes oh okay never mind i took this
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:56.720]   screenshot before they evaporated these are the multicolor sketches
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:59.200]   i love them yeah
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:04.640]   serenity serenity's got serious art chops though i realize the real point of the
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:09.280]   apple watch is to announce the world that you are one of the anointed
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:12.720]   it's a convenience let again like i i did it i talked to my sister about it because
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:15.840]   she's been wearing one for a few months now and she's a psychologist on on the
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:18.960]   floor at a major hospital and she said it's so convenient for her that she
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:22.160]   actually has time to have lunch now and that sounds silly but that is such a
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:25.680]   for her that's huge yeah yeah i think though for most people it's really so
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:30.160]   you can start up a conversation and say don't we love apple yeah we love apple
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:34.320]   yeah i love apple stainless steel how much do you love
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:39.280]   uh i have yet to meet somebody with gold maybe i just don't hang up in the
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:42.400]   hang you're out in the right uh you get the impression that apple is a little
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:45.280]   bit of shame that they even kind of came up with the gold one you
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:50.640]   they they you don't see it was it had a big presence at the intro last year but
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:54.640]   you just don't you catch nobody wearing a gold watch they don't mention it though
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:59.600]   even the one in Palo Alto did you really was on Tim Cook's wrist
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:03.840]   no it was a group of people who i i think were retired uh hard like
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:07.680]   hardware engineers or or or CEOs or something and they were talking about
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:12.240]   which gold model they got oh lord that is a douchebag conversation
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:15.680]   well no but i mean they would be talking about their panorize or their role
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:19.280]   right yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be anyway so
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:22.880]   fathers mean that the screen isn't made out of gold too that's that's i want to
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:25.840]   show off i could have the entire thing made out of gold if i wanted to
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:29.280]   i was at santa roleo i went into a restaurant there was a lamborghini
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:32.480]   eventadore out front and i walked out and there was a lamborghini rebenton
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:35.520]   in front of it yeah that just not that's not everyone else in the same neighborhood
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:39.200]   that's how Palo Alto is it's a very odd that way
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:44.080]   sprinting t-mobile actually starts selling the apple watch in their stores
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:47.680]   uh september 25th so you can go when you go pick up your i new iphone you could
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:51.120]   pick up an apple watch go along with it
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:54.640]   i'm just gonna see what happens come christmas with those come holiday season
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:56.880]   they're not going to release a new watch for a while right
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:01.920]   it's going to be interesting because apple has decoupled usually you wait a
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:04.480]   year and like with the iphone you wait a year and you get new software to go
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:07.760]   with a new hardware but this has just been fine like watchOS 2 may not be a
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:11.440]   ginormous update but it's only five months in they're revving this thing super fast
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:14.000]   right because you think about it was a year ago that they introduced it but it
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.240]   only shipped in april and now september we have an update already and there's no new hardware
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:22.240]   to go with it and you know and he was talking about this earlier there's no new ipad error
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:27.760]   this year and there wasn't a significantly new ipad many so maybe apple's saying that not every
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:32.800]   hardware product has to be revved every year yeah i think that's a good thing to say too because
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:38.640]   you know they they need to focus and they need to focus on iphone and then if you think about
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:43.840]   all the other projects that they have like the car and you know the tv and you know
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:50.000]   there are a lot of things that that need to be um completed and that they can't possibly do that
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:54.800]   every year not with all of those products we're gonna take a break when we come back your picks
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:57:01.120]   of the week my friends as we wrap up this edition of mac break weekly jim dalrymple from lupensite.com
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:08.160]   rene richie from imore.com and the anaco from chicago sometimes always great really great panel i just
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:12.960]   i am bathed in the warm relaxing glow of your intelligence
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:20.800]   our show our show today brought to you and and and the jackhammer i showed they brought to you by
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:27.760]   legal zoom okay if you are starting a business or if you have a family or i mean there are lots
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:33.760]   of reasons you might want to have a lawyer problem is as we all know lawyers cost your money you kind
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:37.200]   of don't even want to walk into the office because you know the clock starts ticking like when he
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:42.720]   senses your presence three feet away i mean it's just it's it's it's expensive
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:50.400]   the good news is not everything has to be done in a lawyer's office in fact a lot of the things
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:55.120]   that you would like to do you can do very easily if you have somebody to help you like legal zoom
[01:57:55.120 --> 01:58:01.920]   dot com for instance making your last will and testament uh you need one for your family you really
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:06.240]   do if you don't have a last will you've got to do i know nobody wants to think about this but trust
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:11.040]   me it is you you know you need to do it you've been putting it off starts at sixty nine dollars
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:14.800]   and that's one of the things i love about legal zoom there's no guesswork you go to a lawyer's
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:20.160]   office you have no idea how many hours is going to take how much it's going to cost you you can
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:27.200]   feel you can feel viscerally the clock ticking not with legal zoom you know complete transparency
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:31.360]   you can review you'll get the price right up front so you know exactly what you're getting
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:37.360]   uh they don't charge you by the hour if you're starting a business great place to go start your
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:42.720]   business get that LLC or the s-corp or the c-corp now you may say well what's the difference
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:47.920]   you can also talk to a lawyer now this is the best thing you said what do i need it
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:54.480]   i want to cooperate but what's the difference in LLC and an s-corp legal zoom if you need legal
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:59.280]   advice has a network of independent attorneys that can provide straightforward guidance in most

[02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:07.760]   uh one quick one and one very important one uh i saw uh the Martian yesterday in the movie and uh
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:12.960]   it's really really good if you if you're a fan of if it's it's slightly different from the book but
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:17.600]   in a way that makes it more make more sense for the movie if you love the book the tone is all there
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:23.760]   the characterizations are a lot more interesting than what are in the book uh and i would also
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:27.920]   one of the reasons why making this a pic is that maybe you actually do want to see this in 3d
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:33.600]   because it's an example of a movie where the 3d is so good you don't notice you're watching a 3d
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:38.800]   movie it just makes it more immersive it makes it more it's done very very thoughtfully so
[02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:44.800]   high high recommendation i thought was i thought it was terrific um the second second one though is
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:50.160]   something that i'm really gonna uh uh really strongly suggest that you install on your phones
[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:57.840]   like today uh the american red cross has a collection of mobile apps that are absolutely fantastic there's
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:02.560]   an app for for instance for first aid and so if you're walking down the street and you see some
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:07.040]   someone collapse you will want to help and maybe you will take out your phone and try to google what
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:12.000]   do i do if someone collapses which will and google tries it's best to make sure that the emergency
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.080]   information is at the top but you don't know where it's coming from and you in this sense you might
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:20.880]   not know where to go for that fire up the first aid app it will say here's how here's how you
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:24.560]   attend to someone like this here's how you attend to someone who's having who's in diabetic shock
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:30.320]   here's here here's how you attend to somebody who seems to be bleeding uh with clear step by step
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:34.640]   stuff and videos and then underneath that a lot more explanation if you want to dive into this
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:39.760]   and find out what that stuff does there is an app for emergency preparedness so that if you get
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:45.040]   hurricanes uh where you live or tornadoes or earthquakes you can get this set up the sap tell it where you
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:49.760]   live tell them tell them where your loved ones are and every time there is an alert uh for
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:54.240]   so you where you need to get ready for something bad that's happening uh it will give you these
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:58.640]   alerts it'll tell you what to do but also again maybe you have relatives that are in the San Francisco
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:03.200]   area i mean i don't get earth we don't get earthquakes here in new england that doesn't mean that if i
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:08.320]   had an old loved one who was in a tornado alley who was in an earthquake zone i would want to know
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:13.200]   that there's bad stuff going to happen to their house and maybe i can get in touch with them and
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:18.480]   help them out with that and their their apps for pet safety for pet health on and on and on and on
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:24.640]   you get these apps for free you install them they're there and they're ready launch them as when you
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:28.960]   install them because you have to you have to accept you know a by the way i'm you know i understand
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:32.240]   i'm getting stuff from an app and not from an actual live medical professional that's standing
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:37.440]   here next to my phone helping me uh and when you need it it's going to be right there and they are
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:42.880]   really high quality apps get the whole suite that's great that's a very useful tip thank you
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:49.120]   yep i will do that when my new phone comes on friday do you want to do a pic uh jim you don't

[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:59.600]   how about you rene richy what's your pick of a week so i have to i was going to pick the ipad
[02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:03.200]   mini forks i wasn't sure we were going to talk about it or not and i just posted my review of
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:08.160]   so you did buy one at that uh that instagram picture was of you purchasing one yes uh yeah and
[02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:12.480]   i posted my review earlier today and it's um it's it's something that surprised me because i thought
[02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:17.600]   i would like it but i've long since contented myself with the ipad air i used to be a mini user but
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:22.480]   now i have the iphone six plus so right i didn't i wasn't certain i really need a mini and the
[02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:27.040]   air is just so big and the screen was so beautiful but i liked it a lot more than i thought i would i
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:34.000]   liked it um so much uh sorry it should be ipad dash mini dash four dash review but um it's uh it
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:41.440]   i was i was shocked at how much i liked it it was just uh fantastic it's the screen you really have to
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:47.760]   to see it it does look every bit as good as the ipad air to not so it was noticeably better than
[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:53.040]   my old mini yeah i mean the reds the magenta's the purples all of them look fantastic now because
[02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:58.080]   it's it's a few screening no longer have the same side of of refraction on and because it's got an
[02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:02.240]   anti-glare coating on it you don't get the same kind of reflections either so it creates a much
[02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:07.680]   more pleasurable viewing experience and you you get all the power of the a8 processor in it and
[02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:12.400]   you get the split view uh so if you want a multitask i'm going to be doing a lot of traveling and
[02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:17.760]   uh i was going to just bring my ipad air with me but when you pick this out i went back to my ipad
[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:21.680]   mini three and it and i'm not saying this to hurt anybody's feelings it felt like a brick for a
[02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:25.360]   second because that's how your brain works your brain instantly adapts whatever the last thing
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:29.120]   you were holding with and it feels either too light or too heavy and i i didn't realize how
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:33.200]   much lighter they'd made it because thinness is never important thinness is just a side effect
[02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:37.760]   of lightness and the apple really believes that that lightness is a key part of usability because
[02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:42.560]   you can it is for the it is for the ipad because you're holding it yeah yeah you're holding it above
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:45.440]   your head when you read or you're holding it on your lap and they want to make it as light as
[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:50.640]   possible and i'm gonna i bought the wifi one because i didn't think i was gonna do much with it other
[02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:54.720]   than put it on my shelf behind me but i'm taking it back and swapping it for the cellular one because
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:59.920]   i want to travel with it yeah that was my thinking as well this is a perfect travel size and it's got
[02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:05.280]   the faster mimo wifi and the faster lte and it just one thing after the camera i mean they're not
[02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:12.320]   iphone six s quality but for an ipad is it iphone six quality no it's it's the same as the ipad air
[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:17.600]   which is sort of around iphone five it's an eight megapixel sensor but it doesn't have all the
[02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:23.040]   no but just doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the iphone camera um i i really really liked it
[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:28.320]   and i have a quick secondary self-serving pick and it's a strategy called well took the ios 9 and
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:32.960]   watch o s two reviews and kindly bundled them up into an ebook for us we could put them up on the
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:37.440]   i-book store because you're looking i she also put up the she included her facues in there and a
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:42.720]   bunch of other stuff so you're looking at you know i forget how big it was 70 000 words or something
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:47.760]   and at the end and some people just said it was easier than to read in in book formats i wanted to
[02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:54.480]   see if that was workable there you go she's an e-book wizard so you got to iTunes and look for search for
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:08:02.720]   i more editors you'll find all of the i'm more uh the the music book as well i think that's smart of you
[02:08:02.720 --> 02:08:10.800]   actually very much yeah well just convenient buck 99 it's just convenient it's the new magazine
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:16.880]   so you know we've talked a lot about two-factor authentication i hope you're using it and i think
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:22.640]   when you first put two-factor authentication uh on your google account or your microsoft account or
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:27.680]   twitter or facebook and almost everybody's doing it the default thing is to go out and get the google
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:32.560]   brand authenticator which is free and downloadable the problem with the google authenticator is
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:40.080]   um and the way these apps work you should know is you get a secret number that you only your only
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:46.800]   your app knows and they hash that secret number with the current time and generate a six digit code
[02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:52.320]   meanwhile google back at the googleplex or microsoft or whatever is doing the same thing
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:57.680]   they're clocks close to yours so for 30 seconds you have a matching six digit number that's the one
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:04.240]   that the uh the website or the app will ask for is authentication um the problem with the google
[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:09.840]   authenticator is you if you get a new phone or you install it somewhere else you have to find out
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:15.040]   what that secret number is usually you enter it by a qr code but the number has gone and you kind
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:19.680]   of have to start setting it up all over again i found a really great app that's free called
[02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:25.280]   authy that does the same thing as the google authenticator but allows you to have a cross
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:30.960]   platform solution get a new phone no problem install authy log in you have a super secret pass
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:36.720]   phrase and all of that and now all of your authenticator stuff all of your apps and stuff is there
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:42.160]   the other thing and i discovered this uh when i got the new uh mini is the authentication codes
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:47.200]   also show up and notify notification pain when you pull it down so it's very convenient if you're in
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:52.160]   an app and you need an authentication code you swipe down there's the code you enter it and you're
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:58.400]   gone and you're good to go um this is a really good app they've done a very nice job of it and uh
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:03.360]   you know it adds and i'll have to ask Steve about this i mean adds one level of insecurity because
[02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:08.800]   they're going to store the secret your secret number on the authy servers that's how it works
[02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:14.400]   cross platform um but i have to say it uh the convenience of that really outweighs everything
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:21.520]   else from my point of view um and uh i trust them they've done a nice job so it's free a uthy
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:28.160]   dot com and if you go to the slash personal you'll see it works on ios android blackberry
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:34.000]   os 10 windows and linux um that's everywhere i want to have an authenticator so if you've been
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:39.440]   using google authenticator this is a nice alternative uh and it is second factor it's not
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:42.960]   somebody's making the point in the shower which is absolutely true you're not it's not like you're
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:50.560]   giving away the keys to the kingdom it's just the authentication code offy a uthy and i'll be doing
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:57.920]   a nice uh installing it immediately on the new phone i'm very excited very excited uh i'm also
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:04.160]   i'm also excited to see jim dalrenbolt the acdc concert and if i cut if if on the next
