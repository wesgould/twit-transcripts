[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   And joining us right now, going from left to right. Andy, actually you're right to my left.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.400]   Andy. That way. Andy and I go.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400]   From the Chicago Suntanis.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.400]   Don't look at me.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.400]   Stage left. Audience right.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   Clearly you are not in the drama club at High School.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.400]   The ORL's, these stage left audience left. Monitor right. Audio right. You've got to know these things.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   You know I knew downstage because the stage used to be tilted so I could remember you downstage.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   You know you rolled down hill but I never could get stage left stage left.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   Exit stage left.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   Hello Andrew. You're back in Baston from your trip to the west coast.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.400]   Back in the land of the cad.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   Yeah. And you've got a Russian cosmonaut and a picture behind you.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   Wait a minute, don't say, don't say, don't say everybody's going to guess.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   We'll make it a contest. We should do this from now on.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   How is Andy's wallpaper? It's a brand new.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.400]   Yeah. It's a few weeks ago I put a new folder on my drop box of interesting things to have behind me when I podcast.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   And so every time I'm like on the web and I say, oh, that's a good photo.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   Oh, I should have that behind me in a podcast. It goes in the folder and good.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   And there you have it. We'll ask why later.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   Also joining me from Germany is Oliver.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.400]   A bride and bocke is with blank software, B-O-I-N-X.com.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.400]   Whenever Oliver's in town, we try to get him in. Hi Oliver.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   Hi. Nice to see you. Thanks for having me on the show.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.400]   Thanks for being here. Also was in town for Mac.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   Well, I think this is going to be a Mac world rehash or deconstruction.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   Gene McDonald is here from Smile Software. Great to see you.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   And congratulations.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   You were the app of the show.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.400]   Well, we're in hot competition with Oliver on who had the most awards.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   But we both won Best of Show.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.400]   It's really awesome. Oh, you did too. That's great.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   And you won it for Stop Motion on the iPad.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.400]   And you won it for PDF Pan on the iPad.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   That's right.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.400]   It tells you something, doesn't it? Did it have to be an iPad app?
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.400]   I think so.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   I think so. And Ken Ray, do you have an iPad app?
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   No. I have an iPad app.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   You do?
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.400]   But I didn't win Best of Shows, so thanks for bringing it up.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   That's painful.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   Painful.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   Ken Ray, Mac always, Ken is also a podcast-a.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   And Mac expert, Mac pundit.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400]   Great to have you all.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   So Ken, you came out as did Andy from the East Coast to Mac world Expo.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   You're coming back next year?
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   Absolutely.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   Oh, okay.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   Just checking.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   I mean, there's...
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   Well, do you want to talk about it?
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.400]   It's kind of small. Kind of small, wasn't it?
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.400]   No.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.400]   Well, I don't know.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   I was reading a few things when I came back.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   And the best thing that I found to sum it up is something that Chris Forresman over at
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   Arst Technica wrote.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.400]   As a tech journalist, Mac world has gradually become less interesting as a user of Apple's
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.400]   products and a geek in general, however the show has become perhaps more interesting.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   Nicely put.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.400]   I was glad to see him print that because I just kept having this sort of feeling like,
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.400]   this feels better to me somehow, but I'm not sure why.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.400]   Interesting.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.400]   And that's really the way.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   There was a whole different energy, a whole different vibe.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   Yeah, I'll definitely be back.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.400]   Small do it may have been.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.400]   And Jean, you were... you said no!
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.400]   Now, both you and Oliver go as exhibitors.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.400]   Right.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.400]   So it's a value to use an exhibitor?
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   It's a fantastic value.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.400]   It's a fantastic value.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400]   It must be decreasing value.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.400]   I mean, Adobe's not there.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400]   Microsoft's there.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   Apple's not there.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   Well...
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.400]   There's a reason these big companies aren't going.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   HP was the biggest company there.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.400]   And I wondered why.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:30.400]   Well, I think that you could argue, and I certainly have, is that with no Adobe and no Apple,
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   the people who come to Macworld are Mac users.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   I mean, there's some people who are not Mac users yet, but Mac people want to see Mac software.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   And so last year we were mobbed at our booth because it was just us and BusyCal, practically.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   And so we said there's... we're definitely coming back and it was very busy.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   Interesting.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   You say an interesting thing because I don't know how many booths there were there.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.400]   I mean, it was a lot of people who were in the house and they were like, "Oh, I'm not going
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   to go to the house."
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:18.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.400]   I'm not going to go to the house.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:51.400]   I've got to admit that I was a little bit disappointed with last year's show because it really didn't take me long at all to feel as though not only had I walked through every aisle of the show last year, but also that I have seen everything I would want to see.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:58.400]   I have had in-depth conversations with as many exhibitors as the have in products I'm really interested in.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   This year I had about my schedule was really compressed and out of two hours I still was about 25% sure it was still like one aisle and a half that it had.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.400]   It hadn't happened covered yet, but it had more interesting things in it.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   More things you might recognize from like a Kickstarter campaign six or seven months ago.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.400]   In fact, I was talking to a friend of mine who she's been a friend of mine for about 10, 15 years.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.400]   She is like very, very active and independent Mac and iOS developers as a PR rep.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:37.400]   She was saying that she felt as though this was she wished that she had gotten more of her clients here because it was a very, very good value every single member of the Mac.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:43.400]   And I was impressed that you would want to have covering your product or covering your service was here.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   And as you say, there was no Adobe, there was no Apple, there was no huge like a gargantuan vendor to an exhibitor to distract people's attention from it.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.400]   So I got a lot more value out of it.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   I certainly got at least four or five columns worth of information out of it.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   So I was pretty happy.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:09.400]   My opinion was actually a little bit topsy-turvy from Ken's in that I thought it was certainly a good show for me.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:28.400]   I thought it was an entertaining show, a huge step forward in terms of the content because I thought it was a more successful marriage of the old fashioned tutorials on how to get things done with your devices, as well as just entertaining exhibitions like the interviews with the South Park Raiders stuff with Jonathan Frakes, that sort of stuff.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.400]   But when I was introduced to people who had flown like halfway across the world to be here, I was glad that they were there.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:42.400]   I'm not sure that if they had asked me before they traveled, should I spend $2,000 to fly out to Mac world by world, I would have to say, how much money do you have?
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.400]   Because if this is, I get it.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   I cannot say that.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.400]   It was an entertaining show.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:54.400]   I'm not sure if I would survive personally in my budget as a freelance journalist and a print media that's slowly dying, that I would spend $2,000 to attend this show.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.400]   But it was very, very good. I'm really excited to see what happens next year because it's definitely on the correct trajectory.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.400]   And I thought that this year's show was a good value for a lot of people.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:10.400]   It is a transitional year, obviously, from, and maybe that's partly what, for me, I'm still living in the past 27 years Mac world's been going on.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.400]   Now, I do have the press release, which I did you just released.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.400]   Thank you, IDG for sending this out here.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:23.400]   25,000 people, they said, 40% of whom were first-time attenders, 300 exhibitors and sponsors, 100 new products, and 100 new products.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.400]   75 tech talks.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.400]   And of course, a much reduced price for the I-fan pass, only $80 if you wanted to go to that track.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.400]   But it's a transitional.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.400]   I mean, it really is part of a transition from the way it used to be.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.400]   It used to be you'd go to Moscone Center on Mac world Expo Day and the palpable excitement.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.400]   There was the traffic jams, the number of people.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.400]   And of course, that's because Steve Jobs was speaking.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.400]   Apple was there.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.400]   It was a very different event now.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.400]   Oliver, will Boinks continue to go?
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.400]   Certainly.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.400]   I think it was very worthwhile for us to come over.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.400]   That's the litmus test.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.400]   Andy, did you stop by our booth?
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   Unfortunately, I think you were working with me back to the left.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   I miss that too.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   I saw Oliver at our business too.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   You making it up now?
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.400]   I saw you.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   I did go by you, but I completely missed your booth and I apologize.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.400]   Where was your booth?
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.400]   It was actually in the mobile apps showcase.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.400]   It just shows you that it is big enough.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.400]   It's big enough to miss something.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.400]   Go ahead.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.400]   No, no, no.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   So it was worthwhile for us and the strategy clearly was that we wanted to have a little
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   part there on the mobile app showcase as a meeting point.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.400]   You had a pod, not a big one.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:47.400]   And the meeting point, you know, on the one hand for the users and on the other hand, of course,
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   people like yourself, the press and other important multipliers.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.400]   And I think it worked out quite well.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.400]   Not, you know, not withstanding that we won two awards, actually.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   Yeah, that's not so bad.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.400]   What was the other one you guys are?
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.400]   The makeup server, editor's choice.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.400]   And smile.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.400]   Smile won that as well.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:11.400]   And the smile booth was on the same side of, you know, we were neighbors on the mobile app showcase.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.400]   And so we decided to petition for next year to call this the award zone.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   Because between the two of us, we had like five awards.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.400]   And I have to say, it's not what --
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   She's a head one.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.400]   It's not why you and she are here.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   It's just because your friends and we love you.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.400]   But hey, that's pretty cool.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.400]   We got the award winners here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.400]   It's like the girls' sweep and Dustin Hoffman.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.400]   Multi-multi-award.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.400]   But no, I --
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.400]   Do I look like Dustin Hoffman?
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.400]   Later.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.400]   Yeah, the girls' sweep and playing.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   Oh, okay.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.400]   No, I look like the girls' sweep.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.400]   That's not nice.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:52.400]   The thing that kind of really bummed me out was the Mac OS X Ally.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.400]   Well --
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   This was -- I mean, so you make Mac software.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.400]   You both make Mac software.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:04.400]   Is Apple kind of -- is this some sort of reflection of the fact that Apple's kind of become not a computer company,
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.400]   but a consumer electronics company?
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.400]   Is OS X dead?
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.400]   Is software for OS X dead?
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.400]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.400]   Why was it such an Ally?
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:17.400]   Well, you know, it's interesting because we did this last year in 2011,
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.400]   and we were in what was called like the -- I don't know, the indie pavilion or whatever.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:27.400]   And there were actually fewer booths, but the way it was set up, it was easier to see them.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.400]   It didn't have quite this like, oh, the back Ally.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   It was --
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   It was -- I was stunned.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.400]   They even had signs.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.400]   It almost looked like, you know, don't --
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.400]   You must be 21.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.400]   And then all this time, see who would hear whatever.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   It was like, oh, my God.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.400]   It's the OS X zone.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:51.400]   Yeah, I mean, it was -- in fact, we decided at the last minute to take a booth in mobile apps as well,
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:56.400]   because we were showing an iPad app, and we weren't quite sure what the traffic was going to be.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   You know, often that area is very -- even though it's out of the way, it's very popular,
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.400]   because everybody, like you say, want to go to Tiny Town, that's where like the new --
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.400]   I think -- but the way it was set up this year, I would say bad function way.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.400]   Right.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.400]   But it was still busy.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.400]   I think that's what it was.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.400]   I don't think --
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.400]   It was all that solid.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.400]   It was just where it was.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.400]   There were definitely more Mac developers like us there this year than last.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.400]   So you don't --
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   And it was more interesting stuff there as well.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.400]   This is actually great, because both of you are -- started as Mac developers who have just now gone into iOS.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.400]   So it's kind of -- well, you did some small iOS stuff.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.400]   Yeah, we did iOS stuff before.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.400]   But it wasn't a big part of your --
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.400]   Now, you know, doing I-Stop motion on the iPad is a big thing.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.400]   That's a big strategic thing, you know.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   Well, and let me ask you about that.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.400]   So why is it so strategic to get on that?
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:54.400]   I think I stop motion for the Mac has a huge market in education, and we see a lot of interest
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   in the education market for the iPad, just because it's much cheaper and also because of the immersiveness.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.400]   It's interface provides.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:12.400]   So if we want to stay in the business in education, I think it's important to have a solution there.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:18.400]   Well, it's also -- I mean, if I may, without having used it yet, and that's the stupid thing.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:25.400]   It's like the thing that Forzeman again wrote last week about how iBooks are going to be the garage band of iBooks.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.400]   I stop motion for like the garage band of stop-action motion pictures.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.400]   And that you kind of feel like you can use it.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.400]   Thanks.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:37.400]   I'm not sure if I can use it over the holidays, but I haven't used it yet because I don't have the little tripod that I want because I want to use the remote thing from the camera.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.400]   But I mean, for what you guys are doing, there's just something -- so I spent five bucks.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.400]   And I haven't used it yet, but --
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   So it is five bucks.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.400]   Yes.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   So now, well, but that's part of the issue, isn't it?
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   You can't make as much money on it either.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:56.400]   Well, I mean, it depends on how many more devices are there and how many more people buy it, actually.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.400]   So it's a number of games.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.400]   It could be as probably.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.400]   It could be.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.400]   It could be.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.400]   It could be.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.400]   There could be a bunch of people like me sitting out there going, "Yeah, I want to make a cartoon."
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.400]   And they buy it and then they don't make a cartoon.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.400]   Well, that's actually, I mean, that's a huge difference.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   I think, personally, I think from a couple years back when you were making software, now you make software and a lot of people buy it who might not ever use it because it's just like, you know, "Oh, this looks nice in the store."
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.400]   And then I go, "Okay, download."
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:32.400]   And to make the development numbers work, you actually have to have thousands of those users.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   And for everyone that really seriously uses your stuff, you know, if you are trying to do, to make money with a productivity app or anything, that's not a game, and it's not made over the weekend by some student in his basement,
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:16:01.400]   you need to activate a lot more customers than you used before and a lot of them will not actually even use your software.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.400]   That's kind of strange from the developer point of view.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.400]   It is an entry.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.400]   It's the entry drug.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.400]   Yes.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.400]   That's how you get people in.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.400]   How about you, Gene?
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.400]   Is it strategic for you to be on the iPad?
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.400]   You have to be now.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.400]   I think you have to be.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:23.400]   I mean, for a lot of reasons, but just looking around how many people are using iPads and how that's just going to continue.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:34.400]   I mean, I think people start to look at their Macs like they're a little bit like out of date, just the whole concept of carrying around this much hardware and have to open it up and so forth.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:43.400]   So, I mean, I'm not saying we need it to go into iPads this year, absolutely, but we could not, you know, say, "Well, we're never going to do that.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.400]   We're going to stick with Macs.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   We like them better because I think somebody in the chat room said the writing is on the wall for mobile computing is where it's at."
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.400]   I hope I didn't say Apple is killing OS X or OS X.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   I mean, it can't because you, I mean, both of you are using OS X to develop new apps.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.400]   I think it's going to be around for a while.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.400]   It's going to be around forever, at least as a development tool, if not just, if not for a pro tool.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:17.400]   Although, I have to say, even in the pro space, Apple seems to be turning its back on pro's look at Final Cut X, which is-
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.400]   Well, they just announced yesterday or today, Jay, announced a new version that brings back a lot of-
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.400]   Oh, thank you.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.400]   Thank you.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   Because we were on the, we were literally on the verge of abandoning it for premier only because it wouldn't write to our San.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   I don't know about that, but it has multi-cancel board and a bunch of other things that-
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.400]   That's big.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   So, they're getting those features back in.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.400]   That actually reassures me a little bit that Apple isn't turning its back.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.400]   That might have been an announcement- And it could have done last week.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.400]   And it works really well on the 27-inch Mac.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:59.400]   So, I'm like, you know, I think maybe the Mac Pros, the desktops that we used to know, you know, these monolithic things, they may be on the way out.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:07.400]   But yeah, but because just because like an iMac is now, you know, at least as powerful-
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.400]   I know.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:18.400]   As the Mac Pro, and there's actually no reason to, you know, with things like thunderbolt, there's no reason to have a big box any more than-
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.400]   Right.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.400]   I'm now updating Final Cut, thank you.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.400]   Okay.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.400]   So, the network is going down.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.400]   Everybody wants to surf, you know, just to stop for a while.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.400]   10.03 came out today.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:40.400]   Multi-cam editing with automatic sync and support for mixed formats, mixed frame rates up to 64 camera angles, and advanced chroma keying with control.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.400]   We have to get Alex to tell us what he thinks of this next week.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.400]   Advanced chroma keying with controls for color sampling and edge quality.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   That's interesting.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   Media relink for manual recuthave needed this badly.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.400]   Manual reconnective projects and events to new media.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.400]   Ability to import and edit layered Photoshop graphics.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:08.400]   XML 1.1 with support for primary color grades, effect parameters, audio keyframes, beta version of broadcast monitoring with third party PCIe and thunderbolt IO devices.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.400]   Interesting.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.400]   Andy, you were also interesting to notice the size of the download because-
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.400]   It's only 322 megabytes.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.400]   Wow.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.400]   What a relief.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.400]   So, they finally managed to turn on the incremental-
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.400]   Vector.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.400]   Vector.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.400]   Yeah, because that's about half the update.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.400]   Good.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.400]   That's actually- maybe that's even bigger news.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.400]   They finally can just patch instead of completely redownload.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.400]   Andy, were you about to say something?
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.400]   Oh, I'll always kind of say that macOS will never go away.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   I mean, they might see-
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.400]   You would use two operating systems.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.400]   They might see these two operating systems take more hints from each other.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.400]   Right.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:55.400]   But I always think that macOS and iOS are kind of like a married couple where one spouse is a handcrafted, the traditional flute maker, and the other one has a very good-
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:03.400]   Well-paying, middle-level civil service job where macOS is the boring, stable one that they don't do the-
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:08.400]   They don't do exciting stuff, but it's stable, it's steady, and it's reliable.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.400]   It's the stuff that you need to have happen.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   iOS, I would never want to live in iOS because it's always going to be a one-window interface.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.400]   Well, we are seeing some iOSification.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   Did you see the new airport utility, airport extreme utility?
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   They just released it yesterday, Apple did, for the desktop.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.400]   It looks exactly like the iPad one.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.400]   It's one screen.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   It really feels dumb down.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.400]   You click big button.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.400]   I mean, I think we're definitely moving in that direction.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:44.400]   Oliver, you sound like you might be in the camp that thinks that Macintosh computing is going away.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.400]   It most certainly is.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.400]   It's just a matter of time, right?
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.400]   And I think if you look at the two operating systems-
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.400]   I'd be here for the two operating systems.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.400]   One day, well, not.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.400]   Maybe five.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400]   Maybe ten.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   You'll have to have a desktop.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:04.400]   I think if macOS goes away, it'll be replaced by another really specifically desktop-oriented operating system.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.400]   So I don't think that we'll ever see iOS take over as Apple's one operating system.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   No, I agree.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.400]   I agree.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:18.400]   But I think that most of the tasks that you use or that you do in a desktop operating system
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   will move into a box in the background and then you'll have a touch interface to that box.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.400]   How about the keyboard?
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.400]   Is the keyboard going away?
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:31.400]   When they finally voice is certainly an interesting thing.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.400]   You want to write software in voice?
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.400]   No.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.400]   Why not?
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.400]   Why not?
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.400]   Like, tell it to- I want to do this.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   Oh, well, if it did it, I would.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.400]   Get it done.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.400]   Siri, make me a-
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.400]   I guess that I do.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.400]   I know lots of writers who write using speech to text.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.400]   I don't know any writers who write using speech to text voluntarily, all of them are because
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.400]   they suffered some sort of crippling hand injury that forced them to switch to it.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.400]   Yeah, but you know, I'm really- I'm sorry.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.400]   I know somebody who now dictates into his phone because he likes the fact that he can get the notes in this area
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.400]   and then he flashes them over to whatever it is that he goes back and edits.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   I think you need to look at the young people, right?
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.400]   So you need to look at how kids are using computers.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.400]   And that's the future, not how we old guys here are using computers now.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:28.400]   And I do have a sample group ranging from 13 to 27.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.400]   Are they not using voice either, right?
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.400]   Not really.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.400]   I mean, they use it for their phones a lot.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:41.400]   As a matter of fact, I have one member of the sample group who actually, for Christmas, got an Android phone
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.400]   instead of an iPhone specifically because she texts a lot and she does not want to.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.400]   She doesn't- she needs to have.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.400]   She feels an actual tactile keyboard.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.400]   And I said, "You should have called me first because there is actually a Bluetooth sliding keyboard case
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.400]   you could have gotten, or you could have tried to use Siri."
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:04.400]   But I really think that we needed at least one more generational hop before people can think of a computer
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.400]   as something that does not have a keyboard attached to it.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.400]   It's a good alternative to have voice, but I don't think that the range of things you can do
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   with a computer can be covered just by voice input anytime soon.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:21.400]   So what I think is that actually written words will decline in importance.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:30.400]   So I think that they're not going to go away, but I think little kids, maybe they learn easier with an iPad
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:35.400]   too with the camera and I'm moving things like I still have more iPad and I have to bring that in here.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:40.400]   They learn actually to express themselves in different ways than just writing text.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:50.400]   So I think they might use more like videos, podcasts, vlogging, this kind of thing with voice and video in the future
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.400]   instead of writing long text.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.400]   So that's my statement to that.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.400]   No, I think things are changing.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.400]   I think it's pretty clear.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.400]   I think it may be in fact that the future programming is what you say.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:08.400]   It's all super high level tools that are more conceptual than anything else.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.400]   I don't know.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.400]   I don't know.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.400]   Yes, I'll tell you one thing.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.400]   You ain't going to see more thunderbolt.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.400]   What the heck?
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.400]   Okay, okay.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:22.400]   I know I'm starting to be Mr. Grumpy here.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.400]   What happened?
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:32.400]   I think as I heard that a lot of developers say that the engineering is really hard to do.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.400]   Did Apple blow it?
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.400]   Should they have gone USB 3?
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.400]   No, I don't.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:43.400]   As so often the case, thunderbolt is a really nice technology.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.400]   It's very fast.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.400]   It's basically the right way to go.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:54.400]   But somehow, for example, there's a reference implementation for the one port,
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:25:01.400]   dead end device, and you don't want that.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   There's a chain device.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.400]   Obviously, at least that's what I heard.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   There's no reference implementation.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:14.400]   People have to figure out themselves how to do that.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:20.400]   Somebody in the chat room says, "But there are a bunch of thunderbolt devices in the pipeline?"
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   Yes, for the last two years they've been in the pipeline.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.400]   Do you have any insight into this?
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.400]   Is thunderbolt dead on arrival?
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.400]   Are we still waiting?
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.400]   I would imagine we were still waiting.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.400]   Yes, well I know we were still waiting.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.400]   Are we going to wait forever?
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.400]   I guess I just said.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.400]   No, I don't think so.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:44.400]   Weren't there a number of the ultra books announced at CES that are also including thunderbolt?
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.400]   Oh, really?
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.400]   That would be good news.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.400]   So thunderbolt on PC on Windows computers.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.400]   Well, I'm asking because I think so.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   But I didn't cover CES that hard because, you know.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.400]   I should know.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   If that does end up being...
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.400]   Go ahead, I'm sorry Andy.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.400]   I'm sorry, I'm just going to confirm what you said.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.400]   There were some outliers who had thunderbolt ports.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:09.400]   I think most of the Windows manufacturers are waiting for better chip level support from Intel and other parts of the player.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.400]   Same issue, yeah.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:18.400]   I mean, I've talked to some engineers who work for a couple of those large producers and they said they definitely are interested in thunderbolt because it's a tick.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.400]   They're facing the same problems that Apple was facing.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:39.400]   If the move is towards these slimmer, more lightweight devices, unless you want to have like an iPod dock ship with each one of these Windows machines to give you a band-a-lear of ports, thunderbolt is the best solution for everything they need an ultra book to do if they're going to be selling them for $899.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:47.400]   So I think that we haven't seen that convergence of four minimum planets lining up in order for thunderbolt to actually happen.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:57.400]   I don't think it's a failure yet, but I think that it's still going to be something that's going to be embraced by most manufacturers, especially once we have a need for mobility devices.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:01.400]   One thing they may be waiting for is Intel's Ivy Bridge because that has built in thunderbolt support.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:12.400]   So that might make a difference. And according to digit times, Acer, Asus, and Lenovo, all three Chinese companies will be offering thunderbolt by the second quarter.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.400]   This is according to digit times.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.400]   So we didn't see them at CES, but those announcements are out there, Ken.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:30.400]   And so then once that happens, you get people buying the high-end stuff and there's more people buy the high-end stuff to price goes down and it just, I mean, unfortunately, it just takes time because you like the idea that when Apple introduces something, everybody can have it.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:37.400]   And I want to say thunderbolt hit the MacBook Pro a year ago next month or a year ago this month. I can't February, I believe it was.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.400]   And so there was this whole idea like, wow, now everything's going to be vast and it's going to be really cool.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.400]   And then some people got it home and like, okay, what do we do with this? What happens now?
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:52.400]   Apple plays that dangerous game, don't they? Where they introduce new technologies and then just wait for the market to catch up.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:28:04.400]   The Aspire S5, which according to Slash Gear is the world's thinnest ultrabook, 15 millimeters will have a 20 gigabit thunderbolt port.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.400]   That actually sounds pretty good. It's too bad they can't connect it to anything except a monitor.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.400]   I'd love to have a hard drive.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.400]   But I think Ivy Bridge is what we're waiting for.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:21.400]   So maybe that's when I tell a wind tell, I should say we'll go.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.400]   We'll come into the thunderbolt world and we'll maybe see some more hard drives.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.400]   Let's take a break and come back with more. We've got a great panel here.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:35.400]   OS, Mac OS, Ken, Ken Ray is here from his home in bitterly cold.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.400]   Is it Buffalo or Buffalo?
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.400]   It's Buffalo, but it's also not betterly cold.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.400]   It's snowing to be snowing to be at the band yesterday and now it's like 48 or something.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.400]   I can't understand. I can't understand.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.400]   I'm going to be in New York tomorrow. Do you think I'll have snow?
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.400]   No, it's going. It's like it's 56 in New York.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:01.400]   I think I can officially say it is creepily warm in New England this winter.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.400]   We call it earthquake weather here in California.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:10.400]   I think I've never really thought about stockpiling guns and water and stuff like that.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.400]   Maybe in the next seven or eight years I'm going to need to be self-sufficient.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:20.400]   Weatherman's calling for 58 degrees tomorrow in New York City.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.400]   That's ridiculous.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.400]   Just a bit.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.400]   May I should do something about that?
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.400]   May I should fix that? We need snow.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.400]   Andy Inako is also here for the Chicago Sun.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.400]   He lives in the New England area.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.400]   He understands all of this.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.400]   Oliver is from Bavaria?
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.400]   Yes.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.400]   In Bavaria.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.400]   You're from Munich?
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.400]   Yes.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.400]   Is it cold there?
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.400]   Yes.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.400]   A lot.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.400]   You're having a weekend?
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.400]   Mine is 20, so...
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.400]   That's really cold.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.400]   I think Europe is actually having all the cold weather that we don't have.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.400]   There's actually a crisis going on there.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.400]   Is there a cold enough for beer to freeze?
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.400]   Yes.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.400]   Absolutely.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.400]   Terrell, this could be a huge crisis.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.400]   Holy moly.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.400]   20 below?
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.400]   Yes.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.400]   Mine is 20 Celsius.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.400]   Yes.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.400]   Holy cow.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.400]   That's really cold.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.400]   I mean, it's like one of those...
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.400]   We all went to Macworld.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.400]   At least for me, we all went to Macworld.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.400]   I totally forgot that there was a primary race going on.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.400]   I know.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.400]   I know.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.400]   The kind of world knows when they come back and they're like...
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.400]   Yeah, people are kind of a...
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.400]   The beer is freezing in Munich.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.400]   Also from Smile Software, Gene McDonald is here.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:37.400]   I have to say, and Gene is a sponsor as well, and we have a Smile ad coming up a little later on.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:41.400]   So what I'm going to ask you to do, we're going to get a hood for her to put over her.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.400]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.400]   Actually, I'm going to ask you to demo it if you have it.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.400]   Yeah, I mean, I think that's what we do.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.400]   That's what we do?
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.400]   I'll demo it.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.400]   Yeah, and I'll give you your money back.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.400]   Because it's a conflict of interest and a little bit.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.400]   But I want Gene and Oliver to be here because they are developers who are, you know,
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:04.400]   smack dab in this Macworld question and development for iOS versus OS 10.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.400]   And I guess you don't really care about Thunderbolt.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.400]   Thunderbolt cameras are kind of cool.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.400]   Can Thunderbolt freeze?
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.400]   Never.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.400]   Never.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.400]   Tell you what, let's talk about Ford right now.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.400]   And Ford is, of course, another great sponsor.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.400]   We have some really wonderful sponsors.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.400]   We hand-pick them.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:26.400]   You know, we don't let just anybody buy ads on this show.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:31.400]   Ford is well known, of course, for their in-car voice activated sync.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.400]   And now they've added something really cool.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.400]   I think Ford's getting into the mobile phone space as well.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:44.400]   They've got AppLink, which means that there's an API for smartphone developers to write
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.400]   their apps in such a way that it can interface with the car.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.400]   And you can talk to the phone through the Ford Sync.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.400]   And I've told you about Ford Sync before, you know, your hands are in the wheel, your eyes
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.400]   are in the road.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.400]   You press a button, it goes, "Hello, what would you like?"
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.400]   And then you say, "Well, I want my Pandora station and it plays Pandora.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.400]   I want to play that way Newton station that I made.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.400]   All right, we'll play that.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.400]   I don't like it, but we'll play it."
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.400]   No, it doesn't talk back to you.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.400]   You could say thumbs up to a song, thumbs down to a song just as you would on your smartphone.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.400]   It's not just Pandora, by the way.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.400]   Stitcher, slacker, OpenBeak, we'll read you tweets.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.400]   All of this without looking down without twiddling knobs.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:26.400]   You're still paying attention to driving and that's absolutely the key for the Sync.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.400]   They also announced some new apps at CES.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.400]   I'm trying to remember some really cool stuff.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:39.400]   I just love what's happening here, which is an interface from your smartphone, by the way,
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:44.400]   not just iPhone, but Android and Windows Phone as well, to your car.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.400]   I want you to give it a try.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:50.400]   Now, Sync is available as options on some cars, as standard equipment on others.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.400]   App Link is not available in all cars, but it is in the 2012 Ford Fiesta.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.400]   I think there's three different models that you can try App Link in.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.400]   So go to your Ford dealer, say, "I want to drive the 2012 Ford Fiesta and I want to try this App Link."
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.400]   And they will show you.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:06.400]   Every Ford dealer has a Sync Specialist who can show you exactly how it works, or visit the website,
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.400]   www.ford.com/technology.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.400]   I highly recommend you take a look at the latest Ford vehicles.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.400]   It's very exciting.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.400]   They got the 2012 focus.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.400]   You can get on that.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:21.400]   The electric focus waiting list is out now.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:28.400]   And next year, some really cool plug-in hybrids and hybrid diesel and all that stuff.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.400]   I love it.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.400]   I just love it.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.400]   There it is, right there, Ford.com/technology.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.400]   We thank them for their support.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:42.400]   So the New York Times concluded its series of articles about Apple's suppliers this week.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.400]   I think Sunday was the last one.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:53.400]   Apple's response, "The Times report is patently false and offensive."
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:59.400]   Tim Cook says, "We care about every worker in our supply chain."
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.400]   Did you guys, did you all read the New York Times series?
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.400]   I think it was two or three articles.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.400]   What did you think, Andy?
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.400]   I thought it made a lot of really important points.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:15.400]   It really outlines a lot of the human cost of producing consumer electronics.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:23.400]   But I don't think it really nailed down the source of the problem yet because a few watchdogs
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.400]   have come to Apple's defense over specifically this article, not about their labor practices
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:32.400]   in general, but specifically this article saying that they think that they relied on a lot
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:37.400]   of testimony that wasn't really spot-on regarding Apple's intentions because the biggest slam
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:43.400]   that the articles, especially the last one, was making was that Apple can be doing so much more
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.400]   but they don't really care enough to.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:53.400]   That they have enough control over Foxconn that if they wanted to actually pay for better
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.400]   worker treatment and pay for better inspections that they could, they were interviewing a lot
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:06.400]   of former Apple executives under anonymity talking about how Apple will always just completely
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:11.400]   keep their profit margins for their suppliers absolutely as slim as possible and always
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:18.400]   becoming back and asking for updates that were lower than last year's bid.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:24.400]   The article suggesting, of course, that the natural effectiveness is for these companies
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.400]   to cut corners wherever they can.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.400]   Given that their costs of supplies and machinery is going to be remained pretty much fixed,
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.400]   the only place where they can cut costs in order to get their operational expenses down
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.400]   is going to be in the cost of supporting their labor.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.400]   So they did get some support.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.400]   Apple got some support from a couple of different trade groups, but I think they did leave
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.400]   the biggest issue on the table.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.400]   Apple has a immense amount of control over Foxconn.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.400]   They could, if they were to, I don't believe that they don't care.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:01.400]   I believe that it's a company with lots of different priorities in their manufacturing and that if you were
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:06.400]   to say what is the priority of treatment of labor, it would not be number one in the list.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:10.400]   I don't know where it would be on that list, but I think that all these reports from so
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.400]   many different sources becoming so very public means that whoever's in charge of maintaining
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.400]   that list should put labor up another tick or two or three.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:24.400]   Ken, with Apple having almost $100 billion in the bank, do you think it would behoove them
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.400]   maybe to focus a little less on profits a little more on the conditions for its workers?
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.400]   Wow. That's such a hard question.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:36.400]   I mean, okay, I had a discussion with some people at Macworld about, first of all, the
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.400]   fact that Apple is sitting on close to $100 billion.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.400]   $90.6 billion.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.400]   That's a little crazy.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.400]   She's Louise.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:47.400]   One hopes though that there's a target that they're going for.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.400]   I mean, one hopes that they're not just looking to take all of the money and put it in a mattress
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.400]   and stick some of it in their ears and stick the tongue out of people.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.400]   One hopes that there's a target that they are going for.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:02.400]   I want to know what Andy said about Apple could pay Foxconn to pay its employees better.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.400]   There was an article.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:10.400]   I can't remember, but I actually didn't like six or seven minutes just on this story on
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.400]   today's Mac OS Canada.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.400]   If you listen to Mac OS, Ken, you know, most stories get about a minute, minute and a half,
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.400]   but there's so many different facets to this one.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:22.400]   I'm not sure how I feel about, first of all, the New York Times handled part of the reaction
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.400]   of it because there are a lot of people in China saying Apple's better than a lot of other
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.400]   people and saying that Apple's better than a lot of other people is not an excuse.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.400]   I mean, you can't say, "Well, I only beat my people five times.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.400]   The guy down the street beats his people ten."
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.400]   I mean, that's still not okay.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.400]   I think that's on the attempt code sort of acknowledges.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:44.400]   At the same time, there was a guy, and unfortunately I don't have the piece of paper in front of me,
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:51.400]   but he is a labor rights activist who says, "Okay, so let's say Apple does pay Foxconn to
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.400]   go ahead and start treating it workers better."
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:38:00.400]   Apple is so dependent on Foxconn at this point, and Foxconn is not stupid.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.400]   Apple could pay them that money, and Foxconn could say, "Okay, we'll get right on that."
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.400]   And then they could stick the money in the areas and stick their tongue out at everybody.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:12.400]   I mean, just because Apple tells Foxconn to do something doesn't necessarily mean they will,
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.400]   and Foxconn kind of has Apple over a barrel at this point because they're making iPads
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.400]   in Brazil.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.400]   They're going too soon.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.400]   They're making iPhones in Brazil.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.400]   They're making so much of the stuff that Apple makes in China.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.400]   So how do you solve that problem?
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:30.400]   Honestly, the biggest, and this is the hardest, most difficult thing to acknowledge, the best
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.400]   illustration of the problem came from fake Steve Jobs two years ago.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.400]   He's like, "Yeah, we're the problem, okay?
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:43.400]   Walmart does not become the largest retailer in the world without China, and China does
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:48.200]   not send us beds that you can get for $50 or whatever it is without us sitting in the
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.200]   house sitting here going, "Well, I'm not going to pay so many $5 for a bed.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.200]   I'll pay $50, get on that."
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.200]   Right.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.200]   I mean, you can say it's Tim Gough.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   You can say it's Tim Gough.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.200]   Oh, it's us.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.200]   You can hear it's Tim Walton.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.200]   Well, we're part of it.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.200]   I mean, I mean, if we're not...
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   It's...
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   Now, I'll have to say something else, which is that I was just looking at...
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:10.200]   New York Times has a list of its most viewed, most emailed, and most blogged articles,
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:14.200]   and in no case, any of these articles appear in the top 10.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.200]   I don't think people even care that much about it.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.200]   Oh, wow.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.200]   I mean, that's really a statement, too.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.800]   I mean, here are these articles, whether you think they were a hit piece, whether you
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:28.200]   think Apple's doing what it can or isn't doing enough, nobody really...
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.200]   It didn't...
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.200]   It didn't feel to me like a hit piece.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.200]   It did feel like sort of the...
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.200]   What is it that Andy says, "Treeware"?
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.200]   It felt like the "Treeware" version of Linkbait.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.200]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.200]   I felt like there was one article.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   I can't remember which one it said.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.200]   It didn't work.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.200]   It was Linkbait, it was a flop.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.600]   There was one article that said that the New York Times is going for the Pulitzer, and
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.000]   that may actually be the case.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.200]   There's one other question, and I'm not saying...
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.800]   The thing is, I don't want to fault them for doing this because these are real issues,
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:00.520]   just like Andy said, that really do need to be addressed.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:07.400]   They didn't seem to pay as much credence to the response coming out of China saying,
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.400]   "We're happy."
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.400]   "You're just vilifying Apple, and this is a bigger issue than that."
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.800]   That didn't seem to get as much play as the "Here's how much Apple sucks, and here's
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.800]   why."
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   I think it's a complicated story.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   I think it's ridiculous.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.800]   I think it's ridiculous.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:33.560]   The
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:42.000]   factories down in Shenzhen are coastal and they're close to Hong Kong, and they're a
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.960]   bit more easily accessible to outside media.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:49.200]   It's not easy, but they're easier than the one they're putting in the middle of Northern
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.200]   China.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.400]   I just got an invitation to go to Shenzhen.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.400]   Did you really?
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.400]   Are you going to?
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.400]   I probably should.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.840]   Who did the invitation from?
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.880]   Well, I'm sure it's from the manufacturers.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.800]   It's some group called PCH.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:11.240]   They've been taking journalists to Shenzhen to talk to people.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:18.480]   The PCH International, it's a Hong Kong-based, probably public relations firm, right?
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.960]   The tough part about that, though, is obviously they knew you're coming.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.680]   This is what some people said was...
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.320]   Oh, actually some people like that.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.920]   They're a supply chain company.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:32.640]   But if they're inviting you, then they're obviously cleaning stuff up.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.440]   I mean, if they're inviting you and me and the New York Times and whoever.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.440]   That's exactly the issue for me.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.000]   I would love to go.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.520]   I'm not an investigative reporter.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:42.520]   I feel like I'd just be a Patsy.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.520]   Right.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.520]   Say here.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.520]   Right.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.520]   Like how lovely it is.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.520]   It's all clean and wonderful.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.520]   Yes, and that's fantastic.
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.240]   Everybody's got waterbeds.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.240]   Probably not.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:57.760]   Just the pure 90-year-old people sleeping in that waterbed, but hey, it's a waterbed.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:02.120]   I try to agree on the sleep comfort number for that adjustable bed.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:09.000]   But I think that this has really become high-profile enough and there is enough people from enough
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.280]   independent sources that are complaining about working conditions that these Foxconn
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.760]   plans for assembly lines for these specific devices that it is becoming a problem that
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.080]   Apple needs to seriously address.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:25.960]   It is by all the people who have been trying to teach me about these issues, Apple does
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:26.960]   treat.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:30.520]   Apple does make sure that its workers are treated better than most people who assemble
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.440]   things in China.
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.560]   They also have a better open policy.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:40.800]   The question is how much force do they put behind those policies?
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:46.880]   If Foxconn were to break rule of what they think they're calling core, they're different
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.920]   levels of different demands that Apple makes with their suppliers and the top level are
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.760]   these core things like worker health and safety.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:43:01.360]   If a plant violates one of these core problems, is shutting down the contract with this plant
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:08.360]   on the table for this company and looks from the biggest area of concern I thought from
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:13.120]   the Nor Times articles is that the writers were insisting that Apple will take it only
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:20.120]   so far but not beyond a certain point, especially if it's a plant that can only manufacture
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.880]   certain parts for them.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:26.960]   I think that Apple is treating employees, make sure that people who work in assembly plants
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:34.040]   are being better treated than other people but I don't care about how well they're treated
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.160]   according to other people.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:39.640]   I think that if Apple really wanted to put the screws down, not simply by saying here's
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:45.080]   a larger check for manufacturing but we are going to make congratulations Foxconn.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.080]   We're going to work together.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.560]   We're going to make you together.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.120]   You're going to be the pride of Asian manufacturing.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:53.800]   We're going to make sure that it's so good you can have people in at any time to inspect
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:58.680]   what's going on and they'll say my God, when the greatest thing in the world be to be a
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.920]   worker in this plant and they could do that by putting more boots on the ground to insert
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:08.160]   themselves into the inspection process and to have a closer eye on things.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.560]   At minimum, they can't just simply say that we've been maligned, we've been maimed, we've
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.480]   been hurt, we've been offended.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:19.120]   Maybe they have done so but it does require them to participate in this story now.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.720]   I'm doing a little bit more than so.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:26.080]   It was a big step that they were releasing a list of all their contractors.
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.360]   That was one of the big complaints that a lot of watchdog groups were having that they
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.400]   are so secretive about who manufactures what in their product line that they weren't allowing.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.480]   So they didn't know, the watchdogs didn't even know what companies they should keep an eye
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:42.400]   on to see how well these workers were being treated.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:46.320]   That is a huge step and they should get full credit for that but I really do think that
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:49.440]   Apple needs to participate at least in this public discussion.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.840]   I agree and I think that's how they will have to because of the times.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:45:00.240]   And the final word is this is a good thing that these articles were written and the conversation
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.920]   needs to be had however much it bores everybody apparently.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.920]   Let me ask one other question really fast.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:12.040]   So does Apple do that for the Apple line or does Apple do that for Foxconn?
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.960]   Because the thing that seems to, I mean there was a little bit of a thing in the New York
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:19.200]   Times about Foxconn also built stuff for Apple and HP.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.240]   Right, exactly.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:24.720]   So I mean does this need to be actually sort of a hands across America thing or hands
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:29.360]   across the tech world thing where you get Michael and Tim Cook together.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.360]   Sorry.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.360]   Well, we're in Michael.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.360]   Well, we're in Michael.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.360]   It's exactly.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.240]   You get everything together and say we're all doing this because if Apple says we're going
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.000]   to clean up our supply chain, so great.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.560]   Building six in Foxconn City is like totally great place to work, but building five and
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.560]   seven.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.400]   You don't want to send a worst enemy there.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.080]   I mean, I mean, because it's not this is where it gets so thorny.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.720]   It's not Apple's job to clean up everything.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.720]   It's everybody's job.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.480]   It's clean up everything.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:00.680]   Is their job to clean up things that they're immediately responsible for?
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.680]   No, that's absolutely.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:08.520]   If they've told their subcontractors that here is a 48 point list of things you agree
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.720]   to do in terms of treating the environment, but your employees are going to work in, it's
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:17.600]   their responsibility to make sure that they meet all 41 of those criteria.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:22.080]   And it's very, very true that there are some companies that are a little bit better in
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.560]   Apple in certain regards.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.800]   Some are much worse than Apple in some regards.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:33.200]   That's not Apple's problem, but Apple's manufacturing, sorry, Apple's manufacturing partners are
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.840]   their problem and they really do have to at least be.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.760]   They really do have to participate in the discussion, do whatever they can to improve
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:41.760]   things.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:47.800]   And even if they have to ultimately say we are doing everything we possibly can and we
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:55.040]   are looking to improve, at least they have to show some more skin in the game that they're
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.040]   showing right now.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:00.640]   I mean, one of the most interesting things from the entire debate, and this was something
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:04.880]   that was echoed from, again, the people who are helping me to be a little bit less ignorant
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.360]   about the dimension of this problem, because I agree with you, Candice, it's not a simple
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.160]   problem with a simple solution.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:15.880]   What they like to see in large manufacturers is a certain amount of welcoming of third-party
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.760]   watch job groups, because it's not that they're sneaking people into the plants and trying
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.480]   to video things and trying to get stories in the papers, but they are the sort of people
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:28.000]   that can feed information to Apple about here's something you really want to take a look into.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.520]   We're doing this work for you.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:34.840]   We're not here to tell the world that you're a bunch of evil bastards, but we want to
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:35.840]   do.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:39.400]   We're giving this information to you in the hopes that you will do something about it.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:44.040]   And at the same time, it's fair to go ahead and beat up on Apple, because I mean, Dell's
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.680]   not worth more than that, on any given day.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:47.680]   That's the point.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.240]   And the player, whoever else, is not worth more than that.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.360]   So it makes sense to point fingers at them.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.240]   It's certainly not going to be bad for your circulation, although apparently it's not
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.280]   going to be great for your circulation, as Leo pointed out.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.840]   It's not going to be bad for your circulation to do that, and it's certainly not going
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.360]   to be bad for the industry to do that.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:05.640]   At the same time, it kind of feels to me like, maybe it would just be more of a message,
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.720]   even if Apple ends up bearing the brunt of it.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.760]   And that would also mean, what did Tim say in the letter that was supposedly sent to all
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.480]   of his employees?
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:17.640]   The one thing we're not going to do, and paraphrasing, because I can't remember it off
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.400]   the top of my head, the one thing we're not going to do is stand by and do nothing.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.400]   That's not what leaders do.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.400]   Good.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.560]   So I mean, as Virgil said, your chat remapples should lead by example, whether it's their
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.000]   problem in time and its entirety or not.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.720]   Here's one of the things that really stuck out to me over the past couple of months looking
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:38.120]   at this, that it seemed as though there was a point in the Big Apple rollout keynotes,
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:41.440]   where there would be a whole section of this new product we roll out, where they would
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:46.760]   go through all of the green factors that went into the assembling and design of this
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.560]   thing, where it's designed from the ground up to use minimal packaging, to use recyclable
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:55.520]   materials to eliminate use of toxic chemicals and waste products in its production.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.320]   There really should be.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.120]   Why isn't it that we're not seeing that same sort of attention paid?
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:05.760]   And here is the improvements that have been, here is what's been, here is how workers are
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.120]   being treated in the plants in which this product is being manufactured.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:14.560]   We want to be just as pride and just prideful and just as boastful of how our subcontractors
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:20.080]   treat our employees as we are of the fact that we don't use cost of chemical cleaning
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:23.480]   agents to wipe down the screens of our devices.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.280]   We're going to come back and talk about it.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.600]   We kind of peripherally mentioned it, but we, you know, it's funny.
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.760]   They did it to us again.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.800]   Apple releases their quarterly earnings.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.240]   Huge news right after the show last week.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.680]   So we will talk about that next.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.680]   Andy Inacos here.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:45.400]   O S Ken Mac OS Ken Ken Ray, Jim McDonald from Smile Software and Oliver Bridenbach from
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.320]   Boinks talking about the Mac.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.400]   Alex is out of town.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.000]   He's in DC or something.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.320]   He actually missed Mac world Expo.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.840]   Will he be back next week?
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.800]   Only the shadow knows.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   It's really a mystery.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.800]   He's been traveling a lot lately.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.800]   That guy.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.800]   Hey, let's talk about Smile Software.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:05.160]   Jean, do you have a PDF pen on your iPad there?
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.160]   What?
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.160]   No, of course not.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.160]   I think I have.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:13.720]   Why would I have had she says, do you have the release version or do you have a special
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:14.720]   beta version?
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.440]   No, it's not.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.440]   So congratulations.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:18.440]   This is new.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.440]   Thank you.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:23.800]   We've talked before about P F pen and PDF pen pro on the Macintosh.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:28.680]   Which, of course, is it's a PDF reader, editor, annotator.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.600]   Really great tool.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.280]   What is new or different on the iPad?
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.600]   Well, it's on the iPad.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:36.600]   That's the one thing.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:40.440]   It's $10 to $10.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:44.000]   That's the introductory price.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.760]   I think the story is that it does everything for almost everything that you do on the Mac.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.720]   You can do on the iPad now with the PDF pen for iPad.
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.880]   So you'll find it on the iTunes Store.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:01.120]   But if you want to know more, you can also go to the website smilesoftware.com/macbreak
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.840]   and read about it.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.760]   Go ahead and give us a little.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.760]   Sure.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.760]   It was here.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.760]   I was a little demo.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:08.760]   There you go.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.760]   So those are all PDFs.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.760]   These are PDFs.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.800]   This is the document screen.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:20.280]   You can grab your PDFs from Dropbox or Evernote, Google Docs.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:25.160]   Also, I guess the big news that I should have set up at the top of the thing is that it's
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.960]   got iCloud support.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.360]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:34.440]   All these docs that are here on my iPad, if I open up my Mac, they'll be right there as
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.440]   well.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.240]   We just released PDF pen and PDF pen pro.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.240]   I'm missing it again.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:46.880]   So if I email you a PDF and you open it into PDF pen, does it then automatically just go
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.480]   to my iCloud as well?
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:55.120]   So if you've got iCloud support, you have to turn on, of course.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:52:02.640]   For sure, the first PDF editing application to have the Mac iPad seamlessly edit from
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.520]   one to the other thing worked out.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:05.520]   That's really cool.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:09.520]   There's not that many apps with iCloud, but that's obviously another discussion.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:13.960]   And of course, you support Dropbox, Evernote, Google Docs and all the traditional things.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.560]   But it's great to have iCloud support, because especially automatic.
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.000]   So now I can open it on PDF pen on my Mac, right from iCloud.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   Exactly.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   So I don't have to sync.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.760]   I don't have to do all that silly stuff to copy the PDF over.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.760]   That's great.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:27.760]   That's right.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:28.760]   That's right.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:34.440]   So, and then of course, yeah, anything you open a PDF on Safari or in your mail, you can
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:40.200]   just hold it and say open in PDF pen instead of say open an iBooks or whatever.
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:44.400]   So let me tell you what I use PDF pen on the Mac for, and you can tell me if you support
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.400]   this.
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.920]   It's almost exclusively signing documents.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.160]   People still want me to sign stuff.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:56.680]   And I have, I shouldn't say this, I have my, in the library in PDF pen, I have my signature.
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:57.680]   And it's like, it's great.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:58.680]   I just rubber stamp it.
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:52:59.680]   Yes.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.680]   And I send it off.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:01.680]   Can I do that on the iPad?
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.680]   Sure can.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.680]   I love it.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.440]   And it works almost the same way.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.440]   Tough question.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.040]   Will my library sync via iCloud?
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.040]   Not yet.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.040]   You got to do that.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.040]   Because then I would have to even get my signature.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.040]   I'll get my signature.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.040]   Well, just like I'm past that.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:16.040]   Actually, I can find it on the iPad.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.040]   That's right.
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:21.120]   It could just grab the thing and just sign.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.120]   That's even better.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.120]   That's probably more legal.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.440]   Look at that.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.320]   I am not a lawyer.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:32.880]   But actually, you know, that's the same deal with creating your library.
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.840]   So you really will only have to do it once.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:37.600]   So I have my signature, obviously this is my signature.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.880]   I've been demoing at Mac world all week.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:40.880]   Lisa.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.040]   Lisa Newman's signature.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.040]   Lisa Newton.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.800]   Oh, I get it.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:45.800]   You get it.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.280]   Thank you, the first person.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.480]   Slow, slow, slow.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.280]   Oh, that Lisa Newton.
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:55.480]   So same thing that you would do on PDF pen on the Mac.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.280]   You can actually make the signature transparent.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.280]   You resize it.
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.040]   And then people will never know that you faked it.
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.040]   Right.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.040]   Because it never laps.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.040]   Right.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.040]   It looks to sign that.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.280]   And then you can go back to the library to custom and add it.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.280]   So now it's in there.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.280]   Oh, that was easy.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.000]   Like you have on the Mac.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   So for the next time you can grab it.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   It's like a rubber stamp.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   Uh-huh.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.520]   The other thing that's really cool about the-- you know, I was just so impressed.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:25.320]   I have to say with the engineers that I work with, I kept thinking, oh, well, they won't
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:30.000]   be able to do X, you know, whatever, on the iPad because that'll be hard.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.720]   Not being a programmer myself.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:38.560]   But things like selecting some text and then-- oops.
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:45.240]   Even after four days at Mac world, I still haven't like totally gotten the touchpad demoing.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:49.800]   It doesn't work in my fingers as well as keyboard yet.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:56.280]   But I can select text and then hold down my finger to get the menu to pop up and choose
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.120]   correct text.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:04.400]   And that does what it does on Mac, which is create an editable text box.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.920]   So you're on the road.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.920]   You're right there.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.520]   And you have to change the name of something.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:09.520]   Right.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.520]   Mobile me.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:12.360]   I think they should probably change that to iCloud.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:16.840]   And then you can make changes or a price is wrong or dates or something like that.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:18.720]   That's in the PDF, which normally you can't do that with.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:22.520]   That's really-- Well, you could do it on the Mac with PDF pen.
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:27.240]   So yeah, so it's pretty neat for that kind of stuff.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.240]   Ten dollars.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   You can get it.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:32.120]   In fact, I hear you're like already top ten.
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:36.000]   You've immediately gone on the charts on the app store, haven't you?
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   Yes.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.360]   We immediately went on the charts.
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:41.280]   And we sure appreciate everybody supporting the app.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:48.800]   But in my mind, we're number one because the top three are pages, keynote and numbers.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.520]   Yeah, you might as well just take those out.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:51.960]   We're number four.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.400]   That's really one, right?
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.400]   Everybody's agreed.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.920]   You're the number one non-Apple app.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:01.200]   All the developers wish Apple would just make their own category.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:05.640]   So Lion could be in there and the iWork apps could be in there and they could stop like
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.400]   pushing us all down the charts.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.400]   So there's no-- It's just PDF pen for iPad.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.400]   There's no pro version.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.400]   This is everything.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.400]   Right.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.400]   Ten dollars.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:20.480]   You can get it right now or find out more at smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.160]   Ten bucks is a great price for that too.
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.560]   Very, very cool.
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:25.560]   Thank you, Gene.
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:26.560]   I'm glad you're here.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:27.560]   I'm glad I could show you.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:29.360]   I didn't have to fire up my own iPad.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.360]   Let you show the world.
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:32.360]   Thanks.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:35.360]   So Apple had a very, very good quarter.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.360]   Like how good?
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:42.920]   Can-- is it like the best quarter any companies ever had in the history of the world good?
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:45.720]   I wouldn't know that.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:49.840]   I think it's kind of funny though that in the earnings call, Tim Cook was like, yeah,
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:50.840]   you know, it was a good quarter.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:51.840]   It's OK.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.240]   But we kind of underestimated the whole iPhone thing.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:57.440]   If we had bet harder on that, then we would have done much better.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:03.000]   Somebody pointed out there were more iPhones sold per second than there were babies born
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.880]   in the world per second.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:06.880]   So this is good.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.960]   This is bad news in the long run because personally they could saturate.
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.920]   As I said, every baby gets an iPhone.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:12.920]   Everybody be--
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:20.320]   The stat that really stuck out to me is that Apple sold more iPhones that quarter than host
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.000]   to sold Twinkies in all 2011.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   Wow.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   Wow.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.520]   36 million versus 37 million.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:32.080]   37 million iPhones, 128% growth.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:35.840]   I guess the iPhone 4s you really can say is just a failure, just a flop.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:36.840]   Isn't that funny?
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:39.320]   I mean, we've been saying, Jenny, you got the tiny little screen.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:40.320]   Nobody wants that.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.320]   Nobody wants that.
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.320]   Nobody wants that.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:43.320]   Nobody wants that.
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.320]   It just shows you how wrong we can get it sometimes.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:49.080]   The tech press could get it sometimes because we thought, oh, it's just an incremental upgrade.
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.080]   It's only-- what do you get?
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.280]   A little bit better camera.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.680]   You get Siri, dual-core processor.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:57.360]   And obviously, it may not be because it's the 4s.
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:01.520]   It may just be that the iPhone is getting more and more of a juggernaut.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.520]   But boy--
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.520]   I'm trying to figure that out.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.920]   It's not like the iPhone is new.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.520]   It's not like smartphone adoption is new.
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:10.520]   And there are all the things that you said last time I was on here, actually, about people
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:12.920]   want bigger screens, people want 4G.
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:13.920]   And now people want--
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.760]   Did you have to bring that up?
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:19.320]   Well, no, but the thing is, the numbers were still so stunning.
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:22.720]   I mean, I was surprised by them.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:28.360]   And I know Gene Munster said recently that it's something like 94% of people who have
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.840]   an iPhone expecting their next iPhone is going to be an iPhone.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:34.280]   Now, that's based on probably a survey that he ran, which is going to be relatively small
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.440]   because he's not-- he's not Ipsos.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:37.920]   He's not-- he's Gene Munster.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.520]   And so he's got his crew.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:40.520]   But--
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:41.520]   I'm sure it's accurate.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.520]   I think that's accurate.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:44.040]   Well, I think it probably is.
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:47.000]   I expected that a lot of what you were going to see now is just people upgrading.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.520]   And it's not just people upgrading.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:49.720]   And it's not people walking in--
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:50.720]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.000]   Well, hang on.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.560]   It may actually be people walking in just getting the free phone now because on AT&T, they
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:58.760]   have the three iPhone, three GIS, and they have the 99 dollar--
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:02.200]   They didn't break this down to models, did they?
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.360]   This is just all iPhones.
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:06.560]   So it could be three GIS, four, four S.
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:09.640]   And you got to figure that a lot of people took advantage of either the free or the less
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:11.800]   expensive iPhone on AT&T because--
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.800]   Right.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:19.040]   --7.6 million-- I think their numbers came out last night-- 7.6 million of the 9.4 million
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.920]   smartphones that they sold were iPhones.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:23.920]   They didn't say whether they were iPhone, four S or iPhone, you know, four--
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:24.920]   Shh, these.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.920]   --RigGIS.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:26.920]   But--
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:27.920]   That's 80% point.
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:30.360]   Kind of crazy, right?
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:31.360]   And so you think--
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:36.920]   I have to point out AT&T not only sells Android phones, but also they're the big vendor for
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:39.520]   Windows Phone 7 in the US.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:42.680]   80% iPhone is a big deal at AT&T.
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:43.680]   Wow.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:46.880]   And that's with competition from Verizon and Sprint.
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:50.360]   And yet at the same time you had Tim Cook saying on the conference call, we bet really hard
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:52.920]   on the iPhone 4S, but it turns out good or bad, harder.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.320]   And someone's like, oh, yeah, you're right.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:55.320]   The best, poor, whoever.
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.720]   What could they do to bed harder?
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.200]   What could they do to bed harder?
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.600]   Make more, I guess.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.920]   Make up to people at Foxconn.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.680]   I don't want to hire every single person in China.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.680]   Earnings?
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.680]   Earnings?
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.240]   Not so bad.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:12.920]   46.33 billion dollars in sales.
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:16.280]   Now to make that-- so you go year to year, right?
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.280]   You don't go to previous quarter.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.680]   You go this quarter last year.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.960]   46 billion compared to 26 billion.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.960]   Right.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.960]   Huge products.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.320]   So people are stuck up last year.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.320]   But yeah.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.320]   Christmas to Christmas, right?
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.320]   Not a quarter to quarter.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:36.480]   Profit, 13 billion dollars more-- actually, their profit margins went up.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:43.680]   More than double the profit for this time last year, 13 billion dollars in profit.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.080]   It's just mind boggling.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.280]   This is a-- there's no question about a well-run company.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.200]   I think you could point to Tim Cook, really, for a lot of these numbers.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.120]   He could take a victory lap here because as operations guy, he's the guy who brought
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.880]   the profit margins up, right?
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:04.320]   Who made sure that there were 37 million iPhones to sell in three months.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.240]   At the same time, you've got to point to Forestall on his crew, right?
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.240]   Because you're right.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.080]   You're holding basically the same phone that you were holding this time last year.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.840]   I mean, yes, it's got a faster process.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.280]   So yes, it's got a little bit better camera.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:22.720]   But the big difference between the two phones is my phone-- IOS 4 and iOS 5, right?
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.720]   And then Siri.
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.560]   So you're giving credit to the software guy, Scott Forestall?
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.160]   No, I'm giving credit to all of them.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.480]   I mean, yes, Tim Cook is a master of operations.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:37.080]   And that's-- I mean, he was still sort of doing both of those things into that quarter.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.400]   But at the same time, you've got-- I mean, yes, what Forestall has done.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.120]   And then-- I mean, there's a whole iCloud crew as well.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.120]   I mean, it's crazy.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:50.960]   I mean, it's said over and over again, but they're really firing on all cylinders.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.600]   And then they borrow other people's cylinders and they fire on those, too.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.600]   Some of the iPhone sales cannibalized iPod sales.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.880]   But I think this was all expected.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.360]   iPods went down from 19.45 million to 15.
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.560]   Yeah, but they still beat expectations.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.600]   I think the street was expecting 13 million.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.280]   So I mean, they still-- I mean, even though they lost--
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.240]   Hey, Shabby, 15 million is 5 million a month, one and a quarter million a week.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.240]   It ain't something that's been out for-- there was out for 10 years in that quarter, right?
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.240]   It was a 10th anniversary.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.480]   Now, granted, a lot of those were the iPod touch and the nano and things that we didn't
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:23.640]   have when they first came out.
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:27.760]   But yeah, it's a 10-year-old device and it still dominates MP3 players.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:31.920]   It's just that MP3 players don't dominate anymore because now people are starting to
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.920]   finally get hit to the fact that they can play music on their phone.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:39.440]   It's certainly telling that the high-selling iPod is still the iPod touch.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.280]   So that's more of a victory for iOS than for the iPod.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.280]   Right.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:52.280]   Oh, and speaking of iPads, more than double the sales year to year, 15.43 million iPads.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.280]   No, I get it.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.480]   It's a profit thing.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:03.400]   15.43 million iPads compared to 7.33 last year.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:07.560]   Do you actually make that calculation, Gene, where you go, "Well, we know how many are
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.560]   out there.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:09.560]   We figure we could sell this per se.
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.560]   This is a big market."
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:12.560]   You know you have to.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:13.560]   Absolutely.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.440]   I mean, Apple does so well.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.760]   We have to keep up with them.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:19.760]   Right.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.760]   We have to keep up with them.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.760]   I mean, we have to keep up with them.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   We have to keep up with them.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.760]   We have to keep up with them.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.760]   We have to keep up with them.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.760]   We have to keep up with them.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.760]   We have to keep up with them.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.760]   We have to keep up with them.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:31.760]   We have to keep up with them.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:32.760]   We have to keep up with them.
