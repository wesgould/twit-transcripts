[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.800]   And hey, hail, the gang's all here from Montreal, Canada,
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.320]   and iMoor.com.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.040]   Renee Richie, bearded, looking good.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.680]   I like you in a beard.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.920]   I'm accidentally bearded Leo.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.680]   I just didn't have an opportunity to shave it.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.440]   That's how I'm worried he is one day,
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.640]   and that's what he looks like, kids.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.320]   It's Canadian.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.720]   It's defense against the elements.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.000]   It must be.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.880]   It's boom, grizzly atoms.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.800]   Boom, Sasquatch.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.320]   Sasquatch.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.960]   Boom, Sasquatch.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.680]   Do you ever-- you know how Hickory Bark can taste kind of
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.080]   like grape nuts?
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.880]   No way, man, that's not right.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.600]   Also, Annie Inako is here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.400]   Great to see you.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.840]   And the Northeast.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.440]   Yes, we're defending the Northern border.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.920]   Annie--
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.000]   Apparently, it's not a thing.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.960]   Against us.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.000]   Against the white walkers.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.400]   No, just to keep people from leaving.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.240]   Oh, OK.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.760]   Please, hang in there.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.280]   Please, I'll give up.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.000]   And also here, day after his birthday, Alex Lindsey joining us.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.800]   Hello, Alex.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.080]   Good to see you.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.120]   Happy birthday.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.200]   Hey, related happy birthday to you.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.920]   Yes.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.360]   Thank you.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.160]   Did you celebrate?
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.560]   Do I think fun?
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.760]   I worked most of the day.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.640]   I flew back from New York yesterday morning.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.760]   And I worked right up until I drove home.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.440]   But I did get to have a nice dinner and cake with my kids
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.880]   and my wife, so it was good.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.240]   I was so pleased when I came in this morning.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.760]   I had a box from the UK.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.320]   And it says, "Tailors of Herogate."
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.560]   And I thought, wait a minute.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.960]   That's the--
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.800]   It's the new cones of Dunshire.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.080]   Herogate is in Yorkshire.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.080]   You're close.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.720]   It's the maker of my favorite tea, Yorkshire Gold.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.720]   And apparently they're fans.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.560]   And I just got a matte-- look at this.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.200]   This is the funniest thing I ever saw.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.160]   You're going to love this.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.760]   This week in tea.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.720]   Oh, there you go.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.600]   They sent me a giant box of Yorkshire Gold, which
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.360]   is my favorite tea.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.520]   I mean, it really is a great tea.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.120]   In Britain, it's divided between PG tips and Yorkshire Gold
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.440]   Fin.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.240]   You must be a tea drinker, because you're in Canada, right, Renee?
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.760]   I do.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.840]   I am a coffee drinker, but I also enjoy my teas.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.000]   We have David's tea that makes up a ton of really good stuff.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.680]   I love tailors of Herogate.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.360]   So I'm thrilled that they sent me this.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.120]   And this is the funniest thing I ever saw this week in tea.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.040]   So it's amazing.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.720]   Thank you, Tom.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.400]   And then a little--
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.640]   I don't know what this is, Yorkshire.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.240]   What's your tea weapon of choice, Leo?
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.480]   What kind of tea?
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.120]   My tea weapon of choice.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.120]   What do you like?
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.720]   Well, Yorkshire Gold, which is a black--
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.520]   I don't like Earl Grey at all.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.960]   OK.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.680]   Now, this is some other stuff.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.440]   This is the breakfast brew, which I will be trying.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.520]   But this is-- in my opinion, Yorkshire Gold is the best
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.120]   English tea.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.800]   I have not tried it.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.800]   I've got to give it a call.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.160]   Oh, you've got to have that.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.640]   So anyway, Tom--
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.160]   I'm having PG tips myself.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.000]   Earl Grey has the great--
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.360]   Yeah, he's a great cop, so he's at least redempted a bit.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.200]   I hate Earl Grey.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.000]   Too much--
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.840]   He's a great cop.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.760]   PG tips does have that association with Wallace and Gromit.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.480]   You can get a Wallace and Gromit tea cozy, so--
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.040]   So this has become the new This Week in Tea Show.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.640]   And look, they sent me-- what is this?
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.840]   A tea towel.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.520]   Literally.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.400]   The hard part is really finding good cozies.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.040]   I mean, the cozies for the pots or the hard part, I think.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.480]   I use-- I do it a cup at a time, and I use a tea bowl.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.060]   But I have a number of lovely pots.
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.100]   There's a tea company in the United States
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.100]   that does some really interesting teas.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.020]   But I'm a simple guy.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.000]   I just like my tea--
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.580]   On my new tea poll list.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.620]   I had a transformative experience several months ago,
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.580]   where I got a good deal on those really good work job
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.140]   site, like thermos vacuum bottles that holds boiling water
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.900]   hot for three days.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.020]   And so now, every night, I check to make
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.420]   sure that my thermos bottle is filled with this liter
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.140]   of piping hot water.
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.060]   I wake up, and my first conscious thought
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.140]   is to pour myself a cup of tea.
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.420]   I love tea.
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.660]   I know that's-- and now, because I have this piping hot--
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.940]   the steaming hot cup of water, like in my hands,
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.060]   that is my incentive not to fall back to sleep again,
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.460]   because otherwise, I will kill myself.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.260]   So I get-- usually, I get--
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.300]   besides the Yorkshire Gold, if I want fancy stuff,
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.700]   I go to Adagio.
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.740]   And they have--
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.220]   Nice.
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.260]   Yeah, I like Adagio.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.060]   They sent me-- because I mentioned them once before,
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.700]   so I should mention that they gave me this--
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.020]   they call it the concert teapot, which is a--
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.940]   it's beautiful.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.100]   It's highly impractical.
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.180]   Although, you see, it has a little candle.
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.940]   But it is-- it's a solid glass teapot,
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.300]   and it really is gorgeous.
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.980]   I should have bought the extended warranty, though,
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.140]   because I immediately broke it.
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.140]   But other than that--
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.860]   It's more practical than that.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.100]   It's more practical than those fire-based vacuum
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.420]   infusers at Blue Bottle.
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.500]   So you mean, you're not--
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.540]   Yeah, those are kind of kooky, aren't they?
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.040]   Yes.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.220]   They're looking hella impressive.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.940]   But they're finicky.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.020]   Yeah, I think they--
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.380]   see, there's all sorts of ways to brew.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.820]   And I really haven't--
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.340]   I really haven't ventured into the varieties of beer.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.580]   I use the one where you put the tea in the leaves in the top,
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.660]   and then you put it on the cup, and it drains into the cup
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.220]   from above.
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.180]   Yeah, like this.
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.380]   I find those very useful.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.060]   Yeah.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.140]   It's a tea-- travel and fuser.
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.580]   Anyway, I don't know how we got into tea,
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.220]   because this is not a show about tea,
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.900]   but I just wanted to thank my friends at Taylor of Harrogate
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.060]   for us sending me this weekend tea, which is kind of--
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.100]   We just made it for all.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.420]   But just made all of our tea equipment.
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.940]   And we'll get a lot of people listening to it.
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:19.940]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.460]   Yeah, go ahead to Andy, I'm sorry.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.660]   No, no, no, I was just going to say that if we just say,
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.140]   like, what our favorite tea kettle is,
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.740]   what our favorite infuser is, we can make that tax deductible.
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.260]   Tea is lagging behind coffee in terms of--
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.220]   I have in my house 12 different ways to make coffee.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.740]   We've got to work on this with you.
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:36.900]   Tea has--
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.900]   Tea only needs one, Leo.
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.420]   Tea only needs one.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.140]   It only needs one.
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.260]   I think I only have four ways to make coffee in my house.
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.060]   I have-- remember that thing it looks like it was making
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.580]   Krista--
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.380]   I got one of those.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.340]   The giant cold brew drip system.
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.860]   I like a good te kun yang also, and some silver leaf tea.
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.540]   Those are good too.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.300]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.140]   Puer.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:55.580]   Is my--
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.300]   Tea Puer, yeah.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.820]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.540]   Puer, very good.
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.180]   Oh, wow.
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.340]   But again, I don't know.
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:02.700]   There's--
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.300]   And the Japanese one with a toasted rice.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.060]   Yes, that's my favorite.
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.940]   Love that.
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.220]   What is that called?
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.820]   I think-- is that-- no, I have to double check the name.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.860]   Ah, it's on the-- my tongue.
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.060]   I have double check.
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.980]   They have that over across the street, and I--
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.540]   is it Genmicha?
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.140]   Yes.
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.140]   Yes.
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.180]   I love that.
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:22.700]   Genmicha.
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.420]   It's a green tea, but it has toasted rice in it,
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.260]   which gives us this nice toasty.
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:27.740]   Yeah.
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.060]   There is a certain pull to the-- this week in tea concept,
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.460]   I believe.
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:33.980]   Yes.
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.500]   Here's the game.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.300]   Got some VCs in the room, I think it happened.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.540]   Really?
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.980]   Popcorn tea or roasted rice tea.
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.980]   Mm.
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.860]   Do you dunk the biscuit or keep it dry?
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.820]   I liked-- I'm a donker.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.860]   A crumpet?
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.220]   Yeah.
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.660]   I'm a dunk kind of on the biscuit.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.820]   You have a nozzie, you can do both.
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.060]   Crumpets are the best.
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:55.900]   Why are crumpets--
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.900]   I like a good digestive on the side.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.300]   Why are not-- by the way, why are crumpets not
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.060]   as big as scones and--
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.300]   Because they're hard to make.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.860]   Yeah, they're hard to-- but they are the best.
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.340]   They're hard to make.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.020]   A crumpet is so far better than anything else out there.
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.660]   It's like Yorkshire pudding versus stuffing.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.540]   It just takes more efforts.
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.380]   It's a lot of the weird things.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.380]   Don't do it.
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:11.860]   Yeah.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:12.940]   Crumpets are made on--
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.940]   Food break weekly.
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.540]   I don't know what we're doing here.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.780]   Crumpets are made on griddle.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.620]   So you might say, oh, English muffin, no.
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.940]   But that's probably what was inspiring the English muffin.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:22.460]   Yeah.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.980]   This is-- it has a wonderful--
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.820]   There used to be a tea in crumpets in San Rafael
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.460]   that you could actually go get them.
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.660]   There was like a little open window
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:29.900]   where you could see them making them.
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.060]   I remember that.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.260]   Oh, good.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.580]   I kind of had to stay away from them
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.180]   because I would have otherwise died of crumpet over.
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.300]   Crumpet's scurvy when you're not getting enough vitamins
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.980]   because you're eating nothing but crumpets.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.340]   Too much crumpets.
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.740]   So we're all saying all this because really all we have
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:54.620]   is rumors today because Apple's been busy making the new iPhone.
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.420]   I have been playing with iOS 11.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.580]   The new high Sierra public beta came out--
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.660]   I think this week, if you wanted to try it.
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.260]   Renee, you're a big beta guy.
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.660]   I know you said don't use iOS 11,
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.300]   but I've been using it on my iPad Pro 10.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.660]   Well, don't put it on your main phone.
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.820]   Like if it's a phone that you depend on for your life
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.660]   or your business, don't put it on that.
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.180]   Of course not.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.060]   Your iPad is OK.
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.780]   But on my iOS-- on my 10.5 iPad, it just sings.
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.020]   It's beautiful.
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:27.060]   And we just did a whole bunch of tips on iOS 11 on iOS today.
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.940]   And I learned some things because I, for instance,
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.740]   I had split-screen my Safari and I couldn't un-split-screen it.
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.060]   It is not intuitive.
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.820]   I had two pains, which is nice because Safari didn't used
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.820]   to be able to do that, but recently they added that ability.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.900]   But then there was no way to close the pain in iOS 11.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.580]   It turns out if you close all the tabs and all the--
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.740]   one of the pains, then it will go away.
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.500]   I just caution people because even, like, let's say,
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.820]   beta 3 is miraculously good.
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.260]   Maybe beta 4 will have a big problem.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.740]   There's always that risk.
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.540]   So let me ask you-- because I'm very interested in getting APFS
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.340]   on my Macs.
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.060]   Should I go to high Sierra public beta?
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.980]   So I put it on my-- because I never listened to what I do, Leo.
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.060]   I put it on my main machine the day of WWDC.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.420]   I did that with all the betas.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.660]   And since then, I've put it on two other Macs.
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.460]   I put it on my MacBook Pro and I've put it on a MacBook.
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.460]   And I'm Mac.
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.380]   And the APFS was the easiest part of any of those.
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.340]   It's a little checkbox.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.900]   You check it while you're doing the update.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.380]   It changes your file system.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.780]   And mine have been perfect.
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:24.940]   I reclaimed space.
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.140]   They're singing along.
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.460]   I don't recommend that people go and reformat their backup
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.580]   drives or their external drives because it works great with HPFS
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.100]   as well.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:32.580]   You don't need to.
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.820]   But for the main system, I've done it.
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.180]   And I have zero regrets.
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.740]   No noticeable showstoppers?
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.740]   Nothing.
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.100]   In terms of APFS, no, I think they've really done their due
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.820]   diligence on it.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.700]   That's not to say any one of us might be the first outlier,
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.660]   or at least one of the first outliers.
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.740]   So do proceed with caution.
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.260]   Do have your backups done.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.580]   Do have an ability to revert if you need to.
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.020]   Myself and everyone at Imore and everyone that I know who have
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.140]   done it have not even noticed that it was done, which I think
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.180]   is the biggest compliment you can ever give up on.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.420]   But you can't get that new file system without getting high
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.780]   Sierra too, right?
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.620]   It was available as a beta for the previous OS.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.620]   But at this point, I wouldn't recommend where you go back
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.540]   and run an old beta version of Sierra.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.540]   No, absolutely not.
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.940]   So in other words, you're saying high Sierra is OK.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.940]   Yeah.
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.180]   I mean, the things that high Sierra are changing are really
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.180]   foundational things.
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.620]   And they've done really good work on that.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.180]   So it looks the same so you won't have any worries about not
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.180]   knowing how it works.
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.180]   It's just a bunch of technological improvements.
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.180]   It's mostly under the limit.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.180]   It's like no leopard.
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.180]   It's an incremental upgrade to Sierra.
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.980]   It's one of those things that Apple does that I really--
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:36.980]   and I think we've talked about this before.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.980]   But at Apple, there are some features that are pushed down
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.980]   from the marketing team.
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.980]   But there's a lot of features that are just like promotion.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.580]   That was an engineer who came up with that idea and they went
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.580]   with it.
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.580]   And this was a Craig Federighi.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.980]   I think he said this on the talk show.
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.980]   He told the teams, if you had the time, what would you fix?
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.980]   What would you do to make your apps or your frameworks better?
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.980]   And they gave them, I think, 50% time to do that.
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:58.980]   And this is a result.
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:12:59.980]   There are apps that have problems.
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.980]   Like if they're apps you need, they may not work with it.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.980]   But more and more developers are announcing at least preliminary
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.980]   support.
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.980]   So I've backed up my Mac.
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:09.980]   Don't tell them I did.
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.980]   I backed up my Mac.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.980]   The next thing is to download the Mac OS public-- first you have
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:15.980]   to log in.
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:16.980]   Yes.
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.980]   And then download the Mac OS public beta access utility.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.980]   So it'll be interesting.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.980]   It's a little DMG file that you run and it puts you on the beta
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.980]   track rather than the release track for the updates.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.980]   OK.
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.980]   So let me run this.
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.980]   Are we doing this live?
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:33.980]   Exciting.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:34.980]   I probably shouldn't do it.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.980]   Well, you should do it on the Skype computer that's running
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:39.980]   the sometime conversation.
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.980]   Do you have a backup surface?
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.980]   If I have to, I can go to Windows.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.980]   OK.
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:47.980]   And then it wants me to log in.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:48.980]   It does take a little while.
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:49.980]   It'll take about 50 to 20 minutes.
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:50.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.980]   What a surprise.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.980]   I mean, you're actually changing the file system.
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.980]   And then once you run that little stub, which I've done, now
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.980]   you get pulled to the store where you can see Mac OS High Sierra,
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.980]   your Mac elevated, and the button now says download.
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.980]   Yeah, they've made it much easier for-- because it became a
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.980]   public beta, it's no longer all the hoops you had to jump through
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:11.980]   for developer beta.
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:12.980]   They've really streamlined the process.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:13.980]   OK.
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.980]   Cool.
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:19.980]   So is there somewhere a list of the apps that don't work?
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.980]   I haven't seen one of them.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.980]   I haven't looked for one because I've literally not run into a
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:24.980]   problem.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.980]   I'm running Photoshop and Tweetbot and almost everything.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.980]   So that's amazing.
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.980]   And everything you've ever run.
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.980]   So the Adobe stuff runs, that would be for me a show stopper.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.980]   I guess everybody knows what they need.
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.980]   Every once in a while, I get the app shuts down and do I want to
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.980]   send it to developers, but then I pop it back up and it works
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:42.980]   again.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:43.980]   Oh, OK.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.980]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.980]   Or at least I don't think there's such differences that it made
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.980]   a huge impact on developers.
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:49.980]   Yeah.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.980]   That's kind of one of the problems of running beta software,
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.980]   though, because whenever I'm running a beta OS and something
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.980]   weird happens or something crashes or something won't start up,
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.980]   I will simply-- I will stop diagnosing it 'cause I'll think,
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.980]   oh, well, that's stupid beta, oh, well.
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.980]   Without knowing that, no, it's probably-- maybe my network is
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.980]   down or no, maybe this one app is crashing or it kind of lowers
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.980]   your guard for a little bit.
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.980]   And then once you install this, you will automatically get
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:17.980]   updates now, right?
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.980]   I don't have to--
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.980]   Yes.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.980]   If I go to the app store, it will show up as an update.
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:23.980]   Yes.
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.980]   Oh, and I should say that if you're using a lot of apps, like
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.980]   maybe like the ROGOMIBA apps that do a lot of low-level things on
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.980]   stuff like on foundation or core-item, those might be more
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.980]   problematic than if you're running vanilla software that just
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.980]   uses Apple's Flame frameworks.
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:35.980]   All right.
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.980]   I don't know that for sure, but I know that they're updating a lot
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.980]   of stuff, so.
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:39.980]   OK.
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.980]   Well, I'm not going to do it now.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.980]   Oh, I mightily--
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:43.980]   I'll do it in five seconds.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.980]   I can't help myself.
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.980]   Mightily mightily tempted.
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:48.980]   All right.
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:49.980]   Well, good.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.980]   So it doesn't sound like there's a lot of reasons to avoid it.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.980]   Obviously, if you're Alex Lindsay and you've got NASA--
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:55.980]   You've got NASA--
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.980]   You've got NASA--
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.980]   You know, business issues that if these Macs aren't reliable.
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:00.980]   And you usually--
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:01.980]   Not even on Sierra yet.
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:02.980]   --is not even on Sierra yet.
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.980]   Well, and I'll probably update.
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.980]   I have a computer at home that I'm probably going to update just
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:07.980]   to go ahead and play with it.
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.980]   I did that with my-- I got the new iPad Pro.
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.980]   And immediately just decided I'm just going to throw on the beta
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.980]   to start with, rather than worrying about anything historical.
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.980]   I have another iPad that I can jump into.
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:17.980]   Right.
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.980]   I'm kind of glad I put it on my Pro, because it really is made
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.980]   for that, you know.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.980]   One of the coolest things is that there--
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.980]   And this won't impact almost any user.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.980]   But one of the coolest things is they did a lot of work to optimize
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.980]   their VR pipeline, for example.
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.980]   So they'll get everything out of the way, all the CPU stuff out
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.980]   of the way, and let the computer hit the GPU as much and as fast
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:34.980]   as possible.
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.980]   And they've got this wicked, cool diagnostic stuff too, so you
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.980]   can do like, eye by eye comparisons to see what's going on
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.980]   with your code if you're developing stuff for VR.
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.980]   And there's a lot of really clever stuff in their developer tools
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.980]   now as well.
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.980]   Apple--
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:48.980]   It's really equally impressive.
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:55.980]   Maybe come the first trillion dollar company, this next 12 months,
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:01.980]   is according to a Wall Street analyst Brian White, who unbelievably says,
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.980]   "Apple stock is undervalued."
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.980]   He says, "Buy more."
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.980]   Uh-oh.
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:08.980]   Uh-oh.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:09.980]   Just set up the insulate--
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.980]   No, don't.
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.980]   Do you want to tell the other guy you can do it?
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.980]   No, because if I do it, then I won't have access to my machine
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:20.980]   for what, 15 minutes?
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.980]   All the cool hosts are doing it.
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.980]   All the cool hosts do it.
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.980]   You know, your Sierra's not high, Leo.
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.980]   It's not fully baked.
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.980]   Alex and I are doing it right now.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.980]   I don't know about it.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.980]   Hey, not everybody has that kind of guts, but I mean, you know, that's fine.
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.980]   You be you, Leo.
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.980]   Oh, you so cool.
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.980]   You're the cool host of it.
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:43.980]   Rassen, Rassen.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:49.980]   Back to Brian White, who says, "Apple remains among the most underappreciated
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.980]   stocks in the world."
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.980]   How can you say, "Apple stock is underappreciated?"
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.980]   He says, "In our view--"
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.980]   That's true.
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.980]   He says, "In our view, Apple's quarterly results will be less important this summer.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.980]   Investors are focused on the iPhone 8 this fall."
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.980]   That's for sure true, along with the company's raised capital distribution
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.980]   initiative, depressed valuation.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.980]   They've always been under, like, Amazon has always been super valued
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.980]   based on the profits that they make and Apple's always been very low-valued.
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.980]   Okay, price-turning ratio.
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.980]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:21.980]   Okay.
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.980]   And new innovations as showcased at WWDC.
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.980]   So some of this is probably augmented reality, right?
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:27.980]   The scoble effect that people are saying.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:28.980]   Hey, RK.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.980]   What is the right finger though, Leo?
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:30.980]   That's my question.
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.980]   I know a billion is the pinky, but what is it for the--
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:33.980]   What is it for the whole hand?
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.980]   $3,000.
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.980]   Wow, he says--
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.980]   Well, definitely when you look at-- I mean, I think that Apple's--
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.980]   their PE ratio, I think, was much higher before $4 more.
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.980]   I think we're four more, you know, only a couple years ago.
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.980]   So it is definitely less than it has been and definitely less than a lot of other
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.980]   companies in the same group.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.980]   And when you look at their actual PDE ratio.
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.980]   And we should say this.
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.980]   We don't make stock recommendations on this show.
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.980]   Well, I'll speak for myself only.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.980]   We have no idea when it comes to that.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:10.980]   Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.980]   I don't want to speak for you guys.
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.980]   The price to earnings on Apple is not small.
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:15.980]   It's 17.
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:23.980]   That means that the stock price compared to their earnings, but of course,
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.980]   Amazon's used to be in the hundreds, right?
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:27.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.980]   Right now, it's $145.
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.980]   This analyst says it's going to break $202 over the next two months,
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.980]   which would make it a trillion dollar company is currently valued.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.980]   Let's see what the current value--
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.980]   Which also reminds me of $75 billion.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.980]   And put it in the perspective.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.980]   I mean, Amazon is 203.
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.980]   203 for Amazon, yeah.
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.980]   Right now, like just price to earnings.
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:54.980]   And investing is sort of like legalized gambling, so we should just
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.980]   voice factor that.
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:56.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.980]   It's a bunch of speculation and human--
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:19:59.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:00.980]   Human--
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:01.980]   Don't listen to us.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:02.980]   And if you're going to listen to what advice, don't take it from us.
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.980]   Yeah, definitely not.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.980]   And my wife always says it.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:06.980]   I just invest in it.
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:07.980]   I'm like, "I can't be on the show."
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.980]   So one of the reasons--
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.980]   Also, I think you got to--
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.980]   Whenever a piece of information comes from an analyst, you got to know
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:16.980]   where--
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.980]   How will it benefit this person if everybody does what he or she
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.980]   says.
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:21.980]   So that's why--
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.980]   Interesting trivia, but oh, well.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:24.980]   Yeah.
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:30.980]   So let's talk about the iPhone 8, because I think this analyst
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.980]   and probably everybody else who's highly bullish on Apple is
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.980]   expecting a very exciting new release.
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:44.980]   One of the rumors coming from not just Ming-Chi Kuo, who of
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.980]   course has great sources in the supply chain, but now Mark
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.980]   German is saying the same thing.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:57.980]   It may be that the high-end OLED bezel-less iPhone won't have
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.980]   touch ID.
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:06.980]   That sounds like half of a story.
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.980]   That sounds like someone knows that the sensor that they were
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.980]   expecting to see is not there, which is not to say that Apple
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.980]   has not put touch ID someplace else or they have not replaced
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.980]   it with something that they think is just as good, but I can't
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.980]   imagine what that could be.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.980]   Well, so the rumor is that they have tried putting the
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.980]   fingerprint reader in other places and not been happy with the
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:30.980]   results.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.980]   However, what Apple will do--and actually this sounds very
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.980]   appily--is put in 3D sensing for facial recognition.
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.980]   We know that these cameras will have more capabilities.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:47.980]   And iris scanning and that their opinion this is more secure
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.980]   than a fingerprint.
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:50.980]   It would happen.
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.980]   It's interesting in that.
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:57.980]   I'll just say that's a very Samsung-y sort of way to approach
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:58.980]   authentication.
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.980]   It kind of ignores the fact that touch ID is something that you
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.980]   can activate while you're just basically moving your phone
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:06.980]   into position.
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:11.980]   If they can do real 3D face sensing, it'll be a breakthrough
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:12.980]   for such a device.
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:16.980]   If they can do iris scanning in such a way that it's not, oh,
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:17.980]   what time is my flight?
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.980]   A line target, wide and eyes look, hold.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.980]   OK, my phone is--my plate is on time.
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.980]   That will also be unprecedented in this space.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.980]   I'll believe it when I see it.
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.980]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:37.980]   So I think that more people will use the 3D facial stuff for
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.980]   selfies and their Snapchat stuff that they will.
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.980]   I mean, if you think about what it will do to selfies, I think,
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.980]   I think it's going to be more impactful to people buying the
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.980]   phone is that suddenly have a 3D of the phone and we thought
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:51.980]   the tracking was good before.
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.980]   Just imagine how good it's going to be when we've got a 3D
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:55.980]   version of your head.
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.980]   Yeah, I mean, I think nobody--
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:57.980]   Go ahead, Renee.
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:58.980]   You--for Renee.
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:22:59.980]   He's not been able to--
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.980]   No, no worries.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.980]   No, no worries.
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.980]   The way I look at it at least is that Apple has finished this--
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.980]   as far as hardware is done, this phone is finished.
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.980]   They're not lingering at the--you know, trying parts in like
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:10.980]   Lego--
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:11.980]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:12.980]   Try this.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:13.980]   Yeah.
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:14.980]   Yeah, so this one is done.
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.980]   The only question--we are three to six months behind Apple.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.980]   They literally live in the future because they're working on
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.980]   the next two or three iPhones.
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.980]   So we're just trying to figure out, basically, the information we
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.980]   have, which one of those options they chose.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:28.980]   Now, their goal was to get the most infinity of infinity displays
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.980]   onto this phone, like this much glass and as little bezel as
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.980]   possible.
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.980]   And that meant changing the way a touch ID worked because it just
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.980]   wouldn't work with a screen like that and they've tried technology
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.980]   works under the phone and maybe or maybe not that worked.
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.980]   And they tried putting it on the back and maybe or maybe they
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:43.980]   didn't like that.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:44.980]   But touch ID is just a feature.
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:45.980]   It's not a thing unto itself.
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:46.980]   It doesn't have to be there.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.980]   It was one way to solve making authentication more convenient
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:51.980]   because it's not really a security.
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.980]   It's more of a username than a password.
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.980]   And if they feel like they can do what they said is a better--
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.980]   they can get more points of identification off of 3D scanning
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:00.980]   and they can get off a fingerprint.
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:01.980]   Their job is evangelism.
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.980]   The same way people were dubious about touch ID in the beginning.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.980]   They'll be dubious about face scanning in the beginning.
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.980]   But they have to solve several problems to make this work.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.980]   This is not an easy technology either.
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.980]   Samsung famously makes you choose between iris scanning and face
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.980]   scanning at the beginning and one works in low light and one
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.980]   works in bright light and one can be fooled by photos and the other
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.980]   one can't be fooled by photos.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.980]   That's a tough problem to solve.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.980]   But Apple is uniquely positioned as a company that has a lot of
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.980]   resources and has full control of everything along the stack to
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.980]   sort of bring that sort of technology to market the same way
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.980]   they did with touch ID when the previous sort of generation of
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.980]   fingerprint scanners weren't really ideal either.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.980]   So if they did in fact go with facial scanning because touch
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.980]   ID wasn't workable, it's just because they believe that it's just
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.980]   as good if not better a solution.
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.980]   And the biggest question to me is do you get banks and credit
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.980]   unions to go along with it without ever seeing it work in the
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.980]   real world or being tested in the real world?
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.980]   So I think, OK, yeah, we're fine with Apple Pay anyway.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.980]   We trust you guys to do this or do we have to wait until it's been
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.980]   on the market for several months before they get back on board?
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.980]   Andy and I both know that touch ID on the back works.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.980]   Well, fingerprint reading on the back works quite well on Google's
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.980]   phones, but doesn't mean Apple would necessarily like it.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.980]   It's not that it wouldn't work, but as you said, quite accurately
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.980]   fraying.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:15.980]   It would be better.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:16.980]   Yeah, and that would be the thing.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.980]   You know, while, I mean, so right now the face recognition we've
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.980]   seen and Microsoft has it with Windows Hello in some of their
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.980]   systems and other people using Windows.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.980]   And Samsung has it in their Galaxy S8.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:35.980]   The ones we've seen are slow or yes, and you have to position
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.980]   the phone properly.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.980]   I believe they're 2D.
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:39.980]   I'm not sure if they do.
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:40.980]   They don't use same technology.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:41.980]   That's right.
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.980]   These are a combination of regular cameras and infrared to do
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.980]   basically trying to fool static photos.
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:48.980]   Right.
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.980]   Although we know that the Samsung Galaxy S8 has been spoofed both
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:52.980]   of the average.
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.980]   The Apple one is supposed to do points of identification the way
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.980]   a fingerprint does and then also do it in milliseconds, which is
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.980]   way faster than I think a lot of them.
[00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.980]   So that would be the two issues, of course.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.980]   It has to be at least as secure, preferably more secure than
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.980]   fingerprint because Apple Pay relies on it.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:15.980]   And it has to be as convenient and as fast or faster, which
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.980]   means you shouldn't have to with the Galaxy S8, you have to
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:19.980]   position the phone.
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.980]   In fact, they even put little eyes.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:22.980]   Right.
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:23.980]   So supposedly doesn't.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:24.980]   This one you could do it on a table.
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:25.980]   Apparently.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:26.980]   That would be the key.
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:27.980]   Various angles.
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:28.980]   It just knows.
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:29.980]   It's me.
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:30.980]   And I don't have to do anything.
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:31.980]   It just knows.
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:32.980]   And that would be better than fingerprint because I wouldn't
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:33.980]   have to do anything.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:34.980]   It would just know.
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:35.980]   Right.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:36.980]   Well, I also think that there's an opportunity.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.980]   I mean, if they include a fingerprint or iris or a backup,
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.980]   almost a two part authentication with these biometrics, you can
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.980]   theoretically not necessarily be forced to do it this way, but
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.980]   we have the option of saying, I want to know that my watch is
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.980]   on, you know, I'm in vicinity, you're going to look at my face.
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.980]   And I mean, and there are some people that would really prefer
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.980]   to have all of those things added to it to make it, you know, very,
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:02.980]   very secure.
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.980]   And as you get to a point where you really feel like it's really
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.980]   working, like right now I still have time, a handful of times when
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.980]   I need to actually still use my keypad rather than my fingerprint.
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.980]   When you feel like it's rock solid, you could theoretically
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:20.980]   either make a much longer keypad entry or get rid of it.
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.980]   So here's Mark Gurman's quote.
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.980]   So Ming Chi Quo, you'd expect to know something because he has
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.980]   good supply chain sources.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.980]   And as you pointed out, Renee, the phone's done.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.980]   Are they making it yet?
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:34.980]   Probably, right?
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.980]   I think they're for order.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.980]   Yeah, they're going to start getting component orders in.
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.980]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:40.980]   So they're tooling up.
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:41.980]   The factors are tooling up.
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:42.980]   Prototypes exist.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:43.980]   So it wouldn't be surprising.
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:44.980]   But you've got a program against that hardware.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:45.980]   Like you can't just keep moving hard.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.980]   And again, I might be totally wrong.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.980]   There might be people laughing at me at Apple right now, but I believe
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.980]   that you can't just keep changing the hardware and expect the
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.980]   software team to catch up and ship a product.
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.980]   So here's Gurman's quote.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.980]   He says they're testing face recognition.
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:03.980]   The company's also testing eye scanning to augment the system.
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.980]   The sensors speed and accuracy are focal points of the feature.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.980]   It can scan a user's face and unlock the iPhone within a few
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.980]   hundred milliseconds, the person said.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.980]   Gurman has really good sources, so consider that.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:20.980]   It's designed to work even if the device is lying flat on a table
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.980]   rather than just close up to the face.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.980]   We got to explain to Mark that there's a laying and lying, but
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:26.980]   that's okay.
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:27.980]   Lying flat on the table.
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:28.980]   Bloomberg editors.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.980]   Bloomberg at least.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:30.980]   Yeah.
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.980]   No, they don't have nobody has copy editors anymore.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.980]   The feature is still being tested and may not appear with the new
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:36.980]   device.
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:37.980]   That's an important sentence.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.980]   A number of people sent me that or tweeted me that when they, when I
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.980]   first reported this story, they said the feature is still being
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.980]   tested and may not appear with a new device.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.980]   However, the intent is for it to replace the touch ID fingerprint
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.980]   scanner.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.980]   Apple, of course, refuses or declines.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.980]   If it would have to be there, though, I mean, like you can do
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.980]   something like enabling a feature like portrait mode after you
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.980]   ship it, but you can't go in and retroactively put the sensor
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:02.980]   in the case.
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:03.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:04.980]   The hardware.
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.980]   This is hardware stuff as well as software.
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.980]   I know, I wouldn't mind if it's fast.
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.980]   And maybe this would only appear on the high end OLED iPhone.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.980]   The other ones could continue to have touch ID.
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.980]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.980]   It would certainly fit in with all the infrastructure they're
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.980]   putting in for VR and 3D anyway.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.980]   So it's possible that they have the system that's not just for
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.980]   authentication down the road, but also if you're doing an
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.980]   augmented reality, it's very, very handy to know.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.980]   I know that the plane of the phone is like this, but is the
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:34.980]   person's head like this?
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:35.980]   Are they looking over this way?
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:37.980]   Are they looking over that way?
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:38.980]   Are they looking towards this part of the screen?
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.980]   What part do I need to prerender?
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.980]   There's a lot that any time Apple has a rumor about a new
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.980]   thing, my thought is always, yes, they're talking.
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.980]   Yes, we're all talking about authentication, but what else
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:55.980]   could this infrastructure be used for in the next years version
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.980]   of the OS or two years later down the line?
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:02.980]   It's also, I'm just saying that I haven't seen it ever being
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.980]   done, been done on that kind of a level where it's, I've seen
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.980]   it done and I've seen it in labs being done well enough that
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:10.980]   you'd use it for a week.
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.980]   We need a solution where you will be using it a year from now,
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.980]   just like we're using Touch ID a year from now.
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.980]   I think this makes sense that we're getting close to that.
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:19.980]   It does make sense.
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:20.980]   We're getting close to it.
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.980]   I'd be, I'd be, I'm not saying it's not going to happen.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.980]   I'm saying I'd be surprised if it happens this year.
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.980]   I would, I will have learned something brand new, which is
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.980]   always a very, very good thing.
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:32.980]   Also, to be fair, as, as much as we like Touch ID, there are,
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:36.980]   it has its own problems such as like in the winter when my
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.980]   fingertip is really, really dry.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.980]   I have to tap a few times to get it to work.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.980]   In the winter time where I'm wearing gloves, that does, I have
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.980]   to take off a glove to get it to work and that's what I should
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:45.980]   do.
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:46.980]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.980]   So, so it's not as though the Touch fingerprint ID is, is 100%
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:51.980]   either.
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.980]   So anything that if, if we can get it to a place where it's, we can
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:56.980]   absolutely trust it.
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.980]   The first time where I can say I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:03.980]   going to enable this feature on my phone and trust that someone
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.980]   who finds this phone and says, Oh, look, there's that return
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.980]   to the Jedi sticker on the back of it.
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:08.980]   This must be Andy's phone.
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:12.980]   I wonder if we can find a photo of Andy and get, and get, get,
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:16.980]   get access to the immense riches that a print journalist has
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.980]   access to.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.980]   That's messed up.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.980]   His back-break picture is so HD of wonder if I can unlock it by
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.980]   watching the podcast.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.980]   There is a rumor that will cost $1,200 for this.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.980]   Or more, or more.
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:27.980]   Yeah.
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.980]   I think that, I think that one of the things that, I think that a
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.980]   lot of those wow features will sell a lot of units.
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.980]   I mean, I think that Apple has proven that those higher price
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.980]   ones do pretty well.
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.980]   The, I think that, I agree with Andy that I think that these,
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.980]   being able to look at your face, for instance, if you think
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.980]   about what your face, what the facial recognition might be able
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.980]   to do, is it also, if it's tracking those points and it tracks
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.980]   them over time, you could have an avatar that maybe looks like
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:51.980]   you, maybe looks like something else.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.980]   But when you hold up your phone to talk to someone, they would
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.980]   theoretically see, you know, that avatar talking, you know, like,
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.980]   like really tracking your, I mean, you can do that with video
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.980]   cameras now, but you give it a little 3D information and you can
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.980]   get really accurate about, about how that avatar looks and how it
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:07.980]   acts.
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.980]   And I think that part of the bezel-less process is really
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.980]   Apple's commitment to, to the AR area because that's going to
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:17.980]   create like a little window into something else and the, the
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.980]   minimum number of distractions, I think is really important to
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.980]   the design and the process that I, I think they're fairly
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:24.980]   serious about.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.980]   If we look at, you know, what they chose to show at WWC.
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:32.980]   >> 1200 bucks, I would, okay.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.980]   I would pay that if it's super cool.
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.980]   >> I would too.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.980]   >> And what do we pay for our watches, Leo?
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:38.980]   >> Yeah.
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.980]   You know, I mean, really, I think that the Apple market is not
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:42.980]   that price sensitive.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.980]   And if you have special that they are, a few people can get.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.980]   >> They are producing supply.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.980]   >> That's my point, exactly, right?
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.980]   >> There's, there's just a, there's just a bulkization effect.
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.980]   As much as I think that we should make fun of Apple for doing
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.980]   a $12,000 solid gold gadget watch.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.980]   We can at least say that the owners of the $12,000 solid gold
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.980]   gadget watch can't do anything with that watch that the owners
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.980]   of the $350 plain metal gadget watch can do.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:14.980]   It would bum me out if Apple said the innovation is not really
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:15.980]   so much for the poor's.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:16.980]   >> Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.980]   >> We want to make, we want to make the people with, with no
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.980]   sense of money, the happiest of all.
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.980]   So that's, that would worry me.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.980]   >> That, that is, the other thing that I think, I think
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.980]   there's an argument though for Apple to say, you know, we're
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.980]   going to make something available, you know, there's something
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:33.980]   available at a lower price point that you just can't simply do
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:34.980]   at that.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:35.980]   >> It costs us that much to make it.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.980]   >> You know, to make it now, like to not have to wait
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:38.980]   about.
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.980]   >> And so, and look at the $10,000 iMac Pro that's coming out
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:42.980]   at some point.
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.980]   >> Well, I think they tested the iPhone 5C, which they wanted
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.980]   to see what they could do with something that's unabashed
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:48.980]   and plastic, whatever.
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.980]   They wanted to make a lower price point one.
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.980]   And now is probably some frustration to Apple saying we want
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.980]   to do all these things, but we manufacture it such a
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.980]   volume that we have to be able to get yield rates and source
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:57.980]   all this parts.
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:59.980]   And, you know, and this stuff is just not ready.
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:02.980]   But if we only do it in this much and if we could charge this
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.980]   much for it, we could do it now today.
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.980]   And that would help us get this technology like the MacBook did
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.980]   like the MacBook Pro did.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.980]   It helps us get that technology into the mainstream version of
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.980]   the phone, maybe six months or a year.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.980]   >> That's where Elon Musk did with Tesla, right?
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:16.980]   He had very high end models.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.980]   >> He started with the, yeah, the coupe.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.980]   >> To fund the, yeah.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.980]   >> And I think that the, I think that the issue is, is that a lot
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.980]   of what you're paying for when it first comes out is the R&D
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:26.980]   costs as well.
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.980]   You're not just paying for, but they always break these
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.980]   phones down and say, well, the margin was mass at well, the
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.980]   margin that doesn't take into account how many weren't working
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.980]   and, you know, the 40% that go back because something isn't
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:38.980]   working.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.980]   >> And the 10,000 engineers it took to build it.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.980]   >> And also just not to mention a couple of bucks to Qualcomm.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:46.980]   >> Getting panels for this is hard.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.980]   Like getting, for Samsung and Apple, both to put out that
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.980]   many OLED panels is.
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.980]   >> That's why this is going to be in short supply in all I can.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.980]   >> In short supply in all likelihood is the panel, right?
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:54.980]   >> The old.
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.980]   >> The panel and some of the other technology inside it.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.980]   >> I'll tell you those, well, you tell me if I'm wrong, but
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.980]   people have used OLED screens compared to Apple's IPS LCD
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:04.980]   screens.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:05.980]   A lot of them, right?
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:06.980]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.980]   >> They're better.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:08.980]   >> They have considerable advantages.
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.980]   I mean, there's, like Andy said before, no technology is
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:11.980]   perfect.
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:12.980]   I know a bunch of people with OLED screens that have
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.980]   Pokeballs permanently burned in the bottom of the display now.
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.980]   And that doesn't happen with LCD.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.980]   >> It seems like that's a thing for you to bring up with your
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:23.980]   edition, Renee.
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:24.980]   >> I mean, it's just, I was with a group of people and they were
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:25.980]   all complaining.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.980]   >> I know a lot of people have that.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:27.980]   >> They're on their arms.
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:28.980]   I mean, the quality of these syringe.
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.980]   >> I have never experienced burn-in really?
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.980]   They're getting burned.
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.980]   >> It is, like, if you search, if you search Reddit, like there
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.980]   are people who play, you, who use the same app or play the same
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.980]   game repeatedly that has the same pixels.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.980]   And the Apple Watch is acceptable to this too.
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.980]   Like some people have complications that are just there
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.980]   so constantly that they can see the shadow of them.
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.980]   So it's just, it's a minor thing now, but it's like none of
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:48.980]   these technologies are perfect.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.980]   And Apple for a while just wasn't happy with OLED.
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:52.980]   Now they're happy with it.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.980]   And maybe it'll be quantum dot three years from now or
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.980]   micro LED, five years from now.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.980]   But, yeah, OLEDs, the advantages to it now over way, whatever
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:03.980]   drawbacks that they believed in previously.
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:06.980]   Except for availability of course.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:10.980]   >> Well, I, is there a way to fix OLED burn-in?
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.980]   >> You just, yeah, don't keep that poke-able on that screen
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.980]   so much, stop playing it, put it down.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.980]   Walk away from your phone and do something else.
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.980]   >> That's a pretty extreme thing.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.980]   Realize that a lot of, a lot of OLED handset makers actually
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.980]   have like persistent display technology built into it.
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:29.980]   And that even when it's just a clock with moving numbers,
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.980]   I've had, I've actually done stupid things like, I'm
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.980]   reviewing a phone, I'm done with the review, I left it on the
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.980]   charger and then a month and a half later is time to send it
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.980]   back.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:39.980]   I said, oh, that's right.
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:40.980]   I wonder what happened to the screen.
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.980]   And it's still not burned in or there still isn't any fogging.
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.980]   So I don't think it's a real huge problem.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.980]   But again, I say that if you've got, if you've got, if you've
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.980]   got game icons, you need to think about your relationship
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.980]   with that game.
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.980]   >> There's some widget burn-ins too and stuff.
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.980]   It's only, it's things that are really persistent on your
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:01.980]   display.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:02.980]   Like this guy's got the HTC clock.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:06.980]   >> And some of us paid over $1,000 for our iPhone 7 Plus.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:11.980]   I mean, it's, it's not that much more, $1,200.
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.980]   >> What if it's ceramic?
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:14.980]   What if it's titanium?
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:15.980]   >> Oh, no, no.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.980]   >> If they make a ceramic phone on me, I don't care if it costs
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:18.980]   $5,000.
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.980]   >> And I think the other thing is that I'm spending more money on
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.980]   my, on my iMac or my, or my computer and we say that's more
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.980]   powerful, but I spend far more time on my phone than any other
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:28.980]   piece of electronics.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:29.980]   >> Right.
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.980]   >> So the idea of investing more money into the thing that I
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:37.980]   use the most, and I get the most out of, to me seems fairly,
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:38.980]   fairly reasonable.
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:43.980]   >> It should point out that the iPad Pro 10.5 they just put out
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:47.980]   with its new chip is so fast that, you know, I want to see that
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:48.980]   in iPhone as well, right?
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:50.980]   I mean, it's a massive and.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.980]   >> Well, it'll be an augmented reality might be able to use
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.980]   whatever this depth sensing camera that would be important for
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:58.980]   augmented reality as well.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.980]   >> What's super interesting about that chip though is like
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.980]   that, I believe that is a 10 nanometer process we're seeing
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.980]   for the first time on the AT&X.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:05.980]   >> 10, really?
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:06.980]   >> Yeah, and it's an AT&X.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.980]   So it's still based on the architecture of the AT&X where with
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.980]   the iPhone, we'll be getting a 11, which should also be 10
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.980]   nanometer, but the next generation architecture as well.
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.980]   So I want to see how much of a screamer that thing is.
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:16.980]   >> Wow.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.980]   And the one thing I will say, we're doing a lot of AR work right
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:23.980]   now, and the thing that becomes a big deal is battery power and
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:24.980]   heat dissipation.
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:25.980]   >> Yes.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.980]   >> All these phones, when you start doing a lot of, when you're
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:31.980]   using AR a lot, the battery burns out very quickly and the
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.980]   phones get very, very hot.
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:35.980]   >> Apparently, according to the phone, you're going to see
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:42.980]   the chip maker TSMC started production of the A11 in April.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.980]   >> I hate you guys thought it or not, but there were people in
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.980]   Arizona with ice packs on the back of their phones.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:50.980]   >> Are they really?
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:51.980]   >> Yeah.
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.980]   >> It was 120 or something last week.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.980]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.980]   There's lots more to talk about.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.980]   We are now enjoying our audience members.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.980]   Those who want a little tailors of Harrogate.
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.980]   Again, thank you, Tom.
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:05.980]   We're having the --
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:06.980]   >> I'm sorry.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:11.980]   I cannot hear that name without thinking of some sort of role-playing
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.980]   game going on.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:13.980]   >> That sounds like that.
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.980]   >> There's some sort of 17-sided dice being rolled.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.980]   >> We're having the breakfast edition because it is before --
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.980]   >> There's a dragon in the room.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.980]   It's got fire breath right now.
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:24.980]   >> All right, show it.
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.980]   We got a brand new sponsor.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:31.980]   Want to welcome, well, really a venerable member of the
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.980]   Internet community.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.980]   I think these are the first guys to really take advantage of e-commerce
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.980]   dollar shave club.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.980]   I'm going to tell you a secret.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.980]   I've been a dollar shave club customer for a very long time.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.980]   When they first started years ago, remember that great video of
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:46.980]   them wandering through the plant?
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:47.980]   >> Yes.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.980]   >> I immediately signed up for Dollar Shave Club.
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:53.980]   We're really glad to have them as -- I think this is the first time
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:54.980]   though they've ever sponsored.
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:58.980]   I, of course, immediately switched to my Dollar Shave Club executive
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:03.980]   razor.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.980]   By the way, that is a nice looking handle.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.980]   And you get, of course, with the Dollar Shave Club, it's the
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:09.980]   smarter choice.
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:10.980]   You get the blades.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:11.980]   Really.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.980]   I have not seen a test, but I want to do a test.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.980]   I think these are the sharpest blades I've ever used.
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:19.980]   And I think you want a sharp blade because there's less pull and
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:20.980]   drag on your beard.
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.980]   Sharp means you get cut less, not more.
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.980]   Anybody who has good knives knows that.
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.980]   A dull knife is the most dangerous knife in the house.
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.980]   They've got all the features you're looking for in a blade.
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:31.980]   They pivot.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.980]   They've got the lubricating strip.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.980]   They've got that extra sixth blade on the back so you get up
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.980]   under the nose there, which I absolutely have.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.980]   Dr. Carver's shave butter.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.980]   I love the shave butter.
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.980]   This is awesome.
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.980]   You put on, they say, a silver dollar-sized dollop.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.980]   It's clear, which is at first, it takes a little getting used to
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.980]   because you expect a shave cream to be white.
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:01.980]   Like you're supposed to look like Santa, like Renee Richie here.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.980]   Like I do.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.980]   I think I'll be a razor in a few years.
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.980]   But it's clear, but it does actually, transparent.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.980]   It's not so bad because you can actually see where you're going
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.980]   for one thing.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:16.980]   But also, it not only lubricates and makes it easier to cut the
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:21.980]   blade, but it does something special so that afterwards your
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:22.980]   face feels great.
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:26.980]   I'm not surprised it has some really nice stuff in here.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:30.980]   Dollar Shave Club, make the smarter choice by joining Dollar
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:31.980]   Shave Club.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:34.980]   Of course, razor blades, mail order.
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:36.980]   That's the key to this.
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:42.980]   And the $5 starter is worth $15, but it's a great start.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.980]   You get the executive razor.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:48.980]   You get the full-size Dr. Carver's shave butter.
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.980]   And you get four blades and free shipping.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.980]   And then a few bucks a month and you're going to keep fresh
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:56.980]   blades all the time.
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:57.980]   And that's the important thing.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.980]   I think when you subscribe, it gives you incentive to change
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.980]   that blade every week so you always have a sharp, clean
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.980]   shave.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.980]   The weight and the balance on the handle is phenomenal.
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.980]   It feels great in your hand.
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.980]   After your first month replacement car purchase is a ship
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.980]   automatically at their regular price.
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.980]   There are no hidden fees and there's no commitment.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:19.980]   You can't sell any time you like or put it on hold if you're going
[00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.980]   to be out of the country or whatever.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.980]   And I don't think they get enough credit, frankly.
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.980]   Because when I get my box, I love -- they got the bathroom minutes.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:29.980]   I love this.
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.980]   It is a little newspaper.
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:33.980]   It's just full of good stuff.
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.980]   Like, you know, sunburned treatments.
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:37.980]   It's all topical, right?
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.980]   Trivia, stuff like -- it's fun.
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:42.980]   And great quotes.
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.980]   Like "Lm. Montgomery on the back."
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.980]   I wonder what it would be like to live in a world where it was
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:47.980]   always June.
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.980]   This is the June edition, obviously.
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.980]   We'll get the July edition in a little bit.
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.980]   So, my friends, special offer for you, but you only can get it in
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:59.980]   one place, dollarshaveclub.com/macbreak.
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:04.980]   Dollarshaveclub.com/macbreak.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.980]   Get your dollarshaveclub.
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.980]   Get your Dr. Carver's shave butter.
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:08.980]   Get your handle.
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:10.980]   Just $5 and you do want the executive.
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.980]   It just feels nice.
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.980]   I love it.
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:16.980]   Dollarshaveclub.com/macbreak.
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:18.980]   We thank you for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.980]   We welcome them as a brand new sponsor.
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.980]   I want to get Taylor's of Harrogate in here.
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:25.980]   It's a sponsor.
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.980]   We can have a tea break.
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.980]   Tea break weekly.
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:31.980]   All right, so more rumors.
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.980]   Oh, man.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:35.980]   Apple beta software program.
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.980]   Install Mac OS High Sierra.
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:39.980]   It's still teasing me.
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:40.980]   You know you want it.
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.980]   I want it so bad.
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:43.980]   Just hit it.
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:44.980]   Just hit the button.
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:45.980]   Maybe I can just start it here.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.980]   I think you don't want to happen, Leo.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:52.980]   I should start a long conversation that I had, so that a lot using my...
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:53.980]   Oh, too bad.
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:54.980]   I pressed agree.
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.980]   Oh.
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.980]   You can take Sia Rahaia.
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:02.980]   Oh, too major first step without your word.
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:03.980]   Upgrade Macintosh.
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:04.980]   Should I...
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:05.980]   Oh, you want to check this box.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:06.980]   That is not checked by default.
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.980]   Upgrade to the APFS.
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:14.980]   You save room, but more importantly, you use your SSD more efficiently, more reliably.
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:21.980]   It does a lot of wonderful things for usability.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:27.980]   I mean data reliability does snapshots and backups and all sorts of stuff.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:31.980]   21 seconds from now, my computer will restart and I shall begin.
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.980]   And it's smart from...
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:35.980]   On the one on the Mac, it's smart from mobile time machine and a bunch of other things.
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:36.980]   That's the new time machine.
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:38.980]   The new time machine, yeah.
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:42.980]   Well, it was originally given out and then stopped because it wasn't reliable and that works.
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:45.980]   Now I know nothing about the show.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:47.980]   We're just going to have to wing it from here on in.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:48.980]   T-Shirats.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:50.980]   We were talking more about...
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:51.980]   Let's talk more about the...
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:52.980]   Oh, look at this.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.980]   Lisa's showing off for you, Andy.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:59.980]   She's decided she loves her Olympus OM-D camera so much.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:03.980]   She just started upgrading her lenses.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:04.980]   You're killing me.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:09.980]   Scott Borne has now switched over to that platform too.
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:13.980]   Nothing but pictures from that $3,000 300 millimeter lens.
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.980]   If I could show you the pictures from that, I would.
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.980]   The eagle images.
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:23.980]   So it's 300 millimeter, but that's effective 600 on a micro four thirds lens.
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:24.980]   Oh, God.
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:29.980]   See, I thought I was done buying lenses and I'm like, oh, I really want that lens.
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:33.980]   Actually, there was a hawk right outside my kitchen window like this morning.
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:41.980]   I put it on Instagram, but I got my unfortunately only really expensive middle range on a
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:45.980]   zoom on it and it's like, oh, you're going to kill the boy.
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:46.980]   I need 600.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.980]   This is another Pro lens.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.980]   Lisa just bought the 40 to 150, which is effectively...
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:52.980]   Yeah, yeah, that's 800.
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:53.980]   That's mine.
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:54.980]   Oh, God.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:55.980]   Do my love that.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.980]   And you know what's surprising?
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.980]   With all of that, it's still pretty light and comfortable, right?
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:01.980]   See, that's the...
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:08.260]   There are a lot of advantages to like the Sony system because it has a larger sensor for
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.260]   a lot of reasons.
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:14.340]   But when I look at the size of the lens for the Sony system that does the same job, the
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:19.940]   same quality as that Olympus lens, I can throw that into a little hip bag and be walking
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:24.860]   around New York or walking around Boston with this amazing killer assortment of lenses.
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:29.340]   But with the Sony kit, I would have to really have a bag with me and I'd have to really
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.740]   look like, "Hi, yes, I'm with the press.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:32.740]   Hello, press, press."
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.540]   Yes, I are, man.
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:35.540]   No, it's really true.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.340]   Like I'm flocking J-L
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:37.340]   Or something.
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.740]   If you think that's bad, I'm shooting with a Canon.
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:41.420]   Ah, there you go.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:42.420]   Literally.
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:43.420]   It's like a Canon.
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:44.420]   It's huge.
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:46.340]   That is so nice and light.
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.620]   Oh, and it's so fast.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:49.740]   They've really done a nice job.
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:50.980]   Yes, Scott Born has become the...
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:52.140]   In fact, we're going to get Scott on.
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:53.700]   He was on Twitch last week.
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.260]   He's an Olympus ambassador now.
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:00.780]   The reason Scott, as Alex knows, the original members of Mac Break Weekly, the reason Scott
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:05.620]   had to switch is his doctor said, "If you keep carrying that big, heavy Canon 5D and
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:09.540]   all those lenses around, your back's going to go."
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.460]   So he had to switch to a lighter camera.
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:16.140]   And of course, this is a guy who shoots wildlife photography.
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.620]   You think, "You're not micro-fourthrd.
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.060]   You're not going to get the detail.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.060]   You're not going to...
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.460]   This is going to be a very disappointing experience to you."
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:26.380]   But he went out, got the OMD EM1 Mark II, which is what...
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:27.380]   I was just using.
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:28.820]   That's what Lisa has.
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.340]   And the detail he's getting in his images.
[00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:33.340]   And the thing is...
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:39.780]   He has a picture on his page, scottborn.com, V-O-U-R-N-E, of a eagle catching a fish in
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:40.780]   the water.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:41.980]   And it's coming straight at him.
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:46.220]   He said, "I could not get that with any other camera because that's the tracking focus."
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:49.340]   And he said, "That's the hardest thing to do is something moving straight at you at high
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:50.340]   speed."
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:53.020]   And the detail and the focus is phenomenal.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.020]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:58.180]   Especially in the hands of someone like Scott who absolutely knows what he's doing.
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.180]   I want it less.
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:04.380]   But it absolutely shows you that if someone says, "Oh, well, you can't do serious sports
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:08.100]   photography unless you have this camera," or, "You can't do serious nature photography
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.980]   unless you have this other camera," it really is.
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.980]   You can make almost anything work.
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:13.980]   There is.
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:14.980]   Look at that.
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.420]   That said, there's a certain...
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.860]   I don't think that a microfiber... the four-thirds camera could have done that three or four years
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:21.860]   ago.
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:22.860]   No.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:23.860]   It's the newest generation.
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:24.860]   It's like...
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:25.860]   That is typically the complaint about microfiber.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.940]   It's not fast enough for sports photography.
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:30.940]   And I'm shooting roller derby without...
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:31.940]   Yeah.
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:32.940]   But folks...
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:33.940]   Yeah, your shots are great.
[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:34.940]   I know.
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:37.900]   And Alex, I would imagine the Panasonic G5 would be of interest to you.
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:41.900]   That is a camera that shoots 4.2.2 video in the camera.
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:42.900]   Yeah.
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:47.300]   We're definitely looking at it for a couple of different reasons.
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.300]   So...
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.300]   What do you use now?
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.220]   Do you use the Black Magics?
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.620]   For video, we're actually...
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:55.300]   We'll probably announce it sometime soon.
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.580]   We're going to kind of do a big sale of a lot of cameras.
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:58.580]   I was talking about that earlier.
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.580]   And you're going to tell me first, right?
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:01.580]   Exactly.
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:02.580]   I am.
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:07.380]   I just want to help you copy edit and proofread your ads before you do various things.
[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:11.220]   You're not going to publicize it till you tell me the name before.
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.140]   No, you guys will get the...
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:15.140]   But what are you dumping?
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:20.420]   We're pretty much getting rid of all the video cameras that aren't Black Magic.
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:21.420]   So we're...
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:22.420]   Wow.
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:23.420]   That took us a long time to kind of get to.
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:28.420]   But the problem really is that trying to manage a lot of different systems has just become
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:29.420]   this thing.
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:32.660]   We've got cannons and sony's and Panasonic's and...
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:33.660]   And you can't...
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.060]   They don't color match very well, right?
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.700]   Each manufacturer has different color styles.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:38.700]   They don't.
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:40.180]   Even different lenses look a little bit different.
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:44.100]   And so you end up in this situation where we had to kind of decide what we're going to
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.100]   use.
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:48.340]   The way the Black Magic stuff works, I can literally change the color of a camera from
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:51.460]   3,000 miles away the way we have it set up in our system.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.460]   And so we can...
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.340]   We have a lot of control over them.
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.260]   And we've got a lot of other cameras.
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:58.260]   We are keeping this...
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:59.260]   We have Sony...
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:00.260]   I'm not Sony.
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:04.980]   We have Canon ME-200s, which are low light cameras that will probably keep those because
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:07.260]   they are a very specific niche for us.
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:10.420]   I'm being able to shoot low light.
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:13.740]   But the rest of them we've got a bunch of...
[00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:16.980]   We've got Sony F-23s and P1s.
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:20.780]   And we've also got a lot of FS100s and a lot of other things.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.180]   My son is studying videography.
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:26.620]   He just got out of college and wants to do videography.
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:29.860]   So that's why I want to get on that list.
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:32.460]   If you can recommend a good one for somebody starting...
[00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:34.660]   Well, I've been trying to figure out the best one for...
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:35.660]   He's doing E&G stuff.
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:36.660]   He wants to get around.
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:37.660]   He's not studio.
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:38.660]   Yeah.
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:39.660]   And we don't have a lot of...
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:42.900]   We realize we have some E&G, like an EX-1, EX-3 kind of...
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.620]   Stands for electronic news gathering.
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:47.180]   It's people running around running gun with cameras.
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.180]   Yeah.
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:49.180]   And so we don't have...
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:52.420]   We realize we actually don't have a ton of E&G stuff other than using the Black Magic
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:53.420]   stuff.
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:54.420]   So we use the...
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.180]   I don't know, 10 or 12 of the Ursa minis.
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:04.940]   And so those are kind of the ones that we use the most for that type of thing.
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:08.980]   And again, we're also trying to move all of our cameras, all the Black Magic cameras
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:11.540]   that we have that we're going to keep are all 4K.
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:12.540]   So we're kind of...
[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:14.420]   Everything will be 4K or better.
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:15.420]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:16.420]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:17.420]   And so...
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.420]   Some are 5K, right?
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:19.420]   The new ones are 5K.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:20.420]   Well, the Ursa minis that we have are 4.6.
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:21.420]   Wow.
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:22.420]   So they're not quite...
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.420]   Quite fine.
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:24.420]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:25.420]   But...
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:28.420]   And we may keep the reds because we have an underwater rig for them.
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:29.420]   The scarlets may stay...
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:34.660]   Can you believe we are at a stage now where people are discarding the scarlets for the
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:35.660]   next bed...
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:37.300]   Next thing that's new and better?
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:38.300]   Well, yeah.
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.300]   It's...
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.820]   What's exciting about it right now is that you don't try to keep a camera for 10 years
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:46.780]   because you were able to pay it off much faster or get your value out of it.
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:47.780]   A lot less expensive, yeah.
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:49.780]   I mean, now the lenses are still expensive.
[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:52.380]   I just bought some really painful...
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:54.420]   But you can reuse the lenses, can't you?
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:58.940]   But yeah, the lenses are their PL mount or their EEF mount or whatever you're going
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:00.020]   to use.
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:03.980]   Those kind of things stay for a long time and they're durable and you can keep them...
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:08.020]   That's kind of what's becoming digital photography, still photography as well, is you buy good
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.460]   glass but you're going to replace the body as this new technology.
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.460]   Well, that was always...
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:13.940]   To some degrees I would say that's always been the case for photographers is they're
[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:18.820]   constantly moving their bodies up and they're constantly spending a lot of money on glass
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:20.620]   because that's really what's going to make the difference.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:26.580]   And so it's been great that we've been either able to buy really expensive used equipment
[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:32.780]   or now the camera prices have gotten to a point where they really work in our favor.
[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:37.580]   There's definitely still some cameras out there that are expensive and are worth it.
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:40.740]   We've shot a couple of times with Ares that are just amazing.
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:44.260]   Hey, RRI, those are used in motion picture production, right?
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:48.820]   Yeah, the Alexa's and the Alexa Mini's and we've shot some pieces with those and they
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.180]   an area with an engineered lens is...
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:54.940]   It's $150,000 hard work.
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:53:02.260]   It looks great, but on a day-to-day production process, if you're shooting films, the cost
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:07.140]   of your camera rental is not a huge portion of most film production.
[00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:15.260]   So it's not a big deal to rent that at, let's say, $1,500 a day over $2,500 a day over three
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.940]   day weeks across a month and a half.
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:21.220]   That's not going to be a huge percentage of the cost because you've got 60 people on
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:22.220]   site.
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:25.220]   You're paying $50,000 a day for labor.
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:30.380]   So those are all things that make sense for film.
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:34.060]   What we do is day-to-day live production.
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.900]   We need to be more efficient about it.
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:36.900]   So anyway, so we're...
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:41.300]   It must have workflow like with these 5K and with these high res...
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:44.140]   Well, I mean, for a while, 4K was barely doable.
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:46.780]   I mean, the big thing is you just go through a lot of drive space quickly.
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:51.340]   You just have to keep in mind that you're burning through a lot of data.
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:55.340]   We still, while we're slowly moving to 4K, I would say that the majority of our shows
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:54:00.620]   are internally 1080p and still streaming occasionally at 720p.
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:01.620]   That's what we do.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.620]   We stream at 720p.
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:03.620]   Right.
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:04.620]   And a lot of people...
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.420]   People don't want more than that, really, for what we do.
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.020]   Well, yeah, I mean, I think that...
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:09.020]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:12.020]   I mean, I think that there are times when 4K makes a lot of sense.
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:15.700]   There's definitely stuff that we've done that looks amazing and poorly.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:17.980]   Travel logs, nature, yeah.
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:19.740]   But guys sitting around a table talking.
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:22.420]   Yeah, I'll think you need that.
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:23.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:24.980]   And I think that...
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:30.500]   And so we've been moving more to where at least we're doing almost everything in 1080p.
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:35.020]   And then internally or oftentimes starting to work more and more in 4K.
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:37.700]   And so we wanted to kind of move that direction.
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:38.700]   The great thing again about...
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:45.180]   And I don't want to turn this into a black magic commercial, but it makes it easier because
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:47.500]   they have a lot of stuff at 4K that isn't super expensive.
[00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:51.260]   And so having lots of recorders that do 4K and having lots of the infrastructure and everything
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:54.100]   else hasn't been a big challenge for us.
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:55.500]   So anyway, that's why we're kind of...
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.420]   Which lens mount do you use?
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:58.420]   They support Canon ZF.
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:02.500]   I know you can use micro four thirds in some of the black magics.
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:10.020]   Yeah, so the smaller ones, so the studio and the micro studios are all four thirds.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:16.500]   So when you spend great lenses on your Olympus system, you're also getting great video lenses.
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:18.100]   For the most part, yeah.
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:22.180]   There's a couple of little funky things about getting the lens on occasionally.
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:25.140]   The black magic one's a little tighter than a typical camera.
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:29.620]   And so especially for adapters, if you're doing EF adapters, there's only very specific
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:31.660]   ones that work.
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:32.660]   So those are four thirds.
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:38.100]   And for us, that's difficult because most of our pro lenses, the Fujianon and Canon lenses
[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:39.100]   are...
[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:43.100]   They don't do four thirds and there's really hard to adapt to them.
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:44.100]   So then we have...
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:44.980]   What's the crop factor on those?
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:47.300]   Is it similar to micro four thirds cameras?
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:48.300]   Is it 2X?
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:50.540]   Oh, the crop factor is going to be the same.
[00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:54.100]   So they're not full frame sensors then?
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.100]   Right.
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:56.100]   They don't need to be.
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:57.100]   Even for 4K.
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:56:01.580]   Well, in some ways, the four thirds is nicer in that sense because, for instance, a lot
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:05.380]   of people want to use like B4 mounts on them, which would...
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:07.060]   Those are kind of two thirds inch chips.
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:08.900]   And so the chips are half size.
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:15.460]   So making that chip even bigger makes it harder because you already can't zoom all the way
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:19.780]   out or you'll get vignetting because the chip's bigger than the lens was designed.
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:22.380]   And so then you have...
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:25.780]   So you have the new...
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:28.300]   After I bought eight of the...
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:30.380]   The Ursa Mini's PL only.
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:35.700]   And the reason we got PL specifically was because it was easier to rent the lenses.
[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:38.740]   So rental houses have more PLs than they have EF's.
[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:44.100]   And so then the new Mini Pro, of course, now does both B4, PL, and EF.
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.100]   And you can just swap between them.
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:46.100]   EF is Canon.
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:47.100]   What's PL?
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:48.100]   PL is...
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:51.100]   I don't know what it stands for, but it's just a much more...
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.100]   It's a film...
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:55.020]   It's a more standard like an Airy would use at PL.
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:56.020]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.020]   Most of your film cameras are using PL.
[00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:02.460]   Your B4s are mostly your two thirds for broadcast.
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:05.460]   So most of your broadcast cameras are all B4.
[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:10.540]   And then the EF lets you use any of the lenses, which is great because when we're on a cheaper
[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:19.820]   event, we want to be able to throw on just a little Canon 7200 is a great thing to use
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:23.060]   on events that aren't really big and I don't need to control the lenses.
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:25.500]   A lot of our stuff is...
[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:31.140]   You start changing your view of lenses when you start buying film lenses.
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:34.500]   They cost a lot per unit.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:35.500]   Are they better?
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:38.260]   Yeah, they're a lot better.
[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:39.260]   They're noticeably better.
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:41.140]   I mean, there's certain things you're paying for.
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.460]   Number one, you can just see the difference in the glass.
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:48.340]   I mean, you think that these are all the same, like HD is just HD or the glass is just the
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:50.300]   glass and it's really not.
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.180]   And so you can see that it looks much better.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.580]   At least I can see that it looks better.
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.620]   And then in addition to that, we have a lot of controls.
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:59.780]   So the kind of lenses that we're buying for those have these electronic zoom focus and
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:05.420]   aperture controls so that we can tie those into either hand controllers down by the...
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:09.420]   Where operators holding the camera so that you're not like reaching over and grabbing
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:10.420]   onto the lens.
[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:14.580]   And then the second thing is that they'll tie into our telemetrics heads.
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:19.820]   These are big PTZ heads that hold the camera and the lens.
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:20.820]   And so...
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:21.820]   Are you shooting these days?
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:24.220]   It sounds like you're making movies.
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:25.220]   We're close.
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:26.220]   We're working on it.
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:27.220]   So...
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:30.540]   But no, most of our stuff is just...
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:35.100]   Most of our work is fairly high end location production.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:39.100]   So just live streams that people want to have.
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:44.140]   When you're working with big shots, you want to have a big quality.
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:49.140]   Well, and again, those aren't the big expenses for most of our shows.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.300]   Those are fixed costs that we paid for once.
[00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:55.660]   And so we're able to add a lot of value without the cost of doing the kind of productions
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:59:00.540]   that we have is getting seven people to France with hardware and putting them up and their
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:02.380]   hotel costs and everything else.
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:05.500]   So those are kind of costs that really impact the production.
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:07.660]   It's not the...
[00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:10.380]   Us being able to own the lenses means that they all work together.
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.380]   They're not scratched.
[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:14.100]   Someone didn't bend all the pins.
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:16.780]   Those are all the things that we've had recently.
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:17.780]   Good sound.
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:21.740]   So I figure it probably works and the industry says PL stands for positive lock.
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:22.740]   There you go.
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.740]   Positive lock.
[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:24.740]   Positive lock.
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:28.820]   And I need to digress into this week in video production.
[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:31.100]   However, you get somebody like Alex Iran.
[00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:32.100]   It's fun to talk about it.
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:33.740]   And we are a lot of people in the business.
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:35.420]   And we didn't need your screen.
[00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:36.420]   Yes.
[00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:37.780]   Well, it just...
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:39.540]   So it's rebooted like a hundred times.
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:40.540]   Oh, Renee.
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:41.540]   You're so insightful.
[00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:42.540]   Yes.
[00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:43.540]   Yes.
[00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:44.540]   You know what's going on.
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:45.900]   And it says now 26 minutes remaining.
[00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:46.900]   So I have...
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:47.900]   Maybe I don't know.
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:48.900]   I have more of a heart.
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:49.900]   Okay.
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:50.900]   Who's excited about the next season of Game of Thrones?
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:51.900]   (laughter)
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:53.900]   (singing)
[00:59:53.900 --> 01:00:00.220]   Sarah Lane used to say she bought some really nice B&W speakers.
[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:03.540]   She said every time she'd hear that music on there, she'd just get...
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.540]   (laughter)
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.580]   It's amazingly good theme music.
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.580]   It is really good.
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:13.380]   I'm not sure that show has maintained its standards, but the music stays really...
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:14.980]   You can talk about Spider-Man Homecoming too.
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.580]   I'm not going to talk about Spider-Man Homecoming.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:19.940]   I have so little interest in Spider-Man Homecoming.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:20.940]   Ah, Michael Keaton.
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:22.380]   Just see it for the Michael Keaton.
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:23.380]   I heard he was good in this.
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:24.380]   Who does he play?
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:25.380]   He's fantastic.
[01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:26.380]   Is he Dot-A-Vulture?
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.380]   The Vulture.
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:28.380]   The Vulture.
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:29.380]   All right.
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:33.260]   I know when he was just getting started again, he had kind of been disappeared, so it was
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:35.860]   a little independent film, and we didn't end up working on it, but we almost ended up
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:36.860]   working on it.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.060]   I was so frustrated because now he's so huge.
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:40.420]   Well, he did Birdman, right?
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.260]   Didn't that kind of change everything?
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.260]   It was before that.
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.500]   There was some independent stuff.
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.500]   But it was...
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:47.980]   Birdman really kind of launched him.
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:48.980]   He's such a great...
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:50.660]   He was so good in Beetlejuice.
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:52.160]   He's just...
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.660]   I would say underrated, except he, as you point out, no longer underrated.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:56.660]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.260]   It's also a really great set, man.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:00:59.260]   He was a...
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:00.260]   I thought he was a good Batman.
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:01.260]   Yeah.
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:02.260]   I thought he was a great Batman.
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:03.260]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.260]   And just to show you that...
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.260]   He was looking for somebody else.
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:09.660]   Even on the pre-internet days, when we had to write angry...
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:11.220]   Fans had to write angry letters.
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:14.020]   People were upset about the casting of the Beetlejuice.
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.020]   No, it wasn't...
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:17.360]   Was that pre-B
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:23.420]   But yeah, about the comedian actor as Bruce Wayne, but in heaven, he was good.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:24.420]   I think it was after Batman was after the...
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.420]   Well, he does some little comedies.
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:26.420]   Yeah.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:27.420]   He does some little comedy.
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:28.420]   He's mostly intense.
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:29.420]   Well, he's just tense personality.
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:32.780]   Well, back then, he was known for Night Shift.
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:34.780]   He was known for a couple of sitcoms.
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:35.780]   Right.
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:36.780]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:37.780]   And I think that a lot of...
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:38.780]   Now we're digressing to movie...
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.180]   You know, Richard Newbert.
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.180]   But the...
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:42.340]   This will be done in 23 minutes, folks.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:43.940]   At least that's what my match is.
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:44.940]   Oh, okay.
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:47.180]   Can I pause you for one second?
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.180]   Yes.
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.140]   So this is like an additional, like, interim pick of the week.
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:55.300]   Roger Eber's second volume of the great movies that he decided to do later in his career
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:59.560]   just not necessarily reviews, but essays about the greatest movies of all time by his
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:00.560]   estimation.
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.860]   Volume two of it is two damn dollars on Amazon on Kindle.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:04.860]   Oh, get it.
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:05.860]   Wow.
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:06.860]   Get it.
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:07.860]   You should get it.
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:08.860]   Except...
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:09.860]   Except think about this.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.740]   You're going to buy the book, but then you're going to spend hundreds of dollars on DVDs,
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.740]   Blu-ray DVDs, movies.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:14.740]   With no regrets.
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:15.740]   But...
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:16.740]   Because we'll be...
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:17.740]   Oh, wait.
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:18.740]   Is...
[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:19.740]   Back up to 12?
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.740]   Okay.
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.740]   Well, it's still a good deal.
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:22.740]   I get the paper back.
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:23.740]   It's cheaper in paperback.
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:24.740]   Ah, darn it was.
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:25.740]   It was too...
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:26.740]   I guess it was...
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:27.740]   Must have been a prime deal.
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:30.820]   Has anybody been doing the Amazon Prime thing?
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:31.820]   I have...
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:33.260]   If I bought a UPS that I actually had my...
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:35.660]   Already had my ION that was...
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:38.340]   Newegg had it for like 190 and it was down to 110.
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:44.060]   Why are cutters doing analysis last year where it looked like fewer than 10% of the
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.700]   deals on the Prime deals were actually deals.
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.740]   So, anyone else has this experience though?
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:50.700]   Like, in Canada, Amazon Prime is really new.
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.860]   Like, it had a couple of features, but now it's getting more.
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.060]   And I signed up for it.
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.740]   And now it looks like Uber drivers are delivering.
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:03:00.020]   My stuff guys show up with really strange accents that I'm not sure are Taren.
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.020]   And in cars.
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:04.740]   And it's like Sunday at 3pm, bring your Paco Josie Ar.
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:08.260]   And I think one was a Klingons.
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.260]   Are these Klingons delivering his ION?
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.260]   I don't know.
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:12.260]   But I don't...
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.820]   There's not any official to say it was Amazon.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:15.020]   It was just a guy with an envelope.
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:16.020]   Yeah.
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.020]   The dots were down to what?
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.020]   They were pretty cheap.
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.020]   They were like 25, 30 bucks.
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.020]   The Echo was $90.
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.020]   It's half price.
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:23.020]   That's like...
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:24.020]   Oh my God.
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:25.020]   That's an oh my God kind of price.
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:26.020]   This was...
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:27.020]   This was...
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:28.020]   Yes.
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.020]   Last year.
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:30.020]   Oh no, this is this year.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.020]   The 3pm tally on the wire cutter.
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.340]   Because they did doing a great job of this.
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.700]   Of 17,200 deals.
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:35.700]   Only 98.
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:36.700]   Right.
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:37.700]   That's no joke.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:42.660]   Every time that there's like some sort of like a gold box deal.
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:47.860]   If I want it, I will put it in my basket and then spend that 14 and a half minutes looking
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:52.420]   at the online saying, "Okay, so I could buy this art kit anywhere else, including on Amazon
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.660]   for about the same price anytime I want.
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:56.140]   So it could be careful."
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:57.140]   Good tip.
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:59.580]   I'm sorry, Alex, but I entered a few outs.
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:00.580]   You were saying that K-word now.
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:04.900]   All I was gonna say is the sis-cool and Ebert about...
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:10.020]   And also my favorite book by Roger Ebert is the pot and how to use it.
[01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.020]   Right.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.020]   I have to follow along.
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:15.900]   He was a prolific rice cooker, cooker chef.
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.660]   He wrote a book about rice cookers.
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:19.660]   He was an absolute...
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:20.660]   No idea.
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:23.100]   He was like Julia Child with a...
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:26.660]   And I'm not talking about your basic Japanese.
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:31.700]   I think the one that he liked had some smarts in it but wasn't like an $8,000 thing was
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:34.020]   basically go anywhere buy it for 70 bucks.
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:35.220]   And he more than rice?
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:36.700]   Because anything in it.
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.860]   Stews, whole chickens, everything.
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:42.740]   It took me a little while to get over the fact that I shouldn't put anything in it.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:44.900]   I've been a purist of like, I only put rice in it.
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:48.580]   Rice in your rice cooker because it'll flavor it otherwise.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:49.580]   Maybe not.
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:50.580]   But it doesn't.
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.780]   Everybody loves these quick pots now.
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:53.780]   That's the thing.
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:54.780]   What do they call it?
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:55.780]   Like the combination...
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:56.780]   Pressure cooker.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:01.900]   No, no, it's a pressure cooker plus slow cooker in one device.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:02.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.540]   Some of the rice cookers now have that.
[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.620]   I chose when I got my last rice cooker not to...
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:09.060]   I was cheap and now I look back on it.
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:10.060]   It would have been nice.
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:13.220]   But yeah, it's like another $100, $100.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:14.220]   To get why I didn't get it.
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.980]   But because I was just like making my rice.
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:19.580]   Maybe there'll be a prime day deal on rice cooker/quick pots.
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.580]   Actually, wire cutter, I did...
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:22.580]   Oh!
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:25.300]   It's deeply discounted for prime day.
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:31.100]   Not only that, but my favorite sous vide cooker is down to 100 bucks, which is...
[01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:34.300]   You see on Black Friday, but that's about it.
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.300]   Wire cutter did...
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:36.300]   I did retweet...
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.100]   Wire cutter's tweet out about that's the steal.
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.100]   So it is a good deal.
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.100]   That is my own sous vide.
[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:42.740]   I'm pissed off because I cannot buy a sous vide cooker.
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:48.660]   Because I ordered that one a year and a half or two years ago.
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:49.660]   Andy told me about it.
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:52.340]   I said, "This sounds great because it kept it cool."
[01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:54.220]   And then it would...
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:57.260]   The iPhone controlled it and then would cook later.
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:58.260]   And where is it?
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.260]   It's not...
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:03.700]   I can just add it to the list of crap I bought on indiegogo and Kickstarter that I'll never
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:04.700]   see.
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:05.700]   I know.
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:11.740]   That's always a bummer when you buy hardware on indiegogo that hasn't actually been made
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:12.580]   yet.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:17.060]   They wrote to me and they said, "Oh, we're so glad you got one."
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:21.860]   The better news is I get ones that if I do anything like that, it comes like eight months
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:23.900]   later I forgot that it even existed.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:24.900]   And so it's just...
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:31.580]   Well, it's funny because my pick of the week this week I ordered a year ago came yesterday.
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:34.140]   So I have one exactly like that.
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:38.060]   And I don't mind that they're taking a while as long as it comes out.
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:42.160]   My problem is I can't buy anything else because I can't spend a lot of money on a sous vide
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.160]   poker.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.160]   Okay, think about this way.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.220]   So this one, this one is normally like 150, 175 bucks.
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:48.580]   You can get it for 100 bucks.
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:50.180]   That means that like...
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:52.540]   This is the ANOVA Bluetooth model.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:55.180]   I only see it on as 149.
[01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:56.180]   Right.
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.180]   But this...
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.180]   But today it's...
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.180]   When you check it out, when you check out, you get...
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.180]   You'll try to deal.
[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:01.180]   ...and see...
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.180]   ...for the price.
[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.180]   That's not the wife's wife.
[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:04.180]   That's the non-wife.
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:05.180]   I don't need the wife's wife.
[01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:06.180]   I never...
[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.660]   I always control it right from the...
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:09.660]   Yes.
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:10.660]   ...from the appliance.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:11.660]   But here's the deal.
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.860]   It's time to cook your Thanksgiving dinner.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:15.660]   It means that you can have one bath.
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:17.600]   That's at like cooking temperature.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.600]   And another bath that when you...
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:23.080]   Something is cooked, it's now at basically keep this thing warm for the table temperature.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.800]   So you need more than one sous vide cook.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:25.800]   Oh, I have...
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.440]   And not only that, but there are times you're gonna...
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.240]   You're gonna wanna do the 24-hour bacon or the 24-hour brisket.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.840]   And so that's gonna tie up a sous vide for an entire day.
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.840]   Alex is about to tell us how many he has.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:36.840]   A little balance.
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:37.840]   How many I have.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:38.840]   I have two minutes.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:39.840]   So anyway, so...
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:40.840]   But the main thing is...
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.160]   Low balance sous vide cookers.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.260]   I have to admit that I'm testing them.
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:46.260]   I've been testing them.
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.260]   He racked down some Leo.
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:49.260]   He racked down some there three years now.
[01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:50.260]   No, no.
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:51.260]   It's just that I would...
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:52.260]   How many...
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:54.760]   How many can you fit in an envel case?
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:57.180]   No, it's all...
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.500]   I'm testing different ones.
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.500]   And so I...
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:00.500]   Oh, I have to keep ones.
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:01.500]   They're not all in over.
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:02.500]   They're all in over.
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:03.500]   They're all in over.
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.500]   They're all in over.
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.500]   I'm testing them.
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.500]   Exactly.
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.500]   That's what I tell my wife.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.500]   I'm testing it, honey.
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:09.500]   Right.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.500]   And the...
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:11.500]   That's a...
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:12.500]   But yeah, it was...
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:15.400]   To get to Andy's point, I had one where I had...
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.400]   It was a...
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.400]   There was a...
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:20.420]   I had ribs that had to sit for 24 hours.
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:21.420]   And then...
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:22.420]   And then I had...
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:25.160]   But I also had someone coming over and we needed to cook a tri-tip.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.320]   And so these are all things that you have to deal with.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.880]   You know, there's different temperatures, different times, different sizes.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.880]   But the...
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.880]   I will agree with Andy.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.880]   The ANOVA is...
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:34.880]   That's the one.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.820]   I've got a lot of different ones.
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:37.820]   And it is the best.
[01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:38.820]   I mean, it's just...
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:39.820]   The other ones is not that they don't work.
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:41.380]   You know, that's the funny thing is they don't work.
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:42.620]   It's that they do weird things.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.540]   Like, I get into that and I can't change the temperature unless I turn it off.
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:46.540]   And it's just...
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:47.540]   You know, it's...
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:48.540]   But as far as...
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:50.900]   And at $99, oh my gosh.
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:51.900]   It's...
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:55.800]   The difference between is that the ANOVA is built like a kitchen appliance that they
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.340]   added some electronics to.
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:01.820]   And companies will send me like their new Suvie cookers.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:03.700]   And I have to like write them back after months.
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:09.620]   I'm not going to review this because you basically built this consumer electronics gadget that
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:11.260]   you could cook stuff with.
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:13.500]   It doesn't behave like a kitchen appliance.
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:17.860]   Unless it would look at home on one of the counters at the British baking show, I think
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:20.260]   that you need to go back and reconsider what you're doing.
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:21.820]   I have a counter issue, frankly.
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:23.500]   I have way too many things in the counters.
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:27.820]   And many of them mysteriously disappear only to be found later in the garage.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:32.060]   So I just really don't dare add anything more to my case.
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:37.220]   Well, you know about something, I will say the Suvie to something that I use almost every
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:38.220]   day?
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:39.220]   Yeah.
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:43.300]   And I think the big breakthrough also was what was really slimy down is I was vacuum packing
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:44.300]   everything.
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:46.020]   And Andy was like, "No, I just put it in a ziplock bag."
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:47.700]   And I'm like, "Oh, there's a plug bag."
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.820]   Now there's chefs online that say you should never do that.
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:50.820]   It's dangerous.
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:53.620]   Well, not all of them are heat safe.
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:57.420]   I've actually switched to vacuum sealing things because that means I can basically cook in
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.420]   a hand.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:00.180]   I can basically fill a bag in advance, put in the freezer.
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:04.300]   But here was one of the big breakthrough moments for myself where they tell you that, "Oh,
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.060]   try a steak, try a burger, try chicken."
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.380]   And it is the best you've ever done.
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.380]   But then I thought, "Wait a minute.
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:12.420]   Then I thought I'm about to eat one of my...
[01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:16.140]   I don't want to be bothered with cooking, but I need to eat something for dinner because
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.620]   I also missed lunch."
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:22.300]   Which is basically taking a frozen microwave burrito out from the grocery store.
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:23.860]   And I'm like, "Put the microwave."
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:25.180]   Like, "Wait a minute.
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:30.660]   What if I were to put this in a bag, put this in the Suvie and I swear to God it was the
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:31.660]   best.
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:35.660]   It almost becomes restaurant quality because it heats the...
[01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:40.540]   I'm telling you, because the tortilla is completely soft and moist and heated through.
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:42.380]   I do not drink out spots.
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:44.980]   How long did it take, Andy?
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:45.820]   You add, whatever...
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:47.820]   The cooking time was about an hour...
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:49.740]   I added about 20 minutes because it was still frozen.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:52.100]   But no, but here's the deal with Suvie.
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:56.260]   It's not just that it's not the time with the microwave oven, you spend four minutes
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:01.020]   like standing there looking at the microwave waiting for this thing to put it in the spinning.
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:06.300]   With the Suvie somewhere around two hours plus or minus an hour before you feel like you're
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:10.100]   going to eat, you put it in the machine, you'll walk away from it.
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:14.460]   And now you've got this two hour window in which you can take it out at any time and
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:18.540]   it will be perfect temperature, it'll be safe to eat, it'll be as tasty as this thing
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:19.580]   could possibly be.
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:20.580]   So that's...
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:24.220]   Because sometimes it's like, I know that I'm going to want to eat around six, but now
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:27.740]   it's six o'clock and I'm still waiting for something to compile or I'm still waiting
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:31.700]   for something to render or I've got my head lodged in some sort of a problem.
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:33.900]   And I don't mind up eating until seven, but that's okay.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.860]   I can just simply walk over, take the thing out of the bath, cut the bag open, put it
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.580]   in a plate, pour some salt on top of it, boom!
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:44.060]   Waterboy wants to know what temperature for a frozen burrito.
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:49.180]   My rule of thumb is that if it's a frozen commercial product, I don't know whether it's
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.740]   cooked inside or not, it's pre-cooked or not.
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.940]   165 degrees that will make it...
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:58.180]   That is the mouth temperature of piping hot and plus it will make sure that anything that
[01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.820]   is not cooked has definitely been cooked.
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:04.660]   If I were making meats myself, it would be about 129.
[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:09.300]   I did burgers for the 4th of July, pre-cooked them in the sous vait and then grill them.
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:11.460]   Those were about 129.
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:15.540]   That also points out the only other hazard of sous vie cooking is that if you post pictures
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:19.780]   of this wonderful, like, inch thick, deeply charred burger that you have, people say,
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:22.340]   "Oh my God, look, it's all pink and raw inside.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:23.340]   You're going to get so sick."
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.300]   It's like, "No, it's sous vie.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:28.900]   It's all been cooked to a beautiful medium-rare.
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:29.900]   It's perfectly okay.
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:34.900]   The first time you slice into a chicken breast, I say, "Oh, that's a little pink.
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:37.500]   I've been told that pink chicken will kill me."
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:42.460]   There is a book in junior high in home ec, I had a read that said, "Look, here is what
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:44.460]   undone chicken taste looks like.
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.460]   Don't eat it."
[01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:46.460]   And then you eat it.
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:47.460]   Oh.
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:48.460]   It stays pink.
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:50.300]   Now, even though it's up to 145 or whatever the safety is.
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:53.900]   That's the over 132 for an hour or something like that, it'll kill everything.
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:55.820]   Oh, length of time is key as well.
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:56.820]   Right.
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:00.500]   But the way that I explain is that imagine that you're a Bond villain and that the things
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.780]   that will make you sick are James Bond.
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:03.780]   You can either kill it.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:07.660]   You can either kill James Bond by shoving him into an active volcano.
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:08.660]   Yeah.
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:11.340]   And it doesn't matter how long he spends in that volcano, he is dead.
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:14.740]   That is the equivalent of putting a chicken in a conventional oven and pulling it out
[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:16.340]   at 165 degrees.
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:20.140]   At any length of time, if it's 165 degrees inside there, it's the things that are going
[01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:22.100]   to harm you or dead.
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:26.740]   Suvide is more like I'm waiting for him to finish his squash tournament.
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:28.940]   And now he's in the sauna at the gym.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:32.300]   And now I'm going to weld the door shut and turn the heat all the way up to high.
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:33.300]   Right.
[01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:36.180]   It's going to take about an hour and a half, two hours to die.
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:37.180]   But he's still going to be dead.
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:39.140]   He'll still be so thoroughly cooked.
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:40.140]   Right.
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:41.140]   All right.
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:42.140]   And which sealer do you use?
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:43.980]   What did I lose control of this stuff?
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:44.980]   I thought.
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:45.980]   Oh.
[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:46.980]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:47.980]   We clicked.
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:48.980]   Okay, sure.
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:49.980]   Let's upgrade back.
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:58.180]   I use whatever I use whatever model of food saver was discounted from $80 down to $53
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:13:59.180]   on some black Friday.
[01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:00.580]   I actually wanted to save money.
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:04.980]   I said, yeah, I don't want to have to spend a $0.23 every time I cook something to seal
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.180]   something in a bag.
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.780]   But then the sealer, I got a deal in the sealer.
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:14.500]   And then I realized that although I still use it's more convenient because now again,
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:19.620]   I can spend like one day on Sunday pretty much filling bags with things that I want to eat
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:20.620]   over the course of the week.
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:24.300]   I just realized that I'm putting meats, vegetables, sauces.
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:30.060]   And then it's like it's like I'm creating my own like, you know, my own frozen supermarket
[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:31.060]   dinners only.
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:33.060]   This is the Stackhouse filibuster for Macbreak weekly.
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:34.500]   We've got all the grandfathers.
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:35.500]   They were there before you.
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.500]   They'll be there after you.
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:39.300]   There's one thing that's said to take their turn at the month.
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:40.380]   Somebody said you don't kill.
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:41.700]   You don't kill the bacteria by heat.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.500]   It just dies of boredom.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:48.500]   So we're not like to read fantastic for five.
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:54.780]   Let's take a break.
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:59.980]   And when we come back, my machine will reboot and we can talk about there's still not that
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.140]   much to talk about, but I'm sure.
[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:02.140]   Oh, you know what?
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:05.940]   We got to talk about Qualcomm and you're going to explain to me why Apple's right.
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:10.500]   And Qualcomm's wrong because I'm starting to think Qualcomm has some merit in their case
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:11.500]   here.
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:12.500]   It is heating up.
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.740]   We'll talk about it in just a second.
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.380]   First though, let's talk about zip recruiter.
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:19.820]   If you're the person who does the hiring in your company, you have the most important
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:20.820]   job in your company.
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:24.500]   I know you probably, your pay does not probably reflect that, but it's true.
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.500]   A company, all a company is, Steve Jobs very famously said this.
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:36.820]   A company is the 20th century or the 19th century's most significant invention.
[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:41.620]   The idea that you could get a bunch of people together, align on a goal and use all that
[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:47.780]   brain power and skill together to make something no individual could make is immensely powerful.
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:53.580]   But it's made of people and the right people can make it all work beautifully, can make
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:54.580]   it home.
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:57.380]   The wrong people can bring it right down to the ground.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:00.940]   And that's why it's important to do your job and do it right now.
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:05.860]   Let's assume you got an opening, you know, and your company, whether you're the HR person
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:10.940]   or the maybe it's like me, you're the chief cooking bottle washer.
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:12.420]   Let's assume that right person's out there.
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:13.420]   How do you find them?
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:15.100]   Where are what job boards are they on?
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:16.540]   Where do they live?
[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:21.340]   Well, with Zipper Cruder, it doesn't matter because with Zipper Cruder, you're going to
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:27.500]   post to 100 plus job boards, all the social networks with one click of the mouse.
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.620]   So you're going to reach the most people.
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:32.020]   You're going to reach the right person.
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.460]   And now you're going to say, well, I got a massive haystack.
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:36.020]   How do I find that needle in the haystack?
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:40.780]   Well, the good news is those applications don't come to your email inbox.
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:41.780]   They don't come to your phone.
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:42.860]   They're not calling you.
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:45.540]   They all flow into the Zipper Cruder interface.
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:50.020]   Now you can pre-configure that interface with appropriate questions to help you screen
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.220]   the person.
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:54.060]   True, false, multiple choice, even essay questions.
[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:58.140]   You can rank them, rate them, and hire the right person fast.
[01:16:58.140 --> 01:16:59.300]   See that thumbs up, thumbs down.
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:01.060]   It's just that easy.
[01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:06.100]   So that means that you're going to have what you want, the most possible applicants and
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:07.660]   the easiest job of sifting through them.
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:12.420]   So you could find the thing you need the most, the right person for your job.
[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:14.860]   Zipper Cruder doesn't depend on candidates finding you.
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:19.180]   It finds them no wonder more than a million companies have used Zipper Cruder.

[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:43.020]   now.

[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:49.380]   the best candidates.

[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:02.020]   Twelve minutes remaining.
[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:04.060]   What was I thinking?
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:07.900]   It's by the way, just, if you're doing this, just a word of warning, if you sit and watch
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:14.500]   it, which you shouldn't, you should go pretend it's so feeding your, your, your Mac OS and
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:15.860]   go wander off.
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:17.660]   But it did did some scary things.
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:19.540]   It rebooted many, many times.
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:24.820]   The screen, I guess it was updating a video driver was doing weird stuff for a while.
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:27.780]   So be prepared for that if you're going to high Sierra.
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:29.420]   Best just not watch it, right, Renee?
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:32.020]   Just let it, let it do its thing unwatched.
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:33.020]   Yeah.
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:34.020]   Uh, Qualcomm.
[01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:35.540]   All right.
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:40.980]   So the latest is Qualcomm has gone to the US International Trade Organization, which despite
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:46.780]   its name really is the organization that terms what can be imported into the United States
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:54.420]   and asked that no Intel based iPhones, Intel radio based iPhones be imported into the United
[01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:55.420]   States.
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:57.020]   They're trying to have an embargo on that.
[01:18:57.020 --> 01:19:02.500]   Qualcomm of course makes the radios that have been in iPhones until the iPhone 7 for the
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.020]   first time Apple went to a second source.
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:07.540]   So they have some iPhone sevens with Qualcomm.
[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.780]   Those are the ones I think for the CDMA carriers.
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:13.200]   Well sort of Apple was originally using Infineon modems, which Intel bought.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.200]   So Intel now makes the Infineon based modems.
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.200]   Oh, I know that.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.200]   They switched to Qualcomm.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.540]   They switched to Qualcomm for CDMA because Qualcomm has like a jaw lock on CDMA.
[01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:22.740]   Well, they invented it.
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:23.740]   Yeah.
[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:25.860]   So Qualcomm's position is.
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:29.820]   We have at least six patents that are not frant patents.
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:35.220]   We can debate the frant patents too, but at least six patents that Apple uses and does
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:37.500]   not want to pay us for.
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.940]   And that seems like a compelling argument to me.
[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:47.460]   Apple for sure demands people who use their patents either licensed them or not use them.
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:50.020]   Why should Apple not have to license them from Qualcomm?
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:52.420]   I know Renee, you probably have a good argument.
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.420]   So let me hear it.
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:56.220]   I don't know if it's a good argument not because this is an issue.
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:57.220]   We've talked about it.
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:58.220]   It's complicated.
[01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:01.980]   It's complicated and it's also maddening and it's something that is horribly broken.
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:07.780]   But the gist of it is Qualcomm basically controls CDMA technology and that wouldn't matter except
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:12.540]   that Verizon and Sprint in the US are still deployed massive CDMA networks.
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.700]   It's all being replaced by LTE any day now.
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:16.020]   Yeah, we're just not there yet.
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:19.060]   But in other countries it has been replaced or they were using GSM to begin with.
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:23.060]   So it is only a problem that really affects people who want to use their phones on Verizon
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.060]   and Sprint.
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:27.580]   But if you want to offer a world phone which is very appealing to a lot of people, especially
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:30.540]   to a major market in the US and there is some CDMA in China.
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:34.140]   So especially the major markets, you need to use those Qualcomm patents.
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:39.900]   Now Apple was using Qualcomm modems but Qualcomm doesn't, Qualcomm wants to charge you what
[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:42.300]   is in essence a whole device licensing fee.
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.340]   That's my understanding at least the terms are super secret.
[01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:50.420]   Instead of having a flat fee to license the patent, they want a cut of every phone.
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:51.820]   Or a cut of just that part.
[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:55.020]   For example, if they're responsible for 10% of the phone, they would get profits based
[01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:56.260]   on that 10% of the phone.
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:58.780]   They want profits based on 100% of that phone.
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:02.420]   And some people have said it's based not on wholesale price but on retail price.
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:07.380]   And a good reflection of that is paying $130 more for a cellular iPad which Apple just carries
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:11.900]   on to the person because that is roughly, I believe, is probably inflated a little bit.
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:16.460]   But it's roughly what Qualcomm gets just for having you have the ability, sorry I'll back
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.300]   up because iPads still use the Qualcomm modem.
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:22.100]   All iPads use that one Qualcomm modem just for the ability to operate on Verizon in the
[01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:23.100]   US.
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:27.340]   Because they have a one single SIM multi-carrier solution on that.
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:28.340]   Totally.
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:31.020]   So everyone in the world is basically paying Qualcomm for the right to operate on Verizon
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:32.020]   and Sprint.
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:34.740]   And people outside the US obviously aren't super happy about that but it's the world
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:35.740]   that we live in.
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:40.660]   Now some of these patents are covered by Friend which is fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory.
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:44.300]   And that means that you are allowed to be the standard that everyone has to use because
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:48.080]   we want, it's like having different sized train tracks, no train could ever get anywhere.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:52.220]   If we agree to use your standard, you have to then license those things fairly reasonably
[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:57.780]   and non-discriminatory, not with no discrimination to everyone who wants to use that standard.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:02.340]   These patents aren't under Friend, it's arguable that they should be because they are essential
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:06.980]   to using that technology that everyone has agreed is the technology that we want to use.
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:10.220]   But essentially what Apple is arguing is that Qualcomm is not doing fair licensing, that
[01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:12.100]   they are trying to hold Apple and they're not alone.
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:13.100]   But they're not alone.
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.100]   They're not alone.
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:16.340]   They're not technically supposed to be Friend.
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:20.860]   No, but even the non-Friend ones, I believe Apple and some other countries like the US
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:22.620]   is not alone in looking at Qualcomm.
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:26.100]   China, I believe Korea are also looking at them because you're not allowed to abuse these
[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:27.100]   patents either.
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:29.620]   Even if they're not a Friend, you can't...
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:33.420]   My understanding is you can't abuse your strength in one position to force people and it's
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:37.540]   been alleged that they force people to do many other things in order to get this essentially
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:39.380]   irreplaceable technology.
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:41.380]   When Apple decided they no longer wanted to...
[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:43.900]   We would ever see the cost savings of that.
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:45.540]   Apple decided they no longer wanted to.
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:47.260]   We should get from their point of view be held ransom.
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:53.580]   In all likelihood, we're paying for this because they just pass along the costs to us.
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:55.900]   It raises the cost of the phone.
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:58.980]   So Apple doesn't want to do that because they're already expensive.
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:00.460]   They don't want to add the cost.
[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:02.340]   It's an edge case.
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:03.340]   Right.
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:05.300]   That's a good part for Apple.
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:11.940]   It's an edge case for something that people use occasionally and so they're paying a few
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:12.940]   price.
[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:14.980]   I would argue, sure it's an edge case, but you know what?
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:17.540]   That's the deal.
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:20.460]   Nobody's disputing that Qualcomm invented these technologies.
[01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:24.100]   They're not doing a patent roll thing or something like that.
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:27.460]   Yeah, I think it's against the two things.
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:30.580]   If Qualcomm is saying if you want to use our modems, you have to use our XYZ as well.
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:32.500]   That becomes a bigger problem.
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:38.700]   Also, if Qualcomm is charging exorbitant rates, there is some, I'm not a lawyer, so please
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:41.180]   do not hold me to any of this stuff.
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:44.540]   But there are ways of abusing it beyond just a simple friend abuse.
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:45.540]   Yeah.
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:47.380]   That's why friend exists.
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:52.980]   Basically, companies like Apple, the ability to say as soon as a company like Qualcomm theoretically
[01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:59.180]   goes a bit too far that puts a gun in Apple's hand to say, "Okay, look, we'll put up with
[01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:00.820]   this and then we put up with that.
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.460]   But now this is way too much."
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:07.820]   If your terms are unfair, if you're clearly not doing this in a restrictionary way, if
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:12.260]   you're truly abusing the fact that you are the only game in town, at this point, I have
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:14.140]   to tell you that no, we're not going to do that.
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.980]   So that's why that principle exists.
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:23.540]   I'm not sure that Qualcomm is innocent of violating the idea of friend.
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:27.180]   And for Qualcomm, they're trying to cash in as long as they can.
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:30.060]   Yeah, because so much is over for them, right?
[01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:34.540]   The importance of the patent as well as limits of the usage of it, at some point, Apple could
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:37.740]   decide that, "Well, we've decided that we're just not going to use it anymore because
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:41.820]   enough of the world has moved some other direction that's unlikely in the short term, but could
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:43.940]   be possible in the longer term."
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:46.060]   And I think that's where Apple would prefer to go.
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:50.660]   And so they're trying to make sure they get the most out of it before it's no longer useful.
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:51.660]   Yeah.
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:54.580]   I believe they want to pay Qualcomm based on the-- on Qualcomm's contribution to the overall
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:59.620]   device and not based on a very high rate on the entire cost of the device.
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:05.220]   So on this scale, like if the-- let's say the camera person is the same thing, we have
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:07.900]   an exclusive patent on taking photographs.
[01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:11.940]   You've got to pay us a-- not everybody can take 12% of the retail price of the phone.
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:15.740]   There'd be 180% of the cost of the phone very quickly.
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:16.740]   Yeah.
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:21.380]   But also just to clarify, this isn't a patent-troll sort of situation where they've patent something
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:22.900]   very, very broad.
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:27.220]   One of the reasons why the phone does not take off the way it did, was Qualcomm putting
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:31.620]   a lot of money into some basic technology that may or may not have paid off in the future
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:35.300]   back when phones were still a very dodgy proposition.
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:40.780]   And like Alex says, there's a reason why there's-- the patents are supposed to expire so that
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:46.140]   you can absolutely make hay while the sun is shining because at some point you're going
[01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:50.700]   to be-- you're going to be holding the rights to something that everybody can absolutely
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:52.900]   have access to and not pay you a cent for.
[01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:55.500]   So I don't think that's-- this is an evil thing that Qualcomm is doing.
[01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:58.460]   Yeah, I'm going to have to be necessarily sure that they're wrong.
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:01.780]   But I do think that this is a complex issue.
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:06.420]   And they benefited because the CDMA modems, they were not as-- what's the right word?
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:11.340]   They were not as good as GSM, but they had-- per tower, you could serve us a larger area.
[01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:15.100]   So it led-- and getting wafer and getting the ability to put your towers in many places
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:16.620]   was very hard, especially in the beginning.
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:20.700]   AT&T, I believe, had the army sprint had railways and they could put those up because
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:25.540]   this sprint was a railway company and Verizon was able to-- we're using CDMA technology,
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:30.180]   put up these EVDO and-- I forget what the name of the base technology was-- and serve
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:32.900]   as a much larger area than they would have been able to otherwise.
[01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:34.980]   So it benefited them the same way it benefited Bell and Telus.
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:39.900]   They just did not convert to GSM and HSPA as fast as some of the other countries did.
[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:41.820]   So we're sort of stuck with the legacy of that.
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:43.380]   Well, and it's also-- and we see things like this.
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:49.540]   I mean, the HEVC holdouts and why HEVC took so long to come out is specifically because
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:50.540]   of the licensing issues.
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:53.860]   This is a video compression technology in SMPEC 5.
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:57.340]   It's a huge jump from H264.
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:59.580]   And it's been around for quite some time now.
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:00.580]   A lot of us are waiting.
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:04.580]   We all have encoders that will do HEVC and no one's actually using it because no-- and
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:11.700]   also you have big, large companies that are doing CDNs that are wanting to use VP9 specifically
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:15.260]   because they don't want to pay for HEVC.
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:19.540]   And so these licensing things really hold up a lot of-- I'm not saying that they shouldn't.
[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:21.420]   There's a lot of people putting money into it.
[01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:27.180]   But that's what a lot of these platforms and so on and so forth are a lot of our costs
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:29.780]   that we pay as consumers are based on these.
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:33.260]   It's like a VAT.
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:35.140]   It's like industrial VAT.
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:43.620]   I stand-- I'll just say I don't have the technology, the brains or the information to
[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:45.300]   judge in this fight.
[01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:48.140]   But I'm not convinced Apple's right anymore.
[01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:49.140]   I think they can--
[01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:54.940]   I think they should execute it in the court and not try to be barring imports of the phone.
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:55.940]   I think--
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:28:01.260]   Well, but remember, Apple's withholding-- Apple's withholding like a billion dollars in payments.
[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:02.980]   It's hurting Qualcomm economically.
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:06.260]   I mean, Apple could-- whether there's merit in their case or not by withholding those
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:08.580]   payments could severely injure Qualcomm.
[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:10.060]   It's both weapons in their arsenal.
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:12.900]   Like, Apple doing that hopes to accelerate a deal.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:16.020]   Most of these companies, they have billions of dollars to litigate for as long as they
[01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:20.060]   want, the lawyers getting you and better Ferraris, and eventually like they just settled with
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:21.060]   Nokia.
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:23.380]   And those are lawsuits that have been going back and forth for a while.
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:26.660]   Either they will get to court and will have something like the Samsung Verdict happen,
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:29.260]   or they'll one day, like tomorrow, they'll be oppressed, releasing, "We've settled it
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:30.940]   and we've come to this and that terms."
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:34.860]   But right now, it's a lot of legal posturing.
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:46.180]   So you remember the Apple ad with the snail and the Intel chip?
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:49.740]   The Pentium 2 chip.
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:53.580]   Apple was talking about how slow Intel chips were.
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:59.580]   I think the Pentium 2 is the fastest processor in the world.
[01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:05.580]   Quite.
[01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:09.460]   The chip inside every new Power Macintosh G3 is up to twice as fast.
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:10.460]   Think different.
[01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:15.420]   Except, of course, Intel was furious and said that's not true.
[01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:23.980]   But Steve Jobs, there was no love shared with Intel and Steve Jobs.
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:24.980]   It's a lot.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:25.980]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:26.980]   An Apple.
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:29.820]   Quite a few ads in both directions.
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:32.980]   The reason I'm bringing this up, there's a great article.
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:37.940]   Ken Seagull and his Ken Seagull's Observatory of Watch, Fly and Technology and Marketing
[01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:40.820]   called Steve Jobs and the Missing Intel Inside sticker.
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:44.820]   I missed this when it first came out, but I think Carsten found it.
[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:48.860]   So Apple, you know, hell froze over, as we will remember.
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:52.940]   I was very upset about it at the time when Apple decided to dump the Power PC chips and
[01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:53.940]   go with Intel.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:56.940]   We were doing this show when that happened, I think.
[01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:57.940]   Maybe not.
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:59.620]   I thought it was a terrible idea.
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:01.700]   What year did they decide to first?
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:02.700]   2006.
[01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:04.180]   So yeah, it was Tiger, right?
[01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:05.180]   Yeah, it was 10 Tiger.
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.700]   We were doing this show.
[01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:08.900]   Code name Marklar for those South Park fans.
[01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:09.900]   Marklar.
[01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:12.260]   Is that a South Park reference?
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:13.860]   I think a South Park alien, isn't it?
[01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:14.860]   The aliens from South Park?
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:15.860]   I didn't know that.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:17.740]   See, this is what you get for not watching enough.
[01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:20.740]   The light bulb.
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:25.020]   Steve decided to go with Intel.
[01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:28.100]   And Ken Sigal says, "I approached him with my biggest concern.
[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:33.940]   Please, Steve, tell me we won't have to put the Intel inside logo on our Macs."
[01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:36.180]   Jobs looked him in the eye and said, "Trust me.
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:38.420]   I made sure that's in the contract."
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:44.380]   So to this day, when you buy a Windows machine, it almost invariably has an Intel inside sticker,
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:46.900]   which you have to peel off and then get the goo off.
[01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:47.900]   It's very annoying.
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.460]   Most people just leave it.
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:51.620]   Yeah, people do and it surprises me.
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:57.940]   And there's a Windows 10 logo on it to surprise me because I just find that it sticks up.
[01:30:57.940 --> 01:30:59.300]   It's annoying.
[01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:07.540]   Well, Steve did not want that on his beautiful Mac and Tasha's.
[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:16.020]   But they did have a photograph of a processor with the Intel corporate logo on the box.
[01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:19.320]   One of the designs shared with Steve placed the Intel chip apart from the other features
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:21.040]   under the large iMac image.
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:22.700]   Steve hated it.
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:26.680]   He felt Intel was an important part of the computer, but no more important than their
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:28.320]   other features.
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:33.040]   He preferred simply adding Intel to the feature list on the side of the box.
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:36.000]   It's just one more reason to buy a Mac, but not the reason.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:44.320]   He was not willing to siphon off any brand value to Intel.
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:48.120]   And a great inside story by Ken Sigal.
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:49.120]   Thank you.
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:52.160]   I think that's how he wanted them to get rid of the Apple logos in the interface because
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:53.800]   there was too many and it was devaluing the brand.
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:56.480]   And then wanted to see one or two strategically positioned.
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:57.480]   That makes sense.
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:58.480]   Very brand conscious.
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.680]   Yeah, you can say something too often.
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:03.320]   And then people get become immune to it.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:07.920]   Although putting it on the back of the computer like this is probably the best out of all.
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.880]   Yeah, especially when they were glowing on other people's press conferences.
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:14.640]   Yeah, at the Microsoft press conference is all the glowing apples in the front row.
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:16.560]   It was never a good thing.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:17.560]   Not for Microsoft.
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:19.080]   Steve loved it.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:20.080]   I love that story.
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:23.080]   Sigal was a marketing guy at Next.
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.080]   Oh, great.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:26.080]   And that Apple.
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:37.080]   Tomorrow, we should mention, is a day of action for net neutrality because, of course, as
[01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:39.440]   you know, the FCC is right now trying to over.
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:41.800]   Now, let me stop this auto play video.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:45.600]   I want to do it a day of action against auto play video.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:46.600]   Can we do that?
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:48.760]   Safari doesn't for you in the new in I see era.
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:50.920]   That would not have happened if you were running high Sierra.
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.600]   I am running high Sierra.
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:53.600]   So what Safari?
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.400]   Oh, I'm running Chrome.
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.400]   Damn it.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.400]   I got to switch over to Safari now.
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:02.120]   By the way, yes, I am running high Sierra.
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.520]   But not.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:16.200]   So the day of action is to get everybody to write to the FCC and say, please.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:19.480]   The current comment period lasts until July 17th.
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:21.360]   And then there's a second round.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.920]   There's the website.
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:26.240]   Please everybody participate.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.440]   Write your member of Congress.
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:34.080]   I'm a kind of a fan of net neutrality because without it, I seriously doubt Twitter would
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:35.080]   exist.
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:40.720]   Well, the checkbox for having I have a large technology following or yeah, I check that
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:41.720]   I check that.
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:42.720]   Yeah.
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:45.560]   Save the internet.com.
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:46.680]   You can take action.
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:48.720]   You can find out more about it.
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:52.920]   And I should let you know you can sign the petition, whatever it is.
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:56.560]   You make a call to your Congress, Twitter, tweet it.
[01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:58.360]   That's the least.
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:01.160]   That's the slacktivist choice.
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.560]   But so tomorrow is the big day.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:05.520]   And I just want a word of warning.
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.840]   We are going to participate in it.
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:10.080]   We're not going to go dark though.
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:14.120]   We're going to do the same thing we did during the soap up protest some years ago.
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:16.160]   We're going to be in black and white.
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:18.160]   So if you tune in.
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.160]   That's awesome.
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.400]   Yeah, I think that was kind of appropriate.
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:29.240]   What a lot of sites will do, some big sites too, is slow you down, show a spinning thing
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.080]   and saying this is what the internet will be like.
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:37.080]   If the reason net neutrality is important because we can compete with the big boys.
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:41.960]   We can stream video to you at the same speed as Netflix and YouTube and everybody else
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:46.160]   because the internet doesn't discriminate against bits currently.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:52.720]   But you know Comcast and AT&T and Verizon, which is love to make a little extra bucks
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:56.760]   by charging people that have high speed access to you.
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:02.080]   Thereby disenfranchising people like us who couldn't afford to pay.
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:08.320]   Net neutrality is about to go away and we've got at least let them know it's a big deal.
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:10.800]   So I think it blunted.
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:16.320]   The online attack blunted the last push against this.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:17.600]   Oh, by far.
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:22.320]   I mean, no question at all.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:25.120]   There are only two things that scare a congressperson.
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:29.800]   One is the Koch brothers under running the campaign of somebody else and the other is
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:32.080]   actual phone calls and letters to the office.
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:38.240]   So don't just, this will be useful but your congresspeople have phone numbers call there
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:39.240]   office.
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.080]   That's the most effective thing you can do.
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:46.840]   Well, because that wasn't you wasting five seconds in between Reddit and Facebook.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:50.600]   This is you actually have to find out how your phone works once again to make an analog
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.440]   voice call and calling it.
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:55.920]   It really does have a bigger impact.
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:59.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:08.960]   If you need to know more, eff has a lot of stuff eff.org, savetheinternet.com, participate,
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:10.280]   be an activist in this case.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.280]   I think it's quite important.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:15.560]   Is there anything international people can do?
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.400]   Can we just pretend to be Americans for the day?
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:19.560]   Yeah, I think you know the thing is...
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:20.560]   Oh, bandwagon.
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:22.760]   You're going to be affected by what we do here, right?
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:23.760]   Totally.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:26.760]   So, yeah, I guess you can't really call a member of congress.
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:32.160]   We'll stop spending money on American companies unless you give us an open internet.
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:37.720]   We wouldn't have title two regulation of net neutrality if it weren't for all the million
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:42.440]   and a half plus comments that the previous chairman of the FCC, Tom Wheeler, got last
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:49.080]   year because of people like Colbert and many sites protesting.
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:53.400]   Soap would be the law of the land if it weren't for the protests a couple of years ago.
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:56.880]   I think, yeah, you're absolutely right, Andy.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:03.080]   If you want to dilute or even...
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:07.520]   Okay, next week, the day against auto play video.
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.680]   I'm telling you, we got it.
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:09.680]   We're all going to use Safari.
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:12.080]   We're all going to use Safari.
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:16.040]   But if you want to blunt the effect of money in politics, money only buys votes.
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:17.040]   That's the value of the money.
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:20.040]   So you could buy ad campaigns, you can influence voters.
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:23.720]   If the voters speak up, that carries more weight than anything.
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.720]   So speak up.
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:26.720]   Speak up.
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:29.480]   Yeah, it's too bad because...
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:33.160]   I don't know.
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:38.640]   We now have an FCC chairman that is very aware of the cognizant of the problems with
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:40.760]   internet access right now.
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:44.920]   Enough of them to at least invoke them when speaking of the reasons to eliminate, or
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:47.160]   his reasons to eliminate net neutrality.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:51.880]   I hope that A, this change in net neutrality dies, dies, dies.
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:57.880]   But I hope that he's actually sincere about making sure that rural broadband and broadband
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:03.600]   to lower income communities remains a focus of his because that is another emerging tech
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.960]   crisis in our country that we need to address.
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:09.600]   Yeah, there was a story this morning that Microsoft...
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.560]   Well, I kind of misread the story.
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:19.440]   And you might have to, unveils $10 billion rural air push for rural broadband internet.
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:22.240]   But Microsoft's not chipping in $10 billion.
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:25.480]   They're just pushing for other people to do the same thing.
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:27.440]   I wasn't aware of that story.
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.440]   But that is...
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:29.440]   That's what we need to do.
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.440]   That's what we need to do.
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:31.440]   It's just wrong a word.
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:34.680]   But we can't ignore the fact that while we talk about, "Hey, look, this company's creating
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:39.000]   a cajillion dollar spaceship campus, and look, this other company is doing this, that
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.800]   the other, we can't ignore the fact that there are school systems that still just don't
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:44.280]   have access to the internet."
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:50.240]   23.4 million Americans lack high speed internet access because they live in rural areas.
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:55.400]   And that means cutting off access to education, cutting off access to jobs because go to a
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:39:01.080]   public library for a couple of hours and hang out near the public internet kiosks terminals.
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:07.360]   And you will see people using it mostly to look for jobs online and to Skype interviews
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.960]   and stuff like that online.
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:10.960]   And so it really is...
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:16.120]   It's not quite at the same level of cutting off a community from electricity and clean
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:19.120]   water, but it's in the same rough category.
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:23.720]   And it's not a problem that's going to solve itself.
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:27.460]   It's not a problem that's going to solve itself by this part of the industry becoming
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:31.760]   more profitable and companies like Comcast and Verizon wanting to chase up after that
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:38.640]   wonderful money of companies where there are counties where there is high levels of unemployment.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:42.120]   This is going to be a thing where whoever it is and who is in charge of our national
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:47.680]   internet service, such as perhaps the FCC, makes that a priority and takes active measures
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:52.000]   to make sure that every kid who needs access to the internet can find access to the internet,
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.600]   even if it's not necessarily inside their own house, at least inside their own towns.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:02.000]   What Microsoft is proposing, which is kind of interesting, is using television white space,
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:11.600]   unused television bandwidth to wire 12 states by next year and connect 2 million people over
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:12.600]   the next five years.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:15.720]   They call it the Rural Air Band initiative.
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:18.160]   It's a form of wireless internet.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:20.600]   So Microsoft is contributing considerable amount.
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:21.600]   I just...
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.240]   Not $10 billion.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:31.280]   Testing everybody using TV white space technology would cost between $10 billion and $15 billion.
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:37.600]   So there's a significant investment required, but it is so important, I agree.
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:41.360]   So they're trying to get some government money, some private money to do that.
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:44.120]   So well done.
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:46.760]   And we wish you best.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:54.120]   And the funny thing is AT&T is joining tomorrow's protest.
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.520]   This is from TechDirt.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:00.920]   AT&T pretends to love net neutrality and joins tomorrow's protest with a straight face.
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:07.360]   I shall close myself in the robes with my enemy and walk amongst them.
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:08.640]   Oh, I like it.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:09.640]   What's that from?
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:10.640]   I don't know.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:11.640]   It just sounds good.
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:21.320]   In fact, it was AT&T who kind of started the debate back in 2005 when their CEO at the
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:27.400]   time had Whitacre said, "We're not going to let Google ride my pipes for free."
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:28.400]   Wow.
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:29.400]   Mm-hmm.
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:30.400]   You Google you...
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:31.400]   Possible show title?
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:32.400]   That's a show title.
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:33.400]   So that's a candidate.
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.400]   I think we should discuss that one.
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:36.400]   Ride my pipes for free.
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:39.800]   Ride your pipes for free.
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:40.800]   Let's see.
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:42.080]   Let's talk about...
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:47.240]   You can preserve the national parks when you use your Apple Pay just yet another reason
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:50.760]   to use Apple Pay between now and the 15th.
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:54.000]   So hurry up and go buy something.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.600]   For every Apple Pay transaction from any Apple Store, Apple.com or the App Store in
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:02.400]   the US, Apple will donate $1 to the National Park Foundation.
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:04.360]   I should have told you about this earlier.
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:07.600]   So buy each piece of vegetable separately.
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:08.600]   Yeah.
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:12.200]   It has to be an Apple Store, Apple.com or the App Store in the US.
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:13.200]   Oh, okay.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.520]   You can't use it for veggies.
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:17.400]   Unless Apple starts selling veggies in the Apple Store at all.
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:20.160]   They miss their opportunity to buy whole foods.
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:21.760]   This was a stat that...
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:24.160]   You've got everybody panicked.
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:25.160]   Apple buys whole foods.
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:26.160]   Wait a minute.
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:27.600]   It's a buy a blue bottle.
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:28.840]   I'll put it in every genius bar.
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:29.840]   Ooh, I like that.
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:30.840]   Why isn't there a coffee shop?
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:31.840]   Or fills.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:32.840]   Or fills.
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:33.840]   Just put fills in every genius bar.
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.560]   The Apple Store should have a coffee shop.
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:36.560]   Yeah.
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:39.800]   I just like having a coffee.
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:42.920]   This headline got me excited, but maybe not everybody.
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:50.960]   Nielsen says on demand audio streaming hits record high as up 62.4% over last year.
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:56.280]   And I think everybody assumes it's Spotify and Apple music, but no, just audio.
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:59.960]   So it could be podcasts.
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:05.160]   I don't know how much podcasts contributed to this, but I think it's some, right?
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:10.360]   Audio of any kind, audio listening of any kind.
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:17.160]   Ed Sheeran's shape of you was the top on demand song during this timeframe.
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:21.360]   Two million downloads, 4.35 million units streamed.
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:22.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:23.880]   And one of the things that's...
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:26.080]   As this becomes the norm and as we really...
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:28.880]   As this becomes the largest part of the industry, I think a lot of the checks that a lot of
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:30.960]   these folks are gonna get much more reasonable.
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:35.320]   I was talking to an artist that I'll leave unnamed that has a lot of stuff on Spotify.
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:39.040]   And they said that they actually make a lot of money on Spotify.
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:41.360]   See, that's important because we always have this impression.
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:42.360]   They make nothing.
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:43.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:46.000]   They say they don't make anything because they own their tracks on Spotify.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.960]   The studio is making something for everybody else.
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:49.960]   Yeah.
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:50.960]   Yeah.
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:51.960]   I said the problem is going through the studio and getting paid for that.
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:52.960]   It's not the...
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:58.760]   If you're the owner of the actual content, which is more and more doable now than it ever
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:43:59.760]   has been.
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:07.920]   It does provide less and less impact on sales that you actually can do fairly well, at least
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:09.960]   according to the artist I was talking to.
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:13.480]   So Nielsen doesn't break down in this stat.
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:17.720]   Audio includes spoken word as well as in podcasts as well as music.
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:19.080]   They don't break it down.
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:25.040]   But a prior figure from Nielsen said that monthly podcast conception doubled over the
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:27.040]   last five years among adults.
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:28.040]   So that's good.
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:29.040]   I'm glad to hear that.
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.040]   Yes.
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.040]   I like to think it's all back.
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:32.040]   You're welcome.
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:33.040]   Yes.
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:34.040]   You're welcome Internet.
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:35.040]   Yes.
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:36.040]   And you know what?
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:39.040]   It's with all of these segments we do in which we install a system update and just have
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:41.040]   to talk about the book over it.
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:46.240]   There's been a lot of time talking about ZuV and middle of a Mac show.
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:49.760]   Our ad sales department is awaiting your phone call with tech source Snapchat, so I'm
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:51.760]   ready.
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:55.440]   Nielsen's streaming hit a high point of seven and a half billion weekly on-demand audio
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:58.560]   streams the week of March 9th this year.
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:04.720]   Most time it had ever topped seven billion on-demand audio has been streamed over 184
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:07.120]   billion times so far in 2017.
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:12.520]   That's the 62.4% increase on-demand audio and video streams.
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:17.280]   Of course we do both have surpassed 284 billion streams this year.
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:18.800]   That's a 36% increase.
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:25.120]   I you know, I know a lot of this is Netflix and Spotify and Apple, but I have to think
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:28.880]   that we're a little bit of it.
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:32.200]   The podcasts in general are a little bit not this show particularly, but there's a little
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:34.560]   bit of there's a little bit of show particularly.
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:35.560]   Why not?
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:37.280]   Don't throw a basket over our light.
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:38.280]   Come on.
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:40.040]   Don't know if it'll happen.
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:45.920]   We mentioned that Apple might exceed a trillion dollar of value over the next 12 months.
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:49.760]   Samsung may beat Apple in quarterly profit for the first time.
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:52.320]   Is it Samsung mobile or the entire kidding?
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:55.320]   That's the thing.
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:58.320]   I don't think it's Samsung.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.320]   This is a CNBC analyst consensus.
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:01.320]   Let me see.
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:02.320]   Let me see if we can break that down.
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:07.320]   I hate going to CNBC because they always have autoplay video on their site.
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:09.320]   It's Samsung electronics.
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:11.320]   So it's, yeah.
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:17.320]   So they're set to report 11.5 billion profit in Q2.
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:20.480]   Apple's 10.49 billion.
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:24.120]   It'd be the first time Samsung's profit would be higher than Apple.
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:27.440]   Ironically, some of that is probably manufacturing components.
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.920]   It's OLED displays that Apple's buying.
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:30.920]   And chipsets.
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:33.520]   I mean, they manufacture like all a lot of.
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:40.080]   And we really ought to celebrate in honor of Renee Richie, the one year anniversary of
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:42.080]   Pokemon Go.
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:43.080]   Okay.
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:44.760]   I wrote a review yesterday.
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:45.760]   Yep.
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:48.280]   My first game review since Letterpress.
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:51.360]   What was the actual release date?
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:52.360]   I know it was in July.
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:54.080]   July 7th, I think.
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:55.080]   Okay.
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:56.080]   We went crazy.
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:58.120]   That's all we talked about for months.
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:00.120]   I mean, there were people flooding the streets.
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:01.120]   It was hard to ignore.
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:02.120]   It was very hard.
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:06.360]   I've seen some of the finest minds of my generation, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:13.240]   And what's sad is that this was a very popular game, but they, I think they did not improve
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:15.960]   it fast enough to keep a lot of users using it.
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.160]   It's still very popular though, right?
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:20.760]   Did you see that graph that they revealed about what they, what they built for, what
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:24.240]   the worst case scenario they thought was and what the actual load that he was?
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:25.240]   No, no.
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:26.240]   Yeah.
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:29.080]   They said that they, they planned for I think two or three times what they actually expected
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:30.960]   and got something like a hundred to 200 times.
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:34.080]   So they couldn't really roll out new features as fast as they liked.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:38.600]   No, there was an interesting interview with John Hanke, who's the CEO of NianTech.
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:39.600]   And he's NianTech.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:40.600]   Sorry.
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.720]   And he said like all their plans got thrown back six months because all they had to
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:47.600]   take all their resources, devote that to infrastructure and just completely rewrite everything that
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.400]   they had been working on.
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:50.400]   Interesting.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:51.400]   Interesting.
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:52.400]   Well, I'm not surprised.
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:56.240]   Yeah, it's been, this was an article in the Verge, I think that they interviewed.
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:57.240]   Yes.
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.240]   Thank you.
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:47:59.240]   Yeah.
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:02.760]   Well, there have added new features now, right?
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:03.760]   There's some.
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:04.760]   It's amazing.
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:08.560]   So like you, there's these things called raids now where like previously you would battle
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:10.400]   over gyms and different teams would battle over them.
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:13.960]   And now like all the teams can come together and fight these raids.
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:16.840]   And what's interesting is you get one free raid a day and you've got to pay a dollar
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:18.080]   for every other one.
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:22.800]   And even in my small little suburban community, there's 20 to 30 people in the rain fighting
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:25.200]   these raids and going from one to the other.
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:29.520]   And if I multiply that math out over like my city and then my province, then my country
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:33.360]   and then all countries, it's like it's a license to print money all over again.
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:40.120]   So, so your sense is people, at least in Montreal are still using this game as much
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:41.120]   as ever.
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:45.000]   They still have a pretty, I think in the US, it's even more popular and in some other
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.400]   countries, it's far more popular and it's a beloved franchise.
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:51.640]   It's uses AR, it uses real location.
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:53.040]   People have a sense of getting out.
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:56.880]   Now the new system promotes a lot of what they want, which is social cooperative gameplay.
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:00.040]   So you have a group of 20 or 30 people who'd never seen each other before, suddenly working
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:02.200]   together to solve a problem.
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:04.280]   And a lot of people seem to really enjoy that.
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:08.080]   So I think as long as they could do it again with maybe Harry Potter and magical creatures
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:09.080]   or something.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:13.080]   I think it was a good combination of the advent of AR with a, again, a beloved childhood
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.080]   franchise.
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:16.880]   Well, happy birthday, Pokemon Go.
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:21.360]   You know, I don't play it all the time, but I still, you know, I'll fire it up once.
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:24.160]   And while I listen, I'm both will fire it up once and while still a lot of fun.
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:26.000]   It really has got to go in a raid.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.080]   So how do you get raiding?
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:33.000]   So when you open up the app, there's a tab next to the whatever Pokemon are nearby.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.360]   There's a tab called raids and it'll show you what raids are in your area.
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:38.520]   And there's level one, two, three and four right now.
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:41.560]   There'll be a fifth level legendary raids later, but you just see that.
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:44.880]   And you know, for a level one raid, you can maybe will do it on your own two people, a
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:48.240]   level two raid, probably two or three people, a level four raid.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.400]   Some people can do it on their own, but maybe four or five people.
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:53.880]   And then for the level four raids, we usually have like six, seven, eight, nine, ten people.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:57.000]   I feel like I'm in a disadvantage because I haven't played.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.400]   And so I don't have the strong in a while.
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:00.640]   So I have the strongest.
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:02.760]   That's what you get from raids though.
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:06.840]   I mean, you have a chance to get a Snorlax or a Tyranitar or a Lapras right away from winning
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:07.840]   the raid.
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:09.040]   And then catching it afterwards.
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:11.040]   Not something to be ignored.
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:13.040]   No, not something to be sneezed at.
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:14.720]   Don't sneeze at that Snorlax.
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:15.720]   No.
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:18.760]   Let's take a break when we come back unless anybody has something we haven't talked about
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:20.120]   you wanted to bring up.
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:26.400]   I think we've covered the big stories and quite a few of the off topic stories.
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:31.400]   What is the name of that Suvi that I bought?
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:32.400]   The Mellow.
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:33.400]   Mellow.
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:35.520]   It had such a great name.
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:37.520]   I don't know.
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:40.080]   See, the only it was a great idea.
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:44.040]   I don't know if you wanted the if they have a manufacturer wants to create the Conde Shurje
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:46.040]   in if it's yellow, let it mellow.
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:48.880]   Yeah, that wasn't maybe the best.
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:49.880]   But I didn't think of that.
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:50.880]   I.
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:51.880]   Yeah, well, not now.
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:52.880]   No, I do.
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:54.640]   Now I will.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:56.280]   So it looks like I can order it.
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:51:00.240]   But when does it.
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:02.960]   Oh, off last chance at early bird pricing.
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:07.120]   That was an early bird like two years ago.
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:09.760]   So maybe we're getting close.
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:11.920]   Fingers crossed.
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:18.760]   I would I would I would not not not cancel your delivery of home delivery of stuff to
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:20.560]   then but yes, let's put it this way.
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:25.000]   I ordered on Amazon a bunch of silicone.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.240]   So V bag so I could reuse them and they wouldn't have any, you know, bad chemicals
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:30.240]   in them.
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:32.760]   I have I've lost them months ago.
[01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:36.560]   I don't know where they see this.
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:40.640]   The last thing I'll say about two feet in this show is that I would not use those things
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:45.240]   because I again, I am I'm going to get a vacuum ceiling.
[01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:47.360]   I like I like to cut open the bag.
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:52.240]   Dump the bag onto the plate and then throw away every item that I cooked with.
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:53.240]   Right.
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:54.920]   No, no dishes to wash.
[01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:55.920]   You're right.
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:57.080]   Washing washing out a silicone bag.
[01:51:57.080 --> 01:51:59.720]   I don't care about the environment to that extent.
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:01.720]   Oh, that have to do it.
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:04.040]   What did you like the vacuum sealer you got?
[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:05.040]   Is it a food sale?
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:06.040]   What kind did you get?
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:10.560]   It's a it's the cheapest like 50 it was like 50 something dollars on sale.
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:12.320]   I think it's normally like 70 bucks.
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:16.160]   The more expensive ones actually you don't have to use pre-made bags.
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:20.440]   You can actually load up a roll of bag material and then this peel off.
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:21.440]   However much you need.
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:25.000]   And we know that these are safe and sous vide.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.840]   I haven't been killed yet.
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:27.840]   None of the bad.
[01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:28.840]   But you could have cancer.
[01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:33.840]   They've tried.
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:40.160]   There is a prime deal right now on the Crenova VS 100 vacuum sealing system 69.
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:43.080]   It's not such a great deal though.
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:44.080]   I don't know.
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:45.200]   I don't know about that one.
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:47.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:51.920]   The great thing about vacuum seals is that it does mean that again I'll buy like a pack
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:56.720]   of hot dogs and half of them go into the freezer or there'll be a sale on something
[01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:00.320]   that I like that I can't eat all in 10 days for an idea.
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:05.880]   You bag it up and it goes and even like just every time I I'll seal up a I'll buy some
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:11.080]   cheese seal up in a bag and just now less effectively forever because it's there's no
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:12.080]   air getting into it.
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:13.080]   So that was a good buy.
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:14.080]   Yeah.
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:19.920]   Well it sounds like mellow shipping this month unless they mean July 2018.
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:23.680]   So even if you end up with to Leo you'll learn to use both of them.
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:24.680]   Because it's an anti-depress.
[01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:25.680]   It'll just be like oh my god.
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:29.040]   Get the ANOVA and then I'll be ready to do the mellow.
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:30.040]   You can make them fight.
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:32.040]   You mean fight?
[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:37.600]   I showed it a brought to you by something I am glad I purchased and I continue to purchase
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:43.720]   more all the time at the Drobo store of course my lovely Drobo and you know they have not
[01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:44.720]   sat still.
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:49.120]   Drobo was created kind of when the founder some time ago suffered a hard drive crash
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:52.040]   on his rate array and he thought well I'm I should never lose data.
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:56.360]   I'm on raid and he realized that raid as implemented on most computers these days is
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:54:00.760]   not as as robust as one might hope.
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:08.760]   So he created beyond raid and Drobo's designed to protect your important data forever and
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:09.920]   they've got a new one.
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:12.680]   They just they you know I love art.
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:14.400]   I use the Drobo mini all the time.
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:16.040]   That's my main boot drive.
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:20.840]   I have a five N which is my you know I use it as a network attached storage.
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:24.560]   They've just released the 5d3.
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:26.120]   I'm very excited about this.
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:32.600]   This is their third generation 5 bay direct attached storage.
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:38.440]   So this is the ultimate in you know high speed storage not a network device but attached
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:44.240]   to your computer for people like Alex Lindsay who make massive videos people who have a
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:53.480]   lot to back up photographers thunderbolt 3 baby USB type seaports 2x performance boost.
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:57.640]   You can because it's got thunderbolt 3 and pass through you could it supports a 5k display
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:02.720]   or 2 4k displays as pass through.
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:07.840]   It's of course got all of the great Drobo features including the accelerator bay on
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:13.880]   all my Drobo's I buy those I buy you don't need a big one a 64 gig M SATA card that you
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:19.400]   put in the bottom there and that really speeds up right some small files reads of small files
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:26.280]   5d3 be ideal for editing and storing photos and videos for your 5 and 4k workflows backing
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:32.480]   up of course all your personal and business data and it comes with a two year warranty.
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:38.160]   You can this is an awesome awesome new Drobo and as with all the Drobo's it's those lights
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:44.280]   on front and the magnetic panel you can pull right off that make it so easy to add drives
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:50.400]   and the lights tell you how your drives this is a 5 bay unit so you see all the green lights
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:54.520]   when you start to run out of space on one of the drives it shows you which drive to
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:59.960]   replace the smallest drive yes you can mix drive sizes without any issue and you just
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:05.840]   pop the small drive and you put in a bigger drive and you it automatically incorporates
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:12.680]   it and you're good to go here's the little em SATA add on in the bottom when you buy the
[01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:18.840]   Drobo 5d3 you'll also get this beautiful skin look at that isn't that pretty on the

[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:11.600]   three Drobo store you know that in 10 years sorry 10 years ago will be like it'll be
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:15.840]   it'll be like 10 years it'll be like remember back when's when I bought 64 terabytes that
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:23.040]   was a lot when I bought when I bought my my 2ci I bought 122 megabytes of hard drive space
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:26.320]   I know and someone asked like what are you gonna do with all that space and I'm like
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:32.080]   I'm doing audio man I'm doing audio I need that space I got the bits yeah get the bits
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:38.400]   you don't want to know what we paid for our sand oh my god what a waste of money that
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:43.280]   was well as long as we're talking Thunderbolt 3 can I make my pick first I never start but
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:48.360]   I ordered this is another one of those things I ordered ages ago from other world computing
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:54.520]   it's right here it's all plugged in it's the new under the new Thunderbolt 3 dock I thought
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:59.960]   at the time there would be a lot more max using Thunderbolt 3 by now a little disappointed
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:06.160]   but it does work with the 2017 iMac and I'm using it with my 2016 MacBook Pro that has
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:12.000]   this is the one with two Thunderbolt 3 ports which is kind of a drag except when I hook
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:18.760]   up the port to the other world computing dock all the ports yeah I got all the ports it's
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:26.480]   plugged in so it's powering you know the the laptop I've got gigabit ethernet I've got
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:33.440]   firewire 800 Alex I bet you have a few fire wide devices still lying around optical video
[01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:43.600]   1 2 3 4 5 USB 3.1 Type A connector ports this is analog audio and there's an SD card
[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:48.560]   slot as well this is a great dock you sit down it comes with the Thunderbolt cable so
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:55.040]   you just sit down and you go oh let's plug that in we're driving right now not only you
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:59.240]   know powering the MacBook but we're also driving the display so that you can see the screen
[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:06.120]   it will drive a 5k display or 2 4k displays that's just the general limit on the on the
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:14.400]   Thunderbolt 3 you can not only connect a 6 USB 3.1 devices but it will charge all of them
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:22.680]   I think it goes up to 4.2 amps it works with your legacy firewire storage it's got a DAC
[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:28.400]   in it so you've got analog out and in by the way so you can hook up your speakers to it
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:36.120]   I mean this is kind of an ideal dock 299 they announced this I'm not kidding a long time
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:43.800]   ago I love other other world computing stuff and I ordered it at the time and I just got
[01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:49.120]   it yesterday so it's they still say pre-order but I think they're shipping now so you can
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:53.120]   you can get it now and if you need this would be for somebody like Alex or somebody who wants
[01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:57.720]   to use either a laptop you know what the new one of the new MacBook Pros and wants to be
[01:59:57.720 --> 02:00:01.600]   able to carry it around but then sit down and have all of the connectivity and the power
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:08.080]   of a desktop or if you have the new iMac Thunderbolt 3 is I just can't believe it has
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:13.360]   firewire I need it just for the firework right yeah yeah and people and people think
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:17.880]   that Thunderbolt 3 don't don't cut to me because I don't have the camera camera on the thing
[02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:22.000]   my pick of the week so it's gonna look like a talking piece of hardware there you go talking
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:29.000]   about hello hello I like to speak up in half a man do you have a shitty bird hurt
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:35.360]   it is a light bling sink people did people think that thunderbolt 3 is an apple thing
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:40.240]   but it's actually a brand new well and that's I have it for Intel that it's going to control
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:44.680]   everything I haven't tried this yet because I have a number of Windows devices that have
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:50.040]   thunderbolt 3 and I haven't tried it but I think you need drivers I suspect it's not
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:54.480]   gonna work at least not fully work with a Windows device and you don't want to use it
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:57.540]   I think with a thunderbolt 2 device I think this is really for people who have the new
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:01:02.560]   Macbook Pros or the new Mac iMac the MacBook I think no that's not a little bit won't
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:06.600]   do it on the Macbook even although I should try it with the Macbook you know I apologize
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:12.480]   I haven't but the but the way they describe it at Macsales.com their website is this is
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:19.160]   specifically for the new Mac book pros of the new iMac but I like it I mean if you need
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:23.520]   all that connectivity I like it and it charges I would so I'm I've enjoyed one I just haven't
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:26.920]   got it yet you should get it soon I think you're in Canada so maybe you'll get it in
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:34.840]   the fall I like the firewire and you can daisy chain the firewire of course anyway that's
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:41.840]   my pick of the week if you need it get it why don't you give us something Renee so mine
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:46.640]   is actually self-serving but it is time appropriate there is we have a website it's not technically
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:50.920]   part of mobile nations but it's owned by the same people who are mobile nations called thrifter.com
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:55.080]   and they have just gotten a huge redesign in time for Amazon Prime Day and what they're
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:59.760]   doing they're a little bit nutty they are obsessed about deals and they spent 30 hours
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:06.000]   live blogging what all of them have 30 hours live blogging nice Prime Day trying to find
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.880]   the best deals are posting the ones that have a shelf life but the other ones they're tweeting
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:13.440]   and they're just doing in the live blog and they really care about quality and they really
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:17.200]   care about value and they really care about the sort of things that we as geeks sort of
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:20.480]   really care about so they're doing they're doing the work of going through everything
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:23.520]   that Amazon is posting and they do this every day not just on Prime Day they go through
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:27.280]   Amazon and Best Buy and they try to find what's really a good what's really a valuable
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:30.920]   it's really a legitimate deal and then they just surf us all of those on Twitter and on
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:35.080]   the newly redesigned thrifter.com which is based off the same sort of technology that
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:40.720]   I'm more is is now based on and this so this is the E-cam that you recommended a while
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:47.000]   ago and he which I bought his R is a big deal on Prime Day so there you go this is good
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.000]   it really helps to have something like this if you're going to buy something on Prime
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:54.480]   Day so you do buy things that you're saving on.
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:59.440]   Yeah this was the brainchild of Kevin Mitchell look he wanted he who pays way too much money
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:02.720]   for stuff and he said there's no way for me to stop buying so I just want to get the best
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:05.080]   price when I do.
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:10.280]   Very nice thrifter.com Andy you have a box on your desk.
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:18.240]   Yes this is my brand new CD DVD Blu-ray drive and yes you're going to think why does anybody
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:20.520]   on earth need an optical drive.
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:25.920]   Well because I use it almost entirely just to ingest CDs and DVDs and Blu-rays into
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:32.000]   my media library and I've had you can sort of see them in the corner of the screen I had
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:38.840]   an original Apple DVD slot drive and I had like this cheap like eBay Chinese $35 Blu-ray
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:45.720]   reader that I was using for that kind of stuff and for some reason occasionally a CD wouldn't
[02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:51.080]   come in and a Blu-ray or DVD wouldn't be able to rip with my usual ripping tools and I'm
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:55.000]   obviously oh my god I hope they haven't changed the security level so that now my software
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.240]   can't do it thank god it was just that bad hardware so I went shopping around for replacement.
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:06.080]   This is the one that I settled on the Pioneer BDR XD05 available in both black and shiny
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:14.240]   silver and it's a Blu-ray and DVD and CD reader and writer it's about cost me about
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:18.760]   90 bucks at B&H Photo that's about the running price for it pretty much where we go but it
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:26.080]   does it operates off of USB 3 comes with has a rest the a lot of the cheaper drives you
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:31.760]   will get have like those old fashioned pair of USB connectors in the back one for power
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:37.000]   one for whatever this is full USB 3 speed and power really slim it's a top loader I wish
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.840]   were a slot loader but whatever but the deal is that it does work with all of the apps that
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:48.080]   I use to convert CDs and movie discs into files I can put onto my file server and fast fast fast
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:53.600]   because because I've never had a need I don't have a real need day to day for CDs for software
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:05:03.240]   and stuff like that I forgot that like USB 3 is faster than USB 2 so so that's why exactly
[02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:08.800]   it's like one more isn't it but that's that's the reason why I've got like my my webcam on
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:16.360]   a little tabletop tripod showing you this because I started ripping what was it the hot hot fuzz
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:22.280]   the cheese before I really doesn't need a copy of that I think I really oh it's a great
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:26.440]   oh for every second so it's a it's a classic it's a classic it's it's it's part of the
[02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:31.720]   Cornetto trilling I know I know which I hate but go ahead okay that's why I like the zombie
[02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:35.400]   one that was a good one there you go Shawna the dead again Shawna the dead that's fine
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:40.720]   you're you're entitled to your company work with a Mac yes that's what that's what got hooked
[02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:47.960]   up to this bag of hurt you can hang off a Mac it's not a bag of hurt it's a top-loading
[02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:53.840]   wedge of awesomeness meaning that you obviously it's not going to if if you drop a DVD and
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:59.040]   it'll play the DVD using the built-in Mac software blue rays of course it'll mount as
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:04.200]   a devi it'll mount as a storage volume but you won't be able to play it because the Mac
[02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:10.040]   has to come with that software if you pair it with with the software that can convert
[02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:14.440]   DVDs and blue rays into movies you will find that this works perfectly great with all that
[02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:18.520]   and doesn't really fast like I said the reason why I'm sure I'm not holding it up in front
[02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:23.280]   of my my beautiful face is because I I really I've been ripping CDs movies with it for the
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:26.640]   past two or three days and I actually kind of thought it would be done by now but it's
[02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:30.720]   not so I have to keep it I don't want to start it all over again so because I really want
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:34.760]   to see this movie tonight but yeah so you might you might be worried about if you're
[02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:39.240]   using again these third-party tools that convert movies maybe it won't be compatible
[02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:42.640]   with this app or that app all the ones that you might have heard of all the ones that
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:46.280]   Jason Snell has written about on six colors he's written a couple of really good guides
[02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:51.840]   on to how to convert movies to to regular quick time files those work with all those
[02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:56.800]   apps and so this is a good tried and true again not the cheapest one you can get but
[02:06:56.800 --> 02:07:02.320]   it is a pioneer drive it's really really well done and you don't get a piece of junk so
[02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:06.040]   if that's why that's why I bought it and that's why I'm recommending it very nice if
[02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:11.640]   you're a nerd you can go to github.com/donmelton and check out all of Don's tools for H.264 and
[02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:16.360]   I think starting soon 65 okay yeah okay yeah that's just in Denver after making safari
[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:20.320]   he's just ripping all the DVDs it's it's got it's gonna get so much better this this is
[02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:25.880]   and this is why like I don't buy digital movies I buy them on disc because I feel like that
[02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:31.040]   way I can I'm buying like an installer master disc and when an even better compression method
[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:38.240]   comes along the ones that I really care about like oh like I don't know like maybe Star Wars
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:42.960]   really good new movies I'll just simply spend the time to re-rip them into the new format
[02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:48.400]   and have them on my on my plex server that's I've got that I remember I might pick a week
[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:53.480]   a few weeks ago was the Synology and upgraded to my Synology NAS and that's part of what's
[02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:58.920]   spurring this on now I've got a whopping eight terabytes of storage that's like now that
[02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:04.760]   I've got seven now that I've got five terabytes of free storage why am I why was I so conservative
[02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:11.160]   in ripping those movies before why don't I re-rip them at much higher quality so our pick
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:21.480]   of the weeks continue with Alex Lindsay so I I I inherited the house that I moved into
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:28.360]   I inherited a lot of Sonos Wow and boy when we were looking at the house I was like is that
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:33.760]   gonna stay here you know I was built in yeah so there's there's wiring that goes through
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:40.200]   the house so they can't take I guess it wasn't too useful I mean in the you could you could
[02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:43.840]   I mean there was speaker wire like run everywhere I guess whoever built the original house was
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:49.400]   an AV contractor so there's cat five and and speaker wires and all kinds of stuff and so
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:54.360]   but I didn't I'd have bought the house just for that I well it is why I signed it my wife
[02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:57.760]   had a bunch of other reasons oh yeah yeah you know it's really nice now the hell is it
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:03.160]   a priority straight server room I mean it's got a server you know and so so anyway and
[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:07.400]   and I have to admit that I you know I had a sono I you know I got some some sonos the
[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:11.280]   speaker and I just never really took to it you know it was like one of those things that
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:15.960]   I you know is excited about and just had a lot of trolls set it up you know years ago
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:19.960]   or whatever and decided around it's okay but what I have to say is that I'm getting my
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:23.600]   pick because it just I finally got over that hump and just sat down and like I got to figure
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:29.120]   this out and you know it's a lot of different rooms and so on so forth and it just it just
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:32.120]   works great you know because it ties in the spotify you you just sit there and just go
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:37.160]   I want to listen to this playlist in this room and it just you know it just works you
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:41.720]   know you know getting it set up was much easier than I thought which was because I had to
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:47.560]   reset it all you know somebody else's sonos right oh but sonos is amazing as their new
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:57.920]   slogan says it really ties the room together man it's so easy to it was so easy to worry
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:03.800]   about them I have to say with Apple's new home hub and and all these companies going
[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:10.120]   into kind of you know Google's stuff can also sync together I worry that Sonos is falling
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:14.080]   behind they never had voice activation and they still don't well and I guess for for
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:17.360]   me you know those don't make much I mean the speakers aren't really what I have there
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:22.520]   it's the it's these are all connects and connect and also you have connected to speak
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:27.400]   is the real stereos there's real speakers and all the that were left behind right house
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:32.440]   too and so so they're an outside and you know you see that's what I do I have my I have
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:38.120]   the connects and I have connected to stereo systems right right and then and there's you
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:41.840]   know and in this case there's you know like a lot of them so so there was a lot of a
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:45.880]   lot of did you go buy a bunch of them or they had the kennels they were there they
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:50.800]   were all there because these are 350 bucks each for a sonos connect that's that's basically
[02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:55.560]   gives the wireless portion of the sonos to your speakers your stereo system but you
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:58.440]   have to have a stereo system to use it exactly there were a couple connects and then there
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:03.840]   are a bunch of connect amps and oh the amps work with the un-powered you just plug speakers
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:09.120]   in them and off and off they go and so so that's what that's what I have I mean I don't I
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:11.960]   don't I have one or two I have the speakers that I bought the little sonos speakers that
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:16.200]   I'm that I finally added to the system but the ones that are there and I just have to
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:18.840]   say that if you're thinking about doing something like that where you're going to control a
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:22.840]   bunch of pieces I mean and I think you think a lot of us that are kind of really into this
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:29.200]   or thinking I'm going to use the I want to use my stereo these connects and the connect
[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:32.880]   and if you don't have a stereo the connect amps are are pretty great little things works
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:37.520]   really well yeah and they have optical out so you go you know optical and everything
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:43.320]   no I use them both my stereo systems have sonos connects attached I never thought about
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:48.160]   the amp so you can get so yeah I mean the sonos speakers themselves are pretty good
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:52.480]   I'm yeah I mean but this is like there's a bunch of speakers and things you know it's
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:57.920]   stereo and the amp costs the same as their play five but I guess if you have better speakers
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:03.480]   than than the play five it would make sense right yeah right yeah I mean if you're trying
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:06.200]   to tie back into something you already have you already have some speakers you already
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:10.040]   have a stereo system and you want to have that be just something easy to go and again
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:14.840]   being able to say I want a group you know that's the real advantage part of people coming
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:19.840]   over so I want yeah I want the outside yard and I want the living room in the kitchen all
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:26.880]   to have the same music playing it and it was surprisingly easy again I didn't really take
[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:31.960]   to it the first time I went got into it but it's great it's great little package yeah I
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:36.760]   agree it's really and I have them you know I have you know I have all that stuff in the
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:43.280]   house too you know I have to admit the I don't know how you've been the show have you been
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:48.040]   using I am such a fan of the show did you get a show yeah my my kids have forgotten that
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:53.600]   Google so before I had a dot and I had the whatever and I had the Google home and and
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:58.840]   they the kids were all they didn't really like the the scallop and they all all they
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:02.480]   use is Google hold it for a while an echo if you would so we don't trigger people oh
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:09.200]   sorry sorry so the echo and and so anyway and so they always were asking Google something
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:16.080]   and and as soon as it took like about a half a day for the show to be out before they had
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:19.200]   completely decided that the screen was super cool and they're like we just didn't take
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:22.160]   this we can just take this anywhere and just plug it in and we've got movies and we've
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:26.040]   got things and like my only son was like his head was like this is amazing like we can
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:31.280]   just do all these things with this thing and I was like he knows it way already knows
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:35.320]   it way better than I do you know like he pretty cool now they're asking stuff all the time
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:39.600]   and kids are just but that's what I'm really seeing is how quickly kids will I mean like
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:45.640]   us when we were kids yeah but but they just absorb the technology so seamlessly and then
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:50.160]   immediately just using every day like it like it always existed yeah I have quite a few
[02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:56.640]   of them now I was bad at an echo habit as I do a sonos habit eventually this is one
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:03.800]   that something's got to give Alex Lindsay is the pixel core pixel core comm and of course
