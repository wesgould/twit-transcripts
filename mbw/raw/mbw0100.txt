[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   100th episode.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And I'm so glad you're here for Episode 100.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   We had all these plans, things we were going to give away,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   games we were going to play, fun and games and things and
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   nothing.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   We got nothing.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   It says it's just too damn hot.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   It's too damn hot.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Except we do have a fabulous panel for you today, starting
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   with that man, that muffled voice you hear in the background.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Mr. Andy Ennaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Hello Andy.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Am I really muffled?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   No, you know.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   It might be because, like, I'm actually back in my office
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   for the first time in, like, eight weeks.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And to celebrate, I've got the mic stand in Edenism mode in
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   which I get to, I'm like sort of reclining on the sofa as though
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   someone is feeding me grapes.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I've got the boom mic set up so that I don't really have to move
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   or do anything.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   You know, Merlyn can help us here because he's an expert on the
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   neck talk, kind of.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Merlyn Mann from You Look Nice Today.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   You think it's because Andy's chin is on his chest, or
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   something like that?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   No.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   No, I'm not.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I'm now adjusting the mic stand so that my chin is up so that
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   my chin is up so that the next grape is coming.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   You know what?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   You know what really is?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's that I don't hear birds, cafeterias sounds.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   It sounds like you're in a studio.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Explosions.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Matlock.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   There's no matlock in the background.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Merlyn Mann is here.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   He's having a delicious meal of something.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   What is that?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   You're chowing down on Merlyn.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   She's gone.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   We were not able to compete with the cherries Jubilee that he
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   was having for lunch.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Let me add him back in.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I don't know what happened there.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   He was so proud of what he was eating and then we lost him.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   From this weekend photography, the wonderful Twip
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   TwipPhoto.com.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Mr. Scott Borne.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   How was your...
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I hear you got the D700.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I did.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I got it a couple of days ago.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   After that heavy D3, it probably seems like this little
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   toy camera.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I'm calling it my walk around camera.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   It's my point and shoot.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Shut up.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   By the way, when Andy was describing his Mike and
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Heatonism mode, I kind of threw up in my mouth a little bit.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   You threw up in jealousy, no doubt.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   He was revolted in...
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Stuard?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   More mini stickers.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Too sweet.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Now we got Merlyn Mann.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   What were you eating and what was it that pulled you away from us?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   You can't hear him like that, right?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   You're a little dim, fortunately, so we can't.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   But if you could turn yourself...
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Not you personally.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   We've got everybody listening right now hating us because you got me
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   who's lying around in the middle of the afternoon.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Scott, who's got this wonderful new camera, Merlyn, who's enjoying
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   something tasty.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   What about those horrible...
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Those people in this horrible situation...
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Easy, easy text.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I've been making up stuff for the Internet all morning and I haven't eaten.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I was...
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I said a lot of...
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I said a lot of very slightly funny things on Twitter today, so...
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   You know, I deserve a bowl of cereal, I think.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   What's the people on Twitter decide whether you said some funny things on Twitter?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   What flavor cereal are you eating?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Are you consuming?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Hell.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It's fail flavored.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Now I'm having stater, and I'm having Captain Crunch Prime.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Captain Crunch...
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I got it!
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I got it!
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I picked Captain Crunch Prime.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Yeah, that's the unflavored.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   There's no Choco Cherryberry in there.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I'm going to just also say that if you guys...
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Quick, I'm sorry, I'm trying to get my level going here.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Just if you ever have a minute though, do stop by the Captain Crunch entry on the Wikipedia.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I always enjoy the discussion pages on any in-universe fictional character page, but this one's great.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   It's great.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And the role of John Lefoot, his nemesis, a little bit about his personal background, what the captain's full name is, some problems internally with the story,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   with how old he was in the...
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   [laughter]
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Well, um...
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   So apparently he was old enough to have a beard and serve.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   [laughter]
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   What is his full name?
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Oh crap, I don't know.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   That's a terrible name.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Even this is our hundredth episode, folks.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   We have absolutely nothing about Macintosh.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   It's pointed out that it's...
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   We do, we do.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   It tears up the roof of your mouth, and...
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   That's the...
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   ...which I think is true.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   There's some discussion about whether that belongs in the article.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   There's discussion of the fact that his eyebrows are actually on his hat.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   You know what, this is gonna be really controversial.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   This is gonna be really controversial, but my favorite Captain Crunch was Avery Brooks.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I think he brought something to that role that Kirk didn't really do, that Picard didn't really do.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   You know, it was more in-time-capped-in-a-roundy.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Wrong captain.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Sorry.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   So we thought it'd be kind of fun to do a...
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   What's my line game here, because we have a very special guest in studio with us.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   He is a well-known software author.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   He is perhaps one of the most championed fellas in the Macintosh world today.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And Andy Enocho, I'm gonna give you the first question.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Okay.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Hang on, let's have a get my blindfold on.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Oh, you please.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   You would not recognize him.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   I don't think he has made a lot of appearances in the public.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   He is known for being reclusive, private, out of the public.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   You don't do this much, do you, Leo?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I think you're giving a lot of clues away in the informational part.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   You know what else?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   He just hung up.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Well, we could still ask questions.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   What's gonna take home a case of sourdressing from our sponsors as our guest, you know, guest celebrity, but maybe now, you know?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   You would think he would have appreciated that.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   That man who's sacred is that he's the champion road trip, road trip trip shooter.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And maybe we'll just have him on.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And maybe you just leave your botany 500 suit in the dressing room.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   There you go.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   From the Johnny Carson collection, available specifically at Sears retail.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   All right, he's back now.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Ladies and ladies, would you please ask your first question, put your blindfold on Andy Enocho.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Ask a question of our guest today, our ministry guest.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Okay, mystery guest.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   This product that you are known for, would it be helpful in say the agriculture or agribusiness sphere?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Not yet, but given enough time, it probably would be able to control of it.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Yes.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Okay.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Merlin, man, a question for our mystery guest.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Do you have any physical deformities that could be characterized as being flipper like?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Oh, I think you're getting warm.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Well, I think there's some light webbing between two of my fingers, but most people wouldn't notice that Leo.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Leo, is it Don Rickles?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   $10 to our guest.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And we go now to Scott Peggy Carlisle born.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   I was just going to say I have been channeling.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   I'm working with Vantra here in the studio.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Vantra is a well-known side gate.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Vantra is now channeling Kitty Carlisle for me.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I'm asking Kitty for a question.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Her question is this.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Does the person's profession have anything to do with making those giant bugle horns people blow at ball games?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Oh, very close.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I would say no, but I'm sure that some of them have been produced with our company logo on it at some point.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And that's the key, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   That's the key.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Thank you, Kitty.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Wherever you will miss you.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I'm going to turn over all the cards here, folks, and give the $10.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   To our mystery guest, he has stumped you all unless anybody has a guest.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Don Rickles is not the guest.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Any other guesses before I turn over all the cards?
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   It's not Charlie Callis.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   No, it is not.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Nicholas Jikkoff is with us.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   He is Al Gore, the creator of perhaps the single most incredibly valuable, useful Macintosh program of all time,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   the perennial free software winner, Mr. Al Gore is a creator of Quicksilver, of course.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   And he now has done a number of things for his current employer, Google, including, I understand,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   the Google app for the iPhone, which we've already, I think, has been a pick on Mac break weekly as being incredibly useful.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   It was my pick.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Yeah, because it's just a little, it's a location-based search.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Nicholas, it's so good to have you. We're big fans.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   It's good to be here, finally.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Finally!
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Oh, I think Alex Lindsey now wants to get into the game.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Don't tell him who our guest is.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Surprise him.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Surprise him.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Let's see if you'll know.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Wait, I'm channeling Bennett Surf.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   He says, "Bolds of fire, blood, blood of the goat, pulls of..."
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Oh, God, Bennett must have really screwed.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   He went the wrong way.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I don't know what he was into, but it's been freaking him.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Alex Lindsey, are you there?
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   I am.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   All right, we've just missed our What's My Line game.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   We introduced Nicholas Jikkoff, who is, of course, Al Gore.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Do you still use the name Al Gore, Nicholas?
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   As a user idea.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   What does that come from?
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   It's the name of a star in The Big Dipper.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Next to The Big Dipper.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Well, yeah, but that's not why it's famous.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Why?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   It's famous.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Isn't it the company that froze?
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Is the company that froze?
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Was it Ted Williams?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   No, who did they freeze?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   They froze somebody's head.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   They're a head freezing company.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Oh, no, no, you're thinking...
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   That's also the case.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   You think of Halcoa.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   He was wrapped in Reynolds rap.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   That was Walt Disney.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   And then he went...
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Al Gore Life Extension Foundation.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   How old were you when you first wrote "Quick Silver?"
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Because you seem like a pretty young guy, unless you're very youthful looking.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   2000, so 21?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Okay.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   So you are youthful looking.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   But you were still in college when you wrote that?
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Yeah, the one that's released is right after college around that.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   You did something recently, I think it was pretty interesting.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   You've kind of given "Quick Silver" away.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Well, and that's partly due to my inability to spend time on it.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Right.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Like making something open source is one of the few ways you can get more input from other people.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I think huge, though.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I think a really significant thing.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   How has that gone?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Have people jumped on and become part of the team?
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Yeah, there's a lot of people who are really interested in helping.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   The main problem is trying to figure out how to organize them so that it's not forked into a bunch of different versions.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Right.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Has it forked?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   There's a few people working on variants of it, but we're trying to sort of coalesce everything into another release that we'll do.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   One thing I always wanted to ask you is, are you a graphics designer?
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Because one thing I always liked about "Quick Silver" is how beautiful it was and just how elegant it is.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And it feels like, did you hire somebody to help you with that or did you do that yourself?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   No, I did that.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I actually work as a designer here.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   What's it going to say?
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Because even "Black Tree" is gorgeous.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Thank you.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   So you're a designer as well as a programmer.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Yes.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   And so your chief work at Google is which?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   As a designer who uses programming to illustrate ideas.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Interesting.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   What was your-- were you a CS major?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   CS major, but minor, effectively, and art.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   That's a nice combination.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   I think rare, too.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   It was fun.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   It's helpful because it makes it easier to make something compelling.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Yeah, it's what stops me.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Everything I do looks ugly.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   I was like, OK, I can't do a good icon to save my life.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   So "Quick Silver" has always been very pretty.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   So tell us a little bit about what you're doing at Google.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   So generally, I work on mobile and desktop applications, but I'm focused on user experience for that.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And just always thinking about ways of getting people to their information faster or to whatever they're looking for.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   That's kind of your charter there.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   That's what they brought you on for.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Yes.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   That's neat.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Good.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   And I sort of started on the Mac team, but tend to branch out to a bunch of other projects.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   You've worked a lot.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   I was looking at your page at Google Code, and you were on about 10 or 11 different projects.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Most of those are personal, but yeah.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Really all of them.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Wow.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   So what's your favorite right now?
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   My favorite project.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Can you pick one or is that too hard to do?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Wild card is my favorite, but it's not really ready for release.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   I think generic whiteboarding, game playing, coronimation for the phone and desktop.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   I'll take two.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   If I do that, my brain will melt.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   That's what you know.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   I think you need to add the suffix for productivity and connectivity scalable across enterprise.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   And you said that'll get people to read for their venture capital checkbooks.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Hey, Nicholas, are you still working on discipline?
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Is that just a personal project?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Or did you ever do anything to more to release that?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   I mentioned as the 40th year, I think people will be interested in knowing about discipline.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   So discipline was an app that I made a while back that basically was intended to keep you
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   on track constantly, like every five minutes or so.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   There'd be a whip crack sound and it asked you what you were doing.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   No.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   It honestly, you were accomplishing your task.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   You're kidding.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   It's fantastic.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   It totally worked.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   For somebody like me, that's a mess.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   No, totally.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   And you've got to tell it.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   So it goes, "Hey, are you doing that thing?"
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   You said, "Earlier today, you said you wanted to work on this thing."
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   And then it goes, "Wooosh."
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.640]   And then you go, and then you have to enter in what you're doing, and whether it's the
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.000]   thing that you were supposed to be doing.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   So basically, effectively, you create a log for where, if you're off track you were doing.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.520]   There's obviously a comedy kind of component and there's a mindfulness component, but
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.000]   there's also kind of a really, if you're trying to track down where your attention is leaking,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   it's one way to see patterns as they emerge.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   I thought it was a really neat app.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Is that because you need something like that, Nicholas?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Is that why you wrote that?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Somewhat.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   I'm curious about a brain.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   It helps, though, with having multiple projects, and I can just jump from one to the other,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   as the next one becomes interesting.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Don't let me monopolize Nicholas, by the way, guys.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   If you've got a question for him.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   I have a question.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   I have been a fan of Quicksilver.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Quicksilver is literally one of the reasons, one of the primary reasons that I started
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   43 folders.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.600]   For no other reason, then people were really tired of me telling them about this program
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.000]   and making them watch it.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.400]   Of course, they became like a magic trick, and they were like, "Oh my God, I have to go
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.400]   use this."
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   I've been with this for a long time.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.840]   I've got a build of it that's not broken yet, despite some updates.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.920]   I keep waiting for the day when the build that I have breaks.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:16.360]   I guess I'm just curious if you know, I had a post about this not long ago, but I'm aware
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.520]   that there's a primary fork that some folks are working on, and there's a secondary fork
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.200]   where the one guy mostly went in and cleaned up the code.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   Is that a superficial two major parts of the fork right now?
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.760]   Yeah, the main thing is that there's a version of the fork that is very stripped down, like
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.280]   a light version, in attempt to make things lower profile, like there's no triggers, things
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.440]   like that.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.360]   They're usually committing the changes back into the main code.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.480]   Yeah, I mean, as people who are dependent on Quicksilver, I'd hate to see it.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.560]   Well, that's why I was wondering.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:56.800]   So I mean, for me, I think I'm probably, and probably Leo, I suspect we're even amongst
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.720]   power users, we're probably, I know I'm pretty rare, and then I use almost everything in
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.720]   Quicksilver.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.720]   It's one of the few applications.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.880]   It's ironic, given that it does so much.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.160]   Photoshop, I open up and I hit Unsharp Mask and I close it.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.120]   But Quicksilver, I really use--
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.920]   I mean, you don't have a trigger for that yet.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.120]   I have triggers for almost everything, including drag triggers.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.920]   I have stuff where I can drop it to a corner and it goes to transmit.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.280]   I mean, people who have found that-- and this is not in any way a slam against Butler or
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.720]   Launch Bar because they're fantastic.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:30.000]   But the people who have been able to easily switch to those apps, which are great apps,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.920]   have been able to do so because they really hadn't gotten addicted to the--
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.960]   It's almost like if you were somebody who used the shell a lot and then somebody came
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.200]   along with a GUI, there's two ways you could go.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.800]   You're either the guy who says, actually, a GUI is going to help me do this, or you
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.800]   go, you know what?
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.120]   I really need to stay here because there's more I can do here.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.120]   And so as somebody who has all that stuff going on and knowing that Quicksilver can
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:55.800]   do so many things, do you have any sense of the main kind of Trump crowd?
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.880]   What's the focus of what they see this app doing?
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.360]   Because I could very much see this forking in a million directions.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.400]   Well, my main goals are to keep it fairly simple.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.440]   I think triggers are a bit of a distraction from what the core app does.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:15.560]   It happened to be together, but it's almost a completely different app's worth of functionality.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.360]   And I think that branching those off into a separate mechanism that's always running
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:23.360]   and you can trust that your triggers will work independent of the search app is a reasonable
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.360]   thing to do.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.600]   The question is when and who will do those things.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.880]   So it'd be something like an API or something that would get access to the app and it would
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.560]   be cached or something like that?
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.280]   Yeah, they would be tied to each other somehow.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:42.240]   Main thing is, though, I wouldn't worry too much about it becoming obsolete just because
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.520]   snow leopard potentially won't change that much about the OS and these things are likely
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.280]   to keep working for the next few years.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:58.320]   There were so many Mac hacks like Haxes that used undocumented and in some cases deprecated
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.880]   hooks into the operating system and Apple always said these things aren't going to work.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.400]   So you're saying Quicksilver has been careful to follow the API and the guidelines that
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.840]   Apple provides.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.840]   Or do you hook into some stuff?
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.480]   You know, do you hook because it seems like you're doing some serious voodoo under there.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.760]   Well for instance, when Apple abandoned the input manager, did that screw things up?
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.600]   No, well, it's standalone so it doesn't have to worry too much about poking into other
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.600]   processes.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.600]   Okay.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.560]   There's a little bit in there that's questionable, but it seems to work.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.800]   It's not illegal to do that.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.880]   In fact, I remember talking to Apple and they said, well, you know, don't depend too much
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:43.440]   on these Haxes because in the next version of the operating system, they may not work
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.120]   anymore.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.400]   And these companies are always scrambling to update it.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.200]   I guess now that it's open source, it's not like you're high.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.200]   People can look at the source code.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.200]   Isn't that right, Nicholas?
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.200]   Yep.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.200]   They could fix things that they want.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.280]   I have a few friends who have changed a few things that they've always hated about
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.280]   it.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.400]   I'm happy to let them do so.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.400]   Really?
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.400]   Yeah, this is the thing.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.760]   I know I can see what Merlin's worried about.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.240]   This is the thing we've trusted you.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.680]   We've put this your life in your hands, has been in your hands.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:11.120]   This is what you get for helping people.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.120]   You get the unbearable burden of our affection.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.120]   Exactly.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.120]   Exactly.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:23.320]   And we just, we don't want it to change too much, you know.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.480]   On the other hand, if there's more functionality, we can live with that.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.920]   We're happy with that.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.440]   This is one thing I think that people, and Merlin, you actually did a Nicholas, a good,
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.200]   big favor.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.480]   You're a great programmer, a great graphic artist.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:42.640]   Documentation, not your fort.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.440]   And I think a lot of people came to Quicksilver and immediately groked the idea of you press
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.560]   control space and you type a few things, but that was about it.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.520]   And it wasn't until you came along, and Merlin said, "Whoa, look, you could do this and this
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.840]   and this that I understood."
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.720]   I unfairly get a lot of credit for that.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.520]   I mean, I was definitely an enthusiast, but I'm not a technologist on any level.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.080]   I mean, I was just an excited super user, really, but then I'm forgetting the guy's name Nicholas,
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:12.240]   he should help me, but there's one dude who really threw down and put together a full-on
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.320]   manual for Quicksilver that not only walks you through the setup, which can be kind of
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.600]   a pain in the butt, but all of the stuff that you can do.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.960]   I think it's, last time I looked, it was really, it was a good piece of documentation.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.960]   Howard, Merlin.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.960]   Is it Howard?
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.960]   Oh, for it.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.960]   It's very well done.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.960]   And I'll tell you the truth, this is something I've never said publicly before, but I pitched
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:36.320]   a quick-siller book to O'Reilly at one point.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.560]   This is the thing I really want to write.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.560]   I was like, this is an application.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.560]   That would have been great.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.880]   Yeah, well, I want to write like one of those little quick guides, you know, the little
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.280]   biscuitie books.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.680]   And you know, I think the feeling was, there's probably not enough interest in this and,
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.000]   well, no, it could be.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.120]   I mean, I don't know, you know, who can say.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.120]   Show of hands.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.560]   Anybody here on the panel not use Quicksilver to use Butler or something or not or nothing?
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.720]   Scott, you're the, you're the most, most led item of them all.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   Do you use Quicksilver?
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.360]   Most likely, Anadate cannot use this and I don't.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.800]   I have several people and my staff that do and enjoy it.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.280]   And I look at their screens and it always baffles me when I walk up there and there's
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.960]   like nothing, absolutely nothing on this screen.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.880]   Oh, you're an icon on the desktop kind of guy.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.640]   Not only that, I'm like pretty much every file I've ever created since 1992.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.320]   It's on my desktop.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:30.320]   I have like six monitors because I have to buy monitors for the desktop icons.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.560]   I'm afraid that I don't know how to do it organized.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.560]   Sorry, Alex.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.360]   I just don't know how to be organized like everybody else.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.360]   Go ahead.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.800]   All is going to say is I don't use it only because I have a lot of, I use a lot of different
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.360]   computers and I'm always afraid that I'm going to get used to something that isn't there.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.800]   I have a couple of guys.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.480]   We have a couple of guys here that use it a lot and the big, big challenges that get
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.680]   really, really, you know, it's this environment that they get really used to and then they
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.880]   moved to another computer and suddenly you constantly see them trying to figure out how
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.720]   to interact with the operating system again because they're so used to being.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.720]   It's funny to watch because if you sit down in a Windows machine or for that matter,
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.240]   sit down in another Mac, you might as well be wearing boxing gloves.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.080]   They start to bang it on the keyboard and because the bezel doesn't pop up and.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.080]   Exactly.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.160]   And there's I offer a long time.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.240]   I was doing that with unison.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.240]   I was using unison to sync my preferences.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.840]   Is there any chance at some point in the future?
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.440]   Nick, I didn't mean to hijack your question.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.440]   No, no, no.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:29.200]   Is there any way, any chance you think at some point in the future, Nick, it might be possible
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:34.760]   to wind up all that stuff under a preferences area where it might be portable via mobile
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.760]   me.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.400]   I'm not going to make any promises about features.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.120]   I'm sure somebody will do it if it's important enough to.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.840]   Is it theoretically possible to do?
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.840]   Oh, that's good to know.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.840]   I've made attempts.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.840]   It just was hard.
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.840]   So I didn't never follow.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.040]   Is this stuff stored at an XML file or is it a binary file?
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.920]   There's a few XML files that if you got them onto the other machine.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.080]   So they're just peelers.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.080]   They're just peelers.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.760]   The thing is it would become like a .profile that you would have portable with you.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.560]   And I mean, stuff like when you add something to the shelf, you know, I, again, I know not
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.600]   that many people I guess use the shelf.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.480]   I constantly use the shelf and the clipboard.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.640]   I mean, I've got 250 items in my clipboard.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.800]   So, you know, it would be nice to have that portable across.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.400]   But I'm sorry, Leo, you were asking a question.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.760]   No, no, I think that's fine.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.680]   I take it that Alex and Scott are outliers because I know I use Quicksilver.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.480]   You use Quicksilver Merlin and Andy, do you use Quicksilver?
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.040]   Use Butler or use something else?
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.520]   I don't use Quicksilver.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.520]   I don't use Butler.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.520]   I don't use anything else.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.520]   Really?
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.960]   See, this is why we have work to do Merlin.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:44.120]   Well, no, it's just why like the three other guys who actually get stuff done, you know,
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.880]   this could just be like a carnival ride for us.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.720]   There's just, there are a couple of things.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:54.480]   Number one, Alex has exactly my point of view in that I like utilities that make me
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.240]   work faster and better.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.440]   But the thing is, and that even just within my own personal office, inevitably, I'll set
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.800]   something up on the MacBook that then, oh, God, that means I got to set the stuff in
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.120]   the iMac 2 to duplicate it.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.560]   Oh, God, now I got to get the script running on the tower and that sort of thing.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.880]   Chiefly, I don't want to get into a mode where it gets so dependent on a third party utility
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.080]   that it becomes really difficult for me to work without it.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.600]   But the big thing is that I'm a constantly downloading software and I'm constantly installing
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.920]   it and constantly thinking, okay, let's just check this out and see how it works.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.040]   And though I'm not going to make this into a value judgment on the software.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.880]   The ones that really work for me, I don't really have to remind myself to use it.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.600]   I just start using it and then start, gee, this is really great.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.000]   One of those is a better way to use it.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.760]   Oh, God, there is a great feature for this.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.640]   I just never had that moment with QuickServe Silver.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.680]   I installed it, I tried it, and then I just didn't use it beyond the first couple of hours.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.680]   See, that's the thing.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.400]   It's the first thing, if I go near a Mac, I just install it.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.480]   I think a lot, you'll hear a lot of people say that, Leo, and I think it's for good reason.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.720]   It's a very opaque application.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.080]   And it's like, I mean, like, but in fairness, I mean, I don't mean to sound defensive, but
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.320]   it's kind of like sitting somebody down at the terminal and going start typing.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.240]   You know, like, eventually, you know, in a couple of years, you'll figure out that there's
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.720]   commands that do things.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.760]   But if you don't have somebody say to you, okay, here's how a pipe works.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.800]   And you go, oh, I get it.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.840]   This is why people sit here and use this.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.800]   And I think that's absolutely not transparent with QuickServe.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.760]   And I will say, there's guys here in the office that are just religious about it.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.360]   I mean, they just, you know, people who use it a lot are generally religious about QuickServe.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.040]   I mean, that's what, I mean, they just love it.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.680]   It's like, oh, it's almost like a people who use a Mac.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.680]   It's a cult.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.960]   People who use a Mac are that way.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.960]   You know, and so it's just like it's a--
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.680]   Oh, I think Merlin, you made exactly the right analogy.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.680]   It's like the terminal.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   It's like the command line.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.680]   If you're a command line, whiz, that's it.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.760]   And if you don't like the command line, you don't like the command line.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.760]   You just don't use it.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.000]   I mean, like, after you get in the habit of-- I'm not saying, I'm not saying, "I shouldn't
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.560]   have said it, everybody's got their own reasons."
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:56.240]   But for me, like now, using the finder feels like a play about computers rather than using
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.240]   a--
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.000]   Nicholas, you use QuickServe, don't you?
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Yes.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.680]   I thought I should ask.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.480]   It'd be kind of funny if you didn't.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.560]   You've been doing some neat stuff.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:11.600]   So I really-- Scott Bournes, I mentioned, Scott mentioned, picked the Google app for the iPhone
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.600]   as his pick.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.600]   It's not what I thought it was.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.280]   I always expect kind of the Google app-- there's a Google mobile app for Blackberry and so forth
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.920]   that just links to other Google apps.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.040]   This is basically a Google search engine that knows where you are and gives you-- and
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.120]   it's really slick.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.720]   I think that's a-- how hard was that to do?
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:32.520]   Is that an unusually difficult thing to do, or was it fairly easy to develop for the phone?
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.840]   It was pretty easy here, just because we-- our Mac team had put together so much shared
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.760]   code that when we actually started to do phone development, we were able to carry most
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.760]   of it over.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.760]   Oh, that's good.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.160]   And so the Coco stuff you'd already done worked.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:50.880]   So using the work that others had done, it was just me and an engineer working together
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.040]   with a few other people helping out periodically and we were able to throw it together in a
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.480]   couple months.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.760]   That's cool.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.520]   And how is it-- how hard is it to work with the location API?
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:05.800]   Because it strikes me that's where a lot of these applications, maybe it's a phone issue,
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.960]   a crash.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.960]   There's not much--
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.960]   It's just a call--
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.960]   It's just a call.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.960]   It's just a call.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   It's just a call.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.960]   So it's just a call.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   Location.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.960]   It's like, where am I?
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.160]   Well, like Apple has all those libraries, core location, core data, and really they're
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.960]   wrapping functionality so that developers can take advantage of it.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.000]   So really, if there are issues, it's not the developers, unless they're doing something
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   really weird.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.440]   It's probably something in the core location.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.440]   Because that's where it seems to me--
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.440]   I think it depends on the app, too.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.240]   It's hard to tell where an app is crashing.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.240]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.920]   They mostly seem to crash when they're asking for the location to me.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.960]   Although I have a fix, and we're going to talk about this a little later.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.520]   I'm on my third iPhone restore and I finally found-- somebody told me something that really
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.680]   helped.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.760]   And I think I found-- well, I'll tell you now.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.360]   And actually, I'll run it by you, Nicholas, to see if it makes sense to you.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.160]   I literally have had to restore this three times.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.120]   I've got to the point where just the white Apple shows in a manner.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.640]   How many times I reset it, I can't get it to boot up.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.640]   Before you say anything, I guess.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.480]   I'm going to guess it has something to do with downloading stuff through the app store instead
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.480]   of through iTunes.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.480]   You're exactly right.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.480]   We had the same problem.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:18.680]   So when I stopped installing and updating applications from the phone, and only did that
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:24.040]   from iTunes and then let it sync to the phone, all my troubles went away.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.040]   Same thing happened to me.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.800]   All my troubles went away.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.200]   This is a really important tip.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.360]   So the three of us have had that result.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.760]   Furthermore, when an application does crash, I'll turn the phone off.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.760]   I won't reset.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.000]   I'll turn it off and turn it back on and then almost always fixes that.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.760]   So I think knock on wood, that may have solved these restore problems.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.600]   So Nicholas, do you have any insight into why that would be?
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.240]   Honestly, I can't really say.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.640]   I don't know how Apple's handling things behind the scenes.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.800]   It seems like incomplete installs.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   I've seen updates stall out.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.920]   I think what you're missing here, Leo, is what Craig Hockenberry calls the Fing NDA.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.440]   The Fing NDA.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.320]   This has been a real source spot.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:15.280]   Apple said on July 11th, the NDA would change and that developers could talk to one another
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.320]   and they didn't withdraw it.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:23.240]   So it meant that all of a sudden you're not in a normal development environment.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:29.720]   It's normal for developers, people like Hockenberry who writes Twitter-rific, to talk to Daniel
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:35.160]   Jockod who writes Marsetta and say, "Hey, how are you solving this problem?
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.600]   Are you seeing a bug here?
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.120]   This kind of conversation makes applications better."
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:45.960]   Nicholas, don't go any farther than you feel comfortable, but do you feel like this is
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.360]   a tie in your hands?
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.640]   Well, I think that the only part that's problematic is that doing a search online to
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.280]   try to find information about how to do something doesn't turn up any information.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.200]   Because nobody can share any information.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.200]   Right.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.120]   And usually what I'm mostly looking for is chunks of code that will accomplish the same
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.120]   task.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.840]   And if you're not able to do that, you have to rely only on the internal documentation
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.680]   and the few people around you can talk to.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.320]   This portion of Mac Break Weekly is brought to you by the good folks at Visa.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.840]   With every purchase, Visa prevents, detects, and resolves online.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.280]   When you're online shopping for your internet pants, you shouldn't have to worry about
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.480]   khaki or beige.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.040]   I mean, you should have to worry about that.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.440]   That's what you should be worried about.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.840]   You know, how big the waste size should be.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:30.840]   Not.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.880]   Not if it's safe to buy them online.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.640]   And it is safe as long as you're using your Visa.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.160]   You don't have to worry about online fraud.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.800]   All purchases you make are safe and secure with Visa.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:44.920]   They use real-time fraud monitoring, very sophisticated software to identify and respond.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.760]   Do the bad guys catch them in the act?
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.000]   It's important part.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Zero liability.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.920]   You are not liable for unauthorized purchases.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.400]   That is peace of mind.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.840]   Safe, secure, Visa.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:03.160]   Visa, we thank you so much for making it possible to do our 100th episode of Mac Break Weekly
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.320]   now back to the conversation with Nicholas.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:10.280]   Nicholas, what is your platform of choice for developing?
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.680]   Do you use a Mac mostly?
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.920]   Yeah, of course.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.920]   Of course.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:14.920]   Almost exclusively.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:19.560]   Nobody at Google saying, "Would you like to work on Vista, please?"
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.760]   No, they're fairly neat about whatever I'm doing.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:23.760]   I'm sure.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.560]   Since what I'm doing mostly is prototyping, it doesn't really matter what platform it's
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.560]   on.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.560]   They're a Python house.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.160]   Do you use Python there?
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.600]   I use App Engine a lot just for backend stuff that I'm playing with.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.600]   And that's Python.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.600]   Just because.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.600]   Yeah, it is.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.600]   And I only learned enough of it to be dangerous.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.760]   And I've been reasonably happy.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.120]   Your preferred language objective C or?
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.120]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.080]   It's still one I'm remotely good at.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.240]   Remotely is, well, I think you're pretty darn good at it.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:54.400]   The amazing voodoo that you do with the QuickSilver is pretty impressive.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.400]   Pretty amazing.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.400]   And the thing is, it's fast.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.400]   It doesn't get in the way.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.120]   It just does the job and the hooks you must have in there.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:07.200]   You must, I guess, write something like "QuickSilver" requires understanding the API inside and
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.200]   out.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.840]   That wasn't one of the nice things about it though, that since it basically has tentacles
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:17.920]   into every app, I got to play with every API that was available on the platform.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.920]   Jeez.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.920]   That's a lot.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.520]   I remember when I got first got my toolbox documentation many, many moons ago back with
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.440]   System 7 probably.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.120]   It was a, you know, it was a good six feet worth of notebooks.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.920]   There was a lot.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.560]   And it's gotten easier since then.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.360]   Maybe it's a little more, a little more straightforward.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.120]   That was back when it was in Pascal.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.160]   There's a lot has changed since then.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:47.120]   So, that's interesting that Scott and Nicholas, and I all have three have this experience
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:51.560]   that if you don't install apps on the iPhone, this is, I think, probably a very important
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.560]   tip.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:58.040]   Only install from iTunes, things seem to run much, much better.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.160]   And no individual apps seem to have trouble, although many of them have been updated now,
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.400]   which is good.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:08.600]   I got an email from a guy saying, he's, "I'm not going to listen to your shows anymore
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:14.120]   and I'm withdrawing my subscription because you don't, you haven't answered my email."
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.120]   Right.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:19.920]   And, you know, I thought this was a community and I don't really feel like it's a community.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.720]   But it go Leo, classy.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:27.400]   You know what I kept finding too was I kept reading the newspaper, but it never read me.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.720]   You know, and I'm like, so what's the deal?
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.160]   I can't leave a comment here.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.480]   You know, I have a thing too that I do.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.640]   And you know, I let people know what kind of sandwich I'm enjoying.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.880]   You know, and if the New York Times doesn't have time to keep up with that, well, maybe
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.440]   I don't want to participate in that community.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.760]   But, you know, we are trying to say, hey, we're something a little different than mainstream
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:45.760]   media.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.760]   We're interactive.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.760]   So I understand a little bit of feeling that one.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.440]   Still, Leo, you really should just add one simple line to the Twit Terms of Service.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.600]   You know, section three, paragraph three, eight, warning, Twit does not love you.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.880]   Well, apparently this guy felt that way.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.240]   And by the way, he works for a fairly major media company.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.760]   I'm not going to say the name, but he works for...
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.800]   He sounds like that with that level of maturity, he's going to be going places.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.880]   I'm disappointed you haven't responded to any of my correspondence.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.960]   Because of this, Twit has lost the community and greed to me.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.960]   You're still...
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.960]   Okay, but here's the deal.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.960]   Email is not community, dude.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.160]   Like, if you want to talk about something, do it in a public forum, and I'll respond in
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.400]   a way that everybody can enjoy it and participate.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.240]   But like, you, just because you think you know me, doesn't mean you get to sit in my house
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   when you feel like it.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:32.360]   He says, I have lost faith in your ability to communicate with your audience on a personal
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   level.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.360]   That scales really well.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.120]   You know, each and every one of you, I love each and every one of you.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.360]   And please send me email because I would love nothing more than have a long correspondence
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.360]   with you.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.360]   But I just don't have time.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.760]   I guess that's the problem.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.320]   Twit does love you.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.400]   And you know, from people, you know, if you put that on a t-shirt, I bet you would sell
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.200]   at least a couple hundred.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:00.640]   The warning, Twit does not love you.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.720]   If you think that Twit loves you for more than four hours, or even better warning, the internet
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.600]   does not love you.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.600]   It is me.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.720]   You know, it did not love me.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.240]   And you know, I know that sound, this sounds like a jerky thing to say.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.120]   And I apologize if that offends anybody.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.120]   But I think that, you know, I tell you what bugs me.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.800]   It bugs me when I've worked really, really hard to protect my attention.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.440]   And it's something that I struggle with.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.000]   And it's something that I'm really trying to work on.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.120]   And it really galls me when somebody tells me what my attention is worth based on what
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.520]   they think theirs is worth.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.400]   And I think that's downright offensive.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.680]   Nicholas, you know, you kept a very low profile for a long time.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.080]   In fact, you still do kind of.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.640]   Is that one of the reasons?
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.640]   Not really.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:46.560]   It's mostly most of it comes from the reason I didn't provide documentation that support
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.040]   does take a lot of time.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.880]   And being easy to do access makes it easier to ask questions.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.880]   It is the same.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:59.480]   It is a scare off the people who would be basically asking for documentation.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.480]   Right?
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.480]   Or just how to do something.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.480]   And effectively.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:08.120]   And the super users like Merlin come along and then everybody starts asking them, which
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.120]   is very convenient.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:14.040]   Now, I think people, and I understand this, people feel like you owe them an explanation.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.040]   You owe me an explanation.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.040]   How that happened?
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.480]   It happened to Ethan with Kinkles.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.480]   No one understands.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.200]   Like, you're like, oh, I downloaded Kinkles and I'm not getting support.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.840]   It's like, you understand this guy is like a photographer in Hong Kong with a kid.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.840]   You understand that, right?
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.200]   It's not some guy who's pocketing any money out of this.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.360]   He's doing you a favor and now you're mad.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.920]   It's a, you know, the internet is a big place.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:39.680]   And as anybody who's ever worked in retail knows, once you start dealing with the public,
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.520]   that they're most, you know, 99% of everybody is great.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:44.520]   All right.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.520]   Just like us.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.480]   And it's just the one or two percent that can really make you crazy.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.400]   Don't you think it's a small minority, Merlin?
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.400]   I don't think it's a big.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.400]   Oh, I do.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.400]   And I do.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.760]   But I just want to underscore the idea that I think it's one thing to say.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.880]   But for example, let's, one thing we haven't mentioned is that last time I checked, Black
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:04.600]   Tree had a pretty lively forum where anybody who wanted to exchange ideas or get help could
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:08.960]   go in there and find a community of people who would gather around them and do everything
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.760]   they could, you know, to give them respect and help them with something.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.240]   And I think that's fantastic.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.680]   That's what stuff like get satisfaction.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.400]   My friend Lane has this company get satisfaction where like you can kind of crowdsource support.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.920]   And I think stuff like that's terrific.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:26.320]   And I think what doesn't scale and what's hard is demanding repeated one on one access
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.600]   with any person on an issue that could be treated in a non one on one way.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.600]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.720]   And Scobles talked about this.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.000]   It just doesn't scale to answer every single email about stuff that's already out there
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   someplace.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:43.200]   And, you know, the forms are nice too because people will get tired of providing support
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.640]   and they'll eventually sort of drop off.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.120]   But then new people will come and replace them.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.680]   So you have this constant.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.240]   Do you like developing for the iPhone?
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.240]   Is it a nice platform?
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.240]   It's wonderful.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.240]   That's good news.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.440]   You want to hear that because that means people will do it.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.240]   Using Xcode is what makes it great.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.240]   Right.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.720]   You already know all the tools and it's easy to move over.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:08.320]   John Carmack, the guy who wrote Doom said he's going to do a graphical tour de force.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.320]   He's excited.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.200]   I think game designers must be very excited.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.720]   It's a great gaming platform.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:19.840]   He says he says it's like a PS two or an Xbox.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:27.120]   And he really thinks you could do an amazing first person shooter or very deep MM, MMO.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.640]   I think the most valuable thing in it though is the multi touch and maybe the location based
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.640]   up.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:35.720]   But the multi touch is so far beyond what anything else has been able to do so far that there's
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.680]   possibilities that people haven't even come up with.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:43.880]   I've been playing with an application, Jam D, which is really its people magazine.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:48.000]   But it uses the multi touch very much more like that Carnegie Mellon demonstration.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.880]   However, was that demonstration for Ted.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.840]   I mean, one of the articles is movie star feet.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.560]   It's all these shoes.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:03.960]   So it gives you a stack of photos, a stack and you can flick the photos away.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.880]   You can size them.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.880]   You can turn them.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.880]   All of this with multi touch.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:12.080]   I mean, this capability is built into the phone beautifully.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.400]   I think people are just starting to use it really.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.400]   What would you like to see?
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:19.400]   What are some ideas for how you could use it Nicholas?
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.400]   Let's mostly what I'm trying to explore.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:26.000]   Like wild card is deliberately for trying to see what multi touch can do, just as a toy.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.600]   I don't even know what to think of.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.880]   I think that the multi touch becomes very interesting when you have multiple participants working
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.280]   together.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.440]   The main problem with the iPhone is such a small form factor that you can't do that
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.720]   much.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:42.800]   You can maybe wedge two or three fingers in there, but you can't get double handed minority
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.200]   report fun stuff.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.200]   Right.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.000]   Although I have to say, have you played with jam D and the interface?
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.520]   Oh, no, I haven't yet.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.160]   Oh, you got to take a look because I know this is the first step I've seen that really
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.840]   uses more than just the pinch.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:03.000]   It allows you to rotate and it allows you to flick to send stuff off to the side.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.600]   I mean, yeah, it's not minority report, but it's getting close.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:11.960]   It's something you would never download because it's basically like People magazine.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.040]   Unless you really like movie stars feet.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.800]   You can really zoom in.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.480]   What is your favorite app besides the apps that you've done so far, Nicholas?
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.400]   What is your favorite iPhone app?
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.400]   The phone.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.040]   I can't remember what it is.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.760]   The movie app.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.160]   Is it one tap the movie app?
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.920]   There are different movie apps I want.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:31.920]   A lot of people.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.680]   Box office is the one I've been using the most box office.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.360]   I've been looking for a good movie app.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.400]   I just I constantly go to rotten tomatoes to look for movies and then go to show times
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.640]   and this just does both.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.640]   That's right.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.640]   I want tomatoes.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:49.080]   People really like I want simply named and it's just you know, it gives you a bunch of
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.240]   icons for you know, restaurants, movies, coffee, whatever.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.240]   I want is pretty cool, but it's very simple.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.880]   It's free.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:01.360]   What is the most you could charge for an iPhone app you think?
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.080]   Isn't there one that's hundreds of dollars?
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.280]   Yeah, there are some expensive ones.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.280]   Yeah, it's one that's like 450.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   Really?
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:11.320]   It's like a sales context sort of front end.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.420]   Wow.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:13.420]   That's ridiculous.
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:16.360]   So for the cost of two and a half, I have two and a quarter iPhones.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.640]   I think 10 bucks unless the program is is really exceptional.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.440]   Ten is kind of the limit.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.640]   What's your favorite besides Quicksilver?
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:27.600]   What are you what applications you like on the on the Mac Nicholas?
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:32.120]   I don't really use anything that Apple or I haven't written.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.960]   Really other than fuzzy clock, which I always love.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.640]   I like fuzzy clock fuzzy clock with a clock in your menu bar that says it's saying you
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.140]   know, it's like almost two.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.140]   It's five ish.
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.140]   A little less than one.
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:50.220]   So actually, that's funny that you like that Nicholas because I've tried to evangelize
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.220]   that with a bunch of folks.
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:54.380]   Matt Howie told me about it originally and I it took me.
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:55.380]   He was like, you know what?
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.820]   You're going to try this and you're not going to like it for a couple days, maybe even like
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:58.820]   a week.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:42:59.820]   He's like, but stick with it.
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:00.820]   And I was like, I tried it.
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:04.580]   I put it up there and I was already annoyed like the first time that it said a little after
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.580]   five.
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.740]   I was like, this is so stupid.
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:12.220]   But it's funny because like Quicksilver, it becomes so much more enjoyable when you when
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.580]   you live with it for a while.
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.120]   And then pretty soon you're like, Oh my God, I just realized like how little exactness I
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.960]   need in a clock as long as I have alarms.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:23.640]   Yeah, this is a good point.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:27.120]   Humans don't think in terms of 1201 and 15 seconds.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.040]   That's not a normal way of thinking.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.440]   Right.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.480]   This portion of Mac break weekly has always brought to you by audible.com.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:39.360]   It's where we go to download our download our audio books.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.260]   Love those audio books.
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:46.500]   Tell you what a lifesaver it is for me to be able to download a book and have it within
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:51.400]   minutes playing on my iPhone or my iPod or I could burn CDs played on the computer.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:56.040]   In fact, it plays on almost any portable device, even the Kindle of all things.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:02.280]   50,000 titles, not just books, radio shows, lectures, all sorts of great stuff.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.480]   I highly encourage you to check it out.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:09.880]   A U D I B L E dot com, audible, like get it through their audio books.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:10.880]   They're audible.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:13.680]   You can hear them.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.600]   And incidentally, we have a special deal.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:21.760]   If you're not yet an audible member, I want you to go to audible.com/macbreak and you
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:26.040]   could join audible right now and you could, you could pick a free book, a credit towards
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.800]   almost anything they've got in the audible stores.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:33.480]   There's so many great books for some summertime reading, maybe a mystery, a thriller.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.600]   I like to read history.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:41.680]   Comedy is a huge amount of wonderful, wonderful stuff to choose from.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:45.040]   And they've really improved the sci-fi section.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.040]   They are working hard.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.360]   In fact, I think it's their goal.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:52.640]   Ultimately, I know this is their kind of their mandate to get every book ever written
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.160]   on an audible.com.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:58.520]   That may not happen in my lifetime, but they're working on it.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:04.640]   If you're not yet a member, just visit audible.com/macbreak and join today.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.720]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:14.280]   Let's see, is there any big Apple news we can get to before we get to our picks?
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.000]   I'll tell you what, while I'm looking, let me thank you and Nicholas and let you get back
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.840]   to work because we were only supposed to take 20 minutes of your time and we've taken an
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.840]   hour.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:22.840]   I really appreciate it.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.840]   It's been great to talk to you.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:25.840]   Good to talk to you.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.640]   Thank you so much for Quicksilver.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.160]   The thing you want to plug that's coming up, MacFuse, which you've worked on, is really
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.160]   cool.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.080]   It allows you to use any plug-in, any file system into the Macintosh.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.080]   That's neat.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.080]   Are you excited about XFS?
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.080]   Do you think that's going to be an important?
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.160]   That's part of Snow Leopard, I gather.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.160]   Is EFS or XFS?
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.160]   ZFS, I'm sorry.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.160]   I got my...
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.160]   I'm vaguely excited.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.760]   I like the idea of not having data corrupted to go off and it's like, does.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.760]   We'll see.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.760]   We'll see.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:54.760]   Nicholas, thanks for your time.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.760]   We really appreciate it.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.760]   Sure.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:02.480]   Fresh from his hyperbaric chamber, the webbed one.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.480]   We appreciate your time.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.480]   Take care.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.480]   See you later.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   See you.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.760]   He's so cute.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.760]   He came by one of our broadcasts from...
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.160]   You remember that from the Apple Store.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.160]   My main reaction was, are you 12?
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.680]   And when I first met him, I don't know.
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.160]   It's so funny.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.400]   You get these ideas in your head of what people look like.
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.440]   I always assumed John Gruber would look pretty much like Wallace Sean.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.440]   Yes, me too.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.440]   Because he's kind of caventi.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.920]   Yeah, it's totally just he just seems like he'd be terminally annoyed and correcting
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.920]   people.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.920]   Do not think he has means what you think it is.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.080]   And that's how he talks.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.080]   What's funny?
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:43.000]   Especially when he's had a couple of drinks, that's how he sounds.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.160]   But with him, I was like, why is this devastatingly good looking young man staring at me at the
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:50.160]   Muscone?
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.160]   Exactly.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.120]   He's like, he's a really good looking.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.840]   And I was like, wow, so surprised.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.840]   He's good looking cute.
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.360]   Smartest, smartest nails.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.360]   Yep.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.560]   Do you want me to pass my note at gym class and see if he really likes you?
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.560]   No, no, no, it's okay.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.560]   It's okay.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.560]   Okay.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.000]   That was like, he's taken a bit of a turn.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.880]   But send him a radio button like just Y or N.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.960]   Is that what they do?
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.400]   Is that what the kids do now?
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.400]   That they're right.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.400]   You write a Rails program.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:21.320]   And if you can get it across before it crashes, you can tell whether you love somebody.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.200]   You know, I bet you there are.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.080]   If there were any, well, maybe not.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.080]   I'm just wondering, maybe there are kids doing that.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.080]   You know.
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.280]   People are turning, people are turning books into iPhone apps at this point.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.400]   So like, there's so much, and we should return it at some point because the stupidity has
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.120]   not gone away on the app store.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:41.760]   There continues to be a triple A, you know, space a, a, a, a, a tip calculator, you know,
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.480]   showing up there.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.760]   Why is Apple allowing that and not getting updates in in a timely fashion?
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:52.080]   Can't talk about your product and how it's developed, but like some guy can come up and
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.560]   have a tip calculator that it drives me crazy.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:59.320]   Yeah, those are different decisions, but some of the things that Apple does can be very
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:01.400]   hard to understand.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.000]   Please Apple, just open up the apps.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.240]   You're absolutely better.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.760]   Everybody will be happier.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.800]   This pension for secrecy can go too far.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.440]   And I think it really has in this case.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.560]   Who is it that says the F and NDA?
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.840]   Craig Hockenberry, the guy who does, that's sort of horrific.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:24.040]   I'm with you go to spell out that particular gerund and that particular acronym.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.040]   com.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.240]   You'll find a stream that pulls out all the Twitter's that people have to say things
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.960]   about the effing NDA.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.960]   Is it effing or is it, is it the full adult version?
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.200]   No, no, it's the full gerund.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.200]   Oh, I see it.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.200]   Oh, this is a great site.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.200]   Fing NDA.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.200]   Oh, that's so funny.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.200]   Oh, that's so funny.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.200]   It does.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:48.800]   It does make you wonder what it is.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.840]   As Scott Born said, what is the business case for this?
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:59.440]   And I just think it's corporate, I don't know, it's just a weird corporate situation.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.000]   Let's get to, we want to wrap it up anyway.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.560]   And there isn't a whole lot of Mac news.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:07.840]   I think it was just a great to have on our 100th episode have Alcor.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.240]   Although I'm a little disheartened that so few of you actually use Quicksilver, it may
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:15.240]   be that maybe that it's just you and me Merlin that really came out.
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:17.320]   Well, that's the beauty of it though.
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.720]   You know, this is why we use Macs.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.400]   And this is why we beat the Germans because we want to have a system where everybody gets
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.920]   to use the thing that makes sense to them.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:27.440]   I'm forever being challenged by people who are like, tell me why I should use OmniFocus.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.440]   And I'm like, you shouldn't.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:30.640]   Like, that's so weird.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.320]   That's like me trying to sell you on like moving to mustard.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.680]   It's like, why do I care?
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.440]   Like if that works, something works for you.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:41.440]   Like, don't be such a complete like sociopathic nerd that you think every decision like has
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:45.120]   to, you know, you've got to talk somebody into being who you are.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.040]   That's why that's why the Mac is great.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:51.520]   And an endless number of options for basically doing incredibly powerful things in any way
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.520]   that makes sense to us.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.520]   Hey, let's talk about.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.520]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:55.520]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:58.960]   I was just, I was just going to say, I mean, sometimes you meet somebody who's opinion,
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:04.520]   you respect so much that you have when they disagree with you so completely on something,
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:09.040]   you have to have the humility to take once half a step back and think, maybe I'm wrong.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.880]   Let's just, I'm going to evaluate that.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.840]   I've got there a couple of movie critics like that where if they just hated them, if they
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:17.000]   just love the movie that I just hated, I got to think, okay, I'm going to do that.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.600]   Okay, maybe it wasn't a whirling vortex of purple suck.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.400]   Maybe it was just a point of view problem.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.440]   Oh my God, Andy, you're not going to believe this.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.880]   I have completely changed my mind.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:28.880]   You're right.
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.880]   I have been respecting.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:36.520]   I have been reading and respecting your work for so many years that you literally had to
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.320]   say that one thing to change my mind.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.440]   I could not literally could not be any more in agreement than I am at this moment.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:46.080]   Well, I was, see, that now making me feel it's not as good to turn into the Sammy modeling
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:50.040]   show because that was a lead up at the saying, that's why I keep trying to, I keep trying
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:57.720]   to figure out what it is, how to make Omni-focused work because you're a smart guy.
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:03.920]   When you write stuff, I actually understand the word treatments you use.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:08.160]   And so when I, every time I launch Omni-focus and I say, okay, create task, tag it with
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:12.760]   writing, okay, please find every task that's associated with writing, no tasks.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:13.760]   Okay.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:17.960]   Let's be stupid because clearly this is supposed to, you know, you have to understand, Andy,
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.680]   this is written by people who use e-max.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:25.040]   I mean, man, they're used to, they're used to playing the piano for things to happen
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.280]   on their computer.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:34.160]   I was, as early as late as Mac OS 10.3, I was still using pine and Elm for like most
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.160]   of my internet use.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.880]   So it didn't surprise me a bit.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:37.880]   I've thought about it.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.960]   I thought about going to my, you know.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:45.600]   So how, actually, let me ask you about your Apple core experience because you installed
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.240]   the new Apple core.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.560]   What is it?
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.720]   The ATV.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.240]   Mmm.
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:58.440]   And I have to say, by the way, the Apple TV 2.1 software that lets you use the iPhone
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:05.480]   as a remote is the single most exciting invention since the atom bomb.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:08.720]   You have to wonder if that's one of those things, like what is that story?
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:13.280]   There's that story about the graphing calculator, that famous story about how tenacity and
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:18.720]   and, you know, the kid who worked at Apple for a year without actually working in the
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.440]   world without really working there and like graphing calculator into the OS.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:26.560]   You know, you kind of think, like, I wonder how that slipped in and whether people realize
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:31.920]   what a game changer that was given out, given how unbelievably excreable it is to try and
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.520]   type on the Apple TV.
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.520]   Unbelievable.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:35.520]   This thing.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:38.240]   So what happens is your remote, you know, this, which everybody loves.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.280]   So this is like the number one or two iPhone app, this remote that lets you control iTunes.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.720]   Also now lets you control your Apple TV.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:50.520]   So you see your Apple TV, but you also see on the iPhone, you could browse all your content
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:57.000]   on the Apple TV, including any iTunes it's connected to, start it, stop it, fast forward
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.280]   through it all with this.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:02.040]   I mean, it suddenly makes it like a harmony, one remote.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:05.480]   And when you go to YouTube to do a search or you go to .max, something where you have
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:11.440]   to put in your password as soon as a text field pops up on Apple TV, it also pops up
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:12.440]   on your phone.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.440]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.440]   You type using the Apple keyboard.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.000]   Oh, that's a big improvement.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.400]   Oh, no, that's what I'm saying.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.600]   This is unbelievably useful.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.520]   You imagine that there's going to be a wing of the app store for Apple TV.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.960]   Wouldn't that be a total game changer for that device?
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.480]   Oh, no kidding.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.640]   I wanted this apart on me.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.640]   I just, it's so funny.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:34.080]   I, you know, I never try to overstate like how much my opinions agree with the rest of
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.080]   the world.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:40.080]   And that's never clearer than with the Apple TV because, you know, people like friends
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:45.120]   of mine, like this, we love the Apple TV so much, especially the hacked Apple TV, to
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.160]   be honest, but there's a part of me that keeps thinking, I wonder if this can become
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:51.680]   some kind of, if they're not really going to put the resources into this to really pump
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:56.040]   it out there, I wonder if this could become like the total developers hack on box, like
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:01.520]   really cut the price and really get a little bit flimsy with the security and not even
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:02.520]   security.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.440]   I'm running a Drobo off of my Apple TV now.
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.440]   Well, that's what I want to talk about.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:11.280]   So you have the Apple core ATV, the new one, 3.2 just came out.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.280]   Now,
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:17.720]   3.1, 3.1 is the one you need to have if you're using 2.1 for the Apple.
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:22.280]   3.2 is the new one and 3.1 fixes a really annoying problem with Sapphire.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.280]   Okay.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:28.760]   Because I can't get Nito TV to work because I updated to 2.1 and the Apple software.
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.760]   Yes.
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.480]   So what happened was this is again, and then if you're doing anything with the Apple,
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:38.400]   the Apple core Apple TV stick, you're on pretty thin hacker ice.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.760]   It looks like this is all going to be seamless, but it's still, it's a little bit out there
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:43.760]   what we're doing here.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.960]   So things will break.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:49.400]   But what happens is you buy this program, which you by the way can just download for
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:50.880]   free yourself from Aqua TV.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.880]   It's patch stick.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:53.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.200]   But what this guy's done, which I think is kind of cool is he's taken this stuff and
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.360]   basically made it into an installer with a wizard.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:04.600]   So you create on a USB drive, you create the ability to install these hacks in about 30
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:05.600]   seconds.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.640]   It's so easy and well worth doing it.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:10.680]   The negative is you have to back up your Apple TV to the beginning days.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:11.680]   So you have to-
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:12.680]   You've got exactly.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.360]   You've got to go full restore and so that takes a little while and you're going to lose
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:16.880]   everything you've got on there.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:17.880]   And then you have to-
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:18.880]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:21.680]   And then you have to update to the latest version.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.480]   But once you've done that, it's very simple.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:26.600]   A couple of things in this latest update are just, we're just mind blowing for me.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:30.600]   So, and not show what it does is it's been this project called Aqua TV.
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:32.320]   I think it's you can consider it a project.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:35.640]   And it's a whole bunch of different add-ons for the Apple TV that takes this open source
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:39.400]   functionality and throws it on the Apple TV to let you do stuff the Apple TV won't let
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:40.400]   you do.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.400]   Okay.
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.520]   Now some of it to me is not useful.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:45.520]   Some of it is order Papa John's pizza over your Apple TV.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:46.520]   And I have not done that.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:47.520]   They've not done that.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.520]   They've got dominoes too.
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.520]   So it's two kinds of crappy pizza you don't want.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:50.520]   Oh, sweet.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:51.520]   You can surf the web.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.520]   You can surf the web from your Apple TV.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:53.520]   Don't want to do that.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.120]   Of course, this is modal.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:59.200]   So you would have to stop your movie to go over to surf the web and go to Wikipedia.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.280]   Those things aren't as useful to me.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:01.920]   A couple of things that are amazing.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:06.360]   First of all, it basically installs a little mini version of OS 10.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:11.040]   So you've got, oh, that is to say, you know, what you more standard thinking version where
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.920]   you have a user called front row.
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.360]   And the user called front row has a movies folder and has a music folder and so on and
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:20.200]   so on with a lot of the core OS 10 functionality right there.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.200]   And so you have the ability to go in there and up so now it's been pretty cool.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:29.800]   You could SSH in without any hardware hacking and just drop stuff into this folder.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:34.040]   And then you get stuff like automatic IMDB lookup, you know, sort of like the way CDB
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.280]   does for your music.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:39.480]   This does this for your movies, include posters and it's funny.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:44.600]   You can like so say like you've hypothetically, let's say you have an AVI of your cat playing
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:45.920]   that's in two parts.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:50.760]   You can group, you can select those to be concatenated and it will automatically join
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.840]   them together for you.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.040]   But the game changer is what they've added in this new edition.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.600]   Is it okay to rant about this a little bit?
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:58.440]   No, I'm really I think this is very excited.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:02.080]   And I think, you know, I'm installing I am totally I saw your tweet saying you're able
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.720]   to connect your Drobo to the Apple TV.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.920]   Yeah, I ended up writing a post on it.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.520]   There's three things about this that are pretty amazing.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.240]   The first is that first of all, and now has a GUI installer.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.640]   You don't have to get in the terminal and get your hands dirty.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:17.000]   This this you basically take any USB stick.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.920]   Any sub any one gig or less.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:20.080]   One gig or smaller.
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:22.680]   That's important because it tends to fail at higher sizes.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:26.720]   And this has a little kind of clunky looking wizard, but it installs it for you in, you
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:28.080]   know, a minute or two.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.080]   Very easy.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.080]   That's so great.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.240]   So you don't have to be a hacker.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.640]   Second huge change.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.720]   You don't have to SSH in anymore.
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:39.440]   You can now do vanilla FTP, which means you could create, you know, a new favorite in
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:40.440]   my case in transmit.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:41.440]   That's what I did.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.560]   And I can just drag stuff.
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:46.080]   I have automated actions now where I can drag stuff onto a folder and automatically gets
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.520]   uploaded to the movies folder.
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:49.520]   This is huge.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:54.280]   So easy to use is much more Mac like than the Mac version of this in some ways.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.360]   And then finally it's added USB drive support.
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:57.360]   That's in Nido TV.
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:58.360]   And that's the thing.
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:57:59.360]   Nido TV.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:03.480]   And so you need to go in and make sure you get up to date because basically leopard, there's
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.160]   some leopard stuff that broke last one.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:11.120]   But any long story short, I've got three terabytes hanging off my Apple TV.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:14.920]   What I want to do is I have a little portable drive that I bring to work.
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:16.480]   I download stuff or whatever, put it on there.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:19.120]   I'd like to have it, you know, like a little shuttle drive and then I connect it to the
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.120]   Apple TV.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.120]   It's 320 gigs.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.120]   That's a lot.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.120]   That's plenty of it.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:24.600]   That's hundreds of hours of stuff.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.480]   And I no longer have to FTP.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:29.920]   I no longer have to, you know, go through and rename stuff.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:30.920]   It's just there.
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:31.920]   It shows up and I could play it.
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:34.000]   I mean, this is, this is huge.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   This is revolution.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.080]   And now I can browse it with my iPhone.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.080]   That's right.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:40.040]   And you can also do stuff like install Parian.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:44.160]   There's, if you want, if you don't want to use Sapphire, which I like, you could go jump
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:47.960]   over and use M player, you can pretty much install any kind of OS 10.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:51.280]   I think I might be talking on my butt, but I think basically you drop anything into the
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:54.720]   documents folder that's a, it has an installer on a DMG.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:59.240]   You say smart update, click and it installs whatever's on those DMG.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.240]   So that's pretty powerful.
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.520]   What I have not figured out to do that's my next thing to figure out is how to make
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:09.560]   the Drobo network accessible from, from FTP.
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:13.000]   So in other words, I imagine I could, was somebody who was smarter than me.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.560]   You'd just SSH in and, you know, change a file somewhere to make that a sign, an IP
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.000]   address or something.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.480]   But right now I can only upload into that movies folder.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:26.960]   The mounted drive for me is not showing up as a, oh, I was hoping it would show up.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:27.960]   Okay.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:28.960]   Well, I, I wonder if you can.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:29.960]   It would not surprise me if that was, man.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:31.520]   So you still have to copy files over.
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:34.760]   You can't just put a drive on there and play what's on the drive.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.160]   You could SSA or FTP.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:40.200]   I guess more likely, SSH in, but it would have to be a good manually.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.200]   Oh, see, that's just the point.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.560]   I want to be able to play directly off that external drive.
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.000]   Well, yeah, you still can't play off there.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.120]   What I did was I moved, no, no, absolutely.
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:49.120]   No, no, no.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.640]   First, first thing I did was take all of my cumulative movies, throw them on the Drobo,
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.520]   then hook it up and it's right there.
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:55.520]   Just maps.
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:56.520]   Okay.
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:57.520]   Okay.
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.000]   And so right under Sapphire, it says identify this as a collection and then it surfs it
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.760]   in one movie, one TV show at a time by TV show.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:06.920]   I mean, films with my cat, it will go and look all that information up for you.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.920]   That's the beauty of it.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.320]   And it knows, you know, I used to go through and rename stuff.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.520]   It knows this is a series.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.520]   This all goes together.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.000]   I mean, it's really neat.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.560]   It's like 50 bucks.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:20.280]   And like I say, if you're, and of course, you know, the sneering e-max people will point
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:23.480]   out that you could just go to awkward TV and do all this yourself, but you could also
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.560]   line your own breaks and make your own catch up.
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.720]   This is a nice, nice thing.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.720]   It's 50 bucks.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.920]   I'm going to make that your pick.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920]   That's my pick.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.640]   Good night, everybody.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.640]   It's my pick too.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.640]   I'm just really excited.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.120]   Andy, do you have a pick of the week?
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.120]   Yes.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:43.680]   And this is based on the fact that for the past 73, 78 weeks, we've been complaining about
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.480]   how back to my Mac is a wonderful screencast demo.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.560]   The 10 points out of 10 to Apple for creating a really wonderful page on a website that
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.800]   demonstrates how this feature should work, ideally.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.200]   But this idea of being anywhere in the world and being able to access our Mac regardless
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.080]   of whether we have a virtual public, virtual private network or whatever, up or not, doesn't
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:07.320]   actually so much work so much as it fails.
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:13.720]   So I've been playing around with the utility called FarFinder that is not exactly back
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:14.720]   to my Mac.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:19.080]   Back to my Mac is wonderful because you can actually turn any iMac or any Mac you're in
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.480]   front of into your own home Mac and get screen share.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.760]   You can get everything.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:27.920]   But when you think when I think that what I really want to do is I want to be able to
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:33.760]   get at a file that I may have left behind or copy something from my remote hard drive,
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.480]   my local hard drive.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.440]   So, just a little stuff like that.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.320]   FarFinder is a third part of utility.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.200]   It costs 35 bucks.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:46.680]   It is a web based interface to the contents of your Mac.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:52.760]   Once you set up the client, the host application on your home Mac and it's not difficult to
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:02:00.320]   do, then you simply have a custom URL that always points back to your that specific Macintosh.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:06.200]   So from any Mac, any PC, any Unix, Unix machine, you can then simply bring up this URL login
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.240]   and then get your entire file system.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.880]   They also have an iPhone interface.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:18.240]   So again, if you need to view a Word file, you can just simply go back to launch a FarFinder,
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.960]   go back and then navigate, drill down to the documents folder, find what you want and read
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.960]   it.
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:27.200]   It has some really cool little tweaks to it.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:31.800]   You can't do simple things like drag a file from out of the FarFinder window into the
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.240]   Finder window you're in front of right now.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.440]   But you can do things like just like, especially if you're on the iPhone, click on a file.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.560]   If my editor never got something that I emailed her this morning or if I was supposed to send
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.480]   it to her personal address instead of her business address, now that's absolutely not
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.480]   a problem.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.680]   I can just again, navigate to that document, click on it and then to simply directly from
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:56.240]   the web interface, say, please email this file to this person and it just gets transmitted
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.680]   and emailed.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:01.120]   But that's only about 60% of why it's so cool.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:06.800]   The other 40% is that it does things that Apple should have hardwired into back to my
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:07.800]   Mac.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.600]   If you can't get it up and running on the first click, it really does walk you through
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:16.800]   what the problem might be and gives you suggestions on what you should start trying.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:21.360]   And then it's almost practically asked you questions like, okay, when you've done that,
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.360]   click this button and I'll see if that fixed it.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:28.360]   Nope, that didn't try it.
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.080]   So once you go back in Assistant Preferences, go into Security because obviously it's not
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.080]   doing something very simple.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:35.600]   It's not obviously not doing something as safe as not letting people access your Mac
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.600]   remotely.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.640]   So there needs to be a certain amount of caution.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.200]   You have to drill holes in your firewall to make sure that this works properly, make
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:49.200]   sure that the FAFR Finder has the ability to access that thing remotely.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.280]   But once you get the key is though, I've been using it for the past couple of weeks,
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:57.200]   once you get it up and running, it runs.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.560]   Meaning you can go to that business trip, you can go for a month to the far east.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:05.120]   If it's running by the time when you leave for the airport, as long as your Mac doesn't
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.520]   go to sleep, so no one steals it, as long as the cat doesn't barf on the keyboard and
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.400]   cause a short circuit, it will continue to work.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:16.040]   It's not this thing where you've got to sit back to my Mac where you get it set up just
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.040]   fine.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.680]   You think you're okay until three days, you get to the hotel just screwing around.
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.280]   You think, oh, I want to get a copy of that comic strip I downloaded.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.800]   And of course you can get the comic strip.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:30.640]   But three days later, when, oh my God, thank God, I've got a backup copy of the presentation
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.960]   back home when it's your butt on the line.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.760]   Of course, that's when back to my Mac doesn't work.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:40.120]   So anyway, 35 bucks, not the cheapest piece of shareware, but it works fine.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:43.200]   And for a lot of people, it's going to be what they were hoping back to my Mac was from
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.200]   day one.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.960]   Hey, if it works, it's all I care about.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.200]   Man, why isn't Apple getting that working?
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.200]   I don't understand.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:53.920]   It's so bad that it almost feels like, like you just forget about it and it would just
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.000]   become a security hole for.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   Exactly.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.440]   It's like suddenly you go, Hey, there's this new thing where I can make money by taking
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.680]   my door off the hinges.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.520]   It doesn't work.
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.720]   I'm not going to make any money, but I think I'll just leave my door off the hinges.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:08.720]   Let's see what happens.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.720]   Oh, jeez.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.220]   All right.
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.220]   That's a good recommendation.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:14.220]   Thank you.
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:16.000]   I'm going to make a note of that and give that a try.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.120]   I am still playing with iPhone apps.
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.240]   And it's been a little disappointing because while the store opened with 600 apps, it seems
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.240]   like only four new ones.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:26.000]   They don't seem like the whole lot of new ones all the time.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.040]   I wish there were more new ones, but I have to say there have been some kind of surprises
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:33.520]   as I've browsed through some of these applications.
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:38.640]   Well, for one thing, there's almost 400 games in there now and there's some really fun,
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:39.640]   interesting games.
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:44.360]   I found one called Subway Shuffle that is just so much fun.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.360]   It's a puzzle game.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.760]   But the one I'm going to recommend is called Save Benjis.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.560]   Have you guys seen this?
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.560]   Yes.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.000]   I'm really happy with this.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.600]   This is kind of what Alex was talking about.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:06:01.280]   We really wanted a program that you could go up to a barcode, snap a picture of it,
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:04.280]   and then have it search the databases for prices.
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:05.720]   It's not quite as easy as that.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.240]   I wish we're doing that.
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:13.720]   It doesn't, you don't yet, you can't yet enter in a, take a picture of a barcode, but
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:18.480]   you can't enter in the barcode number or the manufacturer or the product name or product
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:25.080]   number and do searches in your iPhone for other places that offer this and prices.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:30.240]   So I'm going to, I just a search for a Nikon, let's say the Nikon D300.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.600]   Let's see what prices it includes.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:37.680]   eBay, but also many other stores and it sorts it by price.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.000]   So you could find the lowest price.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.040]   So when you're in a store and you say, you know, I want to buy this, is this a, you know,
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.960]   is this even close, is this ballpark to what I might find on the internet?
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.000]   You can, you can get that information right on your phone.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.920]   I think this is a very cool application.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.120]   I really like it.
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:57.080]   That's just another articulation of how your life is vastly improved when you have an iPhone
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:01.960]   in your pocket because I mean, I go to the MIT flea market all the time and I'll see something
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:06.920]   I have never seen before in my life and I'm willing to hand over whatever it costs to
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:10.680]   own it, to make it part of my family, to make it part of my future.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:13.120]   But of course, you know, you don't have the ability to say, you know what, that's like
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.600]   a 10 year old spectrum analyzer.
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:19.560]   You can buy it on eBay for $8 instead of say, $85, Andy.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.560]   Exactly.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.800]   That's the, so I'm really excited.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.800]   This is, that's the whole idea, the promise of having a portable, really a portable computer
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.920]   that happens to have a phone in your pocket.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.880]   Of course, this would work on an iPod touch as well.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:33.280]   I think a lot of people with touches are going to get a lot of the benefits of that.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.880]   How long thing is going to be before you'll see those little signs at grocery stores?
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:40.160]   Saying no, no iPhones allowed in the store.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:46.680]   Or just a sign saying automatically anybody who brings in an iPhone pays double automatically.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:51.480]   Well, they already have the signs to say for better service, get the hell off your phone.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:54.320]   But now they have another reason to do that.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.600]   That's a really great application.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:59.320]   I mentioned earlier, I want, which is a, is very simple free.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:04.040]   By the way, free, the Benjis is, say Benjis is free as would you would expect for a program
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.240]   that's trying to save you money.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.160]   I want is also free, very simple.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:13.560]   Just puts up on the screen 12 icons for bars, restaurants, coffee, shopping, movies.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:18.920]   You just press the, press the icon and it knows where you are and immediately finds that category
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.040]   for movies gives you the movie times.
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:25.000]   It's a very simple, it's not an elaborate program, but another great free program.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.840]   I'm just seeing so many wonderful applications here and a lot of them are free.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.400]   Oh, and we got to mention since when we talked about one password, one password now has
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.000]   an iPhone app.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   Have you seen that?
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.160]   It syncs automatically with your iPhone.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:42.960]   And that's that's you don't have to hit the sync button manually.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:43.960]   You mean?
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.360]   No, it's waiting.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:47.600]   It's not sinking to your Safari anymore.
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.440]   It's an iPhone app for one password.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.640]   Oh, run.
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:55.160]   Do not walk to the app store and download it.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.200]   It syncs up via Wi-Fi to your database.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.360]   Your iPad, one password database is now on your phone.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:02.880]   Free.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.960]   I think we're very close to starting a brand new iPhone app store drinking game where every
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:13.480]   time you see an application that does not require some sort of online sign up component,
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:15.440]   that's when you drink.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:18.120]   Well, this is you don't have to sign up for anything.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.120]   It's free.
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.960]   If you just want to use it, password protected to store notes you could.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:27.640]   But if you're a one password owner, it syncs up to your Mac and now your database is on
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.640]   there.
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.640]   And that is fantastic.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.040]   All your passwords, all your information there is fantastic.
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.000]   Makes one password really a useful application.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   We're out of time, guys.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.560]   It was so great to have Alcor on with us, Nicholas Jikkoff.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.360]   I'm sorry, we lost in the process.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:47.600]   We should like, this is like one of those monster movies where just, you know, the two
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.880]   people being paid the most are going to survive to the end.
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:52.200]   Like the cute guy and the cute girl.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.720]   But the weird looking tech guy, he's gone.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.440]   The night watchman, he's gone.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.520]   The guy in the red shirt gone.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.880]   The guy, guy, guy, guy having intercourse behind the cabin.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.880]   He's gone.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:06.720]   Yeah, you know, he's gone first because there's, there's always morality plays so that, you
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.040]   know, the more they're having fun, the more likely they're going to offer.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.680]   That means that one of us is probably like, and this is actually the murderer who's been
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.240]   blaming it on the monster in the world.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.520]   Scott born, we'll never forget him.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:23.840]   Alex Lindsey, we, he gave his all in the service of Mac Break Weekly, our 100th episode.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.960]   They dropped off in Skype and we weren't able to get him back.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.960]   Skype was just not giving us a good day today.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:33.680]   But fortunately, we managed to muddle our way through a show.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:36.880]   We're playing the game on expert level where, you know, it's more difficult to get to the
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:37.880]   end of the stage.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.400]   I wonder, you know, I should try to get Alex back on because before we wrap up, because
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:48.040]   this really, the idea for doing the show was Alex Lindsey's and we aren't here at our 100th
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.040]   episode.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.360]   Alex was a guy who came up with the video show Mac Break, came up with a name for it.
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.640]   And somewhat later, not much later, maybe a month or two later, said, hey, we ought
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:01.840]   to really do a podcast, an audio version of this.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.200]   And it was a joint venture of Pixel Core and Twit for a while.
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:09.880]   And finally, at some point, I think we just said, I'll take over the audio.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:11.680]   You continue to do the video.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.160]   And it's stayed that way ever since.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.240]   And I credit to Alex Lindsey.
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.880]   This show wouldn't exist.
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.000]   How do you not start started Mac Break video and then said, let's do audio.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   Are you there?
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   Are you there, Alex?
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   No, can't get him.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   Are you guys still there?
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   I are still there.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   Good.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.760]   Because if you're gone, then I'm the murderer.
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.600]   I don't want to be the murderer.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.320]   Thank you, everybody, for 100 great episodes.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.040]   And here's to 100 more.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.120]   Another Mac Break is brown.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:56.720]   [MUSIC]
