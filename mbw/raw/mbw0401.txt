[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.200]   Again.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.720]   Again.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.640]   Tell us, Nick, come on in.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.080]   He's in town once more.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.600]   Hi, Alex.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.040]   Good to see you.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.560]   Good to see you.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.160]   It was nice because you were here when Pumplamus was here on Sunday.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.660]   I was.
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.640]   We're Saturday.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.840]   They fell in love with you.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.000]   In fact, they sent us an email saying, forget you guys.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.640]   Who is that guy we talked to next door with a green screen?
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.800]   And the mocap.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.560]   Oh, he's coming.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.000]   Oh, I have to admit, I thought they were coming on Monday.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.720]   Surprised.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.360]   And so I was at home.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.880]   And the only reason that I came in was because I looked over and Lisa
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.560]   had posted something on G+ and he was like,
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.560]   and I came in.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.760]   Obviously, I was very scruffy when I showed up.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.040]   Oh, but they were happy to talk to you.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.000]   So it was a good thing you came in.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.440]   They're great.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.680]   And I think they'll be a lot of fun.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.200]   They'll be a lot--
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.960]   They'll explain that.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.040]   I'll explain that in a second.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.080]   But first, the rest of the crew, Renee Ritchie from iMore.com
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.280]   in beautiful Montreal, where his X-Men comic has pushed
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.440]   I-C-E-O to the background.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.560]   It looks like Steve's like, I'm Ian.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.520]   I'm Ian.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.120]   Over from the lens.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.800]   He's just chilling.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.440]   It's dark in there.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.320]   He's having me in.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.480]   Hey, hey, I'm back here.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.120]   Hey, behind the iPhone.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.760]   Hey, it's me, Steve.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.080]   Mine are snuggie, but not boarded and not graded.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.240]   And there was Obi-Wan Kenobi, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.480]   No, no, no, that's Obi-Bob Kenobi.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.080]   Obi-Bob--
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.600]   The new one.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.480]   --as Obi-Wan.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.520]   Bob Newhart is Obi-Wan.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.760]   Yes.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.400]   He was on Big Bang Theory last week.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.280]   He says--
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.480]   So OK, forgive me, Bob.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.080]   He's still alive.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.080]   Good heavens.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.680]   OK, forgive me, Bob.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.760]   Not only is Bob Newhart still alive,
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.960]   but he is still Bob Newhart, Leo.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.960]   Wow.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.760]   Were that any of us at any age could make that claim?
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.680]   You know, I want to now watch Big Bang Theory
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.800]   so I could see Bob Newhart as Obi-Wan.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.400]   That's a great-- that's good.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   That's great.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.680]   I like it.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.440]   So-- oh, my God.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.240]   iOS 7 doesn't encrypt email attachments.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.240]   Ish.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.040]   [LAUGHS]
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.520]   Renee, you posted the calm down, everybody posts.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.080]   So why don't you explain this?
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.040]   It seems to be happening more and more often lately
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.600]   is there's a security story and no one bothers to read it,
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.480]   and then they post really, really scary things
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.680]   to get people afraid.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.640]   So we looked into it.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.880]   The best we could to find out about it,
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.360]   I've actually got a chance to speak to someone from Apple
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.320]   and got a comment on it.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.520]   And it turns out that, yes, there is a problem
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.240]   with email attachment encryption on the iPhone,
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.560]   but it only affects people who are using an iPhone
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.400]   for currently because the other versions of iOS
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.280]   can't be jailbroken.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.760]   And you need to be able to get past someone's passcode
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.920]   to use this bug.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.360]   So you have to have physical access to the device?
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.760]   Yes, prolonged physical access.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760]   You have to use jailbreak tools to get into it.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.280]   You have to be able to get into the file system
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.040]   and then pull out the email attachments.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.400]   If there's no passcode, of course,
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.680]   you can just launch mail.app.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.240]   I mean, there's no need to use any exploit.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.680]   So once again, always, always use your passcode.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.560]   But because the iPhone 4 is the only one
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.960]   with a physical hardware jailbreak,
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.400]   you can get past that on anything, including iOS 7.1.1.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.720]   There's no jailbreak for the iPhone 4S, 5S, on iOS 7.1.1.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.880]   So you're safe if you've got a passcode or a password
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.040]   or touch ID enabled.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.720]   OK, so nothing to worry about.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.560]   I mean, I think we need a grading system on exploits.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.480]   The DEF CON system?
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.000]   Yes.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.920]   That's a good idea.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.400]   Cool.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.680]   So this one's on a scale of 0 to 5.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.320]   This is DEF CON 1.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.880]   Other way, so 1 is a really, really bad.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.400]   Oh, god.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.400]   And this DEF CON--
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.320]   I don't think there's zero.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.960]   There's just one.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.960]   And one can use that.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.400]   One can use that.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.720]   One can get a little more.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.840]   So I didn't watch war games closely enough, apparently.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.480]   All right.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.000]   So this is a DEF CON 4.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.320]   It's not a 5, which would be everybody relax.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.840]   If you have an iPhone 4 and someone manages
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.120]   to get physical possession of it,
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.280]   they can get to your email attachments.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.360]   That's the worst case scenario.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.680]   The best case scenario is you have iPhone 4s or higher,
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.240]   and you have a passcode, and you are perfectly safe.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.720]   As long as you're on iOS 7.1.1.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.520]   And they'll fix it.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.200]   Yes, Apple is working on a fix now.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.840]   I mean, some people are upset they haven't fixed it already.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.840]   I don't have any direct knowledge.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.320]   When did they break it?
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.120]   It was broken in iOS 7.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.760]   It was reported previously.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.280]   I don't have any direct knowledge of it.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.880]   What I understanding is that there is, of course,
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.920]   a priority list of bugs.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.760]   Like, a code to fail is very high priority.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.720]   OK, here we go.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.000]   Defcon 5 fade out, lowest state of readiness, normal readiness,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.240]   blue.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.840]   Defcon 4, double take.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.920]   Whoa!
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.920]   Increased intelligence watch and strengthen security measures
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.640]   above normal readiness.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.360]   It's really a definite--
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.800]   And I think we're--
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.600]   I think we-- I think we generally hang--
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.880]   I think that we are always at Defcon 4.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.520]   We're almost always--
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.840]   Oh, now we're going to get into a national--
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.600]   Now go back to it because I want--
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.080]   We're at 5.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.080]   Currently at 5.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.560]   Wow.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.080]   Who's that?
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.080]   We've been with all this stuff in Ukraine.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.480]   That web page is not inspiring, as terms of--
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.640]   It's number one when you Google Defcon.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.240]   So I'd like to think that it was designed right
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.960]   about the time of war games, I think.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.480]   Probably.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.200]   Do you want your radiations reports?
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.880]   Here's the radiations reports, if you need them.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.400]   It's got weather too, so you know whether the missiles are
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.560]   going to deal with the units.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.160]   You know what?
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.840]   This is-- wait, OK.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.240]   So all right, very nice.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.520]   So Defcon 3 roundhouse, that means that's a punch, right?
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.200]   Exercise term, roundhouse.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.440]   Increased enforce readiness above that required
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.640]   for normal readiness, air force, ready to mobilize
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.800]   at 15 minutes.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.480]   Defcon 2, fast pace.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.200]   Those code names?
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.640]   Exercise item, term.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.760]   Yeah, but I understand.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.880]   But why?
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.920]   Well, are we exercising?
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.480]   I think that's like the internal--
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.480]   Oh, it's the term.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.280]   So if it's an exercise, it would be not Defcon 2,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.520]   but fast pace.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.080]   Next step to nuclear war.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.840]   Armed forces ready to deploy and engage in less
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.720]   than six hours of Defcon 1, cocked pistol, nuclear war
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.480]   is imminent.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.280]   Well, that's good.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.520]   I said Defcon 1, and I meant Defcon 4.8, I think.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.480]   Can you do points?
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.800]   Seems like such a--
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.600]   The Swedish judge says Defcon 6.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.680]   Oh, OK.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.640]   It is a security exploit.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.080]   Apple has to fix it, but it's relatively--
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.880]   it's not low priority, but it's not the highest priority.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.160]   No.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.960]   Here's another number.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.960]   $68 million.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.680]   That's what Angela Arran gets the new chief of retail at Apple.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.800]   Stock grants worth $68 million today,
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.360]   although the way Apple stocks been going up
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.720]   could be worth more tomorrow.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.280]   Not bad.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:20.880]   Well played.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.600]   113,334 restricted stock units.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.920]   That's nice when you get a job and they give you money
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.880]   before you do any.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.480]   More than John Brallitt.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.920]   Well, I think she has to stay with a company for--
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.040]   They don't vest till 2018.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.040]   Right.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.040]   4 whole years.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.040]   You give it to the beginning.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.600]   You say give them to the beginning, so they stay for four years.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.920]   Brallitt got only up.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.000]   Only.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.520]   Only.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.480]   Only $60 million when he was hired.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.520]   That was the predecessor.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.560]   But he was hired in 2012.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.760]   He didn't make it, so I bet he didn't invest it.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.240]   No.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.360]   Well, now wait a minute.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.120]   Because he was let go, right?
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.920]   Do they give golden parachute, Leo?
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.360]   Yeah, I'm thinking golden parachute.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.960]   It's called golden handcuffs until you're fired,
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.680]   then it's a golden parachute.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.680]   Exercise term.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.040]   It was a really, really heavy golden haircut.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.040]   It's all I'd say.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.040]   $60 million.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.040]   So what happened to your hair?
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.040]   What is going on with your hair?
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.280]   Top was down on the way here.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.840]   And I just haven't been able to comment down again.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.040]   So that's what happened.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.520]   So I have this crazy--
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.560]   What top was down on--
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.560]   Oh, my convertible.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.560]   Your convertible.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.560]   What kind of car?
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.120]   I have an old-- I have a very old BMW.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.120]   Yes, to say old, because otherwise--
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.120]   I do.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.120]   I don't want them to--
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.120]   A little bit beamer.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.240]   Yeah, 2005 beamer.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.520]   And my kids love me to take them to school in the convertible
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.520]   with the top down.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.520]   That's like they're big.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.520]   Yeah, they look.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.680]   You should see the other guy.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.400]   Well, no, usually then I get all cleaned up.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.960]   But on the way here, top was down.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.960]   I was like, you know what?
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.960]   Leave it.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.960]   Leave it.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.960]   It's my crazy look.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.960]   I love it.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.600]   Enjoy it by next Mac break it'll all be short again.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.600]   It's the time.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.600]   You know what happens?
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.880]   Aaron was hired from Burberry, where she was CEO.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.880]   So you got to give her a little more.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.880]   She's pretty amazing.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.880]   And somebody pointed out--
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.880]   We've pointed out--
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.880]   You have?
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.960]   Well, she used to do a lot of Salesforce events.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.960]   So--
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.480]   Oh, you know Angela.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.560]   I'm sorry, Dame.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.560]   And--
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.920]   Yeah, so she-- I mean, she's a pretty cool person.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.560]   So anyway, it was a very, very good hire on their part.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.920]   I mean, they basically built up Burberry the way it is.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.800]   And it's become quite a brand.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.800]   So--
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.160]   Retail is so important to add.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.160]   Super smart.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.960]   And she really understands the next generation of retail.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.120]   I mean, that's what they really--
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.720]   really responsive, very techy.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.640]   So it was definitely a much better mix for what Apple does.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:47.640]   So it's a nuanced and high end view of retail.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.760]   The company himself said, this isn't just--
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.760]   this isn't your father's head of retail.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.480]   This is a newly created executive level position.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.480]   Retail is--
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.680]   And retail is online in retail.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.680]   It's so-- this stuff's so important to Apple at this point
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.720]   that it is really-- you really, you're up there.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.320]   You're in the stratosphere.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.120]   I think Ben Thompson pointed out that being
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.720]   head of retail is the closest there is to being
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.840]   like a president or a CEO at Apple.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.120]   That's who it was.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.840]   I was trying to remember Mr. Tekery.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.000]   One of the bigger questions is going to be, though, what
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.760]   is Apple trying to pick up crumbs I think they were missing
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.560]   earlier, or are they just going to stay the course as they're
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.280]   doing right now?
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.280]   Well, that's the interest.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.360]   I think has been pointed out.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.280]   Same store sales were down 5% last quarter.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.480]   And have been hovering at zero growth for several quarters.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:38.480]   So I don't know if that's Apple decline or retail decline,
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.480]   but that's not good.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.760]   Because they have opened a lot of new stores, 19--
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.240]   but they have 19 stores in Japan, China, and Hong Kong.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.520]   That's not as many, Ben says, as they ought to have.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.640]   They weren't directionless, but they didn't have a head of
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.240]   retail for--
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.640]   even if you include Broward for a couple of years, since Ron
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.320]   Johnson left.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.480]   So it's important to have someone with a vision in there,
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.080]   not just influencing the same policies over and over again.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.720]   I mean, I still think they hold the record for the most
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.760]   amount of-- they make the most amount of money per square
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.200]   foot for a retailer in the world.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   I don't know if that's the stat for an Apple--
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.120]   an Apple store.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.280]   My biggest problem with Apple stores is even with all the
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.200]   stuff that they've done, I still go to buy an iPhone and
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.920]   I end up waiting 45 minutes to talk to somebody about it.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.560]   And all I want to do is walk in and buy it.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.640]   It's not during the lines or anything else.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.000]   It's just a process.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.560]   You press the button on the iPad that says
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.920]   "representative Alex."
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.120]   Is there a button on the iPad that says "representative?"
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.120]   Yes.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.120]   You also take advance of that.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.480]   Those are big, thick, heavy tables.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.880]   So if you want, you can climb up right at the top there and
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.280]   shout, "Do you know who I am?"
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.720]   I worked on Star Wars.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:50.920]   She is famous for taking Burberry and making it somewhat
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.560]   of a stylish brand.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.560]   I mean, she doesn't need to do that.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.160]   No, but that's a useful skill.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.440]   If you're bringing in the ability to understand how to best
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.400]   serve people who are already very well disposed to give this
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:08.880]   company your money, that's not the same challenge as trying
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.360]   to convince somebody who can buy their snow tires at pretty
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.880]   much any depot anywhere to pick your place instead of the rest.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.840]   I mean, just like Alex said, I've had that same experience
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.480]   too at Apple stores where the one thing that could even
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.960]   claim is the negative experience is having to wait a
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.720]   long, long time to do something very, very simple,
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.160]   simply because it has become sort of like a clubhouse,
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.000]   a combination between a clubhouse and an embassy.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.560]   Well, and I think that what she understands, I mean, what
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.840]   Burberry really built on was the brand.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.680]   I mean, the idea of Burberry, the idea of, you know, in much
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.720]   in the same way that Apple builds on that.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.240]   So I think understanding that high-end brand, that high-end
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.480]   mentality, I think, is something that their last had a
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.680]   retail to not understand at all.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.920]   You know, so I think that that, because he came from a
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.000]   discount, electronics store that really is horrible if you've
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.640]   ever been to--
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.840]   How it was from Britain.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.360]   Dixon's or whatever.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.920]   It wasn't Dixon's.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.480]   Just with-- you know, they still sell BGA monitors.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.440]   And his predecessor, Ron Swanson, went to--
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.400]   I mean, Johnson, went to--
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.560]   Those tables were very well made.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.040]   Went to pennies, I believe.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:19.240]   Was it--
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.280]   Came on or--
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.280]   Or the pennies.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.400]   And then tried to make that on a scale.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.960]   And then ended up getting--
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.080]   I think with Burberry's as well, we're also very successful.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.200]   I believe in penetrating the Asian market with retail, which
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.480]   is something Apple really wants to do.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.320]   See, now you're kicking it.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.320]   It's not the--
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.440]   Oh, I get all trendy.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.880]   It's they got into Asia.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.640]   Look at this graph.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.400]   This is-- this is to the point of two points that Apple
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.200]   retail has to solve.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   One, they have to penetrate new markets.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.080]   And they have to penetrate lower-end markets.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.800]   This is Facebook--
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.720]   this is a weird graph, so I'm going to explain it.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.360]   Facebook Monthly Active Users by Platform, Android or iOS
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.360]   Android is black, iOS is light gray, Greenwich, Connecticut.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.720]   20% Android, 80% iOS and Greenwich.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.360]   And I bet they wear a lot of Burberry too there.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.640]   San Francisco, well, now it's twice that, 40% Android.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.520]   New York City, 45%.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.680]   Total USA about 45%.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.600]   Detroit, OK, 58%.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.240]   Global, and a little over 60%.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:26.840]   India, 92% Android is the tiny little sliver of iOS.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.800]   Now that's just Facebook, but I think that's probably pretty
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.520]   close to the overall mobile usage.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.960]   And so it shows you that while iPhone does great amongst
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:45.440]   our core cohorts in Silicon Valley and Montreal, in Baston,
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:52.360]   less so in the US total, even less so in poor parts of the US,
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.200]   and really less so globally.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.040]   So this is an opportunity as well as a challenge.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.880]   It's important to remember though with the global stat,
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.720]   like in countries like India, the cell phone market is abysmal.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.760]   The government does not allow a lot of competition there.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.880]   Getting a cheap phone is really important, but some phones are
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.800]   sold only with a Facebook plan.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.400]   So you can get just like you could usually get a BBM plan
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.240]   in the old days.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.440]   You can buy a phone whose only service for a few pennies
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.600]   as Facebook access.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.040]   And that super cheap Android phone will have astronomical
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.200]   Facebook usage in that market.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.720]   So this stuff still needs segmentation
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.920]   before it's really useful.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.760]   OK, yeah.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.880]   Exactly what Renee said.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.160]   Also Facebook's been working very, very hard
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.640]   to make those plans very, very easy for a local telco
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.200]   to implement and enforce.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.400]   Do you not think that Apple needs to do that too?
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.760]   I think they need to be a global company.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.120]   They need to be a force in every single country in which they
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.480]   are capable of operating.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.520]   However, their only limitation is that they have emphatically
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.480]   produced a product line that is not
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.120]   inclined towards making cheap stuff.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.800]   And sometimes cheap means flimsy, plastic, floats on water,
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.680]   that sort of stuff.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.200]   And sometimes just means that affordable to a widest range
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:04.720]   of people.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.040]   The reason why they've got so many hundreds of billions
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.440]   of dollars to have pillow fights with in the comments area
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.640]   every Tuesday afternoon is that they are going for the high end,
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.560]   high markup people.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.760]   And that I think that unless they
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.800]   were to change that strategy and really
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.600]   change their thinking in a fundamental way,
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.200]   I think they have to be resigned to the fact
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.120]   that there's going to be markets that they're just never
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.440]   going to reach, which is fine because, again, this
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.800]   is so profitable for them that they can continue
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.880]   to manufacture their own destiny, which is not something
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.400]   that most companies get to do these days.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.720]   I mean, yeah, I mean, look at--
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.360]   I mean, there are definitely car companies that
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.880]   are not trying to reach India.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.320]   You know, so that people have to decide.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:42.840]   Right.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.200]   People have to decide what they can--
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.200]   They're not big tatas, they're little tatas.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.360]   I wasn't going to go down that path.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.480]   Isn't that the number one?
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.600]   Is there a car that was like a little--
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.520]   Is that not the car of zuos?
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.240]   They're called tatas.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.800]   It is the car that is the tatas that I videoed.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.320]   When you first said it, I was going to go down there,
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.440]   and I was like, I'm going to pause,
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.440]   and then I'm going to drive the big tatas down the streets
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.120]   of some of most of these cities in India.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.000]   You need--
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.400]   It's important to have a small tatas.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   For small tatas.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.880]   They're not called tatas.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.560]   No, the tatas, the brand name.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.080]   Tonton.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.120]   No, no, we're not talking about those.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:17.960]   OK.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.600]   No, we're talking about small parts.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.920]   So I'm talking about the largest Indian automobile
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.600]   manufacturer, Tata Motors.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.400]   Oh, I've learned this right.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.320]   Today I learned.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.960]   Today you learned about tatas.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.680]   Well, mark that in your book.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.320]   Bit gravity, for instance, is owned by Tata.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.200]   Bit gravity are, bit gravity?
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.440]   Is owned by Tata Motors?
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.400]   I love Tata.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.720]   Not Tata Motors, but Tata.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.080]   I think Tata's--
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.560]   I've been a Tata fan since--
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.240]   Yes, in Berlin.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.520]   So if you were to go into your server room,
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.320]   where there'd be 100 students clinging
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.960]   to the side of every single server?
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.200]   That's not just a regional thing.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.280]   By the way, they own Jaguar and Lando Rover.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:01.840]   Londra.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.280]   They're kind of like Samsung in a way that outside of there,
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.080]   I think they have a lot of-- not just Tata Motors,
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.520]   but Tata makes all kinds of stuff.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.440]   I mean, it's like one of those--
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:13.760]   Their newest utility vehicle is the Tata Nano.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.800]   Smaller brand name?
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.480]   Small Tata, I'm telling you.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   We're going to take a break.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.960]   When we come back, we are going to take questions
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.440]   from the audience and our--
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:21.840]   Yes.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.760]   Our question engine is it Bitly, B-I-T dot L-Y.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.840]   That's the shortener we're using.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.760]   That's not our server.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.200]   It's B-I-T dot L-Y slash.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.440]   M-B-W-4-0-1.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.920]   It's actually-- today it's M-B-401,
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.680]   because someone already took M-B-W.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.040]   Who would do that?
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.800]   Exactly.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.320]   Exactly.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.320]   That's why I'm making sure across the streets.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.000]   I went there to find them to draw them, but--
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.080]   M-B-4-0-1.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.920]   That's correct.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.920]   And so when you go there, you could watch the stream there,
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.680]   because Alex is very kindly put the stream.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.800]   But if you're already watching the stream,
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.120]   please don't open another stream, because that would be.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.880]   You can also-- if you're there and you don't want
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.400]   to have a stream and a stream, you can also just--
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.560]   you can pop out the stream and then pop out the video
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.760]   and close the window.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.840]   And then you'll just have text.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.200]   That's very cool.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.440]   So I'm popping out the video.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.360]   Now your full screen, so it's hard to do that.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.400]   Oh.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.640]   And then I'm going to close this tab.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.160]   And now you're just--
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.080]   Now I have eight questions on their tab
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.800]   that's just the questions.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.800]   M-B-4-0-1, B-I-T.out.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.240]   Well, you know what?
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:19.760]   What happened?
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.440]   Didn't we have our own shortener tweet.im?
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.120]   We got to do that.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.160]   Give that back.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.600]   So yeah, so this is the time to--
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.800]   Well, we're running this ad.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.640]   Ask questions.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.520]   Vote on questions.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.680]   Pay attention to the ad with all your might.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.200]   Exactly.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.520]   Of course.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.880]   But you can then, after you've learned everything
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.800]   you need to know from this advertisement, go in there
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.160]   and vote-- you don't need merely to ask questions.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.600]   Voting up or down is also a considerably important--
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.200]   Comments are legal too.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.400]   And you can comment.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.080]   Say, holy--
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.440]   Can't talk about my great hair.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.720]   This does it all.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.920]   My windblone.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.400]   Look.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.480]   Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.280]   That is the great place to sell your phone, your tablet,
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.360]   your iPad, your Mac.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.720]   And get something new, something sweet.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.280]   So the point being that there is cash in them,
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.240]   their drawers and closets under your bed, over your head,
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.160]   wherever you store your old used stuff.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.680]   Why leave it there, gathering dust,
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.880]   when you could get cash on the barrel head?
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:22.280]   Money, American dollars, greenbacks, sawbucks,
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.840]   fins in some cases, hundos.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.160]   All you got to do is go to Gazelle.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.320]   See, I speak the language of the street.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:29.820]   Yes.
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.160]   The people.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.400]   I'm a man of the people.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.800]   All you got to do is go to Gazelle, gazelle.com.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.440]   And you just pick the thing that you got,
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.120]   and you say, what is it worth?
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.240]   Are you getting--
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.520]   says here the new iPad.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.240]   Is there a new iPad?
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.840]   Well, there will be.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:47.880]   Maybe you want to see--
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.380]   Someday.
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:48.880]   Someday.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.360]   Someday.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.960]   Go see what your old iPad is with your old iPhone.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.800]   They will even buy broken iPads and broken iPhones.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.800]   So if you have a fore-ass that you cracked,
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.680]   but you don't want to go get it repaired,
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.240]   you just bring it to Gazelle.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.840]   You actually don't have to even bring it.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.280]   You get the price.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.720]   You get the quote.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.680]   And then get more stuff.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.840]   Get it all together.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.880]   Put it in your shopping basket.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.160]   When you check out-- it's kind of the reverse of a check out--
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.720]   when you check out, instead of you sending them money,
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.840]   they'll send you a box prepaid, postage paid on anything
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.440]   more than worth more than a buck.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.400]   And you pile it into that box, and you send it to them,
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.000]   and then they send you money.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.960]   They send you money.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.080]   It's the opposite of a shopping basket.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:30.960]   What would be the opposite?
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:36.280]   Where you pile stuff into it like a wheelbarrow.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.920]   A selling box.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.800]   Selling box.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.960]   It's the selling box.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:46.600]   Visit Gazelle.com and fill your cell box up with cells
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.040]   and other stuff.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.320]   Then they'll pay you fast by check by PayPal.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.760]   Or if you buy a lot of stuff at Amazon, that 5% really
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.000]   helps.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.680]   They give you an extra 5% on the Amazon gift cards.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.480]   gazelle.com.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.840]   Join more than 700,000 happy folks who
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.640]   have been paid more than $100 million by Gazelle.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.120]   Cash for your stuff.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.800]   gazelle.com.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.240]   It's a much better idea than what I do with my old stuff.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.760]   My cyanide disassembling.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.120]   You take it apart.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.360]   There's pieces of things everywhere.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.680]   We just took apart--
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.120]   I crashed to it, those little helicopters.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.160]   And so we were tearing apart.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.320]   I think my son has a pretty good idea
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.880]   of how those little helicopters work now.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.600]   We had a long discussion about capacitors.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.800]   What capacitors do they need to throw?
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.120]   And don't touch them.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:31.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.120]   There's that.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:32.640]   Did he find out?
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.120]   Did he learn?
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.560]   No, it wasn't charged.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.400]   But we are trying to build a new helicopter
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.040]   from the pieces of the old helicopter in which you get luck.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:39.520]   You know.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.720]   Not as easy as it sounds.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.800]   No, not at all.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.080]   It's the processors that are hard to figure out.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.800]   Well, and it's a good--
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:50.600]   when I was a youngster, I would disassemble things
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.120]   like abacus's to figure out how they work.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.720]   No, I used to take apart pocket watches.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.440]   Oh, really?
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.520]   The problem with taking apart a watch
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.920]   is when you open it up, this thing goes bling.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.920]   And it's never--
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.520]   Never, never, never, never, bling.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.360]   It's back in, never, back in.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.960]   However much you jam.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.240]   Question number one, the most popular question
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:16.120]   upvoted 35 times comes to us from Southwest Ohio
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.680]   Macman.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.160]   He's from Southwest Ohio.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.520]   Where in hell is the refreshed Mac mini?
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.600]   I'm not sure if he got the votes for the curse.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.920]   Or just because everybody wants to know.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.640]   Everyone wants to know.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.360]   I want to know.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.160]   But we don't know.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:30.720]   Do we know?
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.600]   We don't know.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.120]   We have to stick to hell as like a 37th layer in hell
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.160]   as we're talking to you.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.280]   A 66th layer?
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.880]   It's over there!
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.600]   Since it's on the--
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.120]   It's at the basement.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.360]   No, there is no new Mac mini.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.080]   I guess the question that this leads to is,
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.640]   what would we want to see in a new Mac mini?
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.240]   Wow, that's cool.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.680]   So how did it get to being answered on air?
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.720]   I hit answered.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.040]   Answer.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:48.560]   On my sweet.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.040]   On my sweet.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.840]   So now you know that it's being answered right now.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.080]   It's being answered right now.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.160]   Southwest Ohio, Mac Man.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.560]   I think that one of the things obviously
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.760]   we want to see as faster processors,
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.240]   what I would love to see is a faster GPU.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.360]   That's the big thing that the laptops have.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.480]   There isn't even a Haswell Mac mini, right?
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:05.480]   I know.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:05.480]   No.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.480]   No.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.480]   Haswell Mac--
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:07.480]   Haswell Mac--
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.640]   --such a great machine.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.160]   So it's more Iris than Haswell that I would care about.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.520]   Haswell's features is the current processor from Intel
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.160]   is lower, better battery.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.440]   So it's good for a laptop.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.520]   But that doesn't matter how Mac mini.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.760]   It's always plugged in.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.440]   Better performance, of course.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.040]   Lower power means cooler, so nice for a very compact box.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.920]   Which you really want is the onboard graphics, the Iris
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.040]   Pro graphics.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.560]   Because they're not going to put a GPU.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.600]   Do they put a GPU in the Mac mini?
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.360]   I don't know.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.760]   But whatever is in there is not very fast.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.560]   Be nice to have a little bit of a better GPU.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.960]   And onboard PCIe Flash would be nice to--
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.000]   Oh, oh.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.880]   Then I might trade in my Mac Pro.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.200]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:46.680]   Right?
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.080]   Oh, that's why they don't want to do it.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.600]   I don't know.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.360]   The Mac mini is so utilitarian, is so useful.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.640]   We have so many of them.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.840]   Use them as little servers.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.240]   We use them as little connection things.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.840]   It's such a great little piece of glue.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.680]   It is just amazing.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.000]   If you had Iris Pro 5000 graphics,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.400]   and you had a PCIe SSD in there, and a fast i5 or i7,
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.480]   if you really want to go crazy.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.040]   Thunderbolt 2.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.080]   Thunderbolt would be really--
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:09.400]   Thunderbolt 2.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.000]   Thunderbolt 2 would be really nice.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:11.520]   You're right.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.000]   That's better for most people than the Mac Pro.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.080]   That's everything you need.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.800]   The only thing you get more with a Mac Pro is dual GPU's.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.800]   You know, really high end use.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.640]   You don't want beefy processor, but most people aren't going
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.320]   to use any of that.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.520]   It's the family sedan version of the Mac Pro.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.680]   You know what it is?
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.760]   You know what it would be?
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.680]   It'd be the SS, the Chevy SS.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.360]   That's the four door sedan that Chevy
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.200]   makes with a Camaro drivetrain.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.480]   Nice.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.240]   There you have it.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.600]   That's what you want.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.640]   What I want to see is I want to see a Mac mini that
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.360]   is more designed like the Apple TV, believe it or not,
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.160]   where make it really, really slim.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.280]   Make it SSD even if you have to.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.320]   But also make the power requirements so minimal
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.960]   that you will have no problems keeping this on your network
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.520]   and keeping it on all the time.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.680]   Because the amount of services that a Mac--
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.240]   even a headless Mac can deliver to even a home network
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.280]   is phenomenal.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.440]   If you have this one machine that has 100% uptime, 24/7,
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.640]   that is always going to be serving documents,
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.480]   always going to be serving applications, always
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.720]   going to be serving media, always
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.640]   going to be keeping eye on the health and the backups
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.040]   of the rest of the network.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:17.540]   Wow.
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.160]   That would turn a lot of people from people who are already
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.920]   even aware that Apple makes a Mac mini to someone who's
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.960]   willing to buy a $500 Mac mini, even just as an accessory
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.120]   to what they've got already, without any attention
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.800]   of ever actually using it.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.240]   And if that thing is easy to Velcro onto the back of a monitor
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.200]   to be the budget entry level Mac for the rest of the world,
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.680]   so much the better.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.600]   I'm not looking for power as much as I'm
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.480]   looking for accessibility for the rest of the world.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.080]   I mean, I almost think that's almost
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.800]   two-- at that base level, that's almost two different things.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:52.560]   We have, say, Apple TV at $99, a Mac mini mini,
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.440]   whatever, Nano at $250 or $300.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.640]   And then the base Mac mini, which is, let's say, $600, $700,
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.000]   I think that would be an incredible--
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:04.720]   that a lot of people could--
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.880]   that a lot of people would be really interested in.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.880]   I know I'd be interested in it.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:12.160]   OK, that's the end of the conversation.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.720]   So where is it?
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.120]   Who the hell knows?
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.200]   Sitting in the labs.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.680]   Only Angela Aron snows.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.680]   It's in the labs.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.200]   Would they announce that at a WWC, which is Edmonton?
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.120]   WWDC.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:25.640]   Maybe.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.920]   Or drop it in a press release.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.920]   They announced back Mac.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.160]   MacBooks at the last one, right?
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.880]   Yep.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.840]   And the Mac Pro T-shirt.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.240]   Here's my-- OK, I'm going to predict something.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.760]   You're never going to see a new Mac mini.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.280]   They don't care.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.080]   They don't care.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.320]   But that's what we thought of with the Mac Pro, too.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.560]   No, well, it took a while.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.920]   But I thought they had given up.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.160]   I like that Mac Pro, by the way.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.320]   But I'm not knocking the Mac Pro.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.560]   I'm very happy with it.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.560]   My surfing, my email, it's all very fast.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.240]   That's my only--
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.760]   Someone email Tim Cook and ask him,
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.560]   because he'll respond to things like that sometimes.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.840]   He'll say, you know, Apple's got plans for the next year.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.120]   In wonderful new categories.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.600]   Yes.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.560]   Which means shades of purple or something.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.400]   I don't know what that is.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.560]   So the next Mac mini is going to be a wearable Mac mini.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.440]   It's going to be a headband.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.800]   Backpackable Mac mini.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.320]   I know.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.520]   I think a Mac mini is more in line with--
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.360]   a Mac mini is more in line with Apple's consumer focus
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.880]   than the Mac Pro is.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.760]   So I'm also not--
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.080]   I think that Mac mini fills in a lot of gaps
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.800]   that Apple doesn't want to avoid.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.840]   Like they can't sell iMacs to-- they can't necessarily sell
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.640]   500 iMacs to a school system, but they
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.680]   can make the sale for a less expensive and less complicated
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.000]   Mac mini that they can just simply swap out
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.920]   for whatever they've got there to a brand new Mac mini deck.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.480]   So I do think there's a role for it.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.520]   I don't think that it's a dead product.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.920]   We keep reminding ourselves that Apple, for all of their--
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.760]   the fact that they're building a 12,000 person spaceship
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.040]   in the--
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.760]   to replace one of your headquarters,
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.880]   they really are a company that feels as though they
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.120]   have limited resources and limited people
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.240]   and limited attention span.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.600]   So if they are focuses on other products
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.040]   and other things in the product line
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.320]   are going to be ignored for a little while.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.960]   And Mac mini, unfortunately, is not the hot product.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.120]   So it's going to be-- it's going to wait until there's
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.400]   a long enough gap in their product line development
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.440]   to actually put the people on this project
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.760]   to make that a hot product again.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:18.000]   It'd be nice if they should have run off at WWDC along
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.840]   with 10.10.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.040]   It would just be nice.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.640]   Apple, as we know, walks to the beat of their own drummer.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.320]   We said, you're exactly right.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.320]   We said the same thing for the Mac.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.800]   You can have a dance, or you don't dance,
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.440]   but they're not going to listen to you.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.880]   This is why it's nice to have something
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.480]   that's made by a lot of different companies.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.320]   And it's why Apple says, stop doing that,
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.520]   because they want to control that.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.880]   Well, and I still wish that--
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.640]   I mean, I think that would be--
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.760]   I think that would be something that would be very exciting
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:52.160]   is to see Apple release OS 10.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.840]   Jersey Fudge asks, first of all, OK,
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.240]   I'm going to explain Jersey Fudge,
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.120]   because should you put that through Urban Dictionary
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.640]   before we have to release this?
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.480]   I understand.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.040]   You're immediately leap to that, don't you?
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.080]   But in fact, I know this guy, because he's brought me
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:07.960]   Fudge from Jersey.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.040]   And it's not New Jersey.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:09.800]   It's Old Jersey.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:13.040]   It's the island of Jersey, where the cows are happier.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:13.600]   Nice.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.640]   And the cream is richer.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.440]   They're truly happy cows.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.200]   And the Fudge is finer.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.840]   Where Jersey is spelled with 19 letters.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.560]   Yes.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.800]   His question has disappeared.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.840]   Oh, no, we're answering it.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.160]   He says, can Josh be kicked out of this chat room?
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.040]   So we actually don't have--
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:27.520]   Who is Josh?
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.000]   Kickfunk.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.520]   --incidentally, he's someone who's not really in a chat room.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.040]   Yeah, I know.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.440]   So the bottom line is people aren't
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.160]   going to see it if we don't talk about Josh anymore,
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.960]   because there's so many high-voted questions at this point.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.560]   We don't care.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.560]   But we are.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.160]   We're not going to be.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.160]   Just so you know, we don't have kick functions yet,
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.200]   but we're working on them.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.320]   Oh, I see, Josh.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.920]   He's from New South Wales.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:45.560]   We've been in it.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.440]   He's just going to get down-voted.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.840]   He says bad things about people.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.560]   Who cares?
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:56.400]   We'll OS 10.10.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.000]   Whoops, 10.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.560]   So we're currently at OS 10.9.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.560]   OS 10.10.9.2.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.120]   So confusing.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.880]   The next would be OS 10.10.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.680]   Yep.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.440]   So very confusing.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.680]   Will it be named after a beach?
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.600]   Will be named after a California landmark?
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.200]   And the question was--
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.440]   I got half moon.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.080]   Will it be a huge update or just a UI change?
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.600]   Where is it in the TikTok?
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.600]   Are they still doing the TikTok?
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.000]   Remember they did Leopard Snow Leopard, Lion Mountain Lion.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.640]   Maverick's.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.080]   If you consider a design a huge update,
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.840]   a lot of developers and a lot of people
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.920]   who work in the industry will tell you
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.400]   that design directly affects user experience.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.360]   And that is one of the most important and valuable
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.080]   characteristics of what they do.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.360]   I mean, Apple spent a year, most close to years,
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.160]   they could, 10 months at breakneck speed, redesigning iOS 7,
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.080]   because they felt it was really, really important.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.880]   And they're doing the same thing with OS 10.10.10 now.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.720]   So that is absolutely a big--
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.080]   Can we put one person on renaming that?
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:55.560]   One.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.480]   Well, that's why they call it Maverick.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.800]   So no one has to say that.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.640]   It could be--
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.320]   - It's a OS triple X. - There you go.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.360]   OS 10.5.6.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:01.760]   There you go.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.480]   Who named Sarah?
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.160]   You can call it that.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.360]   Sarah?
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.480]   It does--
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.760]   Like K-Sarah or like the line.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.560]   That's EU.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.360]   They're all wine-coded.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.200]   They're all like the point list,
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.520]   the French point list of the 19th century.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:14.000]   The wine.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.160]   Georges Sarah.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.920]   It's like Petite Sarah.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.800]   Too many details.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:21.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.080]   It does make you wonder exactly what they're saving 11 for.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.720]   Because every time they've gone up--
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.160]   So the last time they went up a full number
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.840]   was when they went from OS 9 to OS 10.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.720]   And you feel as though they're saving that for a day
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.080]   when they can say they're doing something as revolutionary
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:43.560]   and as able to break your old experience as OS 10 was for OS 9.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:49.400]   We do know that OS 10.9.3 is being seeded to developers.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.080]   So we will see that sooner than later.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:57.080]   In fact, they seeded that about five days ago, six days ago.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.160]   Renee, is that right?
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.840]   Yeah, and they have that new Apple Seed program where,
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.960]   even if you're not a developer, you can sign up to test the betas.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.200]   Don't do that on your primary machine, by the way.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.400]   Did you do that?
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.840]   If you do that, are you NDA?
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.160]   You are, you are NDA.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.560]   And also, you give up a lot of your Apple Care privileges
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.600]   because they'd Apple Care.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.120]   The front-facing consumer part of Apple
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.680]   does not take care of beta software for you.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.760]   So only if you are really rugged and curious
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.480]   and have a spare machine.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.360]   So I'm sure somebody in the iMore team
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.880]   is rugged, curious.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:32.320]   My boss is running three 4K monitors off 10.9.3.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.240]   And he's loving it.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.520]   Three 4K monitors.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.760]   Yep.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.840]   Is he have a Mac Pro?
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.480]   I saw a lot of resources.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.360]   He does.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.000]   He does.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   That's tempting.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.440]   You know, the only person I know who has actually
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.920]   good 4K monitor is--
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.360]   we have him on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.600]   Marcus Brownlee, who has a 60 Hertz 4K monitor.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.120]   I bet your boss has like those 30 Hertz.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.720]   No, he got them on the Christmas sale off Dell.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:59.200]   And they're running at 60 Hertz on the new builds of OS X.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:34:59.960]   Oh, interesting.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.600]   So that's an OS X specific thing.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.840]   Yep.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.420]   I mean, you can get really crappy 30 Hertz
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:05.000]   so you can monitor--
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:05.920]   Yeah, they can't do more.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.560]   But if you get a good one, then the newest--
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.560]   when did that kick in?
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.200]   I think the first 10.9.3 beta had that.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:15.920]   Oh, that's good.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.520]   So that's something to look forward to.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.520]   Yep.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.520]   For those four of us who have--
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.360]   If you want to run NASA in your living room--
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.240]   Right.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.440]   I think-- does it look like really nice?
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.400]   It must look sweet.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.000]   Yeah, we have a picture--
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.600]   I'll put it in the chat.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.720]   We have a picture of it.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.520]   It looks mind boggling.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.280]   Three.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.160]   And there are-- are they 27 inch, 30 inch?
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.320]   How big are they?
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.920]   I think they're between 27 and 30.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.120]   I forget the exact size.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.720]   Whatever the ones that Dell was telling over the holidays,
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.560]   I believe they're 27.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.200]   Those cat videos must look fabulous.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.400]   You can see every hairlier.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.320]   OK.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:54.960]   So look forward to it, build 13 D55, 10.9.3.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.560]   What do we have a time frame that you think?
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.480]   Basically, I mean, this is what?
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:02.240]   The ninth update, ninth seed of developers for developers?
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.360]   Something like that.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.320]   I mean, there's a muscle, WWDC.
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.440]   So I don't know if they'll be in a rush to--
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.920]   Will they release it at WWDC?
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.480]   They'll just release it when it's ready.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.040]   I don't think they're under any pressure.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.040]   [SIGHS]
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:15.480]   All right.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.600]   Apple has a few acquisitions.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.440]   There is this little lawsuit going on.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:24.720]   The jury seems to think that Apple is worth $119 million,
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.560]   a little less than the $2.2 billion they wanted.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.080]   And it's kind of a mixed verdict,
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:35.080]   because they gave Samsung a little something.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.720]   We'll talk about what that all means.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:41.040]   The great smartphone war, as Vanity Fair calls it.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.160]   The big hoax that fooled pretty much everybody.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.720]   The biometric-- we'll talk about that.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.240]   The biometric earbuds.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.920]   And why you might not want to buy the brand new MacBook here.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.320]   Well, but first, a word from Squarespace.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.560]   I know you want Squarespace.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.440]   I know you want Squarespace.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.720]   The place to make your next website, Squarespace.com.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.200]   If you go and visit, as I know many of you have,
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.640]   and you click the Get Started button,
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.480]   you'll immediately enter the Squarespace universe.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.480]   Now, this is hosting, the best hosting there is.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.800]   There's nothing better.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.800]   You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.640]   So many is the time we go to a website,
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.080]   bring it to its knees, and we wish, gosh,
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.160]   I wish they were on Squarespace.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.840]   Well, you'll never have to worry about that.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:28.280]   Plus, really amazing software.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.720]   Look at all the website, just because they
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.960]   like to show off all the stuff their templates can do,
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.880]   like the parallax scrolling and all that stuff.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.320]   You start with 25 beautiful designer templates.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:44.440]   Each of them have-- these are state of the art.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.400]   I mean, these are award-winning templates.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.160]   I'm just gorgeous.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.960]   But then look at all the people who've used the template
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.880]   and what they've done with it.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:57.000]   Everything from hot dogs to gardens.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.520]   I just want to see this, because I'm curious
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:02.160]   what Harry Curtis hot dogs are.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.000]   I guess he's available for hire.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.360]   Established 2013.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.920]   OK, you could make your site look that.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.680]   Or look at this, Indian Garden.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.000]   Now, this is beautiful.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.800]   In Sedona, Arizona, cafe and market.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.920]   So these templates have another nice feature,
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.680]   which is no matter what size screen, they will look gorgeous.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.640]   What we call-- oh, I love it.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.520]   This is the new thing.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.600]   And this is what I like about using Squarespace.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.360]   Is your site will look modern no matter what?
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.840]   The new thing is now big images.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.080]   What we call full bleed, they go fill a screen, right?
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.000]   And they're just gorgeous.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:38.440]   This is a bad--
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.120]   And they figured it all out so you don't have to.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.320]   You don't have to think about it.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.840]   It's all done for you.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.800]   Whenever you add images, they're resized
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.240]   in nine different thumbnails so that they'll always fit
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.640]   whatever it is that you're trying to fit.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.920]   And this is a magazine.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.120]   And they're going to want their site to look gorgeous, right?
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.560]   So that you buy the magazine.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.760]   They went right to Squarespace.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.600]   And of course they did.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.360]   And no, buy the magazine.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:03.880]   Every template has commerce built in.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.400]   So you don't even think about it.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.200]   Look at this magazine.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:06.960]   They're taking orders.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.480]   Add to cart.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.960]   This is all within Squarespace.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.800]   They support-- there's the cart.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.680]   It's just beautiful.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.400]   It's just like elegant.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.040]   You don't have to think about all this stuff.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.600]   And it's mobile, desktop.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.760]   That takes a lot of work, believe me.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.720]   We deal with that.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.720]   And the point is they didn't have to be a developer to do this.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.440]   They don't have to know CSS or JavaScript or anything.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.120]   Because Squarespace, these designers, are so good.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.760]   All you could point and click drag and drop,
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.400]   you can bring in your social media, you turn on the cart.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.040]   Literally, the thing to do is go to squarespace.com
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:37.640]   and just try it.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.160]   And you'll see.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.680]   You can import your existing content in from your site.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.880]   So they have importing tools for all the blog APIs.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:46.920]   So you'll get comments.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:47.480]   You'll get images.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.080]   You'll get everything.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.400]   So you can really see what your existing site, what that
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.320]   content will look like on the new template.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.560]   They've got the logo designer.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.400]   They've got apps for iPad and iPhone.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.400]   And all this $8 a month, which, if you sign up for a year,
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.680]   includes a free domain name.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.880]   They'll hook that all up for you.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.280]   Hosting plus software to make a really remarkable site
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:12.080]   for your blog, for your e-commerce, for your studio,
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.960]   your photography portfolio, whatever it is that you do.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.840]   You know you want square.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.880]   You know you do.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.280]   So just go to squarespace.com.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.280]   Only-- you don't have to give an offer code or anything,
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.080]   or a credit card number.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.040]   Just sign up.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.200]   And you've got two weeks free.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.680]   If after the end of the two weeks, you say,
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.920]   I think I would like this as little as $8 a month.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.320]   Use the offer code MAC break.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.120]   You get 10% off.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:31.880]   That's pretty good too.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:32.920]   Good too.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.320]   Offer code MAC break at squarespace.com.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.200]   Use the offer code that way.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.960]   They know you heard it here.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.520]   Let's talk about the--
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.160]   I don't normally like to talk about lawsuits.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.560]   I don't want to encourage this.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.960]   But the jury did come in.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.600]   In fact, I think they're deliberating today
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.720]   for a second-- a little bit of a second thing.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.440]   They had to recalcul-- no, I think they're done.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.080]   That was yesterday.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:53.680]   That was yesterday.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.680]   They recalculated the verdict.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.040]   $119 million.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.560]   That's a lot less than the previous award.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.680]   So the first Apple Samsung trial was over trade dress.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.200]   And how the thing looked.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.040]   Whether it was confusing if you go into the store
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.400]   and you see this Samsung phone and you think you're
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.600]   buying an iPhone.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.360]   And that jury gave Samsung more than $1 billion.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.160]   That judgment still being--
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.560]   Gave Apple.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.120]   Took from Samsung, gave to Apple.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:23.000]   In this one, very similar, although it was about five patents.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.080]   Things like slide to unlock and click a text message
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.960]   to dial a phone number.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:34.520]   The jury did say, yes, there was infringement.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.880]   Not less, though.
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:39.240]   $119.6 million to Apple.
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.680]   Samsung, which countersued, got $158,000.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.440]   So the jury-- I think this is sending a little bit of a message.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.840]   And in fact, the jury's saying a little message saying,
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:54.240]   well, it's not like there was this pervasive Samsung stealing
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:54.680]   thing.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.240]   They did-- I don't know.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:02.960]   You kind of wonder how much damage is being done to both parties
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.440]   by the protracted lawsuits.
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.840]   It's not just that Samsung is losing some.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.800]   It's not just that they had to write a check out of their pocket
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.960]   lid for $150,000.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.680]   Apple has to pay that check.
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.440]   It's that every time that these losses go forward,
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.800]   there's a discovery process where more and more documents
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.880]   are brought to light.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.960]   And as more scrutiny gets paid to every single patent
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.040]   that Apple and Samsung and all these other companies
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.200]   have taken out, the court is--
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.920]   is getting a little bit more skeptical that any of these patents
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.720]   should actually have been issued to begin with.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.960]   So I hope that we see an end to the scorched earth policy
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.000]   because right now we're just--
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.520]   I think within a year, we're going
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.920]   to enter our Aussie-Mandyis phase where
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.640]   Apple's going to be this statue in the desert that won all
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.360]   the lawsuits.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.760]   But the inscription of the base of the statue,
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.280]   which is all that remains is we won all those lawsuits.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.280]   Oh, well.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.640]   And remember, Apple's suing Samsung as a proxy, right?
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.880]   To sue Google directly, for some reason they haven't.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.920]   And the jury even mentioned that.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:08.640]   The jury even said, why don't you sue Google?
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.880]   It's hard to prove Google earned any money from--
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.280]   That's the problem.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.440]   Google is backing Samsung and agreed to identify them
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.080]   on at least two of the patents.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.320]   So some of that, $190 million, come out of Google's pocket.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.440]   I think Apple's intention here oftentimes--
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.880]   I don't know what their intention is.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.080]   But my guess is that it creates a chilling effect
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.400]   on other people who think that they're going to any other
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.720]   manufacturer, maybe not Samsung, but everybody else who
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.960]   thinks that they might do something that's
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.320]   like what Apple has already done or patented.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.120]   Apple's going to make clear to them
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.920]   that we will take you to court and we'll keep it in court
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.000]   forever.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.560]   And so the thing is that we--
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.960]   I think that they don't care how much money they win.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.960]   What they want to do is create an unsafe environment
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.720]   for anyone who thinks that they're going to copy something
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.520]   that's like what they did.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.320]   Now I don't know whether that's valid or not.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.600]   But I think that that might be the play here
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.920]   is to make-- it's not just a Samsung,
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.760]   but for every manufacturer that's using Android.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.880]   Because Samsung probably won't even be an Android developer
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.600]   in three to four years.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.080]   They're probably going to be in their own little world.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.400]   And so it is a big message to the rest of the Android platform
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:16.720]   that Apple will bring to bear and keep on pounding until there's
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.840]   nothing left to pound.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.200]   According to Ena Freed writing at Recode,
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.480]   the two patents at Google said, will it
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.240]   demnify you on background synchronization and universal
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:26.720]   search?
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:30.200]   The jury said Samsung did not infringe.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.640]   So it looks like I guess Google won't have to help Samsung out
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:33.960]   at all.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.280]   Samsung got up for this.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.760]   However, the two patents that the jury did say in fringe
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.720]   were the Quick Links patent and the Slide to Unlock patent,
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:47.880]   which surprises me because there is clear prior art on Slide
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.320]   to Unlock.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.880]   I mean, clear prior art.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:56.000]   A third patent, which covered automatic word correction,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.080]   autocorrect, was determined by the court to have infringed.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.880]   There was the court said, no, there's no-- they own this one.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.520]   And all the jury had to do was decide damages.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.120]   So a victory for Apple.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.520]   But I think you're right, Andy.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.160]   Apiric victory.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:13.120]   I've heard some say this will never end.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:17.320]   Apple's going to continue to go after these companies forever.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.080]   There's a thing that's inside Apple.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.280]   Apple's a very personal company.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.720]   They're not run like IBM or a company like that.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.440]   It's very much a lot of individuals.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.080]   And to their core, a lot of people--
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.720]   Steve Jobs is, of course, the most famous one--
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.400]   who truly believed that they did something special with the iPhone
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.360]   in 2007 and that their manufacturing partner at the time
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.360]   and that their services partner at the time,
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.200]   Samsung and Google used their relationships
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.160]   to learn how to make a modern smartphone.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.440]   And then in Apple's way of thinking,
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:49.120]   betrayed them, copied them, and leveraged
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.960]   all of Apple's research development sweat tiers, design,
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.840]   engineering, everything to basically jump
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.040]   start their own entry into this one.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.920]   Isn't that patently false?
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:00.440]   It's not patently false, but it may also not be illegal.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.640]   I think it's false.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.200]   I think Apple-- give Apple credit.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.480]   The first iPhone was a total breakthrough.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.320]   And everybody in the industry sat up and said, whoa.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.200]   But that was a long-- it was 2007.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:16.840]   And I don't think you can say, well, we ought to own the slab,
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.400]   glass, face, or--
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.800]   But don't we think that the early Samsung phones looked--
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.800]   yeah.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.320]   --specifically looking like Apple,
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.160]   specifically so that they would get sales
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.080]   and they get an opportunity.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.200]   Power, it sounds like made a blackberry when blackberry
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.680]   was popular, made a Windows mobile phone when that was popular.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.560]   They made a power core that looked like Apple.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.000]   And the vanity fair article is amazing because it tells you
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.080]   that-- and I've worked with companies in Japan
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.320]   that are very similar-- is that there's
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.440]   a very different philosophy there.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.000]   They don't see that as copying really.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.680]   They see that as this is what the market is doing.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.280]   We're going to do what the market wants.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.720]   It's an incredibly different outlook.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.800]   And American companies sometimes react,
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.000]   like the television industry did,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.720]   like the computer industry did, like the mobile industry
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.480]   doing now, considers that copying,
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.720]   where they just consider it making the product that the market
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.360]   wants.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.840]   And those two philosophies do not coexist very well.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.320]   And there's often a lot of incredibly bad lawsuits.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.560]   I had a friend who worked in refrigerators who said the same thing.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.640]   I forget if it was about Samsung or something, but he said,
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.800]   they copied our bottom pull out fridge drawer
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.080]   and we were in litigation forever.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.360]   And there's fridge patents that have to be respected.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.520]   And these things get worked out.
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.120]   But mobile is an incredibly new business.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.520]   And none of that stuff has been worked out legally yet.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.080]   Well, I think that some of the frustration
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.880]   for folks who are trying to figure things out
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.520]   is obviously that more R&D goes on--
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.320]   or the argument is that more R&D is going on in the United
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.720]   States for some of this stuff.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:34.720]   And when people just copy it, that it doesn't account for that R&D.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.640]   That goes into it.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.880]   It's not just the cost of the item.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.880]   It's the cost of getting it out there.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:43.520]   And it can overall suppress the market in that area.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.600]   I don't know if it really does here.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.320]   I think Apple's making plenty of money.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.720]   So I'm not going to drive-- I agree with it.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.960]   I think that's the argument.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.440]   But I think that it does take a while to do it well.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:53.760]   The other thing is that I think there
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.920]   has to be a line drawn between what Samsung did,
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.000]   certainly with their first couple generations of phones,
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.440]   which is just obviously say, let us make as close a knockoff
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.800]   of the iPhone as we possibly can.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:11.240]   And the basic idea that's been sort of at the engine
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:15.240]   of almost every major advance over the past 20, 30, 40 years,
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.920]   which is to say, that wasn't my original idea.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.000]   But this concept is really, really strong.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.040]   I'm going to take that concept and use that to affect my thinking
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.520]   and use that to affect the products and the ideas
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:26.920]   that I'm going to be cultivating.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.200]   And so if you decide that the first person to do a four-wheel
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.880]   vehicle now owns the concept of four wheels,
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.520]   and now you can do three wheels, you can do five wheels,
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.400]   you can do six wheels, so long as you don't put four
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.200]   of those back wheels together close enough
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   that it looks like four wheels, that just absolutely
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.080]   ends all innovation.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.280]   And it also sort of makes a mockery of the nature of ideas,
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.320]   ideas evolve.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.280]   You get inspired by sources.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.000]   And sometimes that's something that lawyers have to argue
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.720]   about, about whether there was an actual infringement or not.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:02.320]   But you can't deny that if everybody who worked on the iPhone
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.320]   were to be teleported onto the Mars base without any connection
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.960]   to anything that had ever been done before,
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.360]   they would have created something that was the same thing,
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.840]   totally unique, totally in and of itself,
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.120]   that had no inspiration from anything else.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.800]   So I just like to have that.
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.600]   I just think that we should make sure we observe that line
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.440]   between the two.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.240]   You can innovate, you can develop,
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:27.360]   you can move technology forward while still being part
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.720]   of the world that you live in.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:32.120]   And it's hard to justify creating a device that can never
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:35.520]   have any overlap with anything else that's ever come before.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.440]   There's a thing with Samsung though, especially.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.000]   I love the Motorola stuff.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.040]   I love the HTC stuff.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.640]   I've never bought a Samsung thing.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.720]   And a little bit of it is for this reason that I feel a lot
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.000]   of their products are derivative.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   And you can say, you know, they copied the iPhone when it was
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:47.920]   at Verizon.
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.080]   There was no Verizon iPhone.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.760]   So they made something that was as close to Verizon iPhone.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.000]   But I've covered Samsung events like Andy has.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.320]   I've been to some of the same ones.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.200]   The Galaxy S3 event, they come out and they say,
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.640]   oh, look, we're making a river stone.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.000]   No one's ever done this before.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:00.920]   Inductive charging.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.240]   No one's ever done this before.
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.600]   I was at the Bon Prix event two years earlier,
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.720]   and saw that exact announcement.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.720]   And that as a consumer, it doesn't bother me,
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.240]   but it disappoints me because I would like to have something
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.360]   amazingly Samsung that I could buy.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.800]   Which they're doing more now.
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:16.800]   I think that's the problem.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.760]   We are getting things that are amazingly Samsung,
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.720]   each and every revision of their phones.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.560]   I mean, see, there's another reason why
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.760]   I can't be quite so angry with Samsung
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:28.040]   because who in the end pays the price for operating
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.240]   your business that way?
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.240]   When was the last time that Samsung came up
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.120]   with a flagship phone that everybody said, wow,
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.080]   this is so new.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.680]   This is exactly the way that I'd like an Android phone to be.
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.880]   I mean, Nokia has done fantastic things with the 1020
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.280]   and the 1520, the other phones they've done in the Lumial line.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.040]   HTC, their HTC One Line is amazing.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.880]   The Sony Xperia is an amazing phone that gets lots and lots
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.400]   of people writing positive things about it
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.240]   because it's just such a wonderful piece of design.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.600]   Every time-- the S3 was probably the last really great phone
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.880]   that Samsung put out because it's the last one that seemed
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.760]   to have its own style and its own bit of the patch about it.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:08.320]   They're not doing that warrior's journey of meditating
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:11.360]   under a waterfall for three or four days until inspiration hits.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:14.120]   They really are just trying to take whatever's--
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:17.880]   the other warriors from their other meditations
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.200]   came up with last year.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.760]   And it just shows in the product line.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.320]   They've done some good stuff, but they've just never
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.720]   done anything really great.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.320]   But you keep-- yeah, OK.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.240]   And I agree.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.280]   I wouldn't buy another Samsung phone
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:30.560]   unless they've fixed this stuff up.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.000]   And they spend so much money on marketing.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.160]   They completely dominate.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.560]   And it's all about they buy the ads.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.600]   But you can't sue somebody for that.
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.600]   And I don't--
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.240]   Oh, you can.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:39.800]   Sure you can.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.640]   You can sue somebody for anything.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.800]   It won't be successful, yeah.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.240]   You shouldn't sue him for that.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.640]   I think it's time for Apple to lay down arms
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.680]   as Samsung will lay down arms.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.560]   Just calm down.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.880]   You're in different enough spaces now.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:54.960]   If Apple continues to go after Samsung's two possibilities--
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:58.600]   one, Steve Jobs is so revered that his holy war will just
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:59.600]   continue forever.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.240]   And that's not good for Apple.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.520]   Or two, they're so afraid of Samsung
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.200]   that they don't dare let up.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.000]   I don't think they're afraid of a Samsung.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.600]   But I do think that they are--
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:13.520]   still, I still think that this is good marketing from Apple
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.960]   to other Android developers.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.280]   I think that's what this message is.
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.520]   I don't think that Apple-- it doesn't cost them anything.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.520]   I mean, to do this.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.400]   They want enough in this one and whatever.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.280]   I mean, this is all noise to them.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.800]   So I don't think that I think the average person doesn't even
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.320]   know Apple-- I mean, we know a lot about Apple suing Samsung.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.800]   But I think the average person, my parents,
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.800]   don't know anything about the Apple lawsuit and my dad's
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:32.840]   a lawyer.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.760]   And so--
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.360]   What, really?
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.080]   He doesn't care.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.080]   I mean, he doesn't care about Apple.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.480]   He's a care writer, Stan, but he's heard of that.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.480]   He's probably heard about it, but he's heard of it.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:40.360]   I really do.
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.040]   I don't think-- I think 99% of the users,
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:46.040]   even if they've heard about it, it's kind of a background
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.120]   noise.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.840]   So I just don't think that--
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.480]   but I think that people who are developing for Android
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.720]   and that pay a lot of attention to it.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.080]   But I don't think that the average person who owns a phone
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:00.880]   either knows or even if they know cares at all
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.000]   with their campaign.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   They also don't care if Samsung stole ideas or entire phone
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:05.760]   designs from Apple.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:06.720]   Yeah, just give me a good phone.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.320]   I don't care.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.520]   So this is happening-- I think for the average consumer,
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.840]   this is something that happens way in the background.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.920]   It's kind of a side story.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:17.080]   For people who are in the know, I think that--
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:20.080]   I am kind of impressed by how much consumers seem
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.160]   to know about the mobile market.
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.840]   I think that that is something different.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.400]   They take it much more personally.
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:28.480]   And it's a surprisingly large number of people know a lot
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:31.720]   about the stuff that we think is really inside baseball.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:33.360]   You go in a store--
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:37.280]   and my kids break their funds every few weeks.
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.960]   So I spent a lot of time in the AT&T store.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.560]   And it's surprising how much consumers.
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.280]   Even just normal people you wouldn't expect.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.080]   No.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:45.520]   Well, that's articles in Vanity Fair, Leo.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.520]   That's not a trade publication.
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:46.720]   Right.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.040]   Vanity Fair for crying out loud.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:51.800]   They must care because why would you--
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.520]   the great smartphone--
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.880]   What a great story, though.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:55.640]   I want that film.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.040]   I want to see people eating papers.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.920]   Kurt Eichenwalde for three years.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.360]   Appellum Samsung have clashed on a--
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:04.080]   of course, you don't--
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.840]   this doesn't mean you have to care or know about it
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.400]   because he sets it up so that you care about it.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.120]   For three years, Appellum Samsung have clashed on a scale
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.400]   almost unprecedented in business history.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.360]   Their legal war costing more than a billion dollars
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:18.840]   and spanning four continents.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:20.400]   This could be like the next 300.
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:20.600]   I know.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.520]   I was going to say, what you're waiting for is that.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:23.520]   What are you doing?
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.520]   Oh, it's all these.
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:25.840]   Oh, it's all these.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:26.880]   It's an amazing story.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.680]   I mean, they have-- not Apple, but Korean investigators
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.720]   who are going after them for price fixing on LCDs
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.320]   are trying to get in there, and they're stalling them
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.320]   so they can swap out computers and eat the paperwork.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:39.280]   I mean, I love my company, but I'm going to need an awful lot
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.760]   of attention to eat the paperwork.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.920]   Yeah, I'm not eating the paperwork.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.320]   So I haven't read the article yet,
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:48.120]   but I was busy looking at the pictures of Madonna.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.920]   But is it good?
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.120]   It shows you how insane these--
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.160]   and anyone who's, again, anyone who's dealt with big karets
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.960]   who's in Japan in the '80s or with big Korean conglomerates
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:03.080]   in this decade, it's enlightening to feel how much of people's
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.080]   lives and how big and how powerful
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.920]   and how all encompassing these companies are.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.520]   He talks about the purple dorm.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:11.360]   The purple dorm smells like pizza,
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:14.160]   occupying a building at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino,
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:17.840]   the dorm so named because the employees were there 24/7
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:20.800]   amid the ever-present odor of fast food
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:22.400]   was-- I don't know where the purple comes from--
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:25.320]   was the site of the company's most secret undertaking
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:28.040]   code named-- oh, Project Purple.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:28.880]   Iphone code name--
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.360]   The Iphone was Project Purple, the purple dorm.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.760]   And they called it a dorm.
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.280]   The dorm that I visited at University of Colorado,
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.800]   Boulder didn't smell like fast food.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:40.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.600]   No, and there's not a lot in Boulder that
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:43.240]   smells like fast food.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.960]   It was fast food's not very popular in Boulder.
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:46.600]   However, there are other things that are very popular.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:46.600]   Right there.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:47.920]   After I left, it smelled like that.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:48.400]   OK.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.680]   Yeah, so I like the bio.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:52.160]   You know me.
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.600]   I read all these background books.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.640]   I presume that this is the beginning of Kurt's
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.760]   going to write a book that will be this story, although we've
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.960]   seen this before this book.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.280]   I guess we haven't seen a Samsung Apple book.
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.280]   We saw the Google Apple book.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:08.480]   If we also haven't-- we haven't seen a whole lot of books
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.320]   that have had-- that really got the journalism down cold.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:11.840]   Right.
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:13.360]   We've seen a lot that sort of hovered around it
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:15.320]   that I had bits you can believe, bits you can't believe.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.360]   We've had authoritative biographies
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.520]   that were breathtaking in some of the insights,
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:24.320]   but made you really look at the bare patches of unpainted
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.160]   wood that really should have been in there.
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:30.640]   We're still waiting for a really good journalist-powered book
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.760]   on the development of these devices.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.360]   I do like the conclusion.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.040]   Soul of a new machine is still a fascinating book.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:39.800]   Even if you have absolutely no interest in microprocessor
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.840]   design, any process that tells you
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:45.560]   about how intelligent, interesting, and creative people
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:48.400]   struggle to complete a project and bring a vision
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:52.840]   into reality from just neurosynaptic mix
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.960]   firings inside your head into an actual commercial product,
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.480]   that's a great project to watch.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.320]   And so that's why I really want to see more stories like this.
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.480]   There have been moments-- this is concluding paragraphs.
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.120]   There have been moments that boarded on the absurd.
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:06.240]   One of the patents invoked by Apple
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:08.560]   is a single sentence claim with diagrams
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.640]   for a rectangular device with rounded corners--
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.480]   not any particular device.
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.680]   Just the rectangle itself.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:16.380]   But all that seeming silliness was practically
[00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:18.320]   demonstrated to be important by Samsung's own lawyers
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.160]   when federal judge Lucy Ko, who is still the judge
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:23.680]   on all of this stuff, held up the iPad and Galaxy X
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:27.600]   and asked a lawyer, hey, can you tell which is which?
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.040]   Not at this distance, your honor, said the lawyer,
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.920]   who was standing 10 feet away.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:33.480]   No one could claim a total victory
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:34.920]   in the global litigation wars.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.200]   One person close to Apple said the endless fighting
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:42.240]   has been a drain on the company, both emotionally and financially.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.920]   Meanwhile, as has happened with other cases
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.440]   where Samsung violated a company's patents,
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:48.160]   it has continued to develop new and better phones
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.120]   throughout the litigation to the point where even some people
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:51.960]   who have worked with Apple say the Korean company
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:53.560]   is now a strong competitor on the technology,
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:54.840]   not just a copycat.
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:55.920]   We did agree on that, yes?
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:56.760]   Yep.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:59.560]   Despite his role in propelling the lawsuits forward jobs who
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.960]   died in 2011 by now--
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:04.400]   no, I disagree with this part--
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.520]   might have looked at the scorched earth left behind
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.800]   by the litigation and followed his own advice about recognizing
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:12.000]   when it's time to move on.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.560]   I don't think Steve would be moving on.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:16.000]   I've looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself,
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.560]   if today were the last day of my life,
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.520]   what I want to do, what I'm about to do today--
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:22.120]   this is from his famous Stanford commencement.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:22.960]   Yeah, he'd be still.
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.400]   The best thing about these lawsuits-- and I say this purely
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.360]   selfishly-- is how much of the history of the development
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.120]   of the iPhone that it's made public.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:31.480]   Because Apple, given their own drawers,
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:32.880]   would not make any of this public.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.640]   And it is a really important cultural object.
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:37.560]   And it's a benefit to us.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:38.080]   Absolutely.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:40.320]   We've learned about Project Purple and the Purple Storm.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.040]   And the dorm.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:42.880]   By the way, somebody in the chair said Henry's dorm
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.960]   is the Purple Hayes dorm.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:46.640]   I think that's actually quite correct.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:48.440]   After more than 1,000 days of litigation,
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:51.720]   hopefully one morning, Kurt finishes up.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:53.840]   Soon, executives at Samsung and Apple
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:57.040]   will look at their reflection at a long last hit their limit
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.560]   of nose.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.880]   That's where he ends.
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:03.480]   But I don't think-- I don't know.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:03.920]   Is it--
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:05.240]   Apple signed deals with Motorola.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:07.360]   If signed deals with HTC, it's not impossible.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:07.760]   They've settled.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.160]   They've settled, in other words.
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:10.880]   This is now.
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.680]   The diminishing returns.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:15.640]   1.1 billion the first time, 119 million the second time.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.160]   Next is going to be 11 million.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:17.880]   Then it's going to be--
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:18.960]   All it was, people see.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:19.920]   It's just--
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:23.880]   I mean, 2012 was the big win.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:27.000]   I mean, that was the one that said, look, here is nearly $2 billion
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:27.960]   in refreshments.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:32.840]   Not only that, but as you guys have been saying,
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.400]   a very strong warning against anybody else who
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:38.480]   wants to be a major player and wants to make a phone that
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:41.520]   is too similar to the iPhone, major victory there.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:46.400]   Also, a major philosophical victory of having courts say,
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:50.680]   yes, it's not as though Apple just simply did some obvious things.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.000]   They put a lot of passion into this.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.520]   They put a lot of innovation.
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:57.040]   They built a lot of patents that they should have been issued.
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:58.760]   And those are being defended in court.
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.080]   Everything-- I think after that is kind of crumbs.
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:04.320]   And so I don't know-- I don't know what Steve Wooder would not
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:04.840]   have done.
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.280]   I don't know what is in Apple's best interest right now.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:11.000]   But I think that whatever they needed to achieve by suing Samsung,
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.720]   they got a couple of years ago.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.280]   And I do expect that we're going to see diminishing lawsuits
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.120]   and diminishing aggression on this front.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.800]   I mean, if they're trying to kill Android at this point,
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:23.400]   yikes.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.040]   Well, that's--
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.720]   I don't think it's a kill.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.320]   There's a time you can't kill cockroaches anymore.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.080]   You can only get them outside of your ear.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:31.840]   It'll exist.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.040]   I don't think the point is to kill Android.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.520]   I think the point is to make it unsafe for developers
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.440]   so that when they look at that and they think, oh, I'm just
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.960]   going to copy-- oh, whatever Apple just
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:41.960]   did, that's great.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.040]   And for them to think about it on the other end of that--
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.320]   I mean, I know there's a lot of legal things that as a company
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.880]   you always look at, whether it's how you develop things, what
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.000]   you do, how you deal with your employees, all those things,
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.200]   that are-- every decision is informed
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.320]   by the legal issues that are around it.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.720]   And so what Apple's doing is simply
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:02.320]   creating those legal issues so that everyone gets that when
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.920]   you see Apple do something really cool and you think you're
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.240]   going to add that to your operating system,
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:09.400]   know that they will be relentless.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.440]   Meanwhile, it continues.
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.040]   Edward Sung says they're going to appeal
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:16.960]   and they're doing an event just a few days before WWDC May 28
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.240]   to kick off a new conversation around health.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:25.040]   But wait, isn't Apple going to kick off the--
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.240]   John Pachkowski writing in the recode
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:31.680]   says a word of advice if you've been anticipating the debut
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.640]   of new category-defining hardware at WWDC, dial back
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:39.120]   your expectations, or be disappointed.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.640]   No new Apple TV.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.320]   Tim Cook, according to sources, will not show off a wearable
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:52.520]   device, will not even preview new software for the Apple TV.
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:56.560]   Mark Gurman says OS 10, 10, 10, and iOS 8,
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.960]   and maybe that health book app, but don't expect much more.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.040]   You guys agree?
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:05.600]   Yeah, I did say that a couple days ago that this is the last week
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.600]   for any pundit or analyst to make predictions about WWDC.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.800]   If you want to make sure that readers forget what you said
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.360]   by the time you're not actually made.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.520]   You've got to have 30 days separating your prediction
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.160]   and the actual--
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.720]   A return window for your predictions.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.920]   The biometric earpods-- no, not so much.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.600]   It was posted on Secret.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.320]   Now, anybody who reports a tech rumor
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.440]   that they read on Secret--
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.880]   I read a lot of tech rumors on Secret.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.120]   The very least what you should do is say, well, OK,
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.800]   I saw it on Secret.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:36.440]   This was the post.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:39.320]   Apple's new earpods will have sensors in them
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.800]   for heart rate and blood pressure.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.640]   Also, eye beacons so they don't get lost.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.160]   They'll require the lightning port.
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.520]   It's why the audio jack was moved to the bottom.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.520]   Whoever wrote this, obviously, smart.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:55.400]   Apple does have a patent for biometric sensors in the ears.
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:00.080]   Eye beacons, lightning port, I don't know.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.120]   It's credible, isn't it?
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.320]   And that's probably why--
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.040]   I think the thing is that whole--
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.960]   the best thing about a rumor is when it's close enough
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.360]   that you know, oh, that makes sense
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.440]   because you're really against soft tissue
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.520]   and you could theoretically get that data.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.200]   So I mean, I--
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:14.920]   The leakier--
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:15.280]   Weird thing.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.800]   I was like, this doesn't seem like something
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.360]   that Apple would do.
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.600]   When that-- and again, OK, so first of all,
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.480]   I hope we did not report it last week.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.080]   I don't think so.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.800]   And if we did, we would say, oh, yeah, this is--
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.120]   it was like crazy.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.560]   But everybody, but at all the tech--
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.360]   I have mixed feelings about reporting Apple.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.640]   Rumors in general.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.160]   Rumors are not news.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:34.840]   Right.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:38.200]   Rumors are just stuff floating around, often wrong.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.520]   They're a good conversation.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.040]   They're only--
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.040]   They're only give something to talk about
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:41.880]   as long as we tell people.
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:42.080]   Right.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:42.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.880]   I mean, they're interesting as launching off points
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:47.520]   for ideas on where Apple might be headed
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.640]   or the company that we think we understand
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.880]   how would they actually do this sort of idea.
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:55.440]   But yeah, there's a reason why just no one who--
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.200]   no journalist who likes their safety
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.440]   will ever speculate on anything that Apple might do
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:04.000]   any closer than 10 days before any sort of immediate event.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.720]   Because they are a company that can do almost literally
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.960]   anything and that can change their minds in the shortest--
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.640]   a shorter time frame than you can ever imagine.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:17.320]   So it's interesting to have the conversation about how
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.080]   health is going to be increasingly important.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:22.640]   Apple is such a perfect fit for the sort of mandate
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.480]   that they've given themselves to not only make
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.040]   a lot of money selling technology,
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:29.080]   but also improve people's lives and create brand new things.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.480]   And I don't think there's been a device right now that really
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.360]   cracks that for now.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.760]   And the idea of having a health device that can really
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.840]   be-- take away all the problems of wanting to monitor
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.640]   your activity and monitor your fitness,
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.840]   that's something that Apple would be in with both hands.
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.560]   Yeah, I can't imagine them putting IBKINS in this.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.920]   The thing would cost too much.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.080]   It would have to have battery life.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.920]   Well, also--
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:56.040]   my thing is the strain relief of having all that strain
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.280]   on the lightning connector.
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.680]   I think that I don't think the lightning connector is something
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.800]   they want to use for something that's
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.320]   going to be bounced around and jostled around it.
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.320]   I mean--
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:07.400]   So the guy who posted the original secret created a tumble log,
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.960]   then linked to it from that secret post,
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:13.560]   is tumble log post, "Close the Ear Pod Doors, please,
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.480]   Hal, and Apology."
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.680]   I leaked the story about biometric ear pods,
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.000]   but I'm not proud of it.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.920]   Hundreds of blog posts, thousands of tweets,
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.800]   all the new news items from the Daily Mail
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.640]   in the UK to the evening news, the evening news in the US,
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.160]   all because of a post on secret.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.040]   He says, "I wrote it five minutes after I woke up
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.080]   on the 1st of May.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.080]   I was blurry.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.080]   I had a headache.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.600]   I was using the toilet and worried about my blood pressure.
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:41.880]   I'd been messing around with secret as an outlet for comedy."
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:42.880]   He said--
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:43.960]   He said, "He's a joke."
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.120]   Right.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.960]   But you know you post this stuff.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.680]   Well played.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.120]   Well, but good on him, because if you're
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.760]   in the entire post, he's a rather-- the tumble post,
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.160]   he said that the reason why he's coming clean is that now he's
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.560]   afraid that people who work inside Apple
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:00.280]   are going to get investigated or even fired for, quote,
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:03.360]   "laking out information on the idea of that."
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.200]   With that, the ironic.
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:05.720]   So yeah.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.320]   Well, that was silly.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.560]   He calls Apple to cancel the biometric headgear.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:12.640]   He says that.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.200]   The first thing I felt was fear.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:19.320]   He says, "I didn't put it on Reddit."
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:20.640]   I guess that's where it goes next.
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.400]   It goes from secret to Reddit.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.720]   And then from Reddit to tech crunch.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:28.680]   And then from tech crunch to bigger mainstream media outlets,
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:29.960]   pretty soon it's true.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:30.460]   Right.
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:31.440]   I mean, it's zero risk.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.920]   You get to have Apple in a headline.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.440]   And you didn't create the rumor.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.920]   So if it's wrong, you'll just do another follow-up story
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.200]   that has Apple in the headline.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:42.320]   He says, "I just made it all up on the crapper."
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.480]   Well done.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:48.360]   Why can't I create some kind of viral rumor?
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:48.920]   OK.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.920]   Anyway, it's fake.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.240]   I posted something that was like 5,000 words
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.360]   long last week that probably didn't get as much attention
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.080]   as this.
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.360]   That's where the frustration--
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.760]   You were obviously-- you were obviously
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.200]   around or into the bathroom where--
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:06:59.700]   Exactly.
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:02.520]   You were generating your post from the wrong desk.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:02.960]   From the audience.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:03.880]   We sucked it out of the closet.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.160]   I thought you were going to say generating the post from the wrong end.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:06.280]   But--
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:08.920]   Exactly.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, I am so excited.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.000]   This is going to be my pick of the week.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:12.520]   Give it to me.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.040]   Give it to me.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.440]   This is my pick of the week.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.600]   We're going to get to our pick of the weeks in just a second.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.240]   So Lisa says, I'm making muffins, brand muffins,
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.480]   healthy brand muffins.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.680]   She says, I don't want the muffin.
[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:22.840]   I just want the top.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.520]   I said, well, you've got to have the muffin.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.480]   If you're going to have the top, she says, no,
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:29.080]   I'm going to find muffin top pans.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.480]   They make pans that are just muffin tops.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.480]   Oh, muffin tops.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.480]   I had no idea.
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.600]   You're right.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.120]   There's no reason to eat the rest of it.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.160]   You just want the muffin top.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.760]   Ladies and gentlemen, I give you from Chicago--
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.480]   Except for their delicious.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.360]   Oh, man.
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.760]   The original muffin top pan.
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:48.480]   That is awesome.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.840]   My pick of the week, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.080]   You know what else would that be really good for?
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.080]   You know what else that's good for?
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:53.560]   What?
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:56.800]   Because you could use that to cook your little egg sandwiches
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.120]   to go in and like English muffin with a little piece of ham,
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.120]   little--
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.920]   I'm going to make all sorts of stuff in the muffin top.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.200]   Small pancakes.
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.880]   Do we have any questions, Alex Lindsey?
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:06.600]   Oh, yes we do.
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:11.400]   B-I-T dot L-Y slash MB401 for our question engine.
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:13.800]   OK, this is our most-- and what's interesting about this,
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.240]   by the way, is if you look at the questions,
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.400]   is that there's like five of them that are very popular,
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:18.480]   and the rest of them are just--
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.800]   How do I get that interface?
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.240]   So, Dash, I don't think I have you.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:23.360]   Oh, I think you're an admin.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.160]   I am an admin.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.040]   Dashboard.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:26.840]   Look at this.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.240]   Look at this.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.680]   There's a graph.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:31.000]   You do a graph of questions asked over time.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.520]   Yeah, you can't show people that yet.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.000]   So anyway, so--
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.160]   Don't look through the muffin.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.440]   There's no graph.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.280]   But it's interesting that I actually go back to Dashboard
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:38.720]   one more time.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:39.440]   I'll show you one more.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:39.440]   OK.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.440]   OK.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:43.360]   You can show this, Chad, even though it's not good.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.680]   But you can have--
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.360]   we've had 169 people.
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.120]   Yep, registered.
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:47.800]   182 questions.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:48.800]   282 questions.
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:49.800]   Two 182 questions.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.800]   18 answered.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:51.280]   18 answered.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.600]   Some of those answered off the year, obviously.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.640]   I answered some of them.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.640]   But then you can see some of them.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.160]   It's cool.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.480]   So then I can look at questions here.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.920]   OK, now to turn that part off.
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.680]   So anyway, so now click on that little thing that
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.520]   looks like an iPhone.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.960]   Oh, this is the pretty interface.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.440]   Now when you click on--
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:07.240]   Back to Jersey Fudge.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.200]   Click on this little gear.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.120]   Oh, click on the gear.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:09.440]   OK.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.440]   And--
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.120]   Oop.
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:11.640]   Oop.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.120]   Aio.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.160]   And then you can show this, Chad.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.160]   It's not tied.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.120]   I answered questions.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:15.480]   OK.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.280]   Close it.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:18.400]   This is very-- it's like you put effort into this.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:19.360]   We put a lot of effort into this.
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:20.360]   It's like some programs.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:20.520]   It's free.
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:21.720]   Andy and Andy.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:22.720]   What are you writing?
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:23.560]   Is it a Python?
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.160]   It sits in Heroku.
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.160]   Oh, it's Ruby on.
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:26.680]   OK.
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:27.920]   Hey, it's--
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.480]   So anyway, so--
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.720]   If you were put in charge, ask Kester, JTT, from Trinidad,
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.720]   Trinidad, and Tobago.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:35.600]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.120]   Click on this.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:36.520]   Click on this.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:37.280]   What happens now?
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.480]   Is it going to make it a big question?
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.160]   And then hit answer.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:39.680]   Answer.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:39.960]   And then--
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.560]   If you were put in charge of the next Apple TV--
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.160]   oh, this is nice.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.120]   It's pretty and red and big.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:46.640]   What are the three-- this is good, Alex.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.640]   I like this.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:48.920]   Are you going to sell this?
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:49.760]   That's the plan.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.880]   What's his name?
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.000]   Andy, Ab Gotson.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.440]   Andy, Ab Gotson, thank you.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.720]   I think I said that Andy's name, right?
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.080]   Andy, I know you're watching, so I'm sorry if I didn't say it,
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:57.360]   right?
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.080]   Ab Gotson.
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.760]   Most of the people just call him Spoon.
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:03.880]   So anyway, but Andy is one of those.
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:05.240]   So anyway, so--
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.160]   If you were put in charge of the next Apple TV, kids,
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:11.040]   what are the three main things you would change or add?
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.360]   Games or apps?
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.800]   No, just forget games.
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.320]   Apps.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.000]   Apps.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.640]   Open the door for App Store.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.560]   Store.
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.120]   One, number two.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.080]   Universal Search.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.520]   Universal Search, Bingo.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.320]   Survey says--
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:28.600]   Survey says is Universal Search number two.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:29.760]   Webcam.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.120]   No.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.160]   Notifications.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.560]   You lose.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.160]   Survey says--
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.080]   I'd want to be a receiver for notifications, too.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.040]   Speech enabled.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.840]   Yeah, Siri.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:42.720]   Siri's a Webcam.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.720]   That's so hard-- well, speech enabled--
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.440]   I do not want notifications on my TV.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:48.520]   I do not--
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.720]   You can have a Skype server.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.320]   I hate it when people call and then I get their phone number
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.680]   in the front of Game of Thrones or 24 or--
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.880]   OK, but that's why you have a notifications manager for this.
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.200]   That lets you say, I want to hear things from this app,
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.880]   this app, this app, but not this one, this one, or this one.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.200]   As long as the number time--
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.840]   The number of times that I'm watching TV,
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.560]   and I have-- I've got my phone handy
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.520]   or I've got my computer handy, not because there's
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.320]   something I'm actively doing, but there's something
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.840]   I sort of actively want to keep an eye on.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:18.480]   I want the Apple TV to be less a thing that I put--
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.040]   I want to be less of a streaming music player
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.280]   and a way to integrate this big, huge, wonderful screen
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.840]   that's in the social area of my house--
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.040]   You want that more than speech?
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:31.840]   Into the services that I've got on my digital network.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:32.240]   That's all.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.040]   You want that more than speech?
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:40.480]   Speech-- well, because speech is fine, but how are you going to use it?
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:43.920]   It works great on the Fire TV as a way of not having
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.080]   to type out--
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.040]   Game of Thrones.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.400]   Or exactly.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:53.240]   But in terms of voice command, are you going to have it listening
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.280]   all the time or--
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.400]   No, I have my Xbox One, does that--
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.080]   Are you going to make sure this is going to have a wide enough
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.400]   library of commands that I don't have to have a card handy?
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.400]   Just say, oh wait, I'm supposed to say, find me--
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.360]   Two-frame of Thrones on the DVR.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.680]   No, and that's what's nice about Amazon.
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:10.880]   You just say the name, right?
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.360]   There's no command.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.200]   But there are two commands I'd like.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.240]   You have to hold down a microphone button on the remote
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:17.600]   to activate it.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.520]   Google now could make that work.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:24.280]   But only if-- it's amazing to me, the more of these devices
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:26.600]   that I try, the more interfaces that I try,
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:31.320]   how few of them do anything better than up down, left, right, OK.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.240]   On an actually nicely made remote.
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.160]   But I got to tell you the thing I use it all the time
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.640]   on the Xbox One, Xbox Pause.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:40.880]   If you want to get up and go to PP to say Xbox Pause,
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.280]   you don't touch anything.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.000]   And it stops.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.320]   And then you come back in the room and say, Xbox Play.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.320]   So Pause, Play.
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:51.520]   And I-- OK, so I'm going to-- this is it.
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.480]   We're at tabling this conversation.
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:56.600]   To answer Kester JJ, we all agree App Store.
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:57.920]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.880]   We all agree universal search.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:03.120]   Yes, better launcher too.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.560]   We got this big grid that is just scroll, scroll, scroll,
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:07.080]   scroll.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:07.960]   I can hide.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:08.960]   I can show.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.840]   I will never, ever, ever, ever use
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.440]   ESB and channel Ocho.
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.200]   Well, you can remove it.
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:15.880]   That app.
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:17.680]   But Andy, you can't remove it.
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.920]   But you have to do it in the parental controls.
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.200]   Yeah, you can hide from the screen now.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:21.840]   They made it easier.
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:22.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.320]   We really do have to see an overhaul of the user interface.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.760]   It also has to be faster.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.800]   I switched back to Apple TV for a couple of weeks
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:32.520]   just to make sure I'm re-centering my expectations.
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.520]   And the number of times that I have
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.200]   to look at a spinning progress bar or something that says
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.920]   you're now being authenticating right now,
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.960]   compared to the Roku or anything else I've got plugged into my TV,
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.040]   it's like, wow, that is so freaking slow.
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.040]   All right, I'm going to table the--
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:47.600]   No, plus side.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.440]   Go ahead.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.440]   I was going to say on the plus side, Apple's
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.640]   paying their own transit fees for Netflix, so it's right.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:52.400]   I agree.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.200]   Best Netflix ever.
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.320]   Dan Rayburn said that.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.800]   So the interface sucks, but good playback.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.200]   I'm going to be Judge Lucy Coe right now.
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:06.440]   OK, I'm talented, but I'm not going to do an accent.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.840]   Again, number one app store.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:08.400]   We all agree.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.480]   Number two, we all agree universal search.
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.280]   Number three, we mostly agree.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.000]   Voice.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:14.640]   With a webcam.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:15.480]   With a--
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.480]   No!
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.720]   Give me a new question.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:20.320]   Are you hit done?
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:20.720]   I'm making--
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:21.600]   Did done.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.800]   Oh, wait, I hit Escape.
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:23.320]   Uh-oh.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:23.880]   Well, we'll see how this goes.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:24.720]   Escape a mistake.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:25.880]   I just won't turn off.
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:26.720]   It won't mark it as done.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:27.520]   Anyway, so--
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.480]   Google releases classroom today.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:30.000]   Uh-oh.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.120]   Oh, no, it's confused.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.080]   Now it's confused.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.080]   I broke it.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.080]   Well, we're looking on it.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:34.760]   That was easy.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:35.400]   Right, Alex, can't have a nice--
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.960]   This is why we beta tested on the show.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:39.720]   So how do I get it big?
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:41.760]   I don't know if you can right now.
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.760]   Because it was probably still on another page.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.440]   Oh, maybe there's another page up into my browser?
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:45.960]   No.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.160]   No, no, no.
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.800]   Dude, you put it into a new state.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.320]   Let's place back.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:50.840]   Let's see here.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.480]   OK, back.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.400]   And then iPhone interface.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.200]   And then answer.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.480]   Well done.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.000]   Adrian Merington of Midland, Michigan, says,
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.840]   Google releases classroom today.
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:03.760]   I don't know about that.
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.200]   So classroom is an integrated solution
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:08.280]   to the-- basically takes the Google Docs
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.000]   and then adds a wrapper around that
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.240]   to make it easier for assignments and classes and everything
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:13.760]   else.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.320]   You can use it in a school.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.760]   And assign student stuff.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.520]   And all the Google Docs are easy to register.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.360]   And this teacher can look at them and all that stuff.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.920]   But Adrian says, Apple seems to have forgotten about schools.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.080]   What do they need to do to remain relevant to the classroom?
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.600]   They've done one thing already, which is an 899 MacBook
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:27.800]   Air.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.720]   I think that was directly aimed at that.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.080]   I can only think of the iPad as being common in classrooms.
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:35.240]   They've got-- they've got-- they own classrooms
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:36.800]   of the iPad, don't you think?
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.320]   They do pretty well with them.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.880]   I think textbooks--
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:41.000]   textbooks they let drop.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:41.760]   They let slide.
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:42.920]   That was a good opportunity.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.400]   I think that there's an opportunity
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.640]   to redefine what a classroom is, which is not what anybody's
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.560]   doing right now, which is--
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:50.880]   anyway.
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:51.560]   I'm sure--
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:56.240]   Just the fact that-- I think Google Docs is now the air
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.840]   and the oxygen in the atmosphere of education
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.080]   at this point, where I can't do it.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.520]   It can't be.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.840]   I mean, in promos, it was a lot more.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.360]   More choices, they're announcing new Chromebooks today.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.480]   There's more choices.
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.000]   And I think--
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.240]   I just feel like that's a strong contender.
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.020]   Apple's really good.
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:15.000]   It's a more democratic system, where no matter what it is
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.520]   that you're running at home or whatever you have access to,
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.680]   it can run to Google Docs.
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:20.800]   That's not true of pretty much any other solution you can--
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:22.680]   I could won't do that.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:25.600]   Well, I think that though, if you want to-- again, you're
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:29.200]   stuck with a $350 buy-in for anything.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.280]   Where else you probably--
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:33.400]   No school, no government wants to tell parents,
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.720]   you have to be in the Apple e-covers.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.960]   And I'm sure they don't want to have a five-year plan that
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.640]   says, at no point, can we ever add anything to this group
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:44.600]   that doesn't have an Apple logo on it.
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.320]   The web apps are really, really good,
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.480]   but it's not up to what educators want.
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.440]   And also, they're running into the same effect
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:54.040]   that Microsoft got with Microsoft Office, where it no longer
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.880]   has to be the greatest suite in the world.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:59.640]   It happens to be the suite that everybody knows how to use.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.640]   And they just don't want to have to train people up
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:02.800]   on a brand new system.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.480]   Or every time you get a new employee,
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.920]   train that person up on a whole new system.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:07.880]   And it's not fun either.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:10.080]   It's just how much time do you want to spend learning this
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:10.080]   first?
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:10.680]   We're doing lightning rounds.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.160]   So we're going to move on.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.320]   Paul France, Pennsylvania, given the Apple TV stuff,
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.000]   when will that get a UI update?
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.280]   And will it require new hardware?
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.400]   Ready, Richie?
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.440]   You know.
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.200]   There will probably be a version that runs on existing
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:24.720]   hardware, but the new version will probably also
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.640]   come with a new refreshed interface.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:31.200]   What's next for iCloud.com asks Mark in Atlanta, iTunes.
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:33.640]   My message, I photo, I give up.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:34.840]   I work.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:37.000]   I mean, I mean, I mean, that it works.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.840]   You know, just that it's smooth, it works, that it's--
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.720]   you know, like, I think that's all I do.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:41.480]   Are you wrong?
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:44.320]   Apple will give up cloud entirely and say,
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.600]   just buy more hardware.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.000]   I sneak around that.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.640]   Photo and video is going to be the--
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:49.800]   Yeah, photo and video.
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:50.400]   Yeah, they need to.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.800]   They killed the photo gallery, and they haven't put it back yet.
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.800]   What are the challenges?
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:56.840]   This is from a wake in--
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:59.440]   I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.800]   Los Angeles, California.
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.280]   What are the challenges or roadblocks for Apple?
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.200]   What is the blue line doing that going across?
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:05.800]   It's refreshing.
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:06.400]   It's refreshing.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.880]   It doesn't do anything when it's a single page,
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:08.880]   but it does one.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.720]   What are the challenges or roadblocks for Apple to open up
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.920]   Apple TV for developers?
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:15.920]   I love my Amazon Fire TV, which, by the way,
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.520]   works with Cosh's Allcast.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:18.960]   Interesting.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.280]   So it is open because it's using dial.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.600]   It seems to be pretty open.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.320]   I think that the roadblock is Apple just doesn't want to do it.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:29.440]   I think that they're afraid of making it complicated and messy
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.120]   and everything else, and I think that they need to.
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:33.520]   I think that they've been able to do it.
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.920]   It's just an iOS app.
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.360]   They just need new hardware.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.960]   It costs to Hyde Park, New York.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.600]   Home of the beautiful Franklin Delano Roosevelt
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.480]   home and museum park.
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:46.440]   Will iTunes on the Mac be split into different apps?
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.640]   As soon as it leaves Windows.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.040]   No, absolutely.
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.560]   I mean, they have to port it to Windows,
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.560]   so they bundle it all up in one bit.
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:55.240]   They can't do it in Windows, yeah.
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:58.360]   Will they ever give up Windows?
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.560]   No, because they want to sell those guys iPhones too.
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.120]   Kevin, "Okolala, Florida."
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.880]   Since Windows 8 has been such a poop fest,
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:11.800]   he uses the word disaster, but I know he meant poop fest.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.440]   Do you think Apple is more likely to keep OS 10
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:17.360]   at true desktop laptop OS?
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.200]   They've already said that they don't want any interest
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.160]   in hybridizing the desktop operating system.
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.400]   They want to take great ideas like power management
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:26.200]   and a cleaner interface from iOS,
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.040]   but they never want to give someone a confusing choice
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.480]   between an iPad and a MacBook Air.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.800]   So I don't think that-- I think we'll see a lot of big redesign,
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.360]   but I don't think we'll see anything that
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:39.440]   is as aggressive as Windows 8.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.360]   Is it doing them in order automatically?
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:41.880]   Do I have to--
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.240]   No, it's a pre-order image, just that you've
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.440]   gotten rid of all the most asked ones,
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:46.520]   and now these are all--
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.200]   These are only--
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:47.700]   Evening.
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:48.200]   No, no, no, no.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:48.680]   One more.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:49.200]   One more.
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.440]   This is for Annie.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:55.040]   "Can not go from JZ in the United States of America."
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.000]   Andy, would you ever consider hosting your own comic photo
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:58.720]   tech show on Twitch?
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:00.440]   You already do one.
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.800]   I do one on the 5x5 network, an Aqua Almanac.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.400]   Also, we're bringing back old tech news,
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.720]   where I do sort of audiobook versions of my tech writings
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.680]   for Chicago, sometimes and elsewhere.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.640]   But to answer your question directly, anytime--
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:15.480]   my short-- my sort of my shield are always available to Twitch
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.120]   whenever they want to call upon them for any show
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.720]   that they would like me to do, or even just guest on every now
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:20.040]   of them.
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:23.400]   To be fair, Andy did come to us and say,
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:25.920]   I'd like to do an Aqua Zomannack.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.600]   He gave us right of first refusal,
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.040]   even though it's not in your contract.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:31.440]   And we said, no, hell no.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:35.240]   OK, hold for it.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.600]   If you want to change that to a little--
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:40.360]   No, I foolishly probably said, you know,
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:42.360]   I think that we've done some geek culture stuff.
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.400]   It hasn't done all that well.
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.680]   It's fine with me if you want to do it with Dan over at 5x5.
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.640]   That seems like a very good place for you to do it.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:51.480]   And it has done very well at 5x5.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.640]   Yep, we just did our 100th episode.
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:56.720]   And after 100 episodes, I think I figured out how to do that.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:59.720]   So hopefully the next ones will be even better.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:01.920]   Last question, and I tell you why.
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:05.760]   It comes from somebody named Lisa in Petaluma, California.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.040]   Who could that be?
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:10.880]   Camrynne, explain what is behind him on the shelf.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:11.720]   Have we ever done that?
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:13.880]   Have we ever done a tour of the shelf?
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.640]   We've been bit by bit.
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:18.720]   Yeah, so we have a Lego Batman Arkham Asylum.
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:20.360]   Yeah, we saw you build that.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:23.320]   Original iPad, original iPad mini,
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:26.280]   bunch of Canon photo equipment, original Apple TV,
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.760]   and the second generation Apple TV,
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:32.560]   all the iPhones with a bunch of Steve Jobs avatars.
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.080]   I don't know what the right word is.
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:37.840]   A bunch of Nokia and Palm and BlackBerry and Android devices.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:42.120]   Cheese greater Mac, and the rest is not finished yet.
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:43.800]   I just want to reach up to the top shelf
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:46.880]   and tap that first iPod box on the immediate right
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.640]   to see all of them just sort of domino over.
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.720]   That's all I want to do.
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.160]   And I had an X-Men number one up there,
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:55.440]   but it kept falling down, so I thought that was not the best.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.640]   Do you dust before the show as I cleaned the house
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.200]   before the cleaning lady?
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.720]   I swear is vigorously as I possibly care.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:03.240]   Yes, I swear.
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.800]   Not a wet Swiffer, I hope, a dry Swiffer.
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:06.880]   No, yes.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.560]   You know, Cat Schwartz, the woman I used to work with
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:12.880]   on Call for Help, she was one of our producers at Tech TV.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.240]   Swore that she invented the Swiffer
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.160]   and never got a penny for it.
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.320]   She was at a meeting, I guess, in the company
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.440]   that invented it, whoever it is.
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.600]   And she said, "You know what we need?"
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:26.760]   What the world really needs is a rag attached
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:29.000]   to a piece of plastic attached to a pole
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.440]   that you could dust with, and the Swiffer was born.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:33.720]   They went, "That's an excellent idea."
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:36.320]   At least I'm Petaluma for that wonderful question.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.960]   Scorched Earth, Leo.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.960]   She should go scorched Earth on this one.
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.280]   She should.
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:44.840]   We're gonna take a break when we come back.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:47.560]   Ready your picks of the week, my friends.
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:48.760]   It is time.
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:50.440]   You know who was here yesterday?
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.640]   I really had fun meeting with them as the team
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:54.720]   from 99 Designs.
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.160]   We love 99 Designs.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:03.160]   These guys help businesses who are looking for logos,
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:09.800]   menus, landing pages on Facebook, any kind of branding
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.800]   to help them really look great.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:15.720]   We do our t-shirt designs there, and we love 99 Designs.
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:19.480]   Quality affordable designs from a gigantic community
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:22.640]   of designers, almost 300,000 graphic designers now,
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:24.800]   at 99designs.com.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.520]   It's so important that you have a brand that works.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:32.160]   We had an email from a pastor at the East Point Church
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.280]   in Ohio.
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:36.080]   Lisa forwarded it on to me, Ant and 99 Designs.
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:39.640]   It was really cool, and I know Pastor Chadwick watches.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.480]   He heard us talking about it, and he said,
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:44.320]   "I think it's time for a new logo for the church."
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:46.840]   But he had ideas about what he wanted,
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.320]   so what he did is he made a contest,
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.200]   and that's what they call them design contests,
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.040]   on 99designs.
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:55.880]   Within days, they had over 100 logo options to look through.
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:58.000]   He says, "We took about a month to go through the options
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.760]   "to choose our winning design.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:00.600]   "Designer got paid.
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.760]   "East Point Church got a fantastic new logo."
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:06.400]   He says, "It was a logo that respected our heritage,
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.000]   "but was fresh and modern."
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.200]   I just, Pastor Chadwick, thank you for sending that email
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:14.280]   and he writes, "Thanks to Mac Break Weekly in 99designs.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:16.600]   "For helping our church move into the 21st century
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.240]   "with a great looking design.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.120]   "It's a great way to get high quality graphic design
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:20.960]   "at affordable price."
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:25.280]   Thank you, Pastor Chadwick, and thank you, 99designs.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:27.280]   Great designers from all over the world await you.

[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:23.920]   Especially you when you get that power pack of savings for free.
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:26.880]   Andy and Ico, you're a pick of the week, my friend.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:30.080]   I got a quick one and a little longer one.
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:32.800]   This one, the quick one is this thing I just started getting
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.680]   into a couple of weeks ago.
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:37.760]   This is just any brand of silicone tape.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:39.600]   It's one of those things.
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.880]   You keep it around the house.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:43.840]   You keep it around like the garage and you will find uses for it.
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:46.400]   It's just pure silicone and it sticks to all these stuff.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.080]   What is it? How is it different from electrician's tape?
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.440]   What is it? I don't understand what it is.
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:50.880]   It has no adhesive.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.120]   It only sticks to itself.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:54.400]   It won't stick to the thing that you're wrapping it around.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.840]   Which means that if you've got a tangle of cables
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:59.480]   underneath your desk and you just want to take these four cords
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:01.000]   and make them into one cord,
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.280]   you can quickly do a couple of wraps.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.920]   One, two, three, four around it.
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:07.600]   And not only will just stay together pretty much for life,
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.520]   but as soon as you cut it off,
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:12.240]   it will just pop right off and not leave any residue behind.
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:13.920]   They're great for repairing cables.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:16.880]   Like if you've got like those older iOS cables that get brittle
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.200]   with heat and now this kind of a break in it,
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.160]   you can easily just wrap it and heal it up.
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:24.320]   Again, it'll stick to itself and not anything else.
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:26.400]   So it's not like electrical tape where it's going to cause this
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:27.600]   gummy mess.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:32.720]   And also, it's heat proof up to 500 degrees
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.360]   and it's freeze proof down to minus something.
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:38.320]   So like if you have this in the glove box of your car
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.240]   and you bust a hose or something like this,
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.800]   you can fix it right there by the side of the road.
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:45.280]   And it's not just, oh, we can limp along,
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:48.720]   but you can probably get home or get to your garage on it
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.920]   as long as you replace whatever coolant that you lost at the time.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.000]   It's good for making wrapping handles of things
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.200]   to make actually good handles.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:58.320]   I repaired my snow shovel before putting it away.
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:26:59.520]   Oh, God. Now we're going to definitely get it.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:00.320]   What brand?
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:03.360]   What brand? Because you're showing extreme tape.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.120]   This is this is this is a matter.
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.320]   A whole bunch of the people make it.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:10.000]   This is this brand is cheaper than probably you'll find from 3M.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.280]   Also, you can get it at Home Depot.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.880]   It's like six bucks for a roll.
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:16.560]   And I don't get out of my chair, so I'm going to order it on Amazon.
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:19.440]   Exactly. So I mean, it says good from minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.360]   to plus 500 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:21.680]   Okay.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:25.280]   Permanent air and watertight seal insulates to 500 volts.
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.160]   400 volts.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.440]   So like I said, if you got there, if there's any time where I've got like a busted
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:35.280]   washing machine hose in here, I don't want to.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:38.320]   The reason why I've definitely bought this was because I thought about this
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.840]   and I read all the recommendations of it.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:43.920]   I knew that if I ever have an emergency with a washing machine or the dishwasher
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:46.320]   and I'm struggling to prevent a flood, I'll be thinking,
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:49.040]   you know, now would be a good time to be able to reach into that kitchen drawer
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.760]   and pull out this tape that someone recommended to me four weeks ago
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:53.760]   that could have solved this problem immediately.
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.440]   But now you decided to maybe not.
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.120]   Okay. Six dollars. Good. Whatever.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:02.000]   So that's it's just it's on that list of tools where buy it, have it around.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.040]   You will find uses for it because I've this is the this is now the third role
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.200]   that I bought because I bought one to play with.
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:10.080]   And now I bought a second role to have on the first floor of the house
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:14.240]   and a third role to have inside the car because again, I got a high mileage car.
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.000]   It runs great, but I'm sure that at some point it's going to say it's going to go
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.840]   blues mobile on me and say, yeah, I've had a good run, but I'm going to go to Jesus right now.
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:26.320]   This will this will at least help me get home instead of getting a 50 mile toe
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.840]   back to the garage.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.680]   I buy all the crap you come up with.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:34.720]   But I still have like four rolls of velcro twist table cable ties.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:36.720]   I just love this stuff.
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:40.800]   Exactly. It's like there's always like five or six of them like in just permanently inside
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:45.200]   like that my rollaway bag because it's the only way to keep anything in order is to have
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.080]   lots of these handy.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:48.160]   I'm buying three rolls right now.
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:48.640]   There you go.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:53.280]   The other quick thing is that an update to a recommendation I probably made I think last year
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:58.080]   Ulysses is one of is a text editor for Mac OS.
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:59.600]   It's a markdown editor.
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:04.240]   They've just updated to 1.2 and added a whole bunch of really nice new features that make it
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.200]   easy to manage a multiple document project.
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:10.400]   There are a lot of simple plain markup markdown editors.
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:15.600]   Not all Ulysses is probably the only one of those that is really good at organizing projects
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.280]   that are spread across several files, which is what pretty much anything you're doing.
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:23.440]   If you're writing lots if you're writing a book project or a novel or a lot of things for
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:26.400]   different websites, it's the only way to keep these things organized.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:30.800]   There are a bunch of really good features, but the really good reason for recommending
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:36.320]   Ulysses is that right now there are only three really good solutions if you want to use an iPad
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:41.840]   and a Mac as your writing tool and be able to switch effortlessly between those two.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.280]   One is iWork.
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:46.160]   The other is Microsoft Office right now.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:50.960]   Ulysses is the other one because they have the same manufacturer, the same maker of this app
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:58.320]   has a companion app called Datalis that brings over about 85 to 90% of the features of Ulysses.
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:01.760]   If you're using iCloud or Dropbox for syncing, you can just
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:06.400]   close your walk away from your Mac, pick up your iPad and all of your documents and all
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.800]   your projects are right where you left them and how you left them.
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:13.840]   It is a plain text editor, but it really does embrace the markdown spirit.
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:18.320]   It can spit out really nicely formatted documents in whatever format you want.
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.760]   One of the new features of 1.2 is a styles library.
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:26.320]   So after you've done this in plain text and markdown, no matter how you want to make it look,
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:29.600]   you don't have to necessarily roll your own.
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:34.080]   You can basically go to this little style gallery that's being contributed to by lots of different
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:37.920]   people and select how you'd like this document to finally work.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:44.080]   And you can also just drag and drop doc X files right into it to continue on your editing.
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:47.680]   So it's a $45. I think it's about $45.
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:49.760]   $44.95.
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:50.880]   $44.95.
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:55.840]   So it's not necessarily cheap, but it's certainly well worth its load for a Mac OS app.
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:31:02.560]   And until a Scrivener becomes available for iOS and that project is continuing onward,
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:09.440]   this is going to be one of the three really great ways to transition to basically have it
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:12.960]   not matter whether you're using a Mac or an iPad at any given moment.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.120]   Because the iPad really is a great, great writing tool.
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:18.560]   It's not a great, every single thing you might use a notebook for, but it is a super
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:19.600]   collaborative writing tool.
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:24.800]   So I think Alex Lindsey is going to like Renee Richie's pick of the week, Renee.
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:28.160]   So this, this exploded on my Twitter stream this morning.
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:33.200]   And it's always funny because every single coffee making implement, they can.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:35.120]   So the new geek thing is sous vide machines.
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:36.320]   Now, daddy, no.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.680]   Yeah, they're bad.
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:38.240]   No, I'm saying.
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.040]   Good one.
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.240]   Several really interesting ones.
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:42.960]   This is a second generation one from ANOVA.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:47.680]   And it fixes a lot of things around with the first one, but it also adds iPhone connectivity.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:50.800]   So no longer do humans like me have to screw up our steaks.
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:53.040]   Now that you just pick what you want to cook and it'll cook for you.
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:55.440]   So, okay, what is-
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:56.720]   Gives me an idea for another product.
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.320]   Alex is a big sous vide guy.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:03.760]   Sous vide is just a fancy term for immersion, you know, immersion, precision immersion cooking.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:08.400]   So you're putting your food into water that is carefully temperature controlled
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:12.320]   and then heating it at precisely that temperature for usually a long period of time.
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:13.680]   And temperature is very low.
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:14.160]   We should-
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:15.360]   Yeah, no, it's not always very low.
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.360]   I mean, it just depends on what you want to do with it.
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:21.600]   So, but the main thing is, is that it keeps the temperature within-
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:22.480]   It needs to be exactly-
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:28.160]   Typically point one degrees for any period of time, but really plus or minus one or two degrees
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:30.640]   wouldn't matter for most things.
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:31.760]   So you're buying what?
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.840]   You're buying this tube that you put in a pot?
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:34.640]   Yes.
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:35.360]   And it's circular.
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.120]   It's basically pushing the water around.
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:41.600]   And then you use a giant alligator clip to clip a zip lock bag-
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.040]   You could buy big ones to a rate idea.
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:45.200]   And then you put meat in there.
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:47.280]   This is, by the way, incredibly dangerous.
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:50.000]   The United States Department of Agriculture is going to come down on you.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000]   Pretty meat and plastic.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:52.960]   Can I take it there, Leo?
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:53.520]   Because there's no-
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:54.800]   We don't ever buy any meat with plastic.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:59.040]   Okay. Anyway, you're cooking it at, like, 102 degrees.
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.280]   No, 132. It's 30.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:01.760]   So- It's- so-
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:02.880]   Meat-safe temperatures.
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:03.400]   No, it's not-
[01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:04.160]   Meat-safe temperatures.
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:07.600]   132 degrees is the minimum. That is rare.
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:08.480]   So you can do 100-
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:11.760]   If you decide you want it well done, make it 150.
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.120]   You know, you can make it whatever you want.
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:15.520]   But you're not cooking it at a temperature that kills bacteria.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:17.680]   Yeah, 132 degrees brings it to the temperature
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:18.800]   that would kill everything in it.
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.160]   Okay. It is probably unsafe.
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:22.000]   You will not be getting any dandy cray-style mad cow.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.440]   There'll be no mad cow in my-
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.240]   Absolutely.
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:24.560]   Okay.
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:28.000]   You can buy immersion cookers that are the whole thing.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.200]   There's another one that was uncooked.
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:29.760]   They're much worse.
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:30.240]   That's-
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.040]   Yeah, 400-
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:31.680]   500 dollars.
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:32.160]   Right.
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:35.280]   This was available for $99, but that price went, I think,
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:37.840]   by the time it took me to write about it, that price was gone.
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:39.760]   I got it at the 120 mark, I think,
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:40.560]   and they have a couple of-
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:40.960]   Ah, sure.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:42.720]   --tradations of early bird specials.
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:43.840]   What do you think, Aynova's-
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.480]   Alex, what do you use?
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:47.440]   I have a sous vide-
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.200]   It's like a sous vide supreme or whatever.
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:50.080]   It's a-
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.440]   It's a box.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.080]   This is a very-
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:52.480]   Here's the thing.
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:53.440]   Is it a very competitive thing?
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:54.720]   These Aynova people are local,
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.640]   kind of, couple, right?
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:57.120]   They just-
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:58.560]   And iPhone connected Leo.
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:33:59.200]   That's kind of-
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:33:59.360]   I know.
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:33:59.360]   I know.
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:00.160]   The selling point is-
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:00.960]   No, I think this is a-
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:02.000]   I'm definitely going to get one.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.320]   Because I use the iGrill.
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:05.360]   Same thing where you-
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:05.760]   It keeps you-
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:06.320]   Yeah, iGrill's great.
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:07.200]   Keeps track of your grill-
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.800]   Well, and it does only ship in October, though.
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:09.600]   It's the one thing to remember.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.600]   So the thing about this is that a lot of times,
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.520]   if you're doing kind of a get-together,
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:14.960]   or you're doing a larger thing,
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:17.040]   you want to have actually a multiple of these,
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:18.160]   and it's much nicer.
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.280]   I don't want to really have-
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:21.200]   You want more than one?
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:21.920]   Yeah, because here's why.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:23.280]   Your chicken is at one thing,
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:24.480]   and your beef is at another,
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:25.920]   and your fish is at another.
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.120]   It depends on what you want to do with it.
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:28.880]   So if you, for instance, what happens is,
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:29.840]   if you take a-
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.040]   Let's say a tri-tip,
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.120]   and you put it into a sous vide cooker,
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:35.760]   it'll be cooked in an hour or two.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:36.240]   Oh, okay.
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:38.000]   But the longer you leave it in,
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.840]   it just simply continues to break down the toughness of it.
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:42.560]   So what you end up with,
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:43.600]   you leave it there for two days,
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:44.080]   which I've done.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:48.080]   And you end up with something that has the consistency of it.
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:49.920]   It has the taste of a tri-tip
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.920]   with the consistency of flame and yolk.
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.040]   And so it's a-
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.360]   And then you just fry it a little on the outside,
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:56.640]   and you're done.
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:59.360]   What's really cool about it when you're hosting people,
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.600]   at your house, is that everything is cooked,
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:02.560]   and just waiting,
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:05.280]   because time is not a precise thing.
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:07.360]   So you get all your meat to where you want it,
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:08.080]   you leave it all there,
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.080]   then you let your wife take as long as she's going to take
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:10.960]   to make the vegetables,
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:11.840]   which is-
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.680]   My wife is not very fast.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:14.640]   If you make vegetables-
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:15.200]   You don't make vegetables-
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:16.960]   Irredible vegetables, it's just not fast.
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:17.760]   Not sous vide though.
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:19.760]   No, I could, but the-
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:21.200]   Probably be primarily for meat.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:22.560]   No, no, no, you can do vegetables,
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.200]   you can do eggs.
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:23.760]   I do eggs.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:27.360]   Sous vide soft boiled eggs is amazing,
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:28.800]   because it's just perfect every time.
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.000]   It's exactly the same every time.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.120]   How long does it take to cook the egg?
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.680]   15 minutes, 10 minutes.
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:35.600]   But what happens is you get ready for your shower,
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:36.240]   you just drop them in,
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:37.120]   because it doesn't matter how long.
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.640]   What temperature do you cook the egg at?
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.040]   I cook it at 64 degrees Celsius.
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:44.080]   I don't know what that is.
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:44.720]   Okay.
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:47.440]   But anyway, so it's like 160 degrees,
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:48.080]   or something like that.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:52.320]   So, but the main thing is you have a bunch of people coming over,
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:53.040]   when they all get there,
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:53.840]   when you're all ready to go,
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:54.480]   and you want to eat,
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:54.960]   you're not-
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:58.320]   Oh, you don't have the time an hour and a half broil.
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:35:59.520]   You just literally pull it out,
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:02.800]   throw it into either a broiler on a pan,
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.320]   or in a barbecue,
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.680]   and it's done and ready to go.
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:07.200]   It's a great product.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:08.880]   And the fact that it's iPhone,
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:09.440]   but anyway,
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:11.360]   I've been thinking about making them.
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:15.840]   I'm not going to make them with their $160.
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:16.640]   Right.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:17.200]   You know, I'm just going to-
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:19.200]   So there's a number of companies doing these.
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.200]   So Sous vide dispelled,
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:24.320]   S-O-U-S-V-I-D-E.
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:26.080]   And-
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:26.800]   Exactly.
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.960]   All three of these guys have been on Kickstarter.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:31.520]   So it's kind of interesting.
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:33.680]   I think this is the only one that does iPhone,
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:35.520]   which for me would be the kicker.
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:36.480]   That's kind of an interesting-
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:38.080]   I think the $500 one does iPhone too,
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:39.120]   but that's also brand new.
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.440]   It's drawing out 800 watts.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:43.600]   Is that every time it's actually cooking something?
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:46.480]   That would be an awful lot.
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:47.600]   I think that typically what's happened-
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:47.680]   I think it's typically-
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:48.560]   It's typically three days.
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:51.360]   It's not leaving it on the whole time.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.600]   What it's doing is it turns on and off.
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:54.800]   So once it gets to temperature,
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.440]   now the thing is that it will stay at temperature
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:58.560]   and it'll be much more efficient
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.400]   if you put it in something that's much more insulated,
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.160]   because it's just measuring the water and adding it.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:04.000]   So the advantage of the cooker that I have
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.280]   is that it's very well insulated.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:06.000]   So it doesn't-
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.440]   Once it gets the water to that temperature,
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:09.840]   it doesn't have to do a lot more-
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.200]   Might be a reason to get something like that
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.080]   as opposed to something like this,
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.200]   which is just really a-
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:13.760]   Right.
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.120]   A prong you put in your pot.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:15.760]   This is exactly what-
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:19.840]   Suzanne Llewellyn, who works-
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.040]   He's our office manager.
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:23.840]   And her husband, Tom Anderson,
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.920]   and I were talking about building one of these.
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:28.640]   And it's pretty much what we had planned.
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.960]   I know a bunch of people who have these
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.640]   and they absolutely love them.
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:35.360]   To the extent that now they are cooking
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:37.440]   way more aggressively than they ever did,
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:39.520]   because it's the chainsaw principle.
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.120]   Let's see if it'll cut this now.
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:42.240]   And so they're trying to see
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:43.760]   what they can actually cook in these things.
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:44.080]   Right.
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:44.720]   I've just got-
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:45.280]   As a bachelor,
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:46.080]   I'm just glad to say that-
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:47.440]   See that boiling the bag dinners
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:48.160]   are finally getting-
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.120]   [laughter]
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:49.600]   --tradically they deserve.
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.280]   And thanks to PCI88,
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:54.320]   the FoodSafe minimum cooking temperatures
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:56.560]   from foodsafety.gov
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:58.640]   for ground meat and meat mixtures.
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:02.560]   Beef pork veal lamb turkey or chicken is 160 degrees.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.360]   That's great, but if you ask for a rare beef-
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:05.840]   I understand.
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:06.640]   It's 132 degrees.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:07.600]   I just don't want anybody to die
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:08.560]   because they heard this show.
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:09.680]   Right, right. There you go.
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:13.520]   A Nova is the product ANOVA on Kickstarter,
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:14.560]   if you would like to bid.
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.120]   And remember-
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:19.200]   All bids on Kickstarter at your own risk.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.240]   And now Alex Lindsay's pick of the week.
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:24.400]   I'd like to pick an app into the future.
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:25.840]   Okay.
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.520]   The replacement for Twist.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:28.320]   What happened to Twist?
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.400]   What do you mean Twist is still here?
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:31.600]   No, they died.
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:32.320]   What?
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:33.280]   Well now there's Glimpse.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.160]   It's not very good.
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:34.320]   No.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:34.800]   You would-
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.320]   For Twist to Glimpse?
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:37.200]   Buy a long shot.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:37.760]   Absolutely.
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:38.880]   Why did Twist die then?
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:40.160]   We don't know-
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:41.040]   They didn't charge anything.
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:41.520]   What were they-
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:42.480]   What was the business model?
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:44.080]   I think they didn't have a business model.
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:47.040]   I talked to one of the developers
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:48.320]   and they would not go into detail
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.000]   as to what actually went wrong,
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.280]   except to confirm that yes,
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:53.360]   this is an expirate.
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:54.240]   It's run down the curtains.
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.640]   So the idea of these apps, Glimpse and Twist,
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:59.120]   is that when you're late, you-
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:38:59.840]   Not even when you're late.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.920]   So for a long time, we had-
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:02.240]   I'm just-
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:03.360]   All here on the all I'm saying is,
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.360]   Glimpse isn't the solution.
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.880]   And Twist is-
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:09.120]   Was not the perfect solution,
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:09.920]   but a great solution.
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:12.080]   What we did is for everybody on our crew,
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:13.840]   we expected about an hour before an event
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:15.280]   for you to Twist us.
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:16.320]   And so we just knew where you were.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.760]   You know, like we knew-
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:18.400]   Are you-
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:20.640]   It creates a live map that your phone updates
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:22.320]   as you move closer to the event.
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.080]   So if I want to know where Joe is,
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:25.200]   I know exactly where he is.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:27.040]   He's stuck in traffic right here,
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:28.720]   or he's now at-
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:29.440]   Did he-
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:33.040]   Doesn't Google have some sort of similar functionality?
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:36.160]   The win is not simply tracking,
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:37.520]   because a lot of apps do that.
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:40.080]   For me, the unique win of Twist was that
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:41.920]   all you have to do is when you set out,
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:42.480]   you say,
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:44.800]   "Tell this person that I'm on my way."
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:47.440]   And then it will immediately text them,
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.760]   "Your ETA, not when you first create the Twist,
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:50.960]   but when you first start moving."
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:52.400]   So if you're still in your car,
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:56.560]   it will not update them unless there is a change to your ETA.
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:57.760]   So if you're stuck in traffic,
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:59.760]   or if you stop to pick up your dry cleaning,
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.560]   it will automatically,
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.760]   without any interference from you.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:03.600]   So you don't have to do anything,
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.160]   and the recipient doesn't have to do anything.
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:08.400]   This is what the list of the wine does, though.
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:09.440]   It just doesn't do it very well.
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:10.880]   It's just cumbersome.
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:11.520]   All of our-
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:12.480]   Everyone in our company is like,
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:13.120]   "Oh, I can't-
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:14.320]   They're all using Glims now."
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:14.960]   And they're all like,
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.240]   "This sucks!"
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:17.280]   You know, so anyway.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:17.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:18.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.720]   So you want somebody to come along and-
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:21.600]   I don't have time.
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:22.080]   I don't have time to twist,
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:23.600]   even though the company went out of business.
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:24.480]   It's because they didn't charge anything.
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:28.560]   I literally would have paid $10 per app
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:30.240]   for everyone in my company to have this app.
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:32.000]   You feel like this is built into something?
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:32.000]   Can I say-
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.760]   Can I say-
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:36.720]   Can I say, though, that I've talked to a lot of developers,
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:40.800]   like developers who are just socially,
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:41.680]   and we're all talking about,
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:43.120]   "Oh, God, Too Bad Twist is dead,
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:44.240]   because we all loved it."
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:46.160]   And they're a conversation three times
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:47.360]   now, conversations have brought up.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.440]   You know, we should do an app like Twist,
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:51.280]   because we just want that app back now,
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.480]   which shouldn't be too hard to do.
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:53.520]   So we'll do it.
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:54.160]   Maybe we'll do it.
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:54.800]   We should do it.
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:56.000]   You might try to tell us about something
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.760]   that you're using instead or-
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:00.160]   I think Windows Phone does that.
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:02.800]   All right.
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:04.640]   I'm going to wrap this sucker up,
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:05.600]   because we've got to get going.
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.360]   Hey, thank you very much, all of you,
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:09.120]   for your fabulous contributions today.
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.120]   Thank you, especially Alex Lindsey,
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:12.160]   for your Q&A-
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:12.720]   Kind of fun.
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:13.520]   Absolutely.
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:14.880]   I think it added immensely to show.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:15.760]   We'll continue to use it.
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:17.840]   As long as you let us.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:21.120]   I have a feeling that this is free until
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:23.360]   we get hooked.
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:25.520]   Well, you're the first one.
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.320]   We're just trying to test it.
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:27.360]   We're just trying to test it.
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:28.160]   Then, well,
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:30.800]   and the government agency that Alex has been working for,
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:32.880]   he's ducked it down and says that,
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:34.800]   as terms of your contract, we now own this.
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:37.760]   We're just trying to figure it out right now.
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:39.280]   Alex is at PixelCore.com.
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:40.960]   I don't know why I tell you this, but he is.
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:42.720]   Oh, by the way,
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:47.440]   tomorrow, Wednesday, at 9am Pacific Standard,
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:48.480]   we're going to use this question app,
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:52.720]   but I'm going to do a class in Rwanda for, on green screen.
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:55.520]   But I am going to include everybody.
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:56.880]   So we're going to stream it to YouTube,
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.640]   and we're going to put it into the question engine.
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.920]   So if you want to learn about green screen,
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:01.600]   tomorrow at 9am Pacific Standard,
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:05.440]   sorry, it's in the morning, but it's like multi-camera.
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:07.200]   It's not like me sitting there on my computer
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:08.160]   talking about green screen.
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.120]   I'm going to walk it around.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:09.760]   I'm going to show myself.
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:12.000]   It's us experimenting with a new classroom format.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000]   And anybody can join us.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000]   So if you want to do that, come and join us.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000]   How do you follow Alex Lindsay on Twitter?
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:18.800]   Yeah, follow me on Twitter.
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.200]   I'm meant to put it up, but it'll be...
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:23.920]   Come back to me in one second.
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:24.800]   I'll have a report.
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:27.840]   Alex L-I-N-D-S-A-Y on Twitter.
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:30.640]   Mr. Andy Inacos at the Chicago Sun Times,
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:33.280]   the host, as you've heard of many shows on other networks.
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:36.640]   And he's close friends with Obi-Bob Ben-Newhart.
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:40.240]   I got a tweet back from ILM saying,
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:41.520]   "Look what God you liked it."
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:42.480]   So I didn't know...
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:43.920]   Did they make the...
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:45.760]   Because these robes are perfect.
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:48.080]   And so I took a chance and said,
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:49.040]   "Well, here are my...
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:50.400]   I'll study my measurements if you want."
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:51.200]   But no, no, no.
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:51.920]   "What do you want?
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:53.760]   You should have a Jedi Master Robes."
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:54.880]   I think you should.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:57.920]   Speaking of which, Alex, I'm glad that you held firm
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:00.800]   and did not answer the question about what you or your company
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:03.600]   may or may not be doing to work on the New Star Wars films.
[01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:08.160]   We respect your decision not to answer that question.
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:08.880]   No comment.
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:09.360]   Really?
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:09.840]   Exactly.
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:11.360]   That's always said was no comment.
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:12.000]   I don't know.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.840]   I think it's wonderful that there are social conventions
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:17.520]   that you can actually answer the question
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:19.040]   without breaking up the question.
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:20.400]   Alex worked on episode one.
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:21.040]   We all know them.
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:21.920]   That's correct.
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:24.160]   This is how rumors are very effectively started.
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:25.920]   Oh, I know that, Alex.
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:27.200]   I know that very well, Alex.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.480]   What do you think I'm doing with this, Alex?
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:30.960]   And can you put that up on secret so we can blog it, please?
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:31.440]   Exactly.
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:34.400]   And Mr. Renee Ritchie, I'm more.com.
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:35.120]   The place to go.
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:36.240]   You want to keep up on this stuff?
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:38.080]   They really do a good job.
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:39.680]   I am ORE.com.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:40.960]   Thanks for being here, Renee.
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:42.000]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:42.560]   OK, Alex.
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:44.960]   He still can't do it.
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:45.600]   He's trying to do it.
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:46.400]   He's trying to set it up.
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:48.560]   Just, you know what, follow them on Twitter.
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:51.920]   Alex Lindsay, A-L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A.
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:52.160]   Why?
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:53.040]   That's the one thing on my trip.
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:53.520]   There you go.
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:54.000]   There you go.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:54.720]   That's it.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:55.600]   I'll post it.
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:56.080]   I'll be there.
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:56.800]   Just go to Twitter.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:57.440]   I'll tweet it out.
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:58.800]   Or Google+, you still do that.
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:01.040]   I do do Google+, so I'll post it in both places today.
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:02.800]   Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:04.000]   We do Mac Break Weekly.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:10.240]   If Leo shows up on time, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC on Twitter.tv.
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:13.680]   You can watch live, but if not, if you want it to begin precisely on time,
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:18.400]   merely download a copy to your device and start it whenever you wish.
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:23.280]   You'll find copies at Twitter.tv/mbw.
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:24.480]   You'll find it on Stitcher.
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.520]   You'll find it on iTunes.
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:28.400]   You'll find it wherever podcasts are aggregated and displayed
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:32.240]   for your consumption at a later date, not in violation of any existing patents.
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:34.480]   We'll see you next time.
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:35.840]   Now get back to work because you know what?
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.760]   Oh, you know what?
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:38.800]   Back to work.
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:40.880]   That's Merlin Mann's show.
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:43.840]   I've been playing Merlin Mann's show for the last 400 episodes.
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:44.400]   Prior art.
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:50.480]   Now get back to work because we know what break time's over.
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:57.920]   [music]
