[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.080]   Times. Good to see you, Mr. I. Good to see you too, Leo. You will be I just found out
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.120]   joining us for our coverage of the keynote on Monday. I'm doing I'm doing like three
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.720]   different keynotes in a row, all of which like from my from my back my Millennium Falcon
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.160]   flight deck of four different screens. This is too many in too many in the three week period.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.840]   Yeah, we just had Google I O. What else is coming up? Big tech at a I mean, forgotten
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.200]   name, but there's a big show in Asia that's going on where he says just showed off a whole
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.760]   bunch of stuff. Copy text. Yeah, copy text. Thank you very much. And also all that stuff
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.320]   we're going to be talking about about the new Thunderbolt and stuff from Intel and kit
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.600]   and only it was really, really it's a good it's a good week to be sitting in your own office.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.720]   Yeah, see, I feel like that, you know, people often think, Oh, you really want to be at the
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.000]   event and you don't you can't really do as much from the event as you can do if you're
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.800]   sitting in the cockpit. Well, sometimes sometimes you do. I mean, especially at an Apple event
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.040]   where it's just as important to both get the temperature of the crowd in a live setting.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.600]   And also there there's if you have had experience, then there are things that you do outside
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.200]   of the actual keynote, whether you have formal briefings privately with Apple or you happen
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.880]   to see someone that you know and they're willing to have a conversation with you that you're
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.400]   not. You can't quote anybody from that useful for you. Inks dained retches, but for us broadcast
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.240]   types. Sometimes though, sometimes though you do have to if you don't have like a big travel
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.320]   budget, you have to ask yourself, okay, I'm going to spend $1,100 to be in San Francisco
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.800]   for for three and a half days. What am I going to get out of that? And sometimes it's like,
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.720]   yeah, I will lose some stuff, but I will have $1,100. I'll get forward. I can buy whatever
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.560]   they're going to announce there. I feel like that's why we have the wonderful Renee Richie
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.040]   from iMour.com. He's going down there. He's going down. He's going down. He'll be he'll
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:54.360]   be and people are saying what keynote Monday, 10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern time, 1700 UTC,
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.360]   WWDC. And we're going to talk about what kind of announcements Apple will have at
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.680]   its worldwide developers conference. It's the 2015 edition of the Yes, it's amazing.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.280]   Since the year zero. Yeah. Yeah. And also maybe down with you, maybe in your briefcase,
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.760]   we're not sure. We're saying Renee Caldwell for my more. I surrender. Hello. It's harder.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.640]   It's harder. Well, I guess you guys are on the East Coast. So you got a long flight.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.580]   It's a long way to go. We do. For me, it's always worth it. I mean, I spent several
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.880]   years in San Francisco when I was first starting out and I have a lot of friends there. So
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.640]   on that note, it's like it's nice to go and see everybody. But also, like Renee was saying,
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.480]   WWDC is so much more than the actual conference these days that it's a it's very easy to justify
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.660]   the six hour flight in the plane ticket at the expense of basically getting to spend
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.320]   an entire week with really awesome people. But you get you like all the other press get
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.360]   thrown out after the keynote, right? You can't stick around for the conference. Yeah. Usually
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:01.620]   that's true. In the past, I know Jason Snell has been able to spend the week and cover
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:08.260]   from a from a non-NDA perspective, the conference sort of to but that's not necessarily the
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.620]   norm. I think that that might be a shift of Apple changing forward where they are letting
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:20.100]   some journalists cover cover the keynote as a whole. But in generally also, I mean, have
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.900]   you been to the the the full conference in years past Leo? No, I was always kicked out,
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:32.020]   right? I would love to. Are you kidding? Yeah, I paid my 99 bucks. It's fascinating. And
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.500]   it's definitely worth the $1,600 to have face to face access with engineers. I went a couple
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.860]   years back for the full conference and being able to interact with all those people one
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.160]   on one and talk to people who you may know, you may never get to talk to you on an email
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.540]   chain to help troubleshoot and help work with your things. But also the sessions are extremely
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.020]   valuable. Now, most of them are now available online for free, which is really awesome.
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.380]   And that gives you know, that gives developers who have paid their $99 but aren't necessarily
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.540]   able to make a flight out to San Francisco, most of the information that's covered at
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.980]   the conference. But there are, I really feel like the face to face interaction and the
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.380]   fact that there are all these people from all over the world converging on San Francisco
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.520]   for a week, that's the special part of it. Yeah, I mean, like the parties and stuff.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.720]   Oh, yeah. And out at Starbucks. Yeah. The weird thing, I feel like the one of the one
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:34.240]   of the best apps, one of the best apps that we use at iMore repeatedly is a little app
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:41.640]   called napkin, just written by a couple of friends of ours. And I was sitting in a cafe
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.800]   that just makes sandwiches right across the street from Muscone when they came up with
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.660]   the idea. So it's really fun to be able to trace that and be like, that was that happened
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.020]   like four years ago, five years ago. They write it on the back of an app in the idea.
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.220]   Because that would be, you know, I don't remember. I think it was a notebook, but it
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.980]   would be very poetic. Isn't part of the problem though, that if you do stay for the rest of
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:12.260]   the of schedule, you are under heavy non disclosure. Again, yes, but less so in that in recent
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.380]   years, it used to be that anything outside of the keynote was, you know, off limits that
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.820]   you couldn't mention it on Twitter, you couldn't blog about it. If you're a reporter going,
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:27.420]   would bought a full conference ticket. Now it's a little bit more flexible. Now you can
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:32.340]   even, you know, you can talk about the developer betas, but Apple's big thing still is they
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.100]   don't want screenshots and they don't want reviews. So they basically are saying, you
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:42.420]   know, we're a little bit more okay if you talking about the stuff that we're prepping
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.340]   for the fall and the stuff that we're working on from the developer side. But we'd really
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.980]   appreciate if you don't say to the public, this is how it's looking in its final form.
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.260]   And this is what I think about this is so awful because a lot can change between June
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.700]   and September. I've been on those betas circles for several years now. And the amount that
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.900]   changes and the stability differences are vast in those couple of months.
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.500]   Yeah, and that's that's really true. Apple has really changed over the past, I'd say,
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:16.420]   four years regarding how tightly they locked down information from from WWDC, even stuff
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.980]   that you can get just as a member of the developer program. It used to be a, I had to,
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:26.380]   I was able to change my policy of not participating in the beta program because of the strict
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.300]   controls Apple puts on what you can do with the information that you glean from having
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:35.820]   early access to the next iOS or the new Mac OS. Now there's sort of a so long as you follow
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.900]   a general no harm done rule songs. You're not like the sort of said songs. You're not
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:44.580]   reviewing it. They're they're they're not willing to really get on your back about what
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:49.860]   you learn from the betas. And I think that the closest that we have to the old fashioned
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:55.300]   Mac world expose is WWDC where it's not just the stuff that's on the schedule and the stuff
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.940]   that you get by actually attending the event. It's the fact that here is for whatever reason,
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.420]   whether it's for WWDC or whatever, you have thousands of people who are in the Mac and
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:09.380]   iOS communities coming to the same city at the same time. So that is an excellent time
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.300]   that even if you don't have a ticket to WWDC, even if you don't attend the keynote, you
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.980]   will have opportunities to meet up with all kinds of people, sometimes two or three at
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.620]   a time during a lunch. And that's a time where again, you can have their questions you can
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:27.980]   ask and information that you can get and deeper knowledge that you can glean from having
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.020]   just a good breakfast with a couple of people or a cup of tea on that roof garden that you
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:37.220]   were going to gardens, then you can by spending two hours inside the actual event itself.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.220]   So it can be very, very valuable. Well, we'll do our best to bring it to you live. And
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:47.460]   Apple's already put up information about their live stream and updated the Apple TV
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.860]   too. So there's the Apple events app, which you probably have. And if you have that on
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:58.420]   your Apple TV, you'll be able to watch the stream there. But if you want our commentary,
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:05.460]   Mike Elgin and Iainakko, we're not myself and maybe some others, please tune in 10 AM
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:14.100]   on Monday, 10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern time 1700 UTC for live coverage of WWDC. Actually,
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.860]   before we talk about WWDC, I think it's worth saying that there's some home kit stuff happen
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:25.860]   today. And in fact, serenity has been already hard at work all morning, testing some of
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:31.980]   this. So there's new hardware. There is after, you know, it's been just about a year since
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:39.020]   Apple announced home kit at last WWDC actually. And throughout that year, manufacturers and
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:44.260]   third party accessory makers have been busy at work getting their stuff certified and
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:50.460]   ready to actually launch. We saw some devices at CES, including some stuff from insupio
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.980]   and a couple other manufacturers. But as of today, as of June 2nd, there are actual home
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:01.740]   kit devices in stores on the market and available for preorder with a lot more coming soon.
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.780]   Now I think there are, Renee, correct me if I'm wrong, there are five to start off with.
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:14.860]   We collected including the Ecobi 3 thermostat, a couple of, I forget what the central hub,
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.660]   I think it's Intion, central hub.
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.020]   - Instion, yeah. - Instion, there we go. I missed the T.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:28.260]   Instion as well as the Luan Qasada, which is the one that I have been testing. That
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:34.020]   was the one that was available in the Apple store today. So I drove over to the Apple
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.020]   store and provided. - No, kidding. Wow.
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.420]   - 10 a.m. I walk in right after they open the doors and I'm like, "Hey, that's dedication."
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:45.700]   - So yeah, I went up to their manager. I felt kind of bad. I was like, "So here's the deal.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.580]   You probably don't have this on your shelves yet. You probably don't even know it exists."
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.220]   - Oh, no, we have one in the back here. Let me get it for you.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.820]   - Yeah, from Pack of House. He was like, "Let me go talk to my guy." And then he came
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.220]   out and he's like, "I didn't even know we had these."
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.540]   - I just came in. Yeah.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.540]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.060]   - So this is a company called, this is probably well known to most people who do this kind
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.060]   of thing, Lutron. - Lutron, yes.
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:10.580]   - And it's called Keseta. And it's for wireless lighting specifically, right? It doesn't,
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.980]   does do anything besides lighting?
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:18.060]   - Yeah, so it says wireless lighting and blinds and it also hooks up with a couple of thermostats.
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.060]   - Lots.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:23.340]   - At least in the app, it says that it works with both the Honeywell and the Nest.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.340]   - Oh, nice.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.900]   - I'm going to try it. I'm going to try out the Nest later today. We'll see if the Nest
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.060]   works with Siri. Fingers crossed. That would be cool.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:37.340]   - But this is what we always talk about in the SmartThings ad, which is, okay, so now
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.620]   you've got your lights and blinds and maybe your thermostat. But that's another app on
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.820]   your phone and then there's another app. So does HomeKit kind of eliminate that? Is
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.500]   Apple becoming the hub that talks to all these things?
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:54.820]   - Yeah, that's the general idea. So you still need the individual apps to set up those devices.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.860]   They all have their own, of course, you know, their various pairing and you still have to
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:04.180]   hook up a hub to your ethernet router. But once you've gotten it set up and once you've
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:10.220]   set up the names of these apps and what rooms they belong to, then it hooks into this central
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:16.460]   HomeKit series system. So I actually just finished an article on how to use Siri with
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:21.900]   your HomeKit accessories. And basically, once you've set up your HomeKit accessories,
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:30.300]   you can put them into rooms and zones that Siri recognizes. So for instance, my lutron
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:39.260]   here, this loading, I have got a couple different setups for rooms and zones. I've got two rooms
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260]   called the space shuttle and the rec room, respectively.
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.540]   - You have a space shuttle in your apartment.
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.740]   - I do. I do.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.940]   - I can't have a hot plate in my apartment.
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.940]   (laughter)
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:56.620]   - The benefits of Boston. Yeah. So you can name them anything, which is really fun.
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:01.420]   Renee, of course, has been joking for years that he wants a crash to compound. And sadly,
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:09.500]   it doesn't quite work. Siri does require that you say turn on, turn off, dim, or set to
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:14.900]   a certain number or percentage. So it's not that cool, but you can still use custom names.
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.340]   So if I get on Siri here, I think this one is--
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.620]   - You need to say turn on the space shuttle.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.620]   - Yeah.
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.620]   - Yeah.
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.620]   - Turn on the space shuttle.
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:30.940]   - Oh, oh, oh. Wow. That's nice. It did. It worked. That's the-- I have seen some
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.940]   of these stuff.
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.260]   - Damn the space shuttle to 65. That might not work.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.300]   - Okay. I said space shuttle light to 65.
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.580]   - Turn off the space shuttle.
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.580]   - Nice.
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:47.220]   - Yeah. And then you can-- so that's the individual room. And the room can be multiple
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:53.660]   devices, including lights, including blinds, including thermostats. And you can set scenes.
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.740]   I don't think-- I haven't been able to make scenes work with Siri yet. I think it's just
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:04.740]   set up to use rooms and zones. But in theory, especially since HomeKit and the HomeKit devices
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:09.700]   support programmable scenes, I'm kind of hoping that in the future you'll be able to be like,
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:14.580]   set the lights to 65 when I leave my house, and it'll be able to combine geofencing with
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:20.140]   that. It doesn't do that yet, but I kind of wish it would. One major bummer besides that
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.380]   as well is that if I go, you know--
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.620]   - She's talking to her watch now, folks.
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:30.520]   - Yeah. I am talking to my watch right now. I pick up my watch and I go turn the space
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:38.180]   shuttle lights on. My watch says, "I can help you control your home when you use hand-off
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.180]   for iPhone."
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.380]   - So you have to hand it off.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:45.740]   - Blomp, blomp, blomp. Yeah. So I'm kind of-- I'm hoping that that's a temporary thing,
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.900]   because really-- I want to be able to control my lights with my watch.
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:51.900]   - Right. - Come on.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.180]   - There's an app. - Yeah.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:16:00.820]   - There's an app for my home kit set up. There's just not Siri integration set, but overall,
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:07.780]   like, the fact that I can pick up my phone and be like, set the lights to 65 is really
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:08.780]   cool.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:09.780]   - I agree.
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.220]   - And I can't wait to try it out with the thermostat, too, because I love the idea of,
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.980]   like, if I'm bundled up and shivering on my couch, I'm like, "It's too cold." Siri
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.700]   set the thermostat to 72. Oh, laziness.
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:25.860]   - I wish I could mention-- this is not unique to Apple. This is Apple's first entry into
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.300]   this, but this is kind of--
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.300]   - Sure.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.700]   - Others have been able to do this. Dr. Mom's telling me that her Amazon--
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.700]   - Oh, Echo.
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.700]   - The Alexa.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:39.300]   - The Alexa Amazon Echo can talk to smart things. So you can do-- and actually, that's
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.940]   even cooler, because it's sitting right there, and you can talk to it, and it will do all
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:43.940]   that stuff.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.860]   - There's one downside that you and I might run into, Leo, and that's you need new hardware
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.700]   for the Hub, so we have a few lights.
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.700]   - Yeah.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.980]   - So we're probably going to have to replace that little white box, because Apple's requiring
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.500]   end-to-end encryption for all the communications to protect passwords and things like that.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.380]   And most of these devices weren't built with a secure Bluetooth or secure Wi-Fi chips to
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.100]   begin with, so the new versions-- like, there's an E-CoB3, it's already on the market, but the
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.660]   one that's shipping in July is the same exact thing, but with those secure chips inside it.
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.420]   So if you want to use the functionality for HomeKit and Siri, you'll have to replace
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.420]   not everything, like not the lights and not speakers and not a lot of stuff, but the
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.620]   little Hub or whatever they call the box that goes with it, the Hub or the bridge, or
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:20.620]   that component.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.620]   - A little bit, yeah.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:22.620]   - Yeah.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:23.620]   - Yeah.
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:28.740]   - But at least it's hopefully just replacing the Hub and not replacing every single Hue
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.740]   light or other small device.
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.740]   - No, no, just that.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.740]   - Yeah, exactly, that you've already bought into.
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:39.300]   Like, is that all of those switches will work as long as you have the new bridge?
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:47.220]   - Yeah, I'm getting a lot of-- some NDA or some agreement seems to have laps at a certain
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:52.300]   time because you can tell when there's one time of day where I'm getting like 18 different
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.580]   press releases every half hour about HomeKit stuff.
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.140]   And almost all of them, when I do follow-ups, they're talking about the exact same things
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.820]   where you won't have to-- if you're an existing customer, you can either just get an upgrade
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.580]   patch, you can do a firmware upgrade to the Webber links sit together, or we can sell
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:11.380]   you a very, very inexpensive new home link that will actually be better than what you
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.780]   have right now, which is a great thing because you're not going to buy-- get people to buy
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.820]   into a system if you're going to tell them that not only do you have to replace a lot
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:23.860]   of the light bulbs and all the appliances in your house, but you have to make it-- you
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:28.620]   have to make the VHS versus beta versus laser disc versus selectivision versus nine other
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.620]   options, and that's the one you're going to have to build based all your hardware on.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.060]   One of the great things about all of these solutions, cross-platform, is that buy whatever
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:41.140]   you want-- do a little bit of due diligence, but its chances are extremely likely that
[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.900]   whatever you buy will work with whatever it is that you have.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.780]   And it's good too because I know a lot of people were hesitant to put any home automation
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.580]   things in their house because they saw that as tech vectors for their home network, that
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.820]   they were basically opening up things that could be used willy-nilly, and because this
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:58.620]   is an antenna encrypted and they're insisting on it at the hardware level, as we move forward,
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.820]   I'm sure it's going to be easier for everyone to use those chips, then hopefully every standard
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.620]   will use them, and we won't have anyone just for convenience sake putting a lot of holes
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:06.620]   on their network.
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.540]   Yeah, I think that's a good thing.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:13.700]   Right now, there's a few Internet of Things attacks.
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:18.900]   Some Foscams, for instance, turned out that password protection wasn't effective, so people's
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.580]   house cameras have been put online, things like that.
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:26.940]   But I anticipate this is going to be a popular attack factor if only to harass people.
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:31.220]   So what if you can turn my thermostat up, except it's annoying?
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:36.380]   It's not the end of the world, but so I think Apple's very smart to insist on it, even though
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.020]   it's a pain point initially.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.820]   Yeah, and I will say, go ahead.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:46.860]   I was going to say, it's unknown at this time what the vectors are and what can be accomplished
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:51.780]   with them, because number one, there are a lot of these portals that try to get like
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.180]   sort of peer privileges with other network devices.
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:00.020]   And so in theory, if someone wanted to be super, super clever and choose the weakest
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.860]   point on your network, your thermostat is a point of entry, that's a problem.
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.020]   You may as well lock it down.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.860]   The second thing is that, I mean, a lot of the most of what we're looking at are things
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.380]   like thermostats, things like light bulbs.
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.340]   But you can do a lot of damage if you suddenly tell some, if you know that the temperature
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:21.580]   at your target's house is going to be 18 degrees outside, if you take that thermostat
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:26.540]   and force it down to like 25 degrees or turn it off entirely, now I've got frozen pipes,
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.300]   now I've got all kinds of nasty stuff happening.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.900]   So I don't think if anything else, it's a trust point for people.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:37.180]   They're trying to get people to invite control of their homes to an entity that they don't
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.780]   absolutely understand.
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.420]   A light switch, you turn it on, you turn it off, you understand it.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:46.260]   So to simply say that, look, we've protected this so that only devices that you approve
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.300]   and absolute approve can possibly control anything inside your house, that's going to
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.500]   be a necessary part of the marketing for this.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.420]   And not to be tin foil hat dude, but a lot of these sensors that are coming online with
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.500]   HomeKit are exactly that.
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.580]   They're sensors and they keep track of how many people are in which room and that might
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.100]   not be information that you want.
[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.460]   And they move passwords around between the devices for authentication purposes.
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.340]   And one of the things that's shown already showed me that blew my mind is that you can
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.060]   add multiple Apple IDs to this stuff.
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:13.580]   So you can have more than one person with authenticated, locked down encrypted control.
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.380]   And I wouldn't want those passwords moving around in less than secure devices either.
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.940]   >> So like one also, go ahead.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:20.940]   >> I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.940]   I had my turn.
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.700]   >> Yeah, I was going to say on top of everything else, that keeps you from having to enter
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.020]   in manual passwords.
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.300]   Like nothing is more of a drag than launching an app and being like, all right, I have to
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:36.660]   enter in the eight digit code to turn on my lights and then it stops being fun.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:42.860]   So instead, if you just have it all tied into Apple IDs, it just means, okay, this phone
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.900]   and any phone using that Apple ID and any additional Apple IDs I authorize.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.540]   So my boyfriend, he can totally use my lights.
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.540]   But random off the streets, that's not going to happen.
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.340]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:01.180]   >> It's all I was going to say was that it's also important to sometimes, given the variety
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:05.900]   of manufacturers you have entering this space, there's extra peace of mind when you basically
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:10.580]   say that security is not something I need to trust the manufacturers to do because it's
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.340]   built into a home kit is built into the system that I've put together.
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:20.260]   I mean, just last week, was it a really, really important Bitcoin app, I think for Android,
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.060]   was it had a huge vulnerability?
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:30.460]   And part of the vulnerability was that the company based a lot of the security on an absolutely
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:36.420]   secure random number generator that had to contact on another server, they had misconfigured
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.180]   the communication between the app and the server.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:45.180]   And so what it was getting back was not a true mathematical random number, but an error
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.020]   code explaining why the number had failed.
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:52.420]   And so every single instance was using the same error code.
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.980]   And so it's funny because I don't have any of my money in a Bitcoin wallet, but that's
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:01.140]   the sort of thing you're talking about where you maybe this is somebody who has a great
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.860]   business plan and they've gone on Alibaba and they can buy like a thousand of these
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.940]   light bulbs and they're going to hire somebody and pay them not enough money to write the
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.420]   software for it and they just screwed it up.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.380]   So it's such a great selling point to be able to say that look, you cannot call this a
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:19.420]   home kit product unless it has this level of security that you don't have to do yourself
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.380]   because we don't trust you to do that.
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:26.980]   It might annoy early adopters like me and Renee to have to buy new hubs, but this is really
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.420]   a brand new market.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.420]   And so most people are starting out for the first time.
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.620]   So it makes a good sense.
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.700]   In fact, it's ultimately going to be a differentiator for Apple if home kit is more secure and more
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.700]   lucky.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.540]   We just installed the EcoB3 this weekend at Georgia's house because I don't have central
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.540]   air.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.420]   So she installed it and then we found out that we have to upgrade it, but it turns out
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.780]   it's just a modular component.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.740]   I think it's $130 for the new one.
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.780]   So you pull it out and you put the new one in and you're good to go.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.420]   And they were less concerned about the price than how we'd actually take the wiring out
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.820]   and rewire something again.
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:56.820]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:57.820]   To them, the stress was the home.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:58.820]   Yeah.
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.820]   Yeah.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:00.820]   That makes sense.
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.820]   Not buying it.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.820]   Yeah.
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:08.900]   Well, yeah, I feel bad for smart things, but they are a sponsor.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.140]   But I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.500]   I mean, I get smart things to own by Samsung.
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:18.020]   So it's not like they don't have the resources to see what Apple's doing and say, okay, I
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.340]   guess we'll do that too.
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.260]   And there's nothing wrong with end to end encryption.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.260]   And I think it works multiple.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.620]   I think it's like CarPlay and Android Auto where these devices can support multiple protocols
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.620]   and that would be good for everybody because you buy it and it doesn't care which one you
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.380]   have as long as you have one of them and one of them.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.180]   You can choose which one you want to use with it.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.180]   Right.
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.180]   Well, and that raises an issue.
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.620]   So if you're working with Z-Wave and ZigBias, smart things does and they're not encrypted,
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:45.580]   how does Apple and Force, it just says you guys have to rewrite your tool?
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.060]   Well, it's hardware.
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.700]   So again, you have to use specific hardware chips for Q2LE and Wi-Fi.
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:51.700]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.860]   So to use those chips with, so hopefully that will force them all to become hardware encrypted.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:25:00.140]   That's my utopian dream, at least.
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.140]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.260]   Let's finally get to WWDC.
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.700]   I imagine there'll be some home kit stuff to talk about there as well.
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:13.180]   Our show Renee Richie's here and Serenity Caldwell, both from iMore.com and Iannaco from
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.740]   the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.700]   We're talking about Apple.
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:21.620]   I have some actual personal questions I want to ask you in a minute.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.380]   Lisa's Apple Watch stopped pairing or would keep losing.
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.420]   And she says she's, did you call Apple?
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:30.220]   Is that what happened?
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.780]   I'm going to reset my settings on my phone.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.020]   Apple said reset the settings on the phone.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.260]   And so I reset my settings?
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.260]   Yeah, and that fixed it.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.260]   And now it's correct.
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.260]   It was instantly shared.
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.260]   Okay.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.340]   So we said if that doesn't work, wipe my phone.
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.700]   Yeah, we did that.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.700]   We don't know what my phone is.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.700]   The phone and the watch.
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.700]   And I said I want to wipe my phone right away.
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.700]   So we'll see.
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.700]   Alright.
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:52.700]   But it's apparently-
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:56.060]   She's got a 38 and apparently a number of people with 38's have had similar problems
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.460]   of the watch losing track of the phone.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.460]   Hmm.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.460]   That's weird.
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.460]   It's not even setting the watch.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:02.460]   Resetting the phone.
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.260]   We've reset the watch obviously, but resetting the phone.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.260]   Yeah.
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.420]   You know, I actually had that happen to my watch.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:10.740]   I think after I went on an airplane and I toggled airplane mode a couple times on and
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:11.740]   off.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.820]   I actually wrote a how to on it.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:19.340]   For me, you just turn the watch on and off and you turn the phone on off.
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.340]   Yeah, we did that.
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.340]   So you reboot both of them.
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.340]   Yeah.
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.340]   We did that.
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.340]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.340]   We did that.
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.340]   Yeah.
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.340]   Which phone settings?
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.340]   Just reset the phone settings so it wiped out all my wife.
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.900]   Oh, I'll reset the phone settings.
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.540]   Oh, wiping them all out.
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.420]   That's a little more draconian than just rebooting.
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.220]   But so if rebooting doesn't work, try that.
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.420]   So, yeah, you have several levels of reset.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:45.300]   And what was the least draconian level, which is just reset your settings.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.300]   Cool.
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.300]   Good to know.
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.900]   If you're having trouble with you.
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.100]   Now I have another question.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.780]   I think I'm going to, does anybody want to buy a slightly used Mac Pro?
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.820]   Did you watch this yawn announcements, Leo?
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.060]   Well, here's my thing.
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.060]   This thing has been nothing but trouble.
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.260]   As you know, I had to trade it out.
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.540]   The initial problem I had was with RAM and USB.
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:08.860]   I'm having USB problems again.
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.380]   I'm getting that dread device drawing too much power.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.780]   So we're, you know, dumbing it down.
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.580]   And I've reset the SMC several times.
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.980]   I've reset the PRAM several times.
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:24.540]   The only thing that's plugged in at all now is a keyboard and it's still saying that.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:29.980]   So I know the keyboard is not drawing too much power on the USB.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.300]   So I'm just thinking it'd be a good time to buy a 5K iMac.
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.500]   And maybe you'd have a nice looking doorstop.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.500]   Especially with those new Thunderbolt ports.
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.940]   One of those, one of those, the Zans coming to the Mac Pro.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:41.940]   Yeah.
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.740]   Oh, great.
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.740]   You don't need Zions.
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.300]   I don't need the generation behind.
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.300]   Yeah, you'll be fine.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:51.540]   No, I think a 5K iMac, can I drive in two 27 inch cinema displays?
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.860]   I could still do that, right?
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.860]   Yeah, sure.
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:54.860]   4K displays are fine.
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:55.860]   No big deal.
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:56.860]   Those are 2K displays.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:57.860]   Yeah, even better.
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.860]   Yeah, nothing.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:27:59.860]   Well, they're a little better than that.
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:00.860]   They're the cinema displays.
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.860]   The 27.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.020]   Now the 5K iMac is still running Haswell.
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.140]   They haven't done as far as I can remember they haven't done a Broadwell update for that
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.140]   yet.
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.860]   Because Broadwell's big selling point is power efficient.
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:09.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:10.860]   This is a desktop computer.
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.860]   Yeah.
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:12.860]   So, yeah, so you might not care.
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.100]   But for people who want the latest and greatest.
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:18.420]   I wonder how well, have they broken out Mac Pro sales numbers at all?
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.420]   I think that thing has a not.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.420]   No, they don't break out any Mac.
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.180]   That thing cannot possibly be selling well.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.740]   Well, it's designed for a very niche market, you know?
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:30.740]   It's not that it fed is not a high like a normal consumer project.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:34.100]   That is a custom, custom machine.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.740]   The dunderhead market is really kind of small.
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:37.740]   It's a Ferrari Leo.
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:43.540]   It's interesting when you look at there's so little difference between an iMac, a Mac
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:48.460]   Mini and a Mac Mac book pro right now that you really it really becomes what shape will
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.100]   fit your lifestyle at this point.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.100]   It's not about power and it's not about accessories.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.620]   It's really is about what shape will work for you.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.980]   Thank God I bought this base model.
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:59.180]   I didn't I didn't put in a bunch of stuff in there.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.180]   I did.
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.180]   Never mind.
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:02.180]   I don't.
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.300]   And if you get really upset, you know, I bet I because it's a cylinder I bet you could
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:10.100]   build like a potato cannon and just like shoot it fire it.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.260]   I say where to get it.
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.180]   Look at like a phone.
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.180]   It's a beautiful thing.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.580]   But I also remember I bought the cube too.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.300]   That was a beautiful thing too.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.300]   Collector's item Leo.
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.660]   Yeah, I wish it was going to be like the cube.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.660]   Yeah, I wish I'd save the cube.
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.700]   I would like it now and I'm going to save the the Mac pro.
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.700]   I'm not good.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:32.900]   I'll just we'll just put it on a shelf somewhere.
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.900]   Set decoration.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:38.940]   We and and really after the Mac Pro came out the new so called Mac Pro came out.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:45.140]   That's when we decided to go all Dell in our edit suites and Premiere Adobe Premiere.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.700]   That was the end of that.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:50.220]   So at least I don't have seven Mac Pros.
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:53.220]   It could could be worse.
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:57.380]   Gazelle.com does buy your old iPhone, your iPad.
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.260]   Many tablets including Samsung, Microsoft and Google tablets.
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:05.220]   It's a great way to get rid of old gadgets and get the new.
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.660]   There's always something new and exciting.
[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.980]   And this is how you can kind of you know feed your habit.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.420]   Bring it to Gazelle.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.260]   Gazelle gives you a top dollar.
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:20.340]   The price you get today is locked in for 30 days into July.
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:24.220]   So you have plenty of time to decide to see what's new, what's different, buy the new
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.420]   device, transfer your data over then send it to Gazelle.
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.780]   They'll pay the postage, turn it around fast.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:34.780]   If you forget or can't wipe your data because they do buy broken devices sometimes, broken
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.980]   iPhones and iPads certainly.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.060]   They'll wipe the data for you.
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.060]   They don't worry about that.
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.220]   They'll take care of you that way.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:46.300]   They'll even upgrade the offer as they have to us now twice saying, "Oh no, this is worth
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.300]   more than we thought.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:49.340]   It's in better shape or whatever.
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.260]   It has more RAM, whatever.
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.260]   Storage, whatever."
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.260]   So that's great.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.260]   I never heard of a company.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.980]   You know, I mean they're only obligated to pay what they say they pay.
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.900]   They give us a huge bump on a 4S I think.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:06.020]   I think they offered us 32 bucks and they gave us like 100 bucks instead.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.660]   These are good people, Gazelle.
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:16.940]   After your item has been accepted and checked out, they will send you cash via check, PayPal
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.300]   or an Amazon gift card.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.300]   That's actually a good deal.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.380]   They bump that by 5% so if you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon, Gazelle's a great place.
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.540]   You can also buy on Gazelle.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.540]   Did you know that?
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:30.700]   They keep the best stuff and they resell it as certified pre-owned, two conditions, certified
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:31.700]   like new.
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.860]   Nothing to say about that.
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:38.540]   It's as good as new or certified good which shows the devices in both cases work perfectly.
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:42.940]   But the certified good devices might show some gentle signs of wear but you're going
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.620]   to save even more money.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.380]   In every case they've been put through a rigorous 30 point inspection to make sure they're fully
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.100]   functional and you have a 30 day risk free return policy.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:32:00.820]   It's Gazelle, the place to sell and buy now, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle.com.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:01.820]   I like this Elgato.
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:06.820]   You know, I've always had a soft spot for Elgato because they did the TV, the ITV.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.900]   I really liked it.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.660]   They have the Elgato Eve.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.820]   I also like the name.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:16.940]   It sounds like a feminine hygiene product but in fact, it's a room, weather, door and
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.620]   window and energy sensor system.
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:23.940]   You can monitor indoor air quality, temperature and humidity.
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:27.660]   They actually have a volatile organic compound sensor.
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.860]   That's kind of cool.
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.300]   Weather is outside temperature and air pressure, door and window.
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:40.900]   So the idea is I could with impunity buy any of these like the Ecobi that you just installed.
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.380]   Do you like that better than the Nest?
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.900]   Yeah, for, well, some people didn't like the way that Google handled transition and linking
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.260]   it to Dropcam IDs.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.540]   So there's some philosophical issues why some people switched.
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.220]   I don't really care about the philosophy.
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.580]   For me, I like the fact that it has the remote sensors.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:00.740]   So you put the Ecobi unit where your central thing is but then depending on the size of
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.380]   your house and the way it's laid out, you put these little sensors in high traffic areas
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.620]   and then it can adjust dynamically as you move through the house.
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.620]   We need that.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:09.620]   We need more efficient.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:14.260]   And I got a chance to interview the gentleman from Ecobi at CES and he told me that he was,
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.860]   I think I might have said this story before, he was out traveling in Europe and he started
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:22.580]   to see people, the number of people in his house increase in his living room.
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:26.460]   10 people, 20 people from a home and he said, "Honey, are you having a party?"
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.460]   No, dad.
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.260]   He goes, "Well, there's 25 people living up."
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.060]   He's like, "Ah, busted.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.060]   I love it."
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:37.340]   Yeah, I have that problem because the thermostats in the hall will turn up the heat but it gets
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.900]   really hot in the bedroom.
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:39.900]   Yes.
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:44.340]   Because the hall is, so that would be really, so I'd put an extra sensor in the bedroom
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.740]   and then it would know, "Oh, yeah, we're overheating the bedroom now."
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.380]   Yeah, and that was one of the things that we heard the most about the nest because Android
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.700]   Central are a sibling site.
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.460]   They did a whole week of nest earlier on and that was one of the things that we heard
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.900]   back is, "I want to be able to get up and move and change rooms without having to constantly
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:57.900]   readjusting."
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:58.900]   Right.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.860]   And that's Ecobi's big selling point because that sensor will recognize you, it'll do
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:05.100]   all that for you and they claim it's even more efficient because as you leave and maybe you
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.300]   forget to change things, it'll just know that you're no longer in that part of the house
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.940]   and shut things down.
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.140]   Yeah, that would be really great.
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:13.140]   Yeah.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.340]   It's super easy installed too.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:18.980]   I mean, we're overlining competent and we got it up in on an hour or so.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.660]   That is important, I'm incompetent.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:26.460]   No, I think I would guess you guys know what you're doing.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.460]   I could be wrong.
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.460]   I would suggest that Leo.
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.180]   More or less.
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:31.180]   More or less.
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:32.180]   Sort of.
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:33.180]   All right.
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:34.180]   I'm sorry, I got distracted.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.180]   I just look at these.
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:41.980]   So the Ecobi is 249 and then the sensors, you get one and the sensors are 79 for two more.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.480]   I would do that.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.700]   It's actually like 30, which is a ridiculous number for most houses.
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.420]   Eye-home, which has been around for a while doing stuff for the other side.
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.420]   That I like.
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:54.380]   Because there's a lot of devices that aren't home-kit compatible right now, but you can
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.860]   still just plug them into the wall.
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.300]   So I'm going to plug the Hue lights into that for now and I won't be able to control
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.880]   them, but at least be able to say turn on, turn off and that will, I won't have to go
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.880]   to the app all the time.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.020]   I can use Siri for the base functionality.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:09.680]   And if you have fans or any other product at all that's not home-kit compliant, just
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.860]   plug it in here and use Siri to do the on-off function.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.100]   And the plug becomes home-kit compliant.
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.100]   That's a good idea.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.660]   And so if you have a space station in your house, you can control it.
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.420]   Spouse, sorry, space shuttle.
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.540]   That's not what we should start taking that on.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.540]   Go ahead and who's going to get the honor of having the hardware that Apple demonstrates
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.740]   during the keynote next week?
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:34.300]   Like who has shipping hardware that's going to be inside the Apple store that Apple chooses
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.300]   to say, "Guess what?
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.300]   You got four minutes.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.300]   Don't screw it up."
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:41.340]   Most of these are pre-order, but the Cassata, the Lutron is available as you know, because
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.780]   Serenity got one.
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:49.340]   The Instion Hub is pre-order, also for the Elgato Ease.
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:52.180]   I think the Instion Hub might be today, but you can only order it.
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.260]   You can't buy it in the store.
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.260]   Starting in July.
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.260]   A lot of these are ordered today, but not available.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.660]   Word or soon, but not available yet.
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.660]   So it looks like...
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:05.020]   So my big question is, did Apple put these out this week because it wants to clear the
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:09.700]   deck before WWDC and we won't see anything home-kit related at WWDC because there's so much other
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.700]   stuff to do?
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.780]   There's an opportunity because Google, of course, is in this space too.
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.740]   We thought maybe Google would announce something at Google.
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.980]   I hope they did not.
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.980]   Well, Brillo, I guess, is the closest to the dozen.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:19.980]   Yeah, but Brillo is not.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.260]   Brillo is a long way off.
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.260]   Yeah.
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:27.060]   All right, so what are we going to see at WWDC?
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.060]   Andy?
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.060]   Tim Cook.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.060]   Oh, I think...
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.060]   Tim Cook.
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.060]   Yeah.
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.060]   Hopefully...
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.060]   Oh, I'm hooked.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:37.060]   Oh, does Tim Tuck?
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.060]   I think he's an untucker.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.060]   I think he's an untucker.
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.060]   He's untuck.
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:44.060]   No, Tim doesn't tuck his shirts, but Jeff Williams died.
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.060]   I don't know.
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.060]   I don't keep track of this.
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:49.740]   But they'll all be wearing an Apple watch.
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.420]   If Tim is untucked, there's no new hardware.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.420]   Is that what it is?
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.260]   Ahh.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.260]   Will there be new hardware?
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.260]   Apple TV.
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:03.140]   It would be really stupid, for instance, for me to buy an iMac now or any Apple product.
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:04.780]   Well, a lot of them have been refreshed.
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:08.900]   Like the MacBook Airs, the MacBook Pros have all been refreshed.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:13.220]   I still haven't seen any signs of Intel having those Broadwell chipsets ready for the iMac.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.220]   So I don't know.
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.980]   I mean, the sad thing is with Macs, they really are on Intel's roadmap.
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.540]   So whenever those chips are ready...
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.260]   But as you said, Broadwell isn't faster.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.660]   It's just better energy usage.
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:26.900]   Oh, so they might just bump it with Haswell and get slightly better clock speeds.
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.740]   Because Apple has a show, you should absolutely wait.
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:34.740]   But I don't think you'll see anything crazy with the iMac at this point.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.740]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.900]   Well, you said Apple TV.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:38.740]   Yeah.
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.740]   I'm pretty sure we're going to see that.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.180]   The service might be delayed.
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.500]   Again, the Apple TV is under iTunes.
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.100]   It's not like the iPhone or the iPad.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:51.220]   So it really is bound to the priorities of the iTunes organization.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:55.220]   And it could be that they decide that the lack of content deals makes it not a compelling
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.740]   enough product to launch, which I think would be really sad because we waited so long to
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.900]   get just the hardware upgrade.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.860]   And I'd be super happy with that upgrade.
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.340]   But I think even if you don't get the Apple streaming TV service and you just get the modern
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:12.020]   processor, things like metal support and you get the SDK, then that's a huge win for that
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.020]   device.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.820]   And I think Apple, they don't need it at this point because it's not a major part of
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:16.820]   their business.
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:20.700]   But I think everyone who does want an Apple TV, I think them getting back into that game
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:24.940]   in a serious way would be appreciated.
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:29.540]   Apple TV, if they announce a new one, will feature an App Store.
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.540]   It should.
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.940]   I don't know if it'll be a game store or a full on App Store, but it should.
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.700]   I mean, there's every indication.
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.740]   As far as I know, they've had that for a long time and just have been sitting on it.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:42.180]   Well, for instance, I can't put Twit on an Apple TV now as it stands.
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.620]   Only Apple can put anything on an Apple TV.
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.180]   I'd have to make a deal with channel partnerships right now.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.180]   Yeah, you can partner.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.180]   Yeah.
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:52.420]   But you can't just build an app and submit it to Apple and hope that it appears.
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.420]   But I would love that.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:57.340]   Now, whether they offer channels, we'll have to see because it could just be like if it's
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.780]   just a game system, then you'd have to make a Twitter video game.
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:03.940]   But if it is a full on SBA, then it'll open the door to a lot more stuff.
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.860]   You could have that happen.
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:06.860]   Knock the head off.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:07.860]   Knock the head off Leo or something.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:11.020]   I think they've never had a episode of the screensavers.
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.940]   All right.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:18.460]   And then you said we keep hearing they're going to work in trying to work to create
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.620]   some sort of streaming TV service on there.
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.860]   Premature, obviously.
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.860]   It's so hard.
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:25.860]   Yeah.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.580]   I mean, it's hard to call.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:32.380]   I suppose I can talk now that last year I had somebody high up in the TV industry who
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:36.980]   was an executive at a network who was telling me about some stuff.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:43.740]   And it was the characterization of his remarks were not so much the details of this deal,
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:50.540]   but just how it's like it's like Zenos paradox, one of those things where the first step was
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.220]   to get half of the issue solved.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.380]   The next step was to get another 25% of it solved.
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.220]   The next step was to get another 12% of it solved.
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:05.060]   And then you're left with a number of issues that both companies are very, very stuck on
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:11.060]   and you need to have a shift in perspective before one of them decides to give ground.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.580]   That was the nature of the conversation that I had with this guy, but that was a year ago.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:18.580]   But that's not dissimilar to the conversations I've been had over the past two and a half
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.580]   years about bringing more content to Apple TV.
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:25.500]   People that it's like it's like Manhattan real estate.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:29.620]   I mean, you own this property and you are not going to let and you know, there's a limited
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:30.620]   number of it.
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:34.140]   If people want property on this block of people want CBS, you're not going to be able to go
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.940]   anyplace else to get CBS.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:39.420]   So you're going to hold out to get the exactly what you want.
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:44.900]   And if you have another, if Apple or any other aggregator wants to get access to that content
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:50.940]   and they have these ideas about what they want their service to be and the sort of things
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:56.380]   like privacy and not using this channel as a way of the advertised advertisers being
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.300]   able to learn things about the viewing habits of its viewers.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.300]   If you don't get that, you're not going to get that.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:06.620]   There's so many different things that that could scotch us at this point that I've given
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:10.580]   up on predicting or assuming that any deal is going to be announced at any time.
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:16.020]   Recode, Don Chimelleski and Peter Kafka writing and recode say Apple subscription TV service
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.660]   won't be announced next week.
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:22.900]   Although they do quote Les Moonves who was at the code conference last week saying that
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:27.860]   he thought CBS, he's the head of CBS, he thought CBS would probably sign a deal with
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.060]   Apple to carry his network.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.220]   We're very excited about it.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:37.580]   He told Cara Swisher so far the main negotiating point according to Moonves money.
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.580]   How much you going to give me surprise surprise.
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:44.700]   But there's also, I think some fear that if you if you go over the top with a network
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:48.620]   that you could alienate the cable networks with the cable companies, which are the MSOs
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:55.260]   which are very important to television networks, you've got to be careful there.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:42:00.460]   So it may be in fact that it'll be like every other system except HBO now where you have
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:04.300]   to log in with your cable company subscription to demonstrate that you should be getting
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.740]   CBS anyway.
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.220]   Apple apparently wants to do live TV.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:11.220]   That's another thing.
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.220]   They're super patient too.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:15.220]   They've waited years.
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:16.700]   The Apple TV hasn't been updated since March of 2012 and they could have updated it every
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.780]   year the way they did the iPhone and iPad.
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.940]   And they just waited because they believe that this is the problem that they want to
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:22.940]   solve.
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:26.620]   And Steve Jobs said it very well at the All Things Decompress many years ago that if you
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:30.580]   think dealing with carriers is hard, dealing with all the tiny little fiefdoms that are
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:34.860]   cable networks, not just in the US, but internationally is an absolute nightmare.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.620]   So the technology has never been an issue for them.
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:40.060]   It's the go to market strategy involving content that's always been the big hang up.
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:44.900]   Well, because it's really very thorny because networks don't necessarily own all the content
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.220]   that they broadcast.
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:50.140]   So maybe the deal that they have with a production unit over with another studio says that no,
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:54.340]   you don't get to simply package us with streaming content because we have our own package that
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.940]   we want to sell elsewhere or you're going to have to open up brand new negotiations with
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:58.940]   us.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:04.780]   This is why on a lot of if you go to websites for networks, some shows you can get on demand
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.780]   streaming.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:09.740]   Some of you go and get clip packages and that's that will identify to you the sort of deal
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.300]   that that production company has with that network.
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.300]   So it's really difficult and it is too bad.
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:21.260]   I mean, I hope that Apple, even if they don't get this service ready for the next two months,
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.180]   Apple TV is just looking so more abundant.
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:27.100]   It's not just the idea that it has not been gotten a significant upgrade in a couple of
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.100]   years.
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:33.420]   It's an unpleasant experience to use Apple TV compared with all these other alternatives
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:34.420]   that are out there.
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:39.260]   Buyer TV is at least as good as Apple TV minus the airplay.
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:44.260]   Google television is also it's a product that Google seems to be interested in growing and
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:49.100]   not they're not interested in waiting for for every piece to be to be complete.
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.620]   So even if all they did was that we're going to revamp the interface, we're going to make
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.380]   authentication a lot smoother.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:56.940]   We're going to make sure that you almost never are confronted with a black screen and a spinning
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:01.900]   dial that says authenticating, buffering, authenticating, buffering.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.820]   That's a win for me.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:07.500]   And so I just hope that Apple, sometimes you really do have to indicate that this is an
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:11.780]   important product and Apple has not indicated that with Apple TV in quite some time.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.420]   And Andy's point, I mean, one of the problems with Netflix has been they haven't been able
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:17.580]   to get shows because of things like music rights and they'd eventually have to take
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.980]   a long time and strip out all the music or even change that.
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:23.500]   I think Dawson's Creek has a different theme song on Netflix than it did originally.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.700]   The famous example of that is the rate.
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.700]   What is that the radio show?
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:31.860]   The UK, European, Cincinnati, where they had real music in it.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.980]   And that's why you don't see it in reruns because it's all real music and it's not licensed
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:35.980]   for replay.
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.660]   So yeah, there's such so many laws.
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:38.940]   But it's also sad.
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:42.620]   There's documentaries like The Eyes and The Prize, the documentary of the Civil Rights Movement
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:46.940]   can't be shown because the state of Martin Luther King won't give him the rights to continue
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.740]   to show that I have a dream speech and other things.
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:53.100]   Will the new Apple TV be a home kid hub?
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:54.700]   That would be why you might announce that.
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.700]   To be.
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:56.700]   Yeah.
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:57.700]   Yeah.
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:59.260]   I don't see why it shouldn't be.
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:06.380]   The real question is whether or not you'll need to connect it directly to your ethernet
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.940]   or the proper end to end.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:09.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:14.020]   Because I mean, for us, our router lives in the basement.
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:19.180]   So trying to run an Apple TV, a long cable up to your Apple TV might be a little bit
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.500]   of a hassle there.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:25.900]   But I don't know if the end to end encryption can be done over airplay or over just straight
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.340]   wireless when you're making that initial connection.
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:30.260]   For an A, you might know better than I.
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.540]   Yeah, as far as I they did, it's been years.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.660]   As far as I know, they've experimented with different things.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:38.980]   And for example, at one point, they were thinking about putting the entire router into
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:42.180]   the Apple TV for people who just wanted an all-in-one solution.
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:46.260]   And as far as I know, one of the bigger rumors was that it was just going to be a way for
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.420]   you to control home kit when you weren't at home.
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:52.340]   So as long as they could have an Apple TV there, they would be able to track, you know,
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:56.580]   as sort of like that we would do with back to my Mac where they take a, I forget the actual
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:00.340]   way that it works, but they keep track of your IP address and they substitute that for your
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:02.540]   Apple ID and then always put those two things together.
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:05.980]   So even if you're at the airport and think you forgot to turn off the lights, you can
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:09.940]   still connect via your device and you have a secure connection to your Apple TV, which
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:12.780]   is a trusted device on their network and you can handle things.
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.500]   I don't think they're going to let it do much beyond that.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:17.060]   Like they won't let it be a substitute hub.
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:21.500]   But just that functionality, they should be able with those chips that do the encrypted
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:25.060]   Bluetooth, LE, and encrypted Wi-Fi, they should be able to have it as a happy network
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:26.860]   citizen regardless of ethernet.
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.180]   Yeah, there's so much potential in Apple TV.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:35.160]   When you think about it as having a small, tiny, hideable device that runs off of a
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:40.260]   mobile processor that generates very little heat and draws almost no power, has Wi-Fi
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:47.700]   and Bluetooth each built into it can also be, and is in a fixed location in a house,
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:51.580]   you're describing a computer that is here is the one device that we can count on always
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:56.260]   being turned on and available to the internet for any sort of device that's outside of that
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:47:01.660]   network that wants to communicate with lights, with heating, with printers, with any sort
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:03.380]   of device that's inside that house.
[00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:08.180]   And also the ability to simply identify that, okay, well, the closest I beacon to the user
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:11.780]   right now is the Apple TV that we know is in the living room.
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:15.980]   So we know that we know that where this signed-in user is going to be.
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:20.180]   So none of this is based on conversations I've had with people, but it's just such an obvious
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:25.980]   thing that even if they did nothing cosmetically to the user interface or the user experience,
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.060]   just the ability of having this always on device, always connected to the internet and
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:34.700]   the most wireless device they have tethered to a specific location, it's a long eight-page
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.900]   list of things you can do with that sort of capability.
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:43.780]   Just taking a step back, it's really interesting to see we've come so far, the way technology
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:48.460]   gets better incrementally, you kind of sometimes don't notice it, but we're now talking about
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:56.060]   really finesses of capabilities and amazing things like being in proximity to your Apple
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:48:02.140]   TV and then the I beacon sees you and these are really kind of amazing technologies that
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:03.620]   they've crept up us on us.
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:04.620]   It's the future.
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.260]   It's the future guy here somehow.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.460]   It's a moral land.
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:12.540]   The big win always of investing in Apple is that they make things that just take advantage
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:16.340]   of each other's presence.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:23.660]   The fact that you have an iPad in the same room as your phone and your iPad can simply
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:28.300]   glom on to your phone's internet connection, not by walking over your phone and turning
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:33.580]   on Wi-Fi hotspot by simply, but by simply like it's an active Wi-Fi hotspot waiting
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:38.580]   to be turned on by this device, that's why you have a phone and a tablet and a notebook
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.980]   that's all created by the same company.
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:45.180]   So you extend that to the home and you think, "Ooh, nobody knows how to make everything
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:49.420]   work together as one, as aggressively and as safely and as reliably as Apple?"
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:53.900]   Yeah, at the same time, I was playing with, I don't want to name it, possible sponsor,
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:59.540]   new kind of Netflix style service, playing with the Apple app.
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:01.460]   And I noticed it had Chromecast capability.
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:02.460]   They didn't have AirPlay.
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.460]   They had Chromecast.
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:08.380]   And I wonder if that's, are you starting to see that trend where there's, I mean, they've
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:09.380]   sold, what do they say?
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:10.860]   They sold 17 million Chromecast.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:11.860]   What was the number?
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:12.860]   It was a large number of Chromecast.
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:13.860]   It's 1.7 million.
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:19.380]   Yeah, which is still peanuts compared to Apple TV, interestingly enough.
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:24.700]   But they're having a really big success with it, considering that this is a $30 device.
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.740]   And they're making it really, really easy for any developer to say, "Oh, sure, what
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.140]   the hell will it include Chromecast support?"
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:34.300]   And now it's hard to, I would have to do an audit of all the stuff that I have on my iPhone
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:38.340]   and my iPad, just the say nothing of the stuff I have on my Android phone.
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:42.700]   But it's hard to mention, it's hard to think of an app that makes sense to have Chromecast
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.380]   support at this point that does not have Chromecast support.
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:49.060]   It is really, really cool to have a sling box connected to your cable box.
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:54.620]   And just simply, the fact that I have this little $30 thing plugged into my Live Room
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:59.980]   TV means that I don't have to do a cable run through two floors in order to get there,
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:04.260]   because the sling player app on my iPad is going to be able to make that connection for
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:05.260]   me.
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.540]   It was one of the, it's one of the things that I think it's overlooked a lot is that when
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:12.340]   you have an iOS device, you have a pretty amazing Google experience.
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.780]   Like Google makes almost all their apps.
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:17.700]   I think Keep is one of the big exceptions, but that's pretty much a web view now anyway.
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:22.500]   And Chromecast, and all of this is well supported, and nest all of those kinds of technologies.
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.380]   You have, I think Paul Thros said it really well, and he said, "You have amongst the best
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.420]   Microsoft support on it.
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:31.100]   Amazon, you go down the line, and if you choose, if you really want to have Google
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:35.500]   ecosystem, it's not as good as having Android, but it lets you have the Apple parts that
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:38.420]   you want and the Google parts you want and the Amazon parts you want."
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.420]   And that's an advantage to a lot of consumers.
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:46.540]   So Chromecast 17 million, what do we know at Apple TV sales?
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:49.180]   They had 10 million units sold in 2013.
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.380]   I don't think they said recently.
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:53.220]   It said lately.
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:51:01.340]   But given the number sold per year in the last six years, they're far more than 17 million
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.340]   out there.
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:05.580]   Chromecast should speak already much faster though because of the size of the Android
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:10.260]   market and the low, the low cost of it and how small and portable it is.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.260]   It's tough though.
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:16.260]   It's no matter how good certain Android or Google products are, it's so hard to remind
[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.980]   people that these are available to them.
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:23.940]   Remember that Google Wallet existed for about a year, year and a half before Apple Pay?
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:28.460]   And even I had to be reminded that, "Oh, you have an XS5, you have the ability to do
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:29.940]   contactless payments."
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:34.260]   And this is just an app that you just noticed, you wrote about, then you forgot about.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:38.620]   If you actually spend five seconds to activate it, you too can have fun with your phone paying
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:40.500]   for things at McDonald's and Panera Bread.
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.140]   Well, it was frustrating at first because the carriers were blocking it.
[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:47.820]   So if you had a Verizon phone, you couldn't use it because Verizon had their own ISIS system
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:49.420]   now called Softcard.
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.300]   But that's all gone by the way, said.
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.020]   So wallet has come into its own.
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:54.660]   And now wallet's not going to be wallet anymore.
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:55.660]   It's not going to be touch to pay.
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:58.980]   It's going to be here to peer Android payments.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:51:59.980]   Android.
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:00.980]   Android pays the new thing.
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.780]   I think that folds in the technology that they bought that was being used by a lot of
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.540]   carriers anywhere, which is nice.
[00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:06.540]   Yes, they bought it.
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.180]   I think they bought Softcard, right?
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.180]   Yeah, yeah, Softcard, that's it.
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:11.180]   Yeah.
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:14.260]   All right, we're going to talk about the music subscription service because that's really
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.940]   going to be, I would bet that's going to be the biggest story.
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:17.940]   Well, I don't know.
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:21.300]   What's the biggest story going to be on Monday at WWC?
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.620]   It's going to be the music, right?
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.940]   Because you're going to want to be there because there's going to be like the Foo Fighters
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:26.940]   will be there or somebody.
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:27.940]   Because Drake will be DJing.
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:28.940]   Drake will be DJing.
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:29.940]   Drake will be DJing.
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:34.540]   I actually think the biggest thing we'll see are new versions of iOS and OS X.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:35.540]   Those are going to be the flagship.
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:36.540]   So that's your geeks.
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:38.540]   That's because you're talking about that.
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:40.780]   Nobody gets excited about that.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:41.780]   Come on.
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:46.420]   We're talking about the things that developers are going to be excited about.
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:50.180]   As a consumer, sure, I can be like, "Ooh, a new music service."
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:54.660]   But the things that are going to actually fundamentally change how we use our devices,
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:58.540]   the security improvements that are going forward in OS X, is that something that's going
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:00.460]   to be like, "Ooh, so shiny."
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:01.460]   No, not so much.
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:04.380]   But I think those are going to be the big important things.
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:10.140]   If we want to talk just straight, consumer shiny, it's probably going to be a divide between
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:12.260]   the new music service and the Apple TV.
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:17.940]   I still don't think that they're going to put on a show the way that I think they do
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:21.260]   with, say, the iPhone or the Apple Watch events.
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:28.740]   They're going to be more thinking about positioning it as a developer device as well as, "This
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:33.580]   is really cool, but I don't think we will get Drake DJing on stage."
[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:37.620]   I kind of feel like that's maybe at the bash on Thursday.
[00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:42.060]   Maybe we'll have Jimmy Iavine and all his buddies at the Dub-Dub DC bash being liked.
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:44.060]   What's the label for our new music service?
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:46.460]   You don't think Dre and I have Enel be on stage on Monday?
[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:47.460]   Oh, they might.
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:48.460]   No, no, they might.
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:51.380]   I'm just saying we won't have a-- I don't think we'll have a musical performance.
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:52.380]   Yeah.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:53.380]   Oh, I bet we will.
[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:58.180]   Well, look, because-- well, let's take a break and we'll debate it.
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:53:59.180]   How about that?
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:04.980]   Next, the new Apple streaming music service, but first snacks, because I know you spent
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:12.340]   all morning serenity doing the home kit thing and you're eating some cold fridge lunch.
[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:13.340]   That's not good.
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:14.340]   We need to feed you some--
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:15.340]   A lot of good snacks.
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:16.340]   We've got to get to get you some nice snacks.
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:19.980]   Everybody loves snacks, but wouldn't it be nice if snacks were as healthy as your meal?
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:23.820]   Nature Box makes healthy snacks you will love like mini Belgian waffles.
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:24.820]   What?
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:25.820]   Oh, my God.
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:26.820]   What?
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.860]   You know, you got a snack.
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:34.900]   So why don't you eat something tasty satisfying that doesn't make you feel terrible afterwards?
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.180]   Over 100 healthy, crave-worthy options.
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:39.300]   All nutrition is approved.
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:45.020]   Never any artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners, 0 grams of trans fat, no high fructose
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.340]   corn syrup, just delicious stuff like this.
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:49.060]   Honeycomb sunflower kernels.
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.540]   We know sunflower seeds are full of great stuff for you.
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:57.460]   Give them a little boost with some honeycomb flavor and they're-- you know, it's simple.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:00.660]   If you look at the ingredient list, it's always short and sweet.
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:04.180]   It's just what you-- oh, I hear somebody snacking already.
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:05.780]   These are-- Andy's eating.
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.340]   What are you eating there?
[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:09.020]   The probiotic fruit and nut mix.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:10.020]   Those are good.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.020]   That's good.
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:13.020]   Blueberry Greek yogurt pretzels.
[00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:14.420]   These are really good.
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:16.020]   Sarah Lane stole all of them.
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:18.260]   We had to get a whole new shipment in.
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:22.660]   White truffle popcorn, coffee kettle popcorn.
[00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:24.580]   This is-- these are just five snacks.
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:29.340]   There are many more awaiting you at naturebox.com, like strawberry lemonade, fruit stars are
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.620]   sweet and salty, nut medley.
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:34.500]   Now, here's what I want you to do.
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:38.300]   Get the free sampler first so you know what you're getting into.
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:42.700]   A trial of your favorite snacks delivered right to your door.
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:46.580]   Just pay $2 for shipping at naturebox.com/twit.
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:48.500]   And we thank them so much for their support of Macbreak Week.
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:51.460]   Not just of the show, but also they feed our staff.
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:54.780]   I don't know, we have like eight nature boxes a month or something coming.
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:56.740]   We have a huge number.
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:57.740]   Very tempted.
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:00.180]   All right, music.
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:01.820]   We know a lot, I think.
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:03.540]   Or it is all just rumor.
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.340]   Apple has not said anything.
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:11.420]   This dates back to the acquisition for $3 plus billion of the Beats service, the Beats
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:12.420]   company.
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:13.420]   They got the headphones.
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.420]   They've already started selling those.
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:15.420]   They've even updated them.
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:16.980]   They've got new wireless headphones and so forth.
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:20.700]   So they're still in the headphone business.
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:27.420]   But most people agree the real gem in the crown of Beats was their streaming music service.
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:32.220]   Not because it had so many subscribers, you know, just a hundred thousand or so.
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:37.260]   But because Apple needed, after many years of turning its back on streaming music, to
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:42.620]   do something, what will they do on Monday?
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:45.180]   So any of your thoughts on that?
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:51.220]   I go back and forth on how detailed the service will be on Monday.
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:55.100]   Obviously, they've spent a long time getting deals together.
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:58.700]   Beats has their own group of artists that they've worked with.
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.420]   iTunes Radio has their group.
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:06.140]   I think what we'll see primarily is we'll hear a lot about the new music app, which is
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:10.780]   in beta right now for iOS developers.
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:16.060]   We will probably hear about the new unified service, what it's going to look like, what
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.500]   its name is going to be.
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.740]   Is iTunes Radio going the way of the dodo?
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:22.620]   Is Beats Music dead to the water?
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:27.900]   I kind of feel like the Beats Music brand might stick around for headphones, but I don't
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:32.660]   know if it will continue to be the overwhelming name for the subscription service.
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:36.340]   And then we'll find out what pricing looks like, whether we're going to look at more
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:40.340]   like the Beats Music service pricing, whether they're going to lower the Beats the service
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:45.580]   pricing to an even lower buy-in, whether or not they're going to have a free tier that's
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:48.860]   been talked about a lot.
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:52.980]   In general, it really comes down to look pricing and name.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:59.020]   And they'll probably have some big headlining thing music-wise.
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:05.620]   And we've got Beyonce exclusive to our platform or something like that to really sell it
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:06.620]   to the music nurse.
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:11.140]   I'd be surprised since Jay Z-Yone's a competing service, but it could happen.
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:12.300]   It's business.
[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:16.740]   Well, I'm sorry.
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:21.340]   I mean, the blueberry Greek yogurt pretzels, you caught me.
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:22.340]   It's complicated.
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:30.260]   I mean, everybody in business who talks about this talks about how you can see that more
[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:34.340]   people are, if they've got X dollars to spend per year on music, they're spending more of
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:39.300]   it on subscription services and less of it on actually purchasing music.
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:43.260]   So it certainly, and everybody's, excuse me, it's certainly an Apple's best interest is
[00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:48.180]   to simply decide that they need to switch, that they need to switch from an iPod idea
[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:51.900]   to an iPhone idea before they can no longer sell iPod, so to speak.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:55.020]   So they want to get this done sooner rather than later.
[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:57.540]   But the question is that people have a lot of habits.
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:01.780]   And so it's going to be a fight between people whose habit is to use a service like Spotify
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:03.420]   versus buy music.
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:07.980]   And then so once you get someone to make that switch, are you going to switch anybody who
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:09.780]   is using Spotify?
[00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:11.340]   Again, they're not brand new here.
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:14.100]   They've not just started using streaming music services.
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.340]   So they probably have Spotify.
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:17.340]   They have all their playlists set up there.
[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:18.340]   How easy is it?
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:21.340]   How attractive is it going to be to switch to an Apple service?
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:26.580]   And how easy is Apple going to make it to switch from Spotify to this new service?
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:31.500]   So there are just so many variables here that I can't even predict success or failure.
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:35.980]   All I got to do is hope that they do at least something to improve the music app, which
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:38.820]   is one of the real weak points of iOS at this point.
[00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:39.980]   You mean iTunes?
[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:40.980]   Yeah.
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:43.660]   No, the music app on iOS and iTunes as well.
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:51.260]   I mean, there are a few apps that I really believe really need to be destroyed and then
[00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:53.140]   replaced with something brand new.
[00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:55.340]   And I think that music is it.
[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:59.180]   It is such a lash up of all the years.
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:04.580]   It's been available in all the years, all the changes in how people acquire and consume
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:07.900]   music that I don't think it serves anybody particularly well.
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:12.460]   It's frustrating as hell for me to just figure out what is on my device right now, what is
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:14.700]   not on my device right now?
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:19.700]   If I want to listen to this to this album right now, what is going to cost me in terms
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:24.380]   of Wi-Fi or broadband connectivity versus what is already on my phone?
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:28.020]   And the fact that it's that hard to get even that done, the fact that it's so hard to do
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:33.540]   even searches just tells me that I hope that if they start a brand new streaming service,
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:34.580]   I hope it works well for them.
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:38.380]   But I just want a music player that works better than the one I have right now.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:41.940]   Well, I always 8.4 has the all new music app already.
[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:43.380]   It's in beta.
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:45.420]   I'm not enough of a music aficionado.
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:47.180]   I barely ever open that app.
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:48.180]   It's my secret chain.
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:53.020]   I don't listen to a lot of music on my phone, but it is all new and all different.
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.020]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:55.020]   I guess people have opinions on that.
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:57.980]   Even if you are aficionado, the chances are they've been in the future.
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:02.700]   And aficionados are opening Spotify or something else.
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:03.700]   RDO.
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:07.500]   I think that's the real risk for Apple is they're going to lose the business entirely.
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.500]   I think that's absolutely true.
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.300]   But there's a lot we don't know about what they're doing, but we can see what they have
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.300]   done.
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.900]   And that is they were going to launch iTunes radio and it went out in the US and it went
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.980]   out in Australia and then it stopped.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:19.820]   And they bought beats and people were still wondering what was happening with iTunes radio.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.860]   Well, after they bought beats, all of that went away and it started making a bunch of
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:23.860]   new plans.
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:26.900]   And there were some ups and downs with the development of what those new plans were going
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:27.900]   to be.
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:31.300]   But the key things for Apple was the human curation that they thought that beats did really well.
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.540]   They thought that was an advantage that they had sort of these people behind it.
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:38.260]   And a lot of people did like the results of whether it was absolute human curation or
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:39.260]   some blend of it.
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:43.380]   They did like the results and rolling that across the entire catalog when they start hiring
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:49.340]   and there's rumors, I think just earlier this week about Drake and Farrell and Dre and how
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:54.700]   the service might be a lot more like it might actually have a DJ factor to it.
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:55.980]   That's sort of how they want to compete.
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:59.580]   I guess they feel like they were at iTunes.
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:03.260]   A lot of the world is now in Spotify or something else and they want to offer what they think
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:06.020]   will be an interesting service for where people go to next.
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:10.260]   That's what Jimmy Iovine said from day one with beats before it was an Apple product was,
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:11.980]   we're going to bring back curation.
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:16.180]   We're going to bring back real people telling you what to listen to.
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:20.300]   It's, you know, okay, but it didn't exactly make beats a world beater.
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.740]   I think it might be a little too late.
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:22.740]   Well, it was US only.
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:26.980]   I think it tied to AT&T at the beginning and getting scaled, those kind of servers.
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:29.340]   I remember the early days of Spotify, I think it started.
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:31.780]   I might be remembering wrong, but I think it was one of the ones that started in Europe
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:33.620]   and people were waiting for it to move.
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:34.620]   Yeah, Apple's.
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:35.620]   Then Europe, yeah.
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.500]   Yeah, Apple's ability.
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.660]   The thing that Apple can do for beats because beats can do curation for Apple and it brings
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:45.620]   Jimmy Iovine in and that helps relieve Eddie Cuse monstrous job, which is already huge enough.
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:49.420]   But it is to help them scale like they can get the beats headphones into all the stores,
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:54.300]   so they can also get whatever this new service is called into that music app on hundreds
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:56.340]   of millions of iOS devices.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:00.380]   Now Apple's advantage is when they hit that update button, it took a little while to get
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:06.340]   to 80%, but it took almost no time at all to get to 60, 70% adoption for iOS 8 and iOS
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:09.260]   9 at the very least people will see it and maybe press it.
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.900]   And that's an advantage that they're going to have over a lot of their competitors.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:13.300]   There's curation and other things too.
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:16.500]   In fact, Andy, I remember boy, that was a great thing you did.
[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.700]   And I recently re-upped for Spotify.
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:20.500]   I had let it lapse because I was using Google music.
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:27.500]   But when Spotify started carrying our podcasts, I re-upped and all my playlists were still
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.340]   there, including that great one you did where you invited.
[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:33.300]   And this is where Spotify really shines.
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:39.300]   You invited people to add to a public Spotify playlist the one song, the song if you had
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:43.860]   only one song to pick that you would pick as the song.
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:45.340]   And I love that playlist.
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:47.220]   And it's still there, it still works.
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.380]   It's great.
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:49.780]   That's curation in my mind.
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:50.780]   That's the best.
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:55.380]   Yeah, it's again, there's so many variables here.
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:04:01.340]   Curation is a really great thing, but honest to God, I don't care about their credentials
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:05.420]   of the person that they pick to curate a certain playlist.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:11.060]   Random person on the internet that simply has good taste, pick songs that I like, it
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:13.020]   has a lot more adventures than I am.
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.740]   Don't care if they never work for the BBC.
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:17.780]   Don't care if they're making $18,000 a year.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:21.260]   They're the person that I'm picking to curate and anybody can do that.
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:26.620]   So I just don't know what they, there are times when you say you just don't know and
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:29.900]   you mean that sort of is a backhanded ball, this is a stupid idea.
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:33.980]   I'm saying I literally don't know what Apple would have to put into a streaming service
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.820]   to make it into a successful thing.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:41.340]   Although as Renee says, just the simple fact of an app that comes preloaded on every single
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:46.200]   phone that ships is a huge, huge advantage for whatever service that Apple chooses to
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.200]   ship.
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.900]   I know that we don't care.
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:50.900]   Go ahead, Renee.
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:54.540]   I was going to say quickly that.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:55.540]   Renee.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:59.380]   I just going to say quickly that it doesn't really, like I'm the same as Andy, like I
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:03.060]   wouldn't know who was curating it, but I don't, I don't see the appeal of Beats headphones
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.940]   and the loud bass and obviously those are hugely popular.
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:09.740]   So maybe the millennials or whatever the proper term is for the generation next really do
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.340]   care that it's Drake or Farrell or Dr. Dre.
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:15.220]   And that along with it being on their phone is going to make it an attractive service
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:19.100]   to them because you know, if you never know what's going to be the next big hit thing,
[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.820]   you can only hope that you have enough ingredients.
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:24.460]   And it seems like at least that's the way that they're going with it.
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:25.460]   Superstars.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:26.460]   Go ahead.
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:27.460]   It's all about the superstars.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.780]   Oh, I honestly, I was just going to make a joke about, you know, not front loading it
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:31.780]   with you too.
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:33.780]   But, uh, no one's really nice.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:35.500]   Yeah, I like being here.
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.900]   I know I love you too.
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:37.900]   I was.
[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:38.900]   I think the playlists.
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:43.300]   I like and I'm interested in, you know, enrolling Stones is the 500 greatest rock and roll songs
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.300]   of all time.
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:49.700]   That's a list I would load and uh, um, KCRW has a summer playlist that's updated regularly
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:51.260]   and that's in Spotify by the way.
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:52.340]   That's a list I would load.
[01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:56.620]   So there are some lists I load because it's often the case that you kind of want to listen
[01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:03.060]   to music without picking it, but you don't want necessarily a Pandora style radio station.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:05.180]   So playlists work quite well, uh, there.
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:09.260]   And so I thought it was very interesting the way beats did the curation.
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:11.180]   You build a sentence.
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:13.700]   I think it'll be interesting to have superstar people.
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:17.260]   As you say, Renee, everybody's going to have it and they're going to have it presumably
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.260]   free for a month.
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:21.060]   Although I, you know, I would be smart to make it free for the first three months or
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.060]   something like that.
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:23.060]   Yeah.
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:28.220]   Give them some, give them some time and also integrating it, integrating it both with, uh,
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:32.300]   with Siri with the phone, um, with CarPlay will be huge.
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:36.820]   I know one of my frustrations right now with beats, um, and with RDO and a couple of the
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:41.460]   other streaming services that I try is that when I'm commuting, when I'm driving up and
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:44.700]   down New England, um, it's very hard for me.
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:48.780]   Like, if I want to switch a playlist in the middle of, in the middle of driving and I'm
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:53.980]   on beats, I have to pull over to the side of the road and pick up my phone and like,
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:59.660]   select things because there's no way to say, Hey, switch the switch to this playlist or
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:00.660]   switch my sentence.
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:02.900]   That's cause you're using an iPhone.
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:05.820]   I hate to tell you on Android, you're on your watch.
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.380]   You'll get arrested on Android.
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:08.540]   You can just say that your phone.
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:10.820]   I want to listen to the Rolling Stones and it'll play.
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:11.820]   Oh, sure.
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.860]   I could, I could do that on iTunes radio.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:15.580]   I just really don't like iTunes radio.
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:16.580]   I know.
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:17.580]   You get to choose on Android.
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:22.980]   What, uh, is the default, uh, music, uh, system so you could make it be Spotify or
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:23.980]   whatever.
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:26.940]   But that, that, that, that is an insight into what could be really awesome.
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:30.940]   If it, if it hooked it into Siri in a very natural way with a lot of deep learning,
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:37.780]   the ability to say, I want to hear a lot of rock from the past three or four years that
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:41.900]   is different from anything that I've been listening to for the past five months, which
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:44.940]   is a really complex thing, but it, but it shows you the sort of thing I'm talking about.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:47.460]   I mean, that's the sort of thing that natural language can do.
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:51.300]   And that a subscription service can do that my own collection can't.
[01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:55.700]   Um, I do have a, I think like most people have some curated playlists that I have a
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:08:00.180]   lot of fun managing and moving songs in and out of, but really that doesn't help me
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:04.820]   discover new music and it doesn't help me help help to surprise me with stuff.
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:06.780]   And it's not always tailored to every single thing.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:11.780]   So if, if that could be integrated with Siri, uh, not only would it be a great feature,
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:16.540]   but it would also be a way that Apple could sort of hit a feature, uh, over the heads
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:20.060]   of every other streaming service because nobody is going to have this level of integration
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.260]   with Siri, uh, as Apple will.
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.260]   That's true.
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:26.260]   And the point I would, I would really like is we saw a lot of continuity last year, but
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.380]   we didn't see any for media.
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:30.820]   And I, I would just love to walk away from my Mac and the playlist to just automatically
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:34.980]   go to my iPhone or my Apple watch or walk away from my Apple TV and the movie just as
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:36.580]   seamlessly switched to my iPad.
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:39.900]   There's so many interesting things you can do once you're broadcasting activity, once
[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.460]   you can move that activity.
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:42.460]   And it's going to be complicated.
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:44.300]   I noticed, uh, there's handoff on the watch now.
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:48.100]   So anyway, showing it before, and I'm typing a message on my watch and I decide I'm a little
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:49.780]   frustrated because I want to say something else.
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:52.180]   I can just pick up my iPhone and swipe up.
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:55.460]   But then I have Safari on my Mac and it's not quite sure whether I want to hand off Safari
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:56.980]   or hand off messages.
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:09:01.380]   But I think that whole area, once it gets really good at that and I can move video and
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:05.500]   audio and all those kinds of things as well, then that, that convenience of having that
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.500]   whole ecosystem again becomes powerful.
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:08.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:12.340]   But that brings up another point and if I'm changing the subject, we can bring, we can
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:13.340]   come back to it later.
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:14.340]   Change away.
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:15.340]   I have no.
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:16.340]   Okay.
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.340]   Well, I'm just, I was saying that a lot of the stuff we've been talking about, a lot
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:21.460]   of stuff we've been reading with other people about is that it's not so much going to be
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.460]   here.
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:26.400]   It's this brand new shiny thing that we're releasing in iOS 9, but we are basically trying to
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:30.860]   make all the features that we've been rolling in there for the past year or so work better.
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:35.740]   And Renee, I mean, you bring up something that was just so frustrating this morning where
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:39.460]   I was having breakfast with a friend of mine and I ran into construction.
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:40.540]   So I had a detour around it.
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:41.540]   So I was very late.
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:45.340]   I knew my friend was at the restaurant with his iPhone next to him.
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:49.740]   And so when we were at a, when we were at a red light, I just raised up my, my Apple
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:53.540]   watch and said text, so a message so and so I'm running a little bit late.
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:56.780]   If you order this for me, I'll probably be there in 12 minutes.
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:58.460]   And then he never got it.
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:04.380]   And the reason why was because he was, the reason why was because he was, he was logged
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:09.500]   into messages in his house, but not logged into messages on his phone.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:14.140]   And whereas I assumed that because I was sending him a text message from my watch connected
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:16.980]   to my phone, it would send it as an SMS.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:22.460]   And I said, no, I'm just going to send this to his computer in his office, not his phone.
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:27.060]   And that's the sort of thing that makes you, makes you wonder, I hope Apple doesn't make
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:30.100]   a car because that would be a very surprising first month of driving.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:37.100]   If that sort of long time is in here, it's like, I found a better route for you.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.700]   It involves cutting through this backyard.
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:40.100]   You're welcome.
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:45.380]   So if, if, if really Apple, if all Apple does is really make the point that here is how
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:49.300]   we're trying to make your overall experience better, that would be the best win for me.
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:50.980]   I don't, I don't care about this.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:53.300]   The new G-Wizzy features that they want to put in.
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:55.620]   I just want fewer moments like that.
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:59.580]   And incidentally, the way to fix that was to go into my phone settings and basically say
[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:05.020]   that, look, forget I met, forget I message for text messages, always send them as SMS,
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:06.300]   which would solve the problem for me.
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:07.380]   And there's other things I could do.
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:10.420]   I had to change a bunch of signings to make sure that wouldn't happen again.
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:16.740]   But the fact that that would get through and be a problem is just surprising to me.
[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:20.300]   People are asking for a link to your Spotify.
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.420]   One song playlist, we could start over again, right?
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:24.340]   We could actually, people could start adding to it again.
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:27.460]   There's a 170 some songs on there already.
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:29.540]   I could, I could, I could tweet that out tomorrow.
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:30.540]   Okay.
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:34.180]   It's a, it's a really, it's something, it's something that, as a matter of fact, Tonya
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:39.180]   angst actually introduced that to me because there was a small world.
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:40.180]   That's nice.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:45.460]   Because she was having a birthday party for, for Adam and decided as a gift, she, she
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:49.340]   decided to ask all of her, all of his friends who recommend one song and one song only at
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:50.740]   the playlist.
[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:54.860]   And after I realized that, well, that's a fun challenge because if I'm only going to
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:58.140]   recommend one song, it doesn't even necessarily have to be the best song.
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:02.860]   But here is one song you really like that you want someone else to know about.
[01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.980]   Know it again, no blog post behind it.
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.300]   No, you have to listen to the album first.
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:09.380]   I'm saying you would just get to tell me a title and nothing else.
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:12.340]   It's an interesting challenge and you wind up with a really interesting playlist.
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:17.100]   Did you have to manually add the songs or could people go to Spotify and add that?
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:21.540]   No, I was, I was, matter of fact, I did it on Twitter and every time I saw a song that
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:26.660]   was at, and people were doing it with replies and then someone actually created that, that
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:29.740]   Spotify playlist for me before I got around to doing it.
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:33.940]   I was gonna, I was gonna, I was gonna sort of curate a little bit more, but as soon as
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:37.740]   like it was halfway done and this playlist appeared, I realized that, wow, this is much,
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:41.460]   much better than having someone offer an opinion on these picks.
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:43.700]   So let's just, you know, have it, have a come on.
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:46.020]   It's kind of crazy because it's all over.
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:49.060]   You know, it's Bruce Springsteen to Johnny Depp.
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:52.260]   Sometimes, but that's exactly, that's exactly what you want.
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:53.260]   Yeah.
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:56.420]   It's, you want that random seed inside your, inside your playlist.
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:13:00.360]   It's like, you don't, and you don't, you want to make sure this is not based on any
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.360]   sense of logic.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:04.140]   It's not trying to profile you or guess what you want.
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:05.140]   Right.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:10.100]   And at some point, you just have to throw the dart at the world at, atlas and learn about
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:12.260]   something that you would never even considered looking at before.
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:17.420]   As you can see, I've subscribed, and this was back way back when I was a Spotify user.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:20.220]   I subscribed to a lot of playlists.
[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:26.300]   There's biblify.com had a variety of playlists, KCRW I mentioned.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:32.140]   So there are people who, I guess I presume to this day continue to publish curated playlists.
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:37.380]   So in a way that this kind of curation exists, it's not as, you know, cool as making a sentence
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:43.300]   or Jimmy Iaveen's top five, but I think this is one of the reasons Spotify has done so well.
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:48.860]   And it is sticky, especially once you start adding these playlists to your collection.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:51.700]   You can't, you can't get that into another service.
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:52.700]   Yeah.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:57.820]   And again, it's hard to imagine what kind of value gets, what kind of value that any
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:02.500]   service could act by saying, look at this incredibly talented playlist curator that we
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:03.500]   hired.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:04.940]   It's not going to be the credentials.
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:07.100]   It's going to be, look, show me one of your playlists.
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:08.100]   Wow, that's awesome.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.100]   Great.
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.100]   Okay.
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.100]   I'm in.
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:12.100]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.100]   I mean, I don't know who here in Donahue is, but he created a list called the 500 greatest
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:16.100]   songs of all time.
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:17.100]   And you know what?
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:18.100]   It's, it's a good list.
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:19.100]   I mean, it's a good list.
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:20.100]   It's a good list.
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:24.700]   But that, but that means that, that at least 130 of them are going to be songs you've heard
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.700]   so a million times.
[01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:26.700]   You're kind of, yeah.
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:28.260]   I like your one song list.
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.020]   It's my favorite playlist.
[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:33.180]   Cedric Ingrond did a guitar hero's playlist.
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:36.780]   You know what's interesting is when this, when he first created this playlist, more
[01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:41.140]   than half of the 41 songs were not available from Spotify.
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:44.220]   As of today, almost all of them are.
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:48.500]   So I find that kind of interesting, right?
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:52.220]   The playlist have really expanded what you can, what you can get.
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:53.700]   No, I love that.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:59.780]   And you know what, there is, Beats has a playlist section where it's not just, you know, make
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:04.860]   the random sentence, but there are folks working behind the scenes building these really, really
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:06.180]   great playlists.
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:13.060]   There's one, one woman in particular, Susie Cole does amazing classic rock playlists that
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:17.940]   I got completely addicted to, to the point where I was just downloading all, like, any
[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:22.300]   time she would do a new playlist, I'm like, oh yeah, I'll listen to it, even if it's not
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:25.100]   classic rock, because I know that your taste in music is good.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:26.900]   And I'm the inform of DJ, right?
[01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:29.100]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:34.620]   Well, I, you know, then nothing wrong with competition.
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:37.060]   I hope Apple does a, knocks it out of the park.
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:39.140]   I'd love to see a great service.
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:40.700]   We know they're going to charge 10 bucks, right?
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.380]   It's going to be the same as everybody else.
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:45.780]   The music industry would have to give them a break to change that, right?
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:47.980]   I don't know.
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:49.740]   We've heard rumors for 799.
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:50.740]   Yeah.
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:53.860]   And it would just be Apple taking a cut to try and boost adoption.
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:54.860]   Right.
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:59.660]   The other thing Apple could do as Amazon and Google have done is integrate your existing
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:04.780]   collection, your iTunes collection into any streaming service.
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:06.980]   I, I'm sure they will do that.
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:09.260]   And that's an advantage Apple does have over Spotify.
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:12.380]   They have iTunes match already, just sit waiting.
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:13.380]   Yeah.
[01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:14.380]   Yeah.
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:15.380]   So that would be pretty cool.
[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:18.980]   What will we hear about OS 10 and iOS?
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:22.100]   You said that was the most exciting thing, serenity.
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.100]   What are you excited about?
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:27.740]   I think it's, I think it's the most exciting in part because I like new software.
[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:35.340]   I like being able to do new things with my already very powerful iOS and Mac devices.
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:41.380]   On the Mac side, the big, the big rumored improvement is this new security system called
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:45.980]   rootless, which I'll let Renee talk a little bit more about since he's more up, up to date
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:47.620]   on it than I am.
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:51.780]   On the iOS side, we're looking to see a bunch of sort of improvements across the board.
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:56.500]   But one of the biggest rumored ones, at least according to Mark, I have all of the sources
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:17:05.140]   german from 95 is a new version of Siri integrated with a spotlight and a couple of other services,
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:06.820]   code named currently proactive.
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:11.540]   Now I don't know if this will actually appear in the next version of iOS in its final form,
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:17.580]   but anything that allows Siri to do more things I am on board with that makes me happy.
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:19.460]   That makes me excited.
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:25.300]   And we've also heard that we might see some more stuff with maps might actually finally
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:29.180]   see transit data fingers crossed.
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:33.300]   Although it's, you know, I am still on the Google Maps train.
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:38.620]   I love many, many things about Apple Maps, but its directions and traffic are not are
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:39.780]   still not my favorite.
[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.420]   And I saw that they're bad.
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:44.620]   It's just that Google has the slight edge, I think, in track.
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:46.900]   I mean, they've been doing this longer.
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:48.140]   They have the head start.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:53.980]   And I don't think that Apple necessarily still has the resources to catch up to them.
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:56.300]   So I'm hoping I'm hoping I'm wrong.
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:18:02.300]   I'm hoping we'll see some more maps improvements that will make me a happier person.
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:06.980]   I love all these code names at Apple so much, but proactive just sounds high fiber to me.
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:07.980]   Yeah.
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:10.060]   I'm a favorite.
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:11.860]   I think the root list stuff is super interesting.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:13.860]   The security stuff in general is super interesting.
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:17.460]   And it's this huge focus because you know, Apple.com/privacy.
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.820]   So it's right at the top.
[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:22.940]   And I think the idea is that you can run one of the big problems now is that people still
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.260]   run as administrator on Mac.
[01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:28.100]   There was this idea that Macs were infallible for a very long time.
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.060]   But there are exploits in browsers.
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:31.620]   There are forms of malware.
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:32.620]   There is phishing.
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:33.620]   There is social engineering.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.860]   There's all sorts of ways you can attack an operating system.
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:38.140]   The issue is really escalation, right?
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:40.780]   That you could escalate your privileges.
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:41.780]   The bad guy could.
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:42.780]   Okay.
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:46.940]   So the point that you want to use the Uefi vulnerability that was reported on this weekend
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:48.740]   is an escalation.
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.500]   They need to actually have something on your computer.
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.660]   They have to be able to have root access on your computer.
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:56.500]   But once they do, they can take persistent control of that computer using a flaw in that
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.420]   way that it resumes from sleep.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:01.780]   This is only for 2014 mid-2014 in previous Macs.
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:02.780]   But it's still a problem.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:06.420]   And if you run as a standard user, it's not a problem, but most people don't run as a standard
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:07.420]   user.
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:08.420]   They run as an administrator.
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:10.580]   So the idea is the user shouldn't have to care.
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:12.580]   They shouldn't have to worry about who they're running at it.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:15.780]   They shouldn't have to go into settings and change their account and make all this.
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:19.300]   They should just not have access to the things that can do them problems and less than until
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:21.620]   they decide to go and escalate those things.
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:25.260]   This is the equivalent of hiding the library folder, right?
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.260]   Yes.
[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:27.940]   So that happened last time.
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:29.620]   Last a big upgrade.
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:31.420]   Or maybe even a couple ago.
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:35.420]   You don't, you didn't see your library folder unless you knew enough to hold the option key.
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:40.100]   Will it be that simple of a speed bump or is it going to be a lot harder to get administrative
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:41.100]   privileges or rules?
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.100]   I mean, there's a couple.
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:45.100]   Like, there's the extreme example, which is on iOS, you have no file system access because
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:48.500]   they believe it's intrinsically not a human way of organizing things.
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:51.980]   But you've had technologies like this, like the Mac App Store stops you in large part
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:54.180]   going to websites and downloading things.
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:57.740]   And we've seen the horrible crapware that a lot of download websites attach to their
[01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:58.740]   download.
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:19:59.740]   So it prevents all that.
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:03.380]   Things like Gatekeeper will stop you from downloading apps.
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:08.660]   You can choose Mac App Store only trusted developers or, you know, if you want to anything
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:11.060]   and everything, but you have to opt out of that stuff.
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:12.860]   So I think it'll be similar to that.
[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:14.340]   Sandboxing is another great example.
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:18.660]   And I think that's the same team who's working on this is that it'll just, it'll work and
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:21.340]   most people will just never know that it's even there.
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:25.140]   And if you try to do something that requires a level of root access, you might have to
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:26.980]   authenticate or do something else over there.
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:28.380]   They already do that, don't they?
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:33.620]   I mean, when I'm, even if I'm running as administrator, I will have to give my password to install
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:37.420]   a program to modify system files or system folders.
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:38.420]   That already exists.
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:39.780]   This must be more than that.
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:45.220]   Well, I think it seals off more because you can, the exploit here was just, the fear was
[01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:47.420]   that someone could force you into a sleep cycle or something.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.660]   So it can sometimes it's not a major command.
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:54.780]   It's an otherwise innocuous command that's something malicious piggybacks onto.
[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:57.500]   And most people probably don't have to open up the terminal and don't have to access any
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:58.500]   of those.
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.500]   Yeah, I do that all the time though.
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:00.500]   I like to be able to do that.
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:03.900]   And I presume there'll be some mechanism for me to be able to have full access.
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:07.500]   I don't know the details, but I assume, but I just from the name itself, it sounds like
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:12.740]   it's basically you run as administrator without root access, which is a huge boon.
[01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:15.460]   And there's a bunch of other security stuff that they've been working on for a while in
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.860]   ways to improve.
[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:21.220]   If you want to just hand your phone to somebody, you don't want them to have access to everything.
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:24.980]   And when I look at the state of security, it's so open right now.
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:29.460]   For example, and I've used this example before, my friend Phil Nickinson, he had a Motorola
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:31.700]   device that was a trusted Bluetooth object.
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:34.460]   And as long as he was wearing that, it could unlock his phone.
[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:37.660]   But if I just, if he left it on the table, I could just pick it up and unlock his phone.
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:39.620]   It didn't know me from him.
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:42.980]   But now you have something like the Apple Watch, which you have to authenticate with,
[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:44.780]   but then you have skin contact too.
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:48.380]   So it kind of knows that you're the one wearing it and then you can start unlocking things.
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:51.540]   So you have these trust relationships with things like touch ID and things like the Apple
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:56.780]   Watch that then you can start doing or using to extend your security to protect security
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:59.620]   the way we're projecting extensions onto other surfaces.
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:01.540]   I think just the whole thing is security in general.
[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:07.700]   If they could make it easier, but also safer, the way touch ID did, the way the skin contact
[01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:08.700]   sensors do.
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:11.540]   I think those are the big wins for just mainstream people everywhere.
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:14.980]   As long as they don't make it impossible for people who like to use the command line.
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:19.700]   And I see reason I still use Macintosh is because I consider it a BSD system and I want
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:21.900]   to be able to hit the command line and do stuff.
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:22.900]   Absolutely.
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:23.900]   And it's a big posse.
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:25.900]   No, I don't think they'll ever take that away.
[01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:26.900]   They better not.
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:31.380]   It'll just be available for the power users who want it.
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:32.380]   Right.
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:37.020]   Rather than more overtly available for your average mother or father.
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:40.540]   Something akin to holding the secret hold down the option key to get the light up.
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:41.540]   Well, you do that now, right?
[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:45.620]   If you don't know any better, you try to launch an app that you don't know where it came from.
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:46.780]   And it'll say this came from the internet.
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:47.780]   You can't launch it.
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:50.820]   If you know, you can press, you can write it like or you can press alt and launch it.
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:51.820]   Yeah, that's a great thing.
[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:52.820]   And that's the right thing.
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.340]   Oh, you can hold on to all key and do that.
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:55.340]   Oh, okay.
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:56.340]   I don't know.
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:57.340]   We should, we'll do it.
[01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:01.340]   We'll digress a little bit and get back to what's going to be new in iOS and iOS.
[01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:03.580]   10 at WWDC.
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:07.020]   But briefly, since you mentioned it, let's talk about this.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:16.340]   UEFI exploit Pedro Villaka, who was a OS 10 security guy, says Max shipped prior to mid
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:18.020]   2014.
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:23.580]   So that's the vast majority of Macintosh is are vulnerable to essentially an exploit
[01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:27.980]   that would give be, be owned, own them.
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:34.300]   And this kind of a sneaky way to do it, you have to do it after sleep.
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:37.060]   The Mac wakes up from sleep.
[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:45.580]   And then you can reflash the Max BIOS using the user land function to contain a root kit
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:48.540]   or whatever the hell you want to put in there.
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:49.540]   And it does not.
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:51.100]   And this is really important.
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:53.220]   Require physical access to the machine.
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:55.780]   It requires root access, but not physical access.
[01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:59.380]   So if you don't have physical access, you have to use a different kind of exploit to gain
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:01.220]   remote access previously.
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:02.220]   First do that.
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:04.060]   And then you can do this.
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:08.260]   So it is still, it's still not going to be something that's going to happen in a.
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:11.180]   Yeah, it's something the vast majority of people do not have to worry about.
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:15.060]   If you think you're a target, again, you can run in standard mode instead of in administrator
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:17.060]   mode, you can disable sleep.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:20.420]   So route pipe won't affect what can't escalate you.
[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:22.060]   For instance, that's one of the exploits.
[01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:25.140]   Can't escalate you if you're not running as administrator.
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:29.980]   I believe this exploit can't take permanent onage if you're not running as administrator.
[01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:31.460]   So you need to be running.
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:36.780]   So finally, a reason that I always tell the windows users do not run as an administrative
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:37.780]   user.
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:42.500]   But I've actually said Mac users, you have a pass because Apple requires you to authenticate,
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:46.100]   even if you're running as administrative user to do anything dangerous.
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:50.100]   But this is now a reason why you don't want to run as administrator.
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:55.660]   And it's these things, Apple has patched previous issues that are similar to this and they're
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:57.220]   going to patch this one.
[01:24:57.220 --> 01:25:00.740]   Of course, some people wonder why it takes so long, but you always have to check the
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:04.220]   code and then check the fix and make sure it doesn't create other problems.
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:07.580]   So you can't just rush out the patch and actually run quality assurance on the patch.
[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:12.780]   Well, that raises the question why they haven't fixed this messages bug that allows people
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:19.220]   to crash messages, sometimes even crash your iPhone by sending a malformed Unicode message.
[01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:20.540]   People are all over doing this.
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:23.540]   I would hate to be a middle school iPhone user these days.
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:24.540]   I spoke to them about it.
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:26.260]   They said they're doing it as fast as possible.
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:30.260]   That's another one where it's probably, you know, I'm going to guess it's a buffer overflow
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:35.260]   in the text read during engine in messages because it even as you point out in your article
[01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:37.780]   and I'm or even works during in the lock screen.
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:41.900]   So what it looks like is that there's a bug in the way that it so these are Unicode
[01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:45.540]   strings and it's happened before it'll probably happen again because there's all sorts of
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:48.660]   weird things that can happen with when you combine Unicode characters, there's there's
[01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:50.140]   a relic there's Arabic.
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:53.500]   There's all sorts of different characters that's and it tries to render them and it can't
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:58.900]   and that failure causes a respring or a reboot and that gets fixed.
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:04.980]   But who know like for some reason, rendering Unicode is sufficiently challenging on a
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:06.540]   lot of these devices.
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:08.100]   Yeah.
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:10.380]   So if they fix the buffer overflow, that's easy.
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:13.540]   But then you as you say, they could have side effects that you might you have to check
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:14.780]   to make sure it doesn't have side effects.
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:16.460]   It looks like cortex because it's not everywhere.
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:20.180]   It's not every app specific to messages but it also happens in the notification center.
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:21.180]   Yeah.
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:24.940]   And the recommendation is if most people's friends got bored almost immediately after
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:25.940]   doing it.
[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:29.540]   So also there's some risk because somebody did it in our chat room and his messages crashed
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:30.540]   as well.
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:31.700]   So there's some risk to yourself.
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:32.700]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:37.780]   So if it happens to you just use Siri because Siri is not affected by this to respond to
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:42.140]   that message and that will at least on the screen that's initially playing it's mostly
[01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:46.860]   the list of messages or the actual message and notifications that is the problem that
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:49.660]   will put your reply first most in that stack.
[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:52.460]   And you can delete the conversation and you'll never see it again.
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:53.460]   Yeah.
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:54.460]   And John Syracuse had a really good point on this.
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:57.380]   He said it's happened often enough that would probably be smart to put some sort of flag
[01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:00.540]   that says if you've crashed last, don't resume to the same state.
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:04.500]   Resume to a state that's sorry that to the last state, resume to a safe state.
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:07.740]   So maybe you can't go into that message thread again but at least you'd be in an area where
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:09.220]   you could continue using it.
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:13.940]   But as Steve Gibson will point out and he probably will next on security now, whenever
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:19.180]   you can get a system to crash, that's always a sign that there's a possibility of getting
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:23.900]   an exploit around it because often what happens is it crashes, the stack pointer gets sent
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:26.420]   to a strange area of memory and crashes.
[01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:30.860]   If you could write to that area of memory some malicious code and get the stack pointer
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:33.900]   to jump there and execute it then you've got an exploit.
[01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:38.620]   And so it's very often the case that a buffer overflow that leads to a crash is eventually
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:40.700]   weaponized to a lead to a hack.
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:42.220]   So this has to be fixed quickly.
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:43.220]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:45.420]   And again, they said they're going to be fixing it as fast as possible.
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:52.940]   All right, let's pop that stack and recurse back to iOS and OS 10 improvements.
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:59.260]   They've said already that or at least they've intimated that iOS was it going to be 8.5
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:00.260]   or 9?
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:03.420]   IOS 9 probably and OS 10 10.11.
[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:04.420]   11.
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:05.420]   Question mark.
[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:06.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:10.500]   If they're going to keep that, they will be snow leopard style upgrades.
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:13.540]   They'll fix, they'll improve, but not a lot of whole new.
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:14.740]   Well, there's some new features.
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:18.420]   Obviously that new root features are good one.
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:22.980]   Internally, there's still 10.11 and iOS 9, but the marketing they could decide that
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:25.420]   you're going to name after Parisian streets from now.
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:26.420]   Right.
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.140]   No, I like California landmarks.
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:29.140]   Let's keep that, shall we?
[01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:32.180]   Well, I'm back, but the iOS doesn't have code names still.
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:33.180]   Oh.
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:35.500]   I mean, they have internal code names like iOS 9 has Monarch, but they don't have, you
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:36.500]   know, marketing code names.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.220]   They're not going to do an iOS 8.5.
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:40.420]   They're going to go to 8.4 and then go to 9.
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:43.940]   8.4 will happen at WWDC most likely.
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:47.980]   If they need to, they might do 4.0 something to fix bugs and things, but iOS 9 will come
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:48.980]   out in September.
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:49.980]   Okay.
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:51.140]   And 8.4 is pretty high.
[01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:54.100]   They haven't gone very high on the point releases in recent years.
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:55.100]   Okay.
[01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:58.060]   They always release a new one with a new iPhone.
[01:28:58.060 --> 01:28:59.060]   So far, yeah.
[01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:00.060]   Yeah.
[01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:01.060]   Okay.
[01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:02.060]   That would make sense.
[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:03.060]   There've been 9 iPhones, right?
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:04.060]   Something like that.
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:06.660]   It's not even a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:08.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:10.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:12.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:13.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:14.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:15.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:16.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:17.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:18.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:19.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:20.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:21.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:22.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:23.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:24.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:25.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:26.660]   It's not a new version of the iPhone.
[01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:33.660]   It's the watch font.
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:34.660]   I believe so.
[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:35.660]   It's a nice font.
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:36.660]   It's a beautiful font.
[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:37.660]   I love this font.
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:39.660]   It's designed for these screens.
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:40.660]   It is.
[01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:41.660]   It is.
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:42.660]   It is.
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:46.660]   Also because I've been back on iOS for now for two and a half weeks.
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:55.660]   I'm surprised by how the thing that I missed the most is a clear, not-whip.
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:30:00.660]   They're not whisper-thin font on my phone screen.
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:02.660]   Normally, I'd be like, "Okay, fine.
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:03.660]   You're changing the font."
[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:07.660]   But now I'm like, "Ooh, I would love to see what iOS would look like with a different
[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:10.660]   font because maybe that will make me like this UI better."
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:14.660]   Andy, you really have gone apostate on us.
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:16.660]   I am shocked.
[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:17.660]   I'm sorry.
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:19.660]   I'm wearing Apple Watch.
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:22.660]   It tells me to move, but it doesn't tell me to sit straight.
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:23.660]   I'm trying to sit straight.
[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:24.660]   I'm not a little straight.
[01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:25.660]   Well, yeah.
[01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:26.660]   How's my apostate?
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:27.660]   No.
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:30.660]   Is this true?
[01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:31.660]   The fifth?
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:32.660]   So not Twitter.
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:33.660]   I got to share.
[01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:34.660]   So not Twitter.
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:36.660]   I wish I could quote him.
[01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:41.180]   If the Apple keynote goes past an hour, is there going to be like a thousand people standing
[01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:42.660]   up because they're watching it?
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:43.660]   Oh, at 10.
[01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:47.620]   At 10.50, we're all going to jump to our feet.
[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:49.340]   That would be interesting, wouldn't it?
[01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:51.660]   Sorry that I can't credit him.
[01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:54.140]   It's always at 10.50 or 50 minutes after the hour, right?
[01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:59.140]   If you haven't moved already, maybe you just get in your movement really quickly before
[01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:01.060]   the keynote starts if they're running late.
[01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:02.060]   The line after the...
[01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:03.860]   It's going to be like a Catholic mass.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:08.660]   Suddenly everybody stands up for no reason says the one thing.
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:11.460]   A thousand dollars a year.
[01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:13.020]   Will we see any watch stuff?
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:14.660]   There's not much to say.
[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:15.660]   Watch it.
[01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:21.020]   The thing that I'm looking forward to the most personally, isn't the music, isn't anything
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:22.020]   else.
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:25.660]   It really is Apple turning over more cards about here is what third party apps on the
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:27.620]   watches are going to look like.
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:29.660]   Here's what we're going to allow people to do.
[01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:35.420]   We've heard about Apple giving direct access to sensors to enable another generation of
[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:36.420]   apps.
[01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:43.740]   But I'm looking at things like are people going to be able to create like their own complications?
[01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:46.180]   Are people going to be able to create their own watch faces?
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:50.940]   Are there going to be able to create apps that are a little bit more mass?
[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:56.100]   Muscular and not limited to just being a scrolling list of buttons or a scrolling list
[01:31:56.100 --> 01:32:02.460]   of things because it's the release of the watch is not yet complete.
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:07.500]   And I don't think that Apple watch will be complete until we see a good robust library
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:10.940]   of four real on device watch apps.
[01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:15.100]   And Apple of course for now they're using handoff to simply have interactivity between
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:16.940]   a phone app and a watch app.
[01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:21.220]   But we're not seeing people design things that are intrinsically designed for a watch
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:22.220]   yet.
[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:24.820]   So that's the stuff that I'm really, really interested in seeing.
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:30.380]   If we all stand up at 10 50, I think we should make the Apple watch salute when we do.
[01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:36.780]   Just say that's a bad idea because everybody has their everybody has it on their left
[01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:38.140]   on their left hands.
[01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:40.140]   That's a bad visual.
[01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:41.780]   Very bad visual.
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:42.780]   No real matter.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:47.540]   The new fascist salute is the Apple watch salute.
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:49.940]   Unless you put both of them on the arms of your little doggy.
[01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:51.100]   Are you still wearing two?
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:52.100]   You're not wearing two.
[01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:53.100]   Are you Renee really?
[01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:55.140]   I never wore two when I got the one that I ordered.
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:56.940]   I took off the one with the review unit.
[01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:58.140]   I canceled by the way.
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:03.260]   I really wanted that black one, but I couldn't justify buying the video.
[01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:04.820]   So I canceled.
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:06.260]   I'm both proud and disappointed.
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:07.260]   I know.
[01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:11.660]   So what you're saying is now you have $1,100 in the budget for a new Mac Pro.
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:13.900]   Yeah, or a new 5K iMac.
[01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:15.060]   That's what I would probably get.
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:16.060]   Yeah.
[01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:17.900]   What's funny to me is I fell asleep with my Apple watch on.
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:21.100]   I forgot to take it off and I woke up and it was at 47% still.
[01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:23.780]   And I think they drastically over delivered.
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:27.100]   So and I would Jeff Williams said that they're going to be showing off native apps, but my
[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:31.980]   concern level for what they can do with this thing.
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:34.460]   I think they have way more room to actually do it.
[01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:38.260]   It reminds me a bit of iOS 7 where they were so cautious about what they allowed access
[01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:40.980]   to for blur because blur was so hard in GPU.
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:43.300]   And then they just relaxed it over the next couple of months because it turned out to
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:44.300]   be fine.
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:47.180]   This might be the same thing where they knew a battery life was super important and they
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:50.220]   overshot it by so much that they'd be like, all right, cool.
[01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:51.220]   Just go ahead guys.
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:53.980]   Don't be dumb, but you know, here's the wider range of stuff.
[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:56.260]   Went to bed yesterday at the end of a long day.
[01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:57.260]   Did iOS today?
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:59.140]   So I showed the watch a lot.
[01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:00.140]   Used it a lot.
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:01.980]   75% left.
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:02.980]   It's nuts.
[01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:03.980]   Yeah.
[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:05.620]   It's like if you can, I agree with you, Renee.
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:10.860]   You can see, especially in just the design of the watch faces where it's okay.
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:14.860]   So every single watch face and every single piece of the user interface is black with
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:20.700]   a minimal piece of white on it as small as you can possibly make it so that you're lighting
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:24.220]   up as few of these OLED pixels as you possibly can.
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:29.260]   I'm hoping that Apple at some point says we're going to create in-house a really, really
[01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:30.460]   terrible watch face.
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:37.660]   That's just nothing but like old fashioned TV static and a cube and it picks our teapot,
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:40.300]   a cigarette teapot that's about rotating.
[01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:44.540]   Let's see how long this lasts and if we get 12 hours out of it, we will let people have
[01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:45.540]   fun watch faces.
[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:46.540]   Yeah.
[01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:50.620]   I would just like to see an ambient display and always on display as Android does where
[01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:53.820]   because it really is discuserting the watch goes completely black.
[01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:54.820]   So, so easily.
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:56.700]   For most apps, it'll leave like it'll leave the workout one on.
[01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:58.700]   It'll leave the Apple TV remote on.
[01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:01.740]   There's a couple that are exceptions, but it wants to make sure that you're doing something
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:05.500]   so active with your watch that it knows you're actually using and don't just forget about
[01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:06.500]   it.
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:07.500]   Right.
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.700]   You know, they wonder where the battery life went.
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:12.020]   Here's an interesting story.
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:17.060]   The new 15 inch MacBook supports 5K displays.
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:19.980]   Yeah, dual link sadly.
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:22.220]   Well, not surprisingly though, right?
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:26.020]   Because didn't we say the only reason you get a 5K display on the iMac is because of
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:29.700]   custom hardware and it's right there on the board and all of that.
[01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:31.220]   Custom timing controller that.
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:32.220]   Right.
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:36.220]   So, but the MacBook Pro will support, what does that mean dual link?
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:37.700]   When why is that a bad thing?
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:38.700]   It's not bad.
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:39.820]   I mean, I guess it depends.
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:40.820]   I haven't tried it.
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:41.820]   So, I can't personally render an opinion.
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:47.140]   I have used the old dual link DVI cables and basically one cable is half the display and
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:48.900]   the other cable carries the other half.
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:51.860]   And the concern when you have that is that if it's not perfectly done, you see you shearing
[01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:52.860]   down the middle.
[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:54.100]   So, you're moving it in one part of the screen.
[01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:57.100]   I have that on my 4K on my Mac Pro.
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:36:02.060]   Yeah, because some of the 4K is used to do that as well before the chipsets got to the
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:05.180]   point where they could drive even wide 4K easily.
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:07.580]   And that's the concern with this is because it's going through separate cables.
[01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:10.180]   You're never 100% sure that they're going to be totally in sync.
[01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:17.100]   John, what can we do with an old Mac Pro and a 4K display, just a 30 inch 4K display?
[01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:18.460]   We have somewhere to store it.
[01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:20.460]   We're going to put on a shelf.
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:23.340]   He says it is awesome.
[01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:24.340]   So this is good news though.
[01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:26.620]   If you've got the new MacBook, that's pretty cool.
[01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:31.620]   You get a nice 5K display running off of it or since nobody sells 5K.
[01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:32.620]   Does anybody sell 5K?
[01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:33.620]   Dell has a 5K display.
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:36.580]   But I think the price isn't that much different than the iMac itself.
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:39.820]   Yeah, you might as well just buy an iMac.
[01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:40.820]   Yeah, I'm more.
[01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:41.820]   Unless you really need two of them.
[01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:44.700]   I'm more and more convinced that I'm going to have to replace my Mac Pro with an iMac.
[01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:45.700]   It's kind of sad.
[01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:49.820]   You drop the low orbit on your enemies, Leo.
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:50.820]   It's like a bullet.
[01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:54.260]   Are there a lot of opinions on 5K versus 4K?
[01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:55.260]   It's nice.
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:59.540]   If you want to edit 4K video, it's nice to have your tools because I tried it online.
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:03.540]   And in Final Cut Pro, if you put a 4K video there, you still have room for your palettes,
[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:06.540]   which doesn't sound like much but really makes a huge difference compared to a 4K.
[01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:09.520]   Well, and I'll tell you the other reason that you want it.
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:13.580]   I mean, I'm just thinking in terms of if you have a 4K display, you have a standard display
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:17.580]   that you can basically use for the next at least five or six years.
[01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:22.780]   And that versus having a 1K display, plus let's say a 1080 display next to it, just
[01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:24.020]   for your palettes.
[01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:27.920]   So I'm trying to understand the advantage of having one 5K.
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:28.920]   The other...
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:29.920]   It's bigger, Andy.
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:30.920]   Bigger.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:31.920]   Bigger.
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:32.920]   Bigger.
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:33.920]   Bigger.
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:34.920]   Bigger.
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:35.920]   I want real estate, but the other advantage of 5K is the high DP.
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:37.920]   No, you're the host right now.
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:40.180]   Full-K, full-K, full-K, all the way up.
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:41.180]   All the way up.
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:42.180]   Where do you go?
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:43.180]   Nowhere.
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:49.460]   Because, you know, on my 4K, I run a high DPI, which turns it into a 1920 by 1080p display.
[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:53.220]   Everything's big, but if you have 5K, it wouldn't be quite so big.
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:56.340]   It looks like a regular iMac, but retina when you're running it.
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:57.340]   Which is glorious.
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:38:00.020]   So for high right now, Leo, in 5K, it looks glorious.
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:01.020]   So for...
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:03.700]   Well, actually, I bought the 5K for Lisa, so we have one at home.
[01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:04.700]   And I do like it.
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:06.520]   I've had enough time with it now that I...
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:07.680]   When she lets me use it.
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:09.640]   She also has a MacBook.
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:10.880]   The gold MacBook.
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:15.840]   She's really well-equipped.
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:16.840]   What else?
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:25.160]   Anything else before we move on Thunderbolt 3 is going to start using the Type-C USB connector.
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:26.160]   That's exciting.
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:27.160]   That's exciting.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.160]   Exactly.
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:29.160]   No.
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.360]   Can you imagine that, like, of all the things we talked about today, the thing that gets
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:35.400]   all three of us saying the same thing, one universal connector always goes past three
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:37.200]   cables, and that's it.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:38.200]   Isn't that great?
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:42.400]   Now, certainly there will be more than one port on all of our future laptops.
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:51.380]   40 gigabits per second over a USB-C connector using Thunderbolt.
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:56.040]   That's fast enough to do dual 4K 60Hz displays.
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:59.860]   That also gives you charging of up to 100 watts.
[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:05.200]   It also gives you DisplayPort USB, obviously, and PCI Express.
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:07.560]   So that is like all you need.
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:08.560]   That is nice.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:11.520]   All they really had to do with the MacBook is put another one on the other side.
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:14.960]   If they had just done that, there'd be no complaint at all.
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:15.960]   I don't know.
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:16.960]   They didn't do it, Leo.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:17.960]   I don't know why they didn't do it.
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:18.960]   Maybe they can't do it.
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:22.640]   It's a lot of circuitry or something.
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:23.640]   It seems like a beat.
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:27.200]   Oh, but it should be made clear that you won't just be able to get Thunderbolt.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:30.460]   That is a USB connector on the MacBook because it has USB 3.1.
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:31.460]   It's not a Thunderbolt connector.
[01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:32.460]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:33.460]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:34.460]   This would be a new...
[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:35.460]   I think it's listening.
[01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:37.460]   Yeah, a new...
[01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:40.780]   It's the same form factor, but a new connector, really.
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:42.860]   But the point is that if you...
[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:46.540]   It can just do so many different jobs in one single port.
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:51.980]   So especially if you have a laptop that has a mind blowing the idea of having more than
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:56.140]   one USB-C connector on it, the idea of you have one cable.
[01:39:56.140 --> 01:40:01.000]   If it's just a cheap $12 USB-C cable, it is a USB-C connector.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.320]   You don't have to have something special.
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:08.640]   But if you have a need for super high speed data connection, you can get a super expensive,
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.820]   super sophisticated optical cable that plugs into the exact same port and simply does different
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:14.780]   things when it's plugged into there.
[01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:15.780]   It really...
[01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:17.580]   Again, I'm embarrassing myself.
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:22.220]   I'm so excited about the idea of just packing for a trip where I've got one sort of cable
[01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:26.120]   for the laptop, one sort of cable for the card reader, one sort of cable for the phone.
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.120]   One sort of cable.
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:30.580]   It's like even last week at Google I/O, I was like, "You made...
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:35.020]   I'll be able to connect my tablet to my phone until my tablet to please...
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:39.620]   With a 100% battery, please charge the phone that only has 8% battery.
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:40.620]   Thank you, USB-C."
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:45.780]   So to clarify, in all likelihood, you won't see this until the Skylake chipset from Intel.
[01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:51.660]   That's the successor to Broadwell, which is just now kind of slowly getting into the
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:52.660]   market.
[01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:57.800]   And it is a Thunderbolt, not a USB chipset.
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:02.800]   So you'd have to have the updated chipset, the support from the CPU, from Skylake.
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:05.360]   It was a USB Type-C connector.
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.160]   It does give you USB-3.
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:08.400]   It does give you Thunderbolt.
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:12.920]   It gives you all the things that the current USB-C connector gives you.
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:15.400]   But it's Thunderbolt, not USB.
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:21.440]   But that's one of the nice things about how it's tied to the chipset.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:26.140]   All these manufacturers are going to start sort of giving away this for free because it
[01:41:26.140 --> 01:41:27.140]   would cost the money.
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:29.960]   It would almost be more expensive not to support this.
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:35.600]   It's the same reason why Apple had the only laptops that didn't have USB 3.0 until the
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.380]   time when suddenly all of them had it.
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:39.920]   It wasn't because they had a lot of debate of whether to support it or not.
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:43.880]   It was because they weren't using the chips that have USB 3.0 built into it.
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:49.100]   So it's four times the throughput of Thunderbolt 1 twice, the throughput of Thunderbolt 2.
[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:52.900]   It is four times the throughput of USB 3.1, which is what you've got right now on your
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:53.900]   Type-C connector.
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:55.900]   Boy, this looks great.
[01:41:55.900 --> 01:42:02.060]   And because it's an industry standard, I think this is the first one where you really
[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:05.580]   I feel like you really do have a shot at this one being universal.
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:10.180]   And you can carry a PC, and a Mac, and a Chromebook, and everything.
[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:12.540]   And same cables.
[01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:13.540]   This is great.
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:14.540]   This is exciting.
[01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:17.260]   Boy, imagine the docking capabilities, right?
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:21.820]   It would blow my mind if Apple decided to make USB-C connector standard on iPhones.
[01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:23.340]   I don't know if that'll happen.
[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:24.860]   Google says it's going to.
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:25.860]   Yeah.
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:27.500]   I mean, it would blow my mind if they did that.
[01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:28.820]   It would be lovely if it did.
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:29.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:34.260]   Oh, well, I can so encourage by the fact that they put it on the MacBook.
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:35.580]   I think it might even be possible.
[01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:39.180]   But it is the case that I think Google really pretty much said that's going to be the new
[01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:42.700]   connector for Android in a year, maybe.
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:44.940]   And that's going to drive us to market.
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:46.500]   And I have a feeling I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:49.100]   I mean, if they put it on the MacBook, why wouldn't they?
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:52.900]   Also, I mean, Apple's not an Apple's not a spiteful company.
[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:58.180]   The reasons why they have not used a micro-zero-sick Samsung.
[01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:00.420]   No, no, no, that's that's that's different.
[01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:04.380]   They Apple felt legitimately injured and they needed to correct what they thought that was
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:05.380]   an injury.
[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:08.860]   But I'm saying that they wouldn't they wouldn't keep lightning because they feel as though
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:11.660]   we don't want to adopt the standard that it's popular elsewhere.
[01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:13.380]   We want to retain some of this proprietary.
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:15.580]   We want to sell a lot of these proprietary cables.
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:19.300]   The reasons why they went to lightning is because it did things that micro USB did not
[01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:20.620]   do very well.
[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:24.980]   Or you could see on a lot of Android devices that, hey, look, you can we have our own HDMI
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:29.580]   adapter, the plugs in through the micro USB port, but it wasn't based on a standard.
[01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:33.380]   When you present Apple with a standard that they themselves had a hand in developing,
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:36.820]   that gives them all the connectivity that they want to have in both their phones and
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:39.020]   their tablets and their laptops.
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:44.940]   Unless there are other reasons that are not publicly known, it becomes a thing of are we
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:48.780]   would we like to physically design our hardware with these connectors?
[01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:53.540]   Or are there still some limit some physical limitations to USB-C that prevent us from
[01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:55.780]   making the sort of devices that we want to make?
[01:43:55.780 --> 01:43:57.820]   So they wouldn't do it simply just to be different.
[01:43:57.820 --> 01:43:59.620]   They would just do they would do it.
[01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:02.380]   They would do it because there was an actual good reason to do it.
[01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:06.420]   This is how you put the light to the idea that Apple does it because they're proprietary
[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:10.020]   and they can license them and they that you know they could do it because they make money
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:12.460]   as opposed to there's an upshot to this.
[01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:13.700]   But there's always an engine there.
[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:18.140]   There's almost at least I'm always been aware of an engineering reason why they did something
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:20.220]   and when they went through a direction.
[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:24.580]   It's not possible to imagine a world where the MacBook might have had a lightning port
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:29.980]   at some point and it was determined that the compatibility, the advantage of having a standard
[01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:35.740]   connector on there that did very similar if not identical things far outweighed the advantages
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:39.660]   of lightning which there still are a few technical things that lightning does that that USB-C
[01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:40.660]   doesn't.
[01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:42.820]   That same equation would get run on an iPhone.
[01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:46.140]   It would say what is the advantages we have especially as we're moving like they said with
[01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:50.220]   the MacBook to a more wireless world of having the ability to do all the dynamic things that
[01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:54.580]   we're doing with the lightning connector and to transiting the kind of information data
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:55.900]   we want to transit.
[01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:59.220]   Do we still need to do that and if we don't what are the advantages of having a connector
[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:04.580]   that's ubiquitous that peripheral makers are going to do things for other devices with.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:10.300]   And it's Tandy's point it's a very simple formula sometimes to the pros outweigh the
[01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:11.300]   cons.
[01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:19.700]   It's going to be fun imagining even myself if I had owned the new MacBook I would be in
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:26.980]   a position where my full-sized, my phone takes Mac or USB, my tablet is a third generation
[01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:32.660]   iPad that takes the old style 30 pin docking connector and my notebook needs the USB-C
[01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:38.380]   connector so it'd be like I can't wait for 2016 or 2017 because my life has gotten very
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:39.380]   complicated.
[01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:41.220]   Too many cables.
[01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:42.220]   It'll be nice.
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:45.100]   What a world we'll have.
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:52.460]   Skylake Keith 512 in our charm says is probably July, August so it's not so far off so it's
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:59.780]   conceivable that this time next year we'll be talking about type C connectors on a variety
[01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:00.780]   of Apple stuff.
[01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:03.540]   I believe in Telwyn they ship now it's my only.
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:07.780]   Yeah they say they overstated that Broadwell as well didn't they as we're still.
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:11.060]   Well I believe that Skylake is on time because Broadwell the die shrink was the hard part
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:14.460]   and the architecture change will be faster but it just question the question is are they
[01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:18.060]   willing to eat Broadwell to get Skylake to market when they said they would or are they
[01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:20.700]   going to push Skylake out to try to make money off.
[01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:22.700]   Right right right right.
[01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:27.780]   Anything else to talk about before we take a break and get your picks of the week?
[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:32.220]   All right going going.
[01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:37.460]   Are sure they brought to you by Linda.com a great place if you know I think human beings
[01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:43.620]   I think if you were to describe us in two words we are learning machines.
[01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:47.700]   I think it's a natural thing people love to learn kids love to learn until it's beat out
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:49.140]   of them.
[01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:53.740]   Learning is exciting it's fun learning something new whatever age you are it's more than that
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:57.140]   it's it's valuable and that's why we love Linda.

[01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:30.220]   Linda.com has just launched a new weekly series the DIY photographer Joseph Laneschke teaches
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:34.460]   it take a look at the first installment he teaches you how to make your own macro lens
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:41.580]   for a few bucks that is that you look at that what is that cop paper.
[01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:47.420]   There's also new courses in exploring photography exposure and dynamic range creating panoramas
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:51.900]   with Lightroom and of course we've many of us upgraded to the new Lightroom six and Lightroom
[01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:57.460]   CC the essential training is always great this is one of the things that's I think Linda
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:02.460]   does so well they work deals with companies like Adobe to make sure that they have training
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:08.580]   the day the new software comes out when it whether it's a you know Photoshop or Final
[01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:12.260]   Cut you can get the training you need right away and that's really when you need it when
[01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:17.820]   the new Lightroom came out it was like what and it was so great to be able to go to Linda.com

[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:34.700]   savers we had her out many times talking about web design things like that she'd written
[01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:42.060]   the books on web design and now she's what she just sold that Linda.com has been around
[01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:48.380]   for more than 10 years she just sold it to LinkedIn for billions and for you Linda you
[01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:53.620]   can come get me in your private jet anytime I'll go I'll just let me know when you're
[01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:59.780]   coming we just lost Andy other is he's back either hey there what about your pick of
[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:07.140]   the week mr Andy can I go one of the announcements from Google I owe that reflects a couple of
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:12.860]   announcements from Google I have reflected our of interest to Apple people one of them
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:17.500]   is Google photos but we don't have time for 90 minute fight about trusting all your photos
[01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:23.740]   to Google I love Google I just want to say love Google photos I think I think it's great
[01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:28.100]   to it's you need you need to have a discussion about whether you want to put all of your
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:33.940]   photos in the hands of a company that is an advertising company I'm okay with it not a
[01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:38.580]   lot of people not some people aren't I just think that if you aren't comfortable with
[01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:42.460]   that make sure you understand the reasons why you're not comfortable with that and it's
[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:47.060]   possible that you're turned around on that issue but I respect people who just don't
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:54.780]   want that to be it's a cool I certainly yeah I mean I'll tell you but okay maybe okay
[01:50:54.780 --> 01:51:01.420]   maybe it's gonna hurt Apple because frankly it does it's not only has the same name actually
[01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:04.460]   I'm curious what's we didn't talk about it we should have terrible search terms for
[01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:07.460]   anybody though if you try to find information on either of those apps it's the most possible
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:12.580]   yeah well it's pretty generic but it does all the things it seems to do most of the
[01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:18.460]   things Apple's photos does only better or my wrong it I wouldn't I wouldn't say that because
[01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:23.380]   you're not you're not storing your photos in the original format the original quality
[01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:28.540]   it's marginally down we're talking about if you're using the free service also the editing
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:33.500]   tools for Apple photos are amazing they're much more fine-grained and they're much more
[01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:37.220]   specific yeah I'm a little disappointed because Google has the capability in fact Google Plus
[01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:41.500]   had better editing tools than they put in here I think those are coming but it's a server
[01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:44.900]   right exactly this is a I've been speaking to a lot of people at Google who work on this
[01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:49.140]   and there are a lot of cool things are coming about it but the coolest thing about it I
[01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:54.260]   basically had the stack of like SD cards from every every photo I've shot over the past
[01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:58.260]   like three months so I had like thousands of photos that decided okay well I won't trust
[01:51:58.260 --> 01:52:02.340]   my main library to it yet until I see what it does but so now I've spent the weekend putting
[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:07.700]   like 6,000 photos on it and then the most fun thing is a when it decides to do cool things
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:12.860]   like it finds animations and finds ways to do HDR and finds ways to organize things into
[01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:20.620]   albums but also the depth of its machine learning for figuring analyzing your photos and understanding
[01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:25.100]   what's in them the first time you click into the first time I clicked into search and I
[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:31.380]   just think about the woman in blue and it's amazing photo in my collection of a woman
[01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:36.780]   wearing a blue shirt in the snow I mean I did I did well let me tell you the let me tell
[01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:42.060]   you the the corker for me I just said okay how about cosplay and it found wow hundreds
[01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:47.580]   and hundreds of new cosplay not only not only that but then I said I saw one photo in there
[01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:52.980]   so I said okay clear the search halo and it found the picture of two people dressed as
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:59.300]   master chief man I read downloaded that photo to make sure that no I did I tag that did I
[01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:06.140]   put it something in there and it's like oh my god this is amazing so it's it's worth like
[01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:10.700]   I said I respect people who don't have that level of trust with Google for me it comes
[01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:15.140]   down to two points I don't yes they they're an advertising company but it's in their best
[01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:19.780]   interest not to sell you're actual information to anybody that there's they're just selling
[01:53:19.780 --> 01:53:25.620]   a position of ads to you and secondly if you are really really upset about your personal
[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:32.580]   information being trusted to a large company you're you're you're kind of making a an empty
[01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:38.820]   gesture unless you are telling me that you you run the ghostry plug-in on your on all
[01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:43.340]   your browsers you're running your DNS and all your mobile devices is through an anonymizer
[01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:48.260]   or you're running tour browser because frankly you're you're I feel it my personally feel
[01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:53.620]   that I'm under way way bigger threat from ad trackers and and beacons that are on every
[01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:58.620]   single webpage than I am from Google but again that's a personal opinion I respect people
[01:53:58.620 --> 01:54:03.220]   it trust is a hard thing to really explain I don't pretend I don't use Instagram I don't
[01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:07.820]   use Facebook because I just don't I get an icky feeling when I use Facebook and so I respect
[01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:12.180]   people who have that same feeling about Google but I think I do think that photos they're
[01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:17.580]   really onto something and it's gonna get even better and better and also as there's so
[01:54:17.580 --> 01:54:22.300]   many good things about Apple photos one bad thing is how much they charge for storage
[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:27.340]   and one of the great things about the service is the simple idea that look take every single
[01:54:27.340 --> 01:54:31.980]   photo you ever take and upload it to the service it is always going to excuse me not always
[01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:36.180]   going to be free but at least for now for the foreseeable future there will never be any
[01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:42.300]   charge to upload photos if we are allowed to down sample them to 16 16 megapixels and put
[01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:45.820]   a little bit more compression on them to make them a little bit more portable but the difference
[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:49.940]   between having to select which photos you want to upload to the cloud and simply saying
[01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:54.940]   that every photo I ever take always gets uploaded to this cloud and will always be available
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:59.660]   to me on every single device I have whether it's an Apple device whether it's a whether
[01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:04.260]   it's an Android device doesn't matter what it is it will always be available to me is
[01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:09.980]   a pretty solid feature I downloaded the Macintosh a downloader and it's been uploading I have
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:15.340]   40 almost 40,000 images it's been uploading them I'm gonna have every picture every digital
[01:55:15.340 --> 01:55:21.540]   photo I ever took is gonna be here it's such a fun game too because it's it understands
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:26.940]   what's in the picture and also particularly if you're taking pictures of like known landmarks
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:31.700]   so it's a for instance of course I took hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pictures at the
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:37.620]   Yosemite conference with that certainty was that as well and so it would automatically
[01:55:37.620 --> 01:55:43.420]   tag every single photo that was of a known landmark in there so half if it had half
[01:55:43.420 --> 01:55:47.460]   dome in it if it had Yosemite Falls and it was automatically tagged stuff however that
[01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:53.820]   was maybe private like sessions inside the lodge inside the auditorium those weren't automatically
[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:59.860]   tagged but even then it took a it took a nice sequence of like at the after party people
[01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:03.780]   behind the microphone like singing and dancing and automatically turn make made of looping
[01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:08.500]   GIF of like people dancing behind the microphone like oh that's a lovely thing that I would
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:13.820]   never bother to create myself thank you Google photos I love the stories which has always
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:20.100]   been a part of Google plus but now you can create your own stories using you know the
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:24.820]   pictures that are on there I mean they just you do it's such a big feature do nothing we
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:29.700]   will automatically the service will automatically find albums for you will automatically organize
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:33.900]   and it doesn't tag things but it makes it very easy to locate things later the other
[01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:38.900]   the last like Gee was feature and this was it was part of the demo and it was so jaw
[01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:45.260]   dropping that I had to reach out to people I know who work in photos at Google to ask
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:53.300]   to clarify did this are you saying that Google photos automatically in the same the the
[01:56:53.300 --> 01:56:58.740]   collection of one hundred thousand photos had a picture of a newborn infant who looked to
[01:56:58.740 --> 01:57:03.580]   be about a day old and an eight year old girl and it figured out that these are the same
[01:57:03.580 --> 01:57:08.180]   two pieces that's amazing that was and yes that's exactly how it happens matter of fact
[01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:13.060]   here is here is a screenshot from my own image library of you can see like my son growing
[01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:20.420]   up over the past six or seven years I'm like that is amazing yeah it just again just the
[01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:24.900]   ability show me show me pictures of this person and this person is your son and now you can
[01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:31.060]   just sort of start crying because it's oh look he's growing older and try to remember
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:37.380]   those times it's a and the kids in the cradle and the students and you don't even have kids
[01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:41.420]   when the story and the story is about how dad like won't come out and play with his son
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:45.060]   because he's too busy experimenting with Google photos yeah son do you automatically
[01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:50.140]   tag these things but my little name is that you know one of the blessings that came up
[01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:55.180]   with this is it went through my pictures of my son Henry and one of the pictures it came
[01:57:55.180 --> 01:58:00.140]   up with was a video I'd shot a long time ago of Henry at the age of seven reading to me
[01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:05.140]   for the first time and I'd forgotten I even had that video and the fact that it came up
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:12.380]   with that was if that's all it ever did yeah it's it's it's we talk about really sophisticated
[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:16.900]   features like matching faces and sophisticated features that are coming to iOS but some of
[01:58:16.900 --> 01:58:21.180]   these some of the biggest leverages come from the simplest things like no don't even bother
[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:25.060]   trying to figure out if this is worth uploading or not if there's a device you have that has
[01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:29.780]   pictures on it there's a CDR if there's a backpack flashcard anything uploaded it will
[01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:34.180]   never it will not cost you more money to add more files to this and then it's it's exactly
[01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:40.100]   as you say there are pictures that that's it unearthed for me or it's surfered for surface
[01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:45.420]   for me that I forgot that I had and so I'm not sure if I'm at the point yet where I'll
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:50.380]   take it's less a trust issue than an effort issue of going through the suitcase of hard
[01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:56.380]   drives and uploading everything to it but it's when you when you think about how difficult
[01:58:56.380 --> 01:59:02.020]   it was when a friend of mine passed away and there and someone was asking for it you have
[01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:06.940]   old photos of your friend at these parties it was like going through this suitcase and
[01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:09.860]   because I knew that I knew that there was a really great picture I couldn't find it and
[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:13.940]   I had a go search and search and search and search for it and the if I had simply been
[01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:19.220]   uploading things as I go it would be there automatically it was a it was it was it's
[01:59:19.220 --> 01:59:24.380]   a pretty cool pretty cool feature Google also churns the old photos so stuff that I was
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:28.180]   taken so long ago that I never made an auto awesome out of it or a collection out of it
[01:59:28.180 --> 01:59:33.740]   it's going back through time and making auto awesomes of pictures I took years ago which
[01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:39.860]   is the computational power storage is one thing I mean the amount of storage they must
[01:59:39.860 --> 01:59:45.660]   be dedicating this is one thing but the computational power they're putting in this I can only imagine
[01:59:45.660 --> 01:59:51.740]   I started I was a little bit disappointed because it had only tagged it only identified
[01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:55.620]   like maybe a dozen faces when I say identify faces it doesn't know who these people are
[01:59:55.620 --> 02:00:00.500]   it's right face matching it's not face identification and so I gee that's weird and and was doing
[02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:08.500]   weird things like here is I take a picture in November of on my on my android where watch
[02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:13.860]   there was a there was a new story that involved a picture of Steve Jobs and Bono and so that
[02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:17.460]   picture was on my android right my round android where watch I thought that was fine
[02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:21.980]   I took a picture of it so it it had broken that out and so here's Steve Jobs is a recognized
[02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:27.660]   face amongst the 12 of it found but it's pretty fun again I I taken at this conference and
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:32.260]   Yosemite it's like I've got like 23 pictures in sequence just holding down the shutter
[02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:36.380]   button of serenity talking like you didn't decide that of these 23 beautiful pictures
[02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:42.020]   of like portrait like you didn't break her out as a different person but then it made
[02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:46.780]   me appreciate how much crunching of numbers is doing because it took a day or two for
[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:51.420]   everything to really fully populate right and and it's it's kind of it's kind of fun
[02:00:51.420 --> 02:00:55.740]   it is like having a personal assistant who's you've tasked to the job of here is every
[02:00:55.740 --> 02:01:00.460]   single photo that I have and I need you to organize them into like logical albums and
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:05.180]   like do HDR and some of them because if you have notifications turned on for the app you
[02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:09.380]   will occasionally get like a message on your watch saying hey we have just a Google photos
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:14.660]   has just created a new album Yosemite 2015 or he has a new album trip to Boston April
[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:19.700]   of 2013 I'm like okay thank thank you Google photos I'm actually I'm actually having dinner
[02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:23.100]   right now but thank you I'm glad you're working very hard for the money I'm not paying you
[02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:29.820]   it's funny I just scanning through these this I was looking for this photo for months
[02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:35.820]   I just found it thank you Google thank you again Google for so that's free it is on iOS
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:40.940]   for the first time it's been on Android for some time it is partly Google I owe a Google
[02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:45.140]   Plus but some of the features the editing features in Google Plus are gone for some reason
[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:49.180]   I don't know completely why I'm sure they'll come back that's actually one of the advantages
[02:01:49.180 --> 02:01:53.260]   of this they essentially one of the bad moves that Google made a few years ago with Google
[02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:57.220]   Plus was essentially saying okay we've got a photo management service but if you want
[02:01:57.220 --> 02:01:59.780]   to use that you're going to have to have a Google Plus account you're going to have
[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:04.780]   to attach it to this whereas you don't have to they've broken all of those old features
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:08.420]   out of Google Plus they've added a whole bunch of brand new ones so you don't have
[02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:14.620]   to have a Google Plus account and also there is such a deep and profound sense that you
[02:02:14.620 --> 02:02:20.500]   are not uploading your photos into a social media service and keeping them private you
[02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:24.980]   are simply putting them in a shoe box yeah that is not connected to any market you know
[02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:31.100]   yeah exactly and if you choose to selectively post send some of these pictures to Twitter
[02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:35.820]   to Facebook to Google Plus to whatever you can do that but as you're working with your
[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:39.820]   collection you are not in any way thinking if I press the wrong button I'm going to publish
[02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:44.220]   all of these to my Twitter feeder to my to my Flickr account so I'm very very happy with
[02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:48.500]   it so far and as I say because it's a service and more than that because it's a Google
[02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:53.100]   service you can pretty much expect that in the coming months and the next year or so they're
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:58.180]   going to be even more services more more features added to it and you'll get more notifications
[02:02:58.180 --> 02:03:03.900]   saying that we have I've created a 3D immersive environment because you you took enough pictures
[02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:09.860]   inside this birthday party that was able to create a actual 3D map of the living room
[02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:13.620]   where you had the birthday cake so if you want to put on if you want to put in your
[02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:19.980]   your Oculus Rift goggles right now you can walk around that room I'm sure that's coming
[02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:24.420]   up with this this is a a picture's several pictures of Alex Lindsey and obviously if you
[02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:29.700]   look at this picture well you know that's easy to figure out that's Alex Lindsey but really
[02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:35.140]   Google knew that that was Alex Lindsey I don't know how it's a little bit scary in fairness
[02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:40.100]   so did you Leo well I did but I'm a human that's easy for me it's a lot and really they
[02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:46.420]   thought this was Alex Lindsey I'm impressed I'm impressed good with it the other fun part
[02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:49.900]   is that of course I did a search for beard and of course there's 40 pictures of Jim Dalrypl
[02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:58.500]   okay that's okay well that was easy anybody can anybody can see anybody can see that's
[02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:05.540]   really funny serenity what is your pick of the week oh let's see do you have one you don't
[02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:15.180]   have to have it on my pick of the week you named your lamp pick of the week I did that's
[02:04:15.180 --> 02:04:21.260]   funny well while Andy was waxing poetic about photos I love it yeah so the you know what
[02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:26.260]   I was I was really skeptical about the cassette of wireless when I picked it up in store this
[02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:30.620]   morning because the box is a little crunchy and I'm a little skeptical about home automation
[02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:40.140]   services that don't start with we and with Mo yeah I actually I really like this so far
[02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:43.660]   setting up with sitting setting it up with my router was easy setting it up with Siri is
[02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:47.820]   easy and if it does in fact work with nest which it seems to imply that it might I'm
[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:51.940]   going to go out to Home Depot and actually buy one for the house today and test it works
[02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:58.260]   with nest then it that it is officially my my awesome I'm good savior nice I'm I'm pretty
[02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:03.660]   psyched about it and it wasn't that expensive I think it was like 224 to 2 plug-in light
[02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:07.620]   switches so you can theoretically wire up two rooms of your house with just the starter
[02:05:07.620 --> 02:05:15.900]   kit lutrons caseta C.I.S. cassette the wireless T. Hey look Andy if I was looking for pictures
[02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:21.500]   of Andy and Akko and Google made a nice little here's a little little animated gift of you
[02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:25.340]   dancing
[02:05:25.340 --> 02:05:29.140]   a little background
[02:05:29.140 --> 02:05:34.100]   Renee Richie you got something for us absolutely I have two things one is is for developers
[02:05:34.100 --> 02:05:37.300]   it's called app figures app figures has been a service has been around for a long time but
[02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:41.420]   they just launched their app and typically I was I wouldn't make like a developer it basically
[02:05:41.420 --> 02:05:45.380]   lets you track how well your apps are doing in the app store and I wouldn't typically make
[02:05:45.380 --> 02:05:50.060]   that a Mac break pick but what I liked about this is it's just it's so delightful I had
[02:05:50.060 --> 02:05:54.860]   a chance to try the beta and I wasn't expecting like I knew it would be like a good crunchy
[02:05:54.860 --> 02:05:59.140]   developer app but I wasn't expecting to be delighted by it and it was a big surprise to
[02:05:59.140 --> 02:06:03.140]   me and it reminded me of something Lauren Bricter of Tweety and letterpress fame said
[02:06:03.140 --> 02:06:08.220]   that when we transition to sort of this modern design all the skeomorphism went into the physics
[02:06:08.220 --> 02:06:12.100]   and the animation and this was the same I touched something and it bounced and it moved
[02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:16.820]   and it and it it drank and it expanded and it was just momentary it never gotten away
[02:06:16.820 --> 02:06:21.300]   oh it never made the app feel slow but it made the app visually interesting to me in
[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:26.020]   a way that didn't involve wood or green felt and just that sort of thoughtfulness in an
[02:06:26.020 --> 02:06:31.660]   app that could otherwise come across as a database or a spreadsheet gave me a lot of
[02:06:31.660 --> 02:06:37.260]   hope for the field of apps in general because I think for a while people weren't sure what
[02:06:37.260 --> 02:06:42.620]   to do and sometimes sometimes very flat design became very monotonous design and if you can
[02:06:42.620 --> 02:06:46.980]   take basically a spreadsheet of app results and delight me I thought that was hugely
[02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:51.340]   impressive so if you are a developer and you do track your apps in the app store absolutely
[02:06:51.340 --> 02:06:56.580]   check out app figures go to the website download the app they have a demo mode so I don't have
[02:06:56.580 --> 02:07:00.340]   an app I could put in so I just hit the demo mode and played around with it and more apps
[02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:06.780]   like this please I agree have you guys you guys are familiar with vunderlist yeah yes
[02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:10.500]   and vunderlist which is you know it's fine it's ironic because I've used them all any
[02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:16.340]   do and Gina Trapani's to do that text I've gone through remember the milk every gym membership
[02:07:16.340 --> 02:07:21.060]   Leo to do after the gym membership to the app store I have them all but I finally set
[02:07:21.060 --> 02:07:26.700]   it settled on a wonder list because it works on iOS it works on Android I even it even works
[02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:33.100]   on my Google Chrome when I put a new tab in wonder list puts my to-do list up on the
[02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:40.740]   blank page which is a very handy just for my don't forget which is great well Microsoft
[02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:46.060]   bought them I'm not sure that's a great thing but it is probably a good time to down
[02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:49.780]   they you know what they bought a comply and they've turned it into outlook for iOS and
[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:55.180]   it's great it bought sunrise they bought sunrise my favorite calendaring app you imagine Microsoft
[02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:59.580]   buying other people's out like this whole world is topsy different places isn't it and
[02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:06.700]   in fact it's funny because they had just added integration with wonder list vunderlist into
[02:08:06.700 --> 02:08:11.580]   sunrise so I don't know if that's a coincidence or what but but my not to-do list now ends
[02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:16.140]   up in my calendar very elegantly wonder list will sync with Google my Google tasks and
[02:08:16.140 --> 02:08:21.780]   other tasks if you get make an account for free I don't there's paid accounts but I haven't
[02:08:21.780 --> 02:08:26.380]   ever paid for it and I just love it you can delegate you can do all sorts of things with
[02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:32.620]   it works with the Apple watch as well so it's it's in it's in the news newsworthy but I have
[02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:38.900]   to say I've been using wonder list now for a while it is is from six Wunderkins which
[02:08:38.900 --> 02:08:43.540]   is a Berlin developer group that was bought by Microsoft I have to think you probably
[02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:49.700]   supposed to pronounce it Wunderlist but I'm gonna call it wonder list because it's amazing
[02:08:49.700 --> 02:08:54.020]   it's like again like you we're talking about photos by Google that works great on iOS and
[02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:57.820]   we're talking about apps for Microsoft that work great on iOS and it again to me it's
[02:08:57.820 --> 02:09:01.580]   one of the huge advantages of the system is that because of its popularity but also because
[02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:05.820]   of the kind of users it has everybody wants to make apps for it and you can like I'm like
[02:09:05.820 --> 02:09:09.500]   Andy I would never upload anything to Facebook or Google plus because by definition their
[02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:13.540]   social networks and I prefer those things to be siloed and I'm glad that you know Google's
[02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:17.860]   making a product that siloed I was joking around saying that I don't care about the privacy
[02:09:17.860 --> 02:09:22.340]   it's the idea that they showed that Google driverless car thing and how the machine learning
[02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:25.540]   and the neural network which is always a scary term when I saw it when I hear it because
[02:09:25.540 --> 02:09:29.500]   of Terminator but it can start recognizing all this stuff because of the machine learning
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:33.460]   because of the vast amounts of data I don't like the idea of Boston dynamic robots tying
[02:09:33.460 --> 02:09:38.700]   into it maybe but the idea that just all the well I saw X Machina last week and one of
[02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:42.820]   the and without any spoilers the basically the guy manages to teach facial expressions
[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:46.500]   by by just putting massive amounts of data about human facial expression and that's what
[02:09:46.500 --> 02:09:51.060]   you need to get a machine to anything you need incredible amounts of data and even if
[02:09:51.060 --> 02:09:54.980]   you know people say like your photos are safe Google's the ancillary benefits of incredible
[02:09:54.980 --> 02:09:58.220]   amounts of data and all their systems get better the same way Siri gets better the more
[02:09:58.220 --> 02:10:03.220]   voice data uses it so it's beneficial to Google they're giving us away for free but they get
[02:10:03.220 --> 02:10:07.660]   huge machine learning benefits and if they want to be the Star Trek computer they need
[02:10:07.660 --> 02:10:12.380]   they're gonna need massive and massive amounts of data so they're they're learning all these
[02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:16.780]   faces they can recognize Alex Lindsey from the angle making a funny face with bug eyes because
[02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:20.540]   of all the data they're crunching and they're uniquely positioned to do that kind of thing
[02:10:20.540 --> 02:10:23.820]   I understand if you object to that you know everything is a pro and cons some people object
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:28.300]   to giving Apple money for RAM and everyone can make those choices but I think it's super
[02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:31.980]   interesting that we have access to all these options we can pick exactly the one that has
[02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:37.300]   the best drawback to benefit ratio for us personally yeah I mean that's that's a great
[02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:43.220]   strength and it also points out that every single company I think sincerely talks about
[02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:47.660]   the good that they think they can do for the entire world and that's not marketing it's
[02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:51.700]   useful for marketing but it is a sincerely held belief and all that all these companies
[02:10:51.700 --> 02:10:56.700]   that are transacting at such a high level and so it's important to understand that but
[02:10:56.700 --> 02:11:02.460]   it's also important to understand that almost no companies will articulate their vision of
[02:11:02.460 --> 02:11:06.900]   improving the world in a way that shoots themselves in the foot so Google will give
[02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:11.340]   away this service in such a way that Google will support every single service phone that's
[02:11:11.340 --> 02:11:15.860]   out there because it's in their best interest to do so to put to keep people playing playing
[02:11:15.860 --> 02:11:23.300]   Google as much as they can in the same way that Apple values security and privacy but
[02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:27.340]   because they have absolutely no financial interest it's not part of their business plan
[02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:32.420]   the part of their business plan is keeping you back to buy a new premium 40% margin device
[02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:37.580]   every year every two years which is so as iPhone users you have the great advantage
[02:11:37.580 --> 02:11:41.460]   that everybody wants to make sure that their service is compatible with your device but
[02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:46.300]   it also means that if you do decide to invest in a service that Apple runs you ain't never
[02:11:46.300 --> 02:11:51.180]   getting those photos off of a device that has an Apple logo so if you want to switch to
[02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:55.460]   a different kind of phone next year or different kind of laptop next year that's going to be
[02:11:55.460 --> 02:12:00.860]   a really big problem so it's there's so much calculus to think about whenever you're
[02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:05.860]   thinking about making a long-term commitment to any piece of hardware or any piece of software
[02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:07.260]   or any service.
[02:12:07.260 --> 02:12:12.180]   I just did a backup so I have on my Mac because I have on godly amounts of storage I just
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:16.420]   keep all the originals and that goes into the photos library gets backed up to time machine
[02:12:16.420 --> 02:12:20.460]   and I'll just point that at Google Photos when I want to try it and do a mass upload
[02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:23.860]   because I figure Google is going to be smart enough to not care what the file names are.
[02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:25.740]   Maybe not maybe they do.
[02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:27.260]   The fact that I might.
[02:12:27.260 --> 02:12:28.260]   X973.5.
[02:12:28.260 --> 02:12:29.260]   See exactly.
[02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:32.540]   It's all metadata babies.
[02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:36.020]   If Facebook had this service like I would upload like just a hundred photos and the next
[02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:38.300]   day I get a little pop up when I lock in.
[02:12:38.300 --> 02:12:41.500]   Now what is your relationship with P104471?
[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:44.980]   We think you went to high school together and then West Penobscot High School.
[02:12:44.980 --> 02:12:49.300]   You just confirmed that you went to West Penobscot High School with P104418?
[02:12:49.300 --> 02:12:50.740]   That would be funny.
[02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:55.740]   Maybe the folks at Bradley Horowitz in charge of Google Plus in an interview with Steven
[02:12:55.740 --> 02:12:58.780]   Levy gave an example of what they might do with photos.
[02:12:58.780 --> 02:13:03.860]   She said right now we don't share it but not to say we might never do that.
[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:08.700]   What if for instance we could determine from your pictures that you own a Tesla Tesla were
[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:13.860]   to issue a recall wouldn't it be cool if you had a Google now card that said hey you might
[02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:16.860]   want to check with Tesla your car is being recalled.
[02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:22.660]   Steve Gibson says this really well that it's not just the company now but once you give
[02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:25.780]   it your data it's the company five years from now ten years from now fifty years ago because
[02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:27.460]   that data is not coming back.
[02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:30.340]   They can have my data is nothing special about it.
[02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:32.380]   That's a different issue.
[02:13:32.380 --> 02:13:37.940]   That's certainly a valuable issue for Radio Shack where Radio Shack had promised that well
[02:13:37.940 --> 02:13:42.980]   look yes you're giving us your location information when you buy a pack of batteries but we will
[02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:47.180]   hold your information and evolve until they go out of business and now there's all these
[02:13:47.180 --> 02:13:51.060]   really valuable customer contacts that are not part of the assets of the company and
[02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:56.940]   now AT&T and these believe it or not you have these wireless carriers that are in the unusual
[02:13:56.940 --> 02:14:01.460]   position of telling people you can't do this to screw over our customers because only we
[02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:09.780]   get to screw over our customers but it's part of the we're getting like a two-hour discussion
[02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:14.060]   so I'm sorry I'll cut this off quickly but that's also another reason why I have less
[02:14:14.060 --> 02:14:19.820]   of a problem with Google than with other companies that Google if I wind up living in
[02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:23.900]   a world in which Google is out of business or so desperate that they need to start you
[02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:28.500]   know melting down armchairs for base metal to sell at this scrapyard.
[02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:34.100]   I think I got a bigger problem than rather than for society as a whole I it's like well
[02:14:34.100 --> 02:14:39.380]   I have to learn how to like shoot birds with a bow and arrow for food because that's where
[02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:43.580]   the it's not like intentional stuff it's the accidents like when when Google buzz would
[02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:46.540]   give your location to everyone with Gmail so like for me it's not I don't think Google
[02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:49.820]   will ever do anything wrong but when you have access and the same thing for Apple I don't
[02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:53.300]   know about Apple in two or five years either the more the more of my stuff they have the
[02:14:53.300 --> 02:14:56.540]   greater the chance that I will be affected by any accident or dumb decision that they
[02:14:56.540 --> 02:14:57.540]   make.
[02:14:57.540 --> 02:15:01.140]   Yeah absolutely that's why the like the second thing I did after after uploading all this
[02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:05.500]   sort of stuff there was no personal stuff and any of the photos from the memory cards but
[02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:10.300]   of course I had it on my my Android phone and I had it on my iPad and so their pictures
[02:15:10.300 --> 02:15:13.340]   on there and but not we're not talking about things that would embarrass me if they were
[02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:18.500]   got out but you know you don't you don't if I need to take a if I need to make a record
[02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:23.620]   of a piece of correspondence or if I'm just simply at a friend's house and my friend maybe
[02:15:23.620 --> 02:15:28.500]   did not want to this this photo be anywhere in the cloud so they were like maybe 40 pictures
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:32.620]   that I deleted out of the out of the out of the place for exactly the reason that you
[02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:37.140]   mentioned because accidents can happen and this is a brand Apple and Google's been in
[02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:40.580]   the photo business for a long time but this is a brand new rollout of a service so you're
[02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:45.580]   just waiting you maybe it might be smart as much as we're talking positively about Google
[02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:50.440]   photos it doesn't hurt to wait a month and make sure that you don't there's no news release
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:54.980]   about how you know customer people people are finding photos showing up in their camera
[02:15:54.980 --> 02:15:59.260]   role that they didn't take and they don't know that happened to me actually but it was
[02:15:59.260 --> 02:16:03.740]   in fact photos that I had downloaded most of my friends don't know that you go to Instagram
[02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:07.100]   and you press the location button and if you don't turn it off that you can find their
[02:16:07.100 --> 02:16:09.820]   house and that's you know for a lot of people they don't want that and once you point it
[02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:13.700]   out they just don't know they use it and suddenly everyone knows where they live and that kind
[02:16:13.700 --> 02:16:18.460]   of stuff concerns me I guess yeah that's that's when it becomes it you don't want to be able
[02:16:18.460 --> 02:16:24.140]   to do a search for names and get actual place places back there's there's so much there's
[02:16:24.140 --> 02:16:27.820]   a reason that's one of the reasons why I was so impressed with its ability to again in
[02:16:27.820 --> 02:16:31.900]   a private fashion detect that over that you you took these pictures at Yosemite National
[02:16:31.900 --> 02:16:36.900]   Park because I have geolocation turned off that it is never embedded in my exit information
[02:16:36.900 --> 02:16:42.660]   because it is so it is too easy to accidentally post a photo that you don't know has been
[02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:47.060]   tagged with a location and then suddenly it's not as though I've got ninjas waiting for
[02:16:47.060 --> 02:16:50.660]   that piece of information to come and hurt me but I just don't want there's information
[02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:56.300]   that you want to try to keep private just simply as a general rule so I don't really
[02:16:56.300 --> 02:17:02.820]   care anything they want I for one of our keys are in the bag yeah put my keys in the
[02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:07.260]   bag that is true my keys are in the bag take your keys out of the bag and say that again
