[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee's here, Andy's here. Heather Kelly joins us from the
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.320]   Washington Post. We're going to talk about the Apple car. Is it just a big advertising vehicle?
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.800]   Those new augmented reality glasses. How real is that rumor? And how the Apple watch might help
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.240]   you diagnose COVID-19 a week early. It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.320]   And I'm thrilled to have Heather Kelly joining us. She is a technology reporter at The Washington Post.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.760]   A legend in the industry worked at CNN for more than a decade. And it's so nice. I think this is
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.040]   your first time. Have you been on any of our shows ever? I have. I have. You and I have done this
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.720]   before. You and I? Yeah. I apologize. It's okay. I am terrible. I am so sorry. I have a thing.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.520]   It's a real thing, but it sounds made up. I think it's aponosia. I can't remember what it is
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:08.240]   because I can't. But I recognize faces go away. I don't see faces. Efasia? It's not aphasia. It's
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:16.160]   a speech thing. Yeah. It's like aphasia for faces. Anyway, it's a lousy excuse. Heather,
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.160]   I apologize. Welcome. It's good to have you. Thanks for joining us. Andy Inaco also here from the
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.560]   WGBH in Boston, Boston Public Radio. Good to see you, Andrew. And he's wearing his Madam World 2002
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.880]   shirt. Yep. There you go. It's almost like a badge that yes, I've survived in this industry
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.800]   for now 19 years, or at least that they haven't gotten around to get into it. I feel like that
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.400]   was last year. I am living in a time warp, I guess. Yeah. But the thing is, I'm joking,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.920]   but this shirt has become comfort food this year because there's certain items of clothing that
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.960]   when you have them for so long, you have so many memories associated with them that even if it's
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.480]   not the fuzzy sweater, it's like, oh, I've had this for two decades and through really great times,
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.880]   and I had a good time there and like, oh, okay, good. And yeah, so even though it's like a little
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.640]   bit threadbare and I probably can't wear it out anymore because I don't want to tear it,
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.200]   it's like, okay, I'm in my Mac, my Mac world 2002. Is that the last one? No, not by a long shot.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.320]   Okay. This is the word. Pausopagnosia. What? Say it again? Pausopagnosia.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.080]   That's it. You know, it's not Heather talking. It's me. Pausopagnosia.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.720]   Pausopagnosia. Oh, it's face blindness. The inability to recognize the faces of familiar people.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.560]   I just thought I'd that's the chat room came up with that. They're amazing that way.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.400]   In fact, the chat room is really, it's your fault. You should have said, you know, Heather.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.080]   She this is what the Apple glasses are going to do. You know, Heather. She was on Twitch 78 and
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.000]   and also Renee Richie, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie. Hello, Renee.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.480]   I've been here before too, Leo. Who are you? What are you doing here?
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.560]   And you were in my house. What? It's getting that way. Pretty soon it's going to be that way.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.800]   Who are all these people to keep showing up on Tuesday? 2020, we forgive anything, Leo.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.680]   Anything. So I guess this is going to lead us into the Apple AR conversation because
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.240]   that actually is a perfect application for somebody with whatever that is, Pausopagnosia.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.960]   I happens to me all the time. It would be wonderful if the glasses I could see a heads up display and
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.640]   would say, oh, yeah, this is you. No, no, no, no. Siri will tell you. Siri will tell you exactly
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.520]   who it is. So the rumors have been stepped up to another notch. The information with an exclusive
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:46.160]   saying they're going to be $3,000. One of the interesting things about the informations story is
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.520]   it did not have a top of headband. It just was around your head and kind of like nerdy glasses
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:01.440]   with a croquet. And that led to speculation that maybe they're not as heavy as they used to be
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:10.560]   or whatever. Apparently the information saw the glasses or saw rendering of the glasses and then
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.280]   had to make their own rendering to avoid giving away anything. Swappable headbands,
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:26.160]   eye tracking anywhere from 12 to 8, 12 to 18 cameras, dual 8K displays.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:34.640]   They're mixed reality because you can't see through them. So they're more like VR, but because they
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.680]   have cameras, you can see a video of what you're looking, walking around at and looking at.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.240]   And then it's superimposed on that, I guess, other things.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.160]   According to the information said they viewed internal Apple images of a late stage prototype
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:57.760]   from last year and then did their own artists rendering. Pegatron will be manufacturing them
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.040]   according again to the information. And perhaps there it is. There's the rendering.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.360]   The back of that does look pretty substantial. Like what you would have if you either A was
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.560]   desperately important to have the tightest possible fit against the face or if this thing was so heavy
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:21.520]   that you just wanted to make sure it didn't shift. Heather, you try a lot of stuff like this.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.720]   I'm really not bullish on VR at all. Do you think this is something that people want?
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.160]   I mean, if it hasn't taken off, I would say during a pandemic, which is like the perfect
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.640]   use case for it to feel like I'm there with you guys, but I don't actually want to be there with
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.880]   you guys. I'm happy just looking at you on my camera. It's fine. But this is more like a HoloLens.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:50.000]   But the HoloLens is very cool to use. It's always like, "Oh, wow, we're doing this." And then I just
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.280]   haven't found a really good use case for it. Maybe in the enterprise, job training, but that's not
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.760]   Apple's niche. I just noticed you have a black hole in your office. That's pretty cool. Where'd you
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:08.560]   get that? It's over your left shoulder. Isn't that a gravitational field distortion? Maybe I'm wrong
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.640]   on that. Could be just a chair. A wireframe model of a gravitational well? Yeah. It's a fancy little
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.240]   chair, I think. That's awesome. Just tell people. That's my black hole. Yeah. I keep it here.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.880]   Of course, when you're streaming, you have to keep it in wireframe mode so the high poly count
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:31.840]   doesn't drop the frame rate. Exactly. Code named N301, this is one of two. There'll be another one
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:38.720]   more like what Apple's trying to do, according to Mark Gurman, a year after that. Maybe next year for
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:46.960]   this. Incredible Renee? I think they're very different products though. We're compounding
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.040]   them together because the special projects group that's working on them is sharing very similar
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.480]   technologies. They have, in some ways, a lot of overlap. I think the way Apple is looking at the VR
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:02.080]   headset or the XR, I can't keep up with the acronyms, all these types of reality things,
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.560]   is that this is going to be an escalation, a premium escalation of the Apple TV,
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.440]   where it's going to be heavily focused on entertainment products. You can watch a movie and make it
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.720]   feel like you're in an IMAX theater. Also gaming, the likes of which we've seen on the Oculus system
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.800]   and on the Vive system with Steam, all those sorts of things. You want to play Pokemon
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.000]   MK-Ultra in the real world. That'll be for the glasses. That's why I think these are much more
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.720]   geared towards what an Apple TV does today. Just a much more expensive version that people will pay
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.160]   much more for. Even things like Fitness Plus, you could do that on the top of a mountain somewhere.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.480]   And then the glasses will be more like an Apple Watch, a wearable that doesn't have the same,
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.520]   VR glasses. They can have a full M2 series processor in them, cooled faster than any MacBook right
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.440]   now. But the glasses, they really can't. They're going to have a system in package the way that
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.720]   the Apple Watch does. And they're going to provide similar wearable, glanceable sort of data that
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.560]   will be much more helpful in brief bits throughout the day, but not like the dedicated fire power
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:10.320]   you'd strap to your head. Wayne Mon, Alex Heath, who wrote for the information say,
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:19.200]   remind us, and it's easy to forget that a 2017 Apple acquired a company that specialized in
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:26.240]   turning the video from a camera into a heads up display. So that would not be a surprise that they
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:33.360]   included that. I don't like VR very much because I'm paranoid. I feel like somebody's going to sneak
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.920]   up behind me. I don't like being isolated from the world around me. I feel like that's-
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.000]   Be self, yo. That's a fun or fun one. That's my wife. But you never know. She could have a frying pan.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.320]   I don't know. So I just I don't like it. It's facetious. And nobody's going to sneak up behind me. I
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.280]   just don't like the fact that you're completely disconnected from the world around you. Also,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:59.920]   the weight of that thing, as illustrated, it does imply the use case for this is going isn't going
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.400]   to be you wear it all day long as your personal assistant. It implies you're going to wear this
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.600]   for an hour while you're doing your training or while you're trying to get this engine put together
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.920]   or why you need documentation in front of you or while you're playing this game and then take it
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:19.920]   right off again. Heather, I mean, clearly Microsoft and Tense Hollow lens has more of a productivity
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:25.040]   tool. Even they showed they showed Minecraft in it. Is Apple going after productivity or
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:31.920]   entertainment or something different? I like Renee's vision of it being used for Apple Plus.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.520]   Although I mean, the biggest problem we still have with these things is how much people get
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:41.360]   violently ill using it. Like until you fix that, I can't imagine actually adding like yoga moves
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:47.440]   to it or anything. Air Force, the Air Force, which does a lot of this in simulators training
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.200]   has done many studies and they call it simulation sickness. And they say 11% of the population is
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:11:00.000]   susceptible to simulation sickness. Nobody's sure what it is. I think the folks at Oculus
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:07.520]   take the optimistic interpretation that, oh, it's just a matter of lag when you turn your head.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.680]   We got to get the lag down. We got to get the the pixel count higher. The resolution.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.920]   The resolution. I think that's over optimistic. I've read another take
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:24.400]   actually by the famous film editor Walter Murch who said, no, no, no, that's not the problem.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.000]   It's something intractable. It's a biological problem. The difference
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:34.400]   between the convergence of your eyes, which your brain uses to estimate distance where your focus
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:40.400]   converges. And I can't remember the other one is, but there's another way you perceive distance.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:46.560]   Those are supposed to match if they don't, right? Because if something is there, it should be there.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.680]   But when you're the convergence of your eyes doesn't match the focal length of the object in front
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:59.360]   of you, your brain says, you ate some bad mushrooms. You should throw us now. And so that's more
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.400]   intractable. You can't really fix that. Those screens are right here. So you're focusing on
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.800]   something this, you know, minches away. And yet the object you're focusing on appears to be and
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:16.560]   your your brain is saying 10 feet away. That mismatch is something I don't know if you can fix it.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.520]   Although if anybody could fix it, I guess it would be Apple.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.800]   Brain implants or something. I don't know. Yeah. Do you get sick Heather when you wear those?
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:32.240]   I don't, but my husband does. It's annoyed when I keep bringing them home to test. Yes. I get,
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:39.520]   I get nauseous, but after or nauseated, but after a length of time, like at first, it's like,
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.960]   oh, this is really cool. I'm having so much fun. And then, you know, you kind of a little bit later,
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.840]   you kind of feel a little weird. That's why also when they conflate VR with the screen, like your
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.080]   fly can fly an X-Wing. That's fine. But if the X-Wing starts doing spins that I'm not doing,
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.920]   that breaks the VR experience. And that's what really annoys me when they stick to the pure VR
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.240]   experience. Yeah, that's classic car sickness where your body's saying one thing and your eyes
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.600]   are saying another thing. So it's probably a combination of a bunch of different issues.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.600]   But it's possible that the use case that they're planning for this, for the people they're trying
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:19.760]   to sell this to, that's not going to be an issue. I was very, very intrigued. I came across what
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:25.280]   might be the first commercial wearable computer or mixed reality computer. It was played by Rockwell
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:32.160]   in 1996. It was called the Trekker. The Trekkers. Wow. Yeah. And it looks ridiculous because again,
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:38.560]   1996 technology, you're basically wearing a shoe box on your, on a special belt. And you've got this
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:47.360]   old-timey CRT type viewfinder on a big, big halo on your head. But the point was, if you read the
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.880]   press materials that they released with it, when they were announcing it, the market for training,
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:59.520]   for people who are just maintaining helicopters in the military, maintaining airplanes is so big
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.680]   that if you just make this one device that the other is, if you just make this one device that
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:10.160]   makes it easy for a person in maintenance to have one eye on procedures and documentation or put a
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.200]   second pair of eyes on what they're doing, that could be in low volume, a very lucrative product.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:22.720]   By the way, I found it on eBay for only $897. If I had $897 that I did not want to spend on
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.920]   something more productive, it's like, ooh, I did right click and save all the photos because I
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.960]   kind of want to build one of those. It's a piece of history. So this started, who was the guy at MIT
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.040]   who was wearing this around for the longest time. All I remember is this last name is
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.400]   man, Professor Mann. And that was one of the, he really, really took it the next level. But that's
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:48.720]   one of the things that always, I always come back to whenever I have to think about a wearable like
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.320]   that that is designed to be worn all the time, because he's been doing, he's been wearing these
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:58.240]   things since he was an undergrad. He was like one of the founders of this technology. And when you
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.080]   see him like walking around with this and all the different videos, all the different interviews,
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.000]   there's always video of, I'm going to take off my glasses so he can see the stories I'm talking about.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.480]   He's always like, yeah, yeah, he's tongue a little bit off to the side because he's a merchant. Yes,
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.920]   Steve Mann, here's the picture. This is what the Air Force by, I'm like, I hear so much.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:24.800]   This is the triumph of the nerds clearly. This is from, I think 1997, the
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:32.560]   just a lot of rainy back. Yeah, that is a great, a lot of dark trench cars. Something about this
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:39.440]   picture. These guys, look at this guy on the left. These guys, they represent the future. So,
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.760]   the one of the things the Air Force noted is with, if you suffer simulation sickness, you,
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.320]   then there is this disconnect with reality when you get out of the simulator that can take as
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.880]   long as 24 hours and they recommended that if you suffer for simulation sickness, you not attempt
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:59.040]   to drive a vehicle for at least a day. Now, what could possibly go wrong? I think the cars are
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:05.520]   driving themselves. This is the argument for augmented reality. I'm not sure the Apple style,
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.160]   where you have a camera, I think you want to see the real world because then you're, then you're
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.840]   kind of at least grounded in something real and your focal length and your convergence match.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.880]   How do I fight zombies? I mean, that's the whole point of this is to fight zombies.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.880]   I like this guy who has put an antenna on his hat.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:32.320]   Yes, probably. Probably. Yeah. I had a little glass on the right. Is that the first version of
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.520]   Google glass on the right? This is all predates all of that.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.960]   Yeah. But speaking of Google last night, that is something I come back to that I don't think
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:47.520]   that's a good marketable version of mixed reality necessarily has to be the sort of immersive,
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.520]   hey, look, there's a cartoon fox on the sidewalk in front of you is when he flicks his tail and
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.200]   turns to the left, that means that that's where you're supposed to go to find the restaurant you're
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:02.240]   going to. I do own Google glass. I am a veteran of the Explorer program. I don't like to flaunt
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.400]   that, but it is true. And I was wearing it because I was very interested in the technology,
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:12.320]   so I was wearing it regularly for a couple of months. And I really liked the idea of all it was,
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:17.520]   was like a tiny little poster stamp screen that was kind of up in your field of view that was
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.400]   totally dark. If you weren't looking, if you didn't do anything with it, but when you when you
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.640]   made a request through voice, that's how you interacted with things visually. And I have to say
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.760]   that I really did enjoy it. I really did use it a lot by just take all my daily to constitutional
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.320]   is being able to take a walk and have an idea and being able to add at a note to something or
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.520]   ask a question and get a response that is not necessarily going to interfere with what I don't
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.800]   have to take my hands off of off of off of I put my hands on a and a device in order to do it. So
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:53.040]   obviously the Google glass was as they said, just an experiment right now it is I think they're
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.880]   they're they do have an enterprise edition right now that they're trying to have some success with,
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.280]   but we don't necessarily have to have the animated Fox Apple could make something that's very,
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:07.760]   very interesting that simply like Siri plus plus your field of view. Actually,
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:14.320]   Steve Mann who started all this when he was in high school, he wired a 6502 computer
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:20.320]   into a steel frame backpack to control flash bulbs flash bulbs. Remember those kids?
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:27.200]   Cameras and other photographic systems. The display was a camera viewfinder CRT attached to a helmet
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:32.640]   giving him 40 column text. The input was from seven micro switches built into the handle of the
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:39.360]   flash lamp that he was holding. The entire system was powered by get ready for this lead acid batteries.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:44.800]   That's a big fanny pack. That's the free life. Tiny packs makes so much sense.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:52.560]   This man is still involved in all of this. In fact, there's a picture of him on Wikipedia
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:58.640]   wearing something very similar to Google glasses called the relation to Merlin. I tap. I don't know.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:04.480]   He's currently CTO and co-founder at Blueberry X Technologies in Toronto.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:10.240]   Canadian engineer. He's Canadian. So Steve, if you're out there, I'd love to hear from you.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.080]   And you could tell us what you're up to. Something involving.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:19.760]   I don't know. Trails. Blueberry, not Blackberry, you said, right?
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.360]   Blueberry, not Blackberry. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.800]   I think I'm excited by the idea of augmented reality. We were talking about this on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:38.320]   And Owen Thomas of this chronicle said, "It's not going to be glasses. It's going to be a more
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:44.400]   advanced version of the AirPods." Yes. That it's going to be an audio interface. That kind of makes
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:49.040]   sense. That doesn't make you queasy. Unless you're using a nickel back, but that's another problem
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.040]   entirely. Motorola had a really great product called the Hint. That was sort of like a single
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:59.920]   hit. Yeah. That came with the Moto X. Yeah. Exactly. And all you had to do was tap on it and ask
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.920]   questions and answer questions back to you. That idea of just simply being a conduit, a voice
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:11.280]   conduit between yourself and all of the features of your phone and also the ability for this thing
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:18.000]   to deliver proactive notifications such as turn right over here or oh, by the way, the 10/20
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:24.880]   meeting has been rescheduled to noon. That's the sort of stuff is very significant.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:30.240]   And also the fact that the Hint, unlike the AirPod, was designed to be, you can't even see people
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.280]   wearing them because it really did snug into the canal very, very well. And that's kind of like
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.200]   the perfect expression of the stick. It was a flaw. But I think it was battery life, as I
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.800]   remember. The battery was, you couldn't get a very good battery in that little thing.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:50.960]   I seem to remember. Heather, if I bought this vintage wearable Rockwell headword computer and
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.760]   just gave it to you to take home and to tell your husband, hey, this is the newest thing.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:02.080]   Do you think? Do I get the outfit to go with it? Get the whole thing. You get the fanny pack.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.920]   You get the outfit. You get the whole thing. In fact, just wear it and say,
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:11.040]   honey, this is, I love this thing. And someday we're all going to be wearing these.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.440]   Ah, get used to this. I mean, I can afford a divorce.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:20.480]   He wouldn't leave you over that. He wouldn't leave you over that though.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.800]   That's a good joke. April Fools will do that. Actually, this is from an estate sale.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.200]   Oh, that's depressing. I hope that's not the cause of their demands.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.880]   Or maybe that's how the person got killed. They were.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.680]   Yeah, that's what she's saying. Yeah. I walked into a pool and they got pulled down by the
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.840]   president of Segway who drove it off a cliff. It's just, you know, sometimes these technologies
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.400]   are just too dangerous. I'm going to frame. I'm going to print this and frame it.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.400]   I'm putting this picture from 1996 MIT.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.600]   I want to know where every single guy is right now. Yeah.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.520]   It's an update on the hall. Do you think? Okay. How many of them are billionaires now?
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.560]   All of them. All of them.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.400]   It's amazing. It's amazing story.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.960]   We are Masters now Leo.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.360]   It is not the only new product from Apple. We're going to talk in a minute about
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:16.160]   well, the strange story of Hyundai Kia.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.160]   Oh, can I ask you something before we move on Leo?
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:23.760]   Yes. So I got to be part of the clubhouse room right after the article went live where
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.320]   everyone was discussing this and you got to see just like Facebook people there and
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.120]   people interested in the Apple version and Google version and all of that.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.640]   And one of the discussions that came up is who's going to own the advertising space in AR and VR
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.200]   sort of like the Wild West of the internet and like will you go to pick up your child at
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.520]   school? And if you're wearing like the Google or Facebook version, this will you see a giant ad
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.680]   over the school or if you're using the Amazon version where you walk into your bathroom and
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.520]   it'll go, Oh, the toilet paper is low. We added an extra version to your cart.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.880]   Because like people already arguing over over rain rights over skyrights, like who owns
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.360]   the physical world never who's going to own the virtual world.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.960]   Speaking of we've been worried about that coming to, you know, Siri and Alexa and it hasn't really
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.560]   happened yet. I mean, sometimes my gets a little chatty and tries to sell me something and I yell
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.560]   at it. But like, I feel I feel like maybe there will be some boundaries for a last.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.080]   That's my worst. That's the worst experience with the same thing with Google Home.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.960]   Where after you give it a command, it says, Oh, and by the way, and you just want to go.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.880]   Oh, you want to know by the way? Yeah, when Siri tells me where her weather data comes from,
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.840]   it makes me angry enough. I can't even imagine that. Stop talking.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.320]   Like having a friend who got into like a multi-level marketing program for essential oils or something.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:40.480]   Yeah. Well, Andy, we'll get to sell you. Andy, will you get to sell the AR rights to your
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.560]   inside your house? Or will some company who made your glasses own the AR rights to that?
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.520]   Well, this is actually going to tie into the car because that was the other thing we were
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.960]   talking about the car. And Mike Elgin said, you know what? The reason Apple's interested in cars,
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.160]   not because it's a vehicle to get around in, but because it's a content consumption device.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:05.440]   And in fact, we've seen many companies, including Google, test where the ads show up.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:12.080]   And they see this as like a subway with its ads all over the inside of the car.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:19.520]   No, I mean, Ford just reached a huge deal with Google to have all of its in-dash computers
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:27.440]   be based on the Android operating system. That is how you get awareness of advertising
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.000]   environments inside of cars. You don't have to buy a hundred. You don't have to sell a $100,000 car
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.080]   just to sell a few ads. Yeah. I don't understand. I don't understand the argument. I don't think
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:42.320]   it's wrong. I'm just saying I don't understand it. Here's my assertion and all that that app. And
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:49.040]   you guys correct me if I'm wrong. Apple is not in the business of computing or cars or headsets.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:55.280]   Apple is in the business of creating experiences that people will subscribe to.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.120]   Pay for ultimately pay for and then ultimately subscribe to.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.160]   And so what they're looking at is just different vehicles for distributing
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:11.440]   these experiences that they can charge you for. And it makes sense to me that they would see a car
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.280]   as that, not so much as a. That's literally the cook to doctrine, right? Like to deliver
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:21.200]   highly differentiated products that consumers find at value to their lives. You charge them
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.560]   for the bright box and now you charge them for the. And I'm taking to the next level.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.280]   Going into the bright box saying they need to understand what their business is,
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:32.000]   which is not making computers. They I think they understand that they took computer out of the name,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.560]   but making experiences and vehicles for distributing those experiences. And then it kind of all makes
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.560]   it all fits together. All makes sense. It's just another another screen in effect.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:47.040]   Just so. Horace. Yeah. Would argue that we don't use cars enough for that. Like he thinks with the
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.560]   average person is only going to use a car for about an hour. So it only makes sense as a distributed
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.800]   platform. Yeah, it might be a flop. Yeah. Well, certainly personal ownership of automobile.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:00.880]   Or a fleet. Terrible idea. Terrible idea. Most cars are used, you know, a tiny fraction of the day.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:07.120]   That's an excellent point. I do. I do think that it's hard for me to get off the idea that when
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.760]   Apple does something, one of the factors is always the thought, well, how can we move the needle on
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:16.800]   this? Meaning that not only did not just from the lofty over here to we're here to change the
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:23.280]   world and help humanity, but also that we can't compete with any commodity manufacturer. Any
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.560]   manufacturer makes the thing that is cheap, affordable works well enough for almost every people.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.880]   We can't compete with that kind of business model. We can compete on the idea of we're building
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:39.840]   something that is the next thing. And also redefines the redefines from category. I'm not sure how.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:43.920]   So when I think about how Apple might be getting into a car, I keep thinking about, well, what are
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:50.000]   they going to do? One of the answers is we're going to be doing something that is a little bit
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.920]   more ambitious that tries to reduce the number of cars on the road and make sure that more of the
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.960]   ones that are doing like public service are running Apple software. But I can't. It's a
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:05.280]   it's a health product. It's a health product. Well, with a treadmill inside that runs the series.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:10.480]   There you go. Yeah. Actually, there's a rebuttal to your assertion, Renee, or
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:17.200]   her or her daddy's assertion. Reverb Mike says, then why are there urinal ads?
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:22.560]   I don't Heather probably has no experience of this, but there must be ads in ladies' rooms,
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:29.040]   too. I don't know. Oh, I thought you meant ads for urinal. Not for urinals above urinals.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:36.240]   In places like Vegas, there's ads everywhere. You can't in the men's room. I don't know where
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.840]   they I mean, any Amazon employee can tell you that there's ads everywhere telling you.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.240]   Is that true? Union. Yeah, they've been they've been plastering. Saying don't unionize.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.240]   Yeah, like you don't know where your dues are going. Oh my God.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:53.280]   Because you can't escape an ad in a bathroom and you probably can't escape an ad in a car.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.280]   In a car. Same thing. You're a cap the body and a headset. Captive audience.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:02.080]   Yeah, that's one of the reasons you don't use it. You don't use a restroom every, you know,
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:09.440]   a lot. Well, one hopes. You're probably spending as much time in your auto as you are in a
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:13.280]   restaurant. Actually, our commutes like longer and longer and longer, the average commute now
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.360]   is something like 45 minutes. Well, in here, it's the tech companies that are making those
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:23.280]   commutes longer, which is kind of in their longer term interest. Oh, that's a massive
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:28.400]   match. They also have a good conspiracy theory. Yeah. I mean, the early thing for Oculus too,
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.240]   is like when Facebook bought them, if Facebook is in your on your phone or in your browser,
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.160]   they're just one click away from the app or the tab going away. But if they're on
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:41.200]   your head, it requires a significant more amount of effort to remove them. And if you're in a car,
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:46.160]   even more because you can't just stop and get out anywhere. So that's why they're going to be
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:54.080]   $3,000. So you won't rip them from your head and throw them to the ground. You'll pause and have to
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.680]   think a little bit. That's just an Apple thing. It's like, because of course it has to be 8K and
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.640]   it has to be 12 cameras, not 10 cameras. And it has to be XYZ. Yeah, look at the sales of the
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.480]   Oculus Quest are quite good because I think it's finally hit. Price point people come forward.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.520]   Beat Saber Leo, those are sales driven by Beat Saber.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:15.200]   All Beat Saber all the time. I just want to point out, and this is another reason I don't like VR.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:20.160]   You look incredibly dumb when you're playing Beat Saber. To you, you're saving the world,
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.880]   you have fun, you're dancing to the people in the room with you. They're just all going,
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:30.480]   it's as bad as that bunch. That might look good.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.200]   Oh yeah, that's true. If you were a Juilliard, then you're a real dancer.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:38.960]   And you look completely over. I say this with love. You don't have to be playing Beat Saber in
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.640]   the leading world of an airport. Okay, that's probably true. You can save that for the house.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:47.040]   I want to take a break. We will talk about the cars next and a lot more. Heather Keller
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:53.520]   is here. It's great to have her technology reporter at the Washington Post, Jeffrey Fowler's
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:30:00.080]   camera operator. I take offense to that. That's right. No, I now remember when you were on,
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.280]   it was when the iPhone 12 first came out, and we had all those great pictures that you took
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:07.280]   with the iPhone 12. You still like it?
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:13.520]   Those were a few units. I'm back to my love and it's great.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:20.400]   Back to the 11. I envy you so much. I was thinking today, boy, it'd be nice if next time I don't
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:26.400]   have to buy an iPhone 13 if I could just stick with what I've got. But I just feel like I have
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:33.440]   to get the new one every year. I hate that feeling. The 11 is fine. It's hardly any different.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:41.040]   I need you to dig deep. You are a tech show host. You don't get to just buy the phone you want.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.480]   You need to buy the phone your audience needs. It's a tax deduction too, I think.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:51.440]   Yeah, it is. It is. Because unlike you, Heather, they don't send me review. I don't want review
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.880]   it. I want to buy it anyway because I don't want to have to send it back.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:31:02.560]   Did it hurt? Oh, I had this iPhone 12 for one brief shining moment. I had the latest,
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:06.160]   greatest in my hands and then it was back to last year's model. Did that feel like that?
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:13.040]   No, actually having review units is terrible. They stack up and they just like this.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.480]   It's like New Yorker magazines. Exactly.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.080]   So I'm glad to not get them whenever possible nowadays, especially since we're all working from home.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:28.320]   Yes. That would also lead to a different divorce. I feel, yeah. And I used to have to mail them back.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.760]   I didn't have a staff to mail them back. That's even worse. You got boxing.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:37.920]   No, the worst thing about all that is that when other companies, they make so many of these that
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.160]   they don't want to pay the return postage for it. So they're just like they don't want them back,
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.920]   which means that I have like no kidding. Like two huge long drawers full of like 10 years worth
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.160]   of phones that I don't feel. I can't give them away. I certainly can't sell them.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.440]   And maybe I want them for the library, but it means that it's when I do my house,
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:00.080]   my big house cleaning every three years, another like six or seven like goes into the drawer.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:04.880]   And I'm like, this seems like it should be an art installation, not just something that's in a drawer.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.160]   Yeah. You see. I have three decapitated cat robots.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.160]   And I can't get rid of them. I can mail to Japan and that this is very daunting.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:18.880]   This is this is Marquez Brownlee's phone drawer. This is where they're working.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:25.040]   Things are changing. Because you often see now hashtag gift from Google, which like never happened
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.800]   in my early days. And like it still doesn't happen when you deal with outlets. Like us,
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   it's review units, but like the influencers Instagrammers. Yeah,
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.440]   it's hashtag gift from Google and they just give you that pixel in a giant pizza box.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:41.200]   Yeah. So that you will open that giant pizza box. Like ours coming up playing Brown rapper.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:45.360]   And he's getting like giant pizza boxes or coffins or these weird production things.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:51.600]   So different. I can hear I can hear people right now. I hear you saying, first world problem.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:58.000]   Jeez, guys, they're sending you free stuff. But it does. You can't keep it. It gets to be a burden.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.880]   I actually had boilerplate that said in response to what you your problem Andy that said,
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:09.840]   if you send me this phone, you must include a return mailing label. You must.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:14.000]   Because I don't want to I don't want to keep it. I'm glad I don't have to do it anymore. And I'm
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:21.680]   glad occasionally we'll do lenders. We got Samsung S21 on loan for review. But most of the time,
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:26.800]   I just I prefer not to deal with it deal with it. Yeah. Our show today brought to you by
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:32.320]   here's something they don't give you loners of a Casper mattress. But you know what? I'm happy
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.800]   to buy one. I just talked to my daughter. She got a new apartment and you know, it's a tradition in
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:45.920]   our family new apartment new Casper. I saw I got her the foundation, which is a box spring,
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:52.000]   the frame and the mattress and the sheets and the pillows. I got it was a complete set of Casper
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.560]   under a thousand bucks for the whole setup. I was really happy. And I asked her, I said,
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:01.760]   you know, how do you like your Casper? And I said, can I quote you? She said, I love it. It's the best
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:07.040]   mattress I've ever had. So I said, can I quote you in the ad? She said, absolutely. It's really true.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:13.040]   Casper is there's there's me and my jammies. Look at that though. That's a king size mattress
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:20.960]   in a surprisingly small box. You open up the box, you you roll it out. And then once you take it
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:27.200]   out of the, I think they must have a giant one of those machines that that you know, vacuum seals
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.440]   it because once you take it out, it goes, the other thing I love about Casper mattresses,
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:36.000]   you don't have to air them out. They're ready to sleep on right away. They're so comfortable.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:43.360]   Cool sleeping, which is very important. Supportive mattresses, but they're also super soft.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:51.440]   It's kind of a paradox. I guess they do it because they only Casper mattresses are made with 86
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:57.360]   supportive gel pods. So that's how they align your spine, eliminate aches and pains. It's
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:02.560]   supportive, but it's comfortable. And with a Casper, you'll always wake up refreshed, ready to go all
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:08.720]   your long. Our cat, Sammy loves our Casper. There's the wave hybrid, perfect for people who have aches
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:14.400]   and pains and want a mattress with maximum support and cooling. You want the most plush mattress,
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:20.080]   check out the Nova hybrid for a plush feel that doesn't sacrifice support. I gave Abby the original
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.760]   because I think it's a great mattress. That's the one she loves the best she's ever had.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:29.920]   The one for sleepers who want both support and cooling. The best-selling Casper pillow. I sleep
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:35.360]   with my cat wrapped around my Casper pillow every single night made with unique pillow in pillow
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:40.400]   design that's soft on the outside, supportive on the inside for all night comfort. Casper makes
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:45.360]   everything you need to refresh your whole bedroom this year from their super soft per kale sheets
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:51.600]   to their all-season down duvets to their cozy, calming, weighted blanket. That's new. I've got
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:57.840]   to get the weighted blanket. I want to try that out. As always, Casper offers free shipping and

[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:35.280]   everybody in the family now sleeps on a Casper including cousins, aunts, uncles. We provided
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:43.600]   Casper too. They're amazing. Yeah, they're great. Yes, Andy, I can tell. Oh, he's got something.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:48.880]   No, I just I just like this phone drawer. This is one of the two. Can I just see an original
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.040]   original Mac? I thought those were Macs. An original Google phone.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:58.320]   Wow. I have a Facebook phone in there. Which one? The Facebook phone, a fire phone maybe? The
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:03.840]   Cha Cha. No, I do the fire phone. Maybe not in this drawer, but I get it in the fire phone.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:09.120]   That's history. The one thing Amazon did that failed, or maybe not the one, but the most memorable.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:13.520]   They learned less. It was actually very forward thinking. Anyway,
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:18.080]   and they had those people who you could call and they would help you. Right? Heather?
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:21.760]   Well, we had 3D. You press a button. That was a little later. Yeah.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.880]   And they go, what's the problem? What's the problem? Parallax.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:30.480]   Yeah, that's right. That weird, that was weird. Just make a shopping phone. No, we'll give it
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.400]   parallax, but why? I just want a shopping phone because we think parallax is cool, but I just
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.920]   seriously, I just want a shopping phone. Your Amazon, we're giving you parallax. Don't worry,
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.800]   Heather. We know who your boss is. You don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.360]   No, it's delightful. I'm allowed to say whatever I want that.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.280]   That's good. I've heard a peep.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:52.720]   No, I'm sure anybody who's sensible media owner is not going to try to get his.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.040]   You wouldn't have anybody working for you because no, no, no.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:01.040]   Personal integrity is going to be. He does watch every episode of Macbreak. We know that.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:12.720]   Okay, let's talk about cars. So it's very confusing. And I think that you all can parse this.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:19.200]   Originally, Hyundai made an announcement. Yeah, we're talking to Apple about a car,
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:24.320]   which I sent chills down my spot. As soon as I saw it, I thought, bad move.
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:28.880]   Stop talking. Stop talking. Of course, immediately after that, they retracted it.
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.520]   They changed the press release to take the word apple out.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.800]   Then for some reason, last week, we started seeing all these reports that Kia
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:43.520]   was doing a deal with Apple, which made a lot of sense. In some respects, Hyundai owns Kia.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:50.880]   Hyundai has a electric vehicle platform that's quite mature, that has 300 plus miles of range.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:55.120]   It's got a lot of horsepower if you want it. It's a really nice, the GPM platform is really nice.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:01.360]   They have a Kia has a manufacturing plant in Georgia. If you're going to build a car,
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.360]   it's probably a great idea to do the deal with somebody who knows how to make automobiles.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.920]   Just as Apple doesn't make the iPhone, Foxconn does.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:13.200]   And who also has service based pretty much the entire world.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:19.200]   Service on an apple car is going to be hell if it's not just a apple branded apple.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.080]   They replace the entire car. It's something good.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.840]   Yeah, every time you get a flat tire, they replace the whole thing is replaced.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:31.600]   So now the latest is, sorry, you drove over a puddle. That's water ingress.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.400]   It's an apple. There's a little blue tag inside.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:39.120]   Now they're taking it back. But here's my question.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:45.600]   Is this a real take back or is it Apple told us to shut up take back? It cost them a lot in stock.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.400]   Or did it cost them the whole contract take back?
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.960]   Oh, or did Apple say you keep doing this?
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:55.520]   I don't know. I just don't see Apple.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:55.920]   Now.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.480]   This announcement, the announcement will proceed.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.600]   The product and both of them are so far off at this point.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:09.520]   I don't think that Apple would cancel negotiations with what they might feel is the best
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:14.320]   partner for this project just on the basis that somebody who is going to be duck walked
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.400]   out of that place with a cardboard box holding a couple industry awards and pins.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.520]   Fire that guy. Make sure he never has anything to do with this project ever again.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.840]   But if Kia or Hyundai has what Apple needs, Apple needs, they're going to do it.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:33.360]   And it wasn't an, the second part that $3.6 billion deal with Apple did not come
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:39.520]   at least as far as we know directly from Kia came from dongay.com or donga.com,
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.240]   which is a Korean rumor site. At least that's what I deducing from this picture.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:49.440]   So we all know Apple is putting that money in Bitcoin, not into Hyundai.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.120]   Yeah. That's another story.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:59.120]   Elon buying one and a half billion dollars Bitcoin and then saying,
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.560]   now I really want to unlock my wallet because he said you could buy a Tesla's with a,
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:08.960]   your Bitcoin and I have enough Bitcoin to buy a fleet. I think if I can figure out what the
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:19.680]   password is. So anyway, in every sense, this kind of made sense to me that they would pick
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.640]   a manufacturer like Kia that doesn't have a, you know, you pick Ford or GM,
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:32.080]   they have such a high profile in the US that, and Ford globally, that everybody would know it's
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:38.080]   a Ford. You pick Kia, maybe Apple can, you know, it can be a white label thing that really has a nice
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:42.480]   Apple logo on it. They're going to design it though. They just poached the guy who designed,
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:46.480]   designed Porsche did all the whole time. Yeah. Yeah. Series. So they're going to almost certainly
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:52.560]   make their own chassis for it. He did the Ticon, the electric vehicle. He's a chassis guy. Yeah.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:58.720]   The Johnny I have of car. What do you think Heather? Is Kia, is Kia just
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:04.080]   backing off to protect their relationship? Or did they actually have it? Did they lose it? What
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:09.360]   really happened? God only knows how they work. But I mean, at the end, it's going to be like,
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:16.000]   who has their name on that car? It won't be Kia. But would Kia be happy with a relationship of like,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.920]   we've made this car and it just says Apple on the back. It depends how much money it. I mean,
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:26.720]   if they get paid 20% on every car or something, you know, Fox right on those app store guidelines.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:32.720]   30. That's right. It has to be 30. I mean, it doesn't say Fox Con on this, on the phone.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.840]   You need a car company willing to like give over that much of their branding and the reputation to
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:44.560]   Apple. And I mean, who even thinks about Kia's outside of this particular, like news cycle.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:48.880]   Right. Renee, who was it? There was a company that Apple was rumored to be talking with it.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:54.960]   That's what they do is white label vehicles. Remember that? I don't call the name, but I mean,
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:59.600]   there's a difference like Fox Con really doesn't like they manufacture Apple stuff,
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.760]   but they basically just take whatever Apple gives them. That was a whole revolution
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:08.160]   of Apple supply chain management is that they didn't want to go in and like a lot of companies
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.720]   did like these parts binned phones or computers where they're like, okay, take these parts off
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:17.040]   the shelf, assemble them into a computer, slap our logo on them and go. And that was really
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:20.960]   cost effective because those were commodity parts. They cost very, very little. And Apple's like,
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:24.160]   no, we're going to tell you, we're not only going to invent a chamfer edge, we're going to invent
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.760]   the machine that makes the chamfer, we're going to, you're going to design it. We're going to
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:32.720]   lease them from you for exclusive for like a year. And I, Kia, like, are they going to be
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.640]   manufacturing using that platform? Or is Apple going to do what Apple does? And basically say,
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:42.640]   okay, this Kia plant is now a de facto Apple manufacturing plant. This is the car you're
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:46.960]   going to build. And we'll look at your little designs, just put them down on the shelf over
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.880]   there. But here's the car we're going to build. But it could also be a business plan for one of
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:55.520]   these car manufacturers, like give up your own brand and just start making Foxcom style cars for
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.120]   their companies. Because it's Apple now, but they could also make the Google branded car,
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.800]   the Facebook branded car, all of these sound like a nightmare, as I'm saying them out loud.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:08.800]   Twitter car. Well, no, I think it's advertising. Of course, Facebook would want a car, right?
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:14.880]   Because remember that in the olden days, a plant would build like the car itself. But then you
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:21.280]   would have coach builders who would build it into like the Cadillac chauffeur upfront living room
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:26.800]   in the back sort of thing. This could be part of Kia, Kia's business plan saying we're building,
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:30.960]   in addition to building cars of our own, we're just building a platform that said, here is
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.440]   everything that needs to be everything that this needs to be needs to be in order to be a car.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.200]   You just add your own sensors, software, and your distinctive styling and you're good to go.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:48.240]   There are a number of companies that actually make cars for other companies, including, I believe,
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:55.200]   Kia in the in the earliest days. So this isn't like car branded cars. Yeah, this isn't on board
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.920]   to be a version of the Nissan. And there's unlike Foxcom, I mean, you're making a phone that's one
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:04.720]   thing to say, okay, Apple, you tell us what to make, making a car because of the safety
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:10.080]   considerations. I feel like requires a significant amount of expertise. It's not something. In other
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.440]   words, that's why Apple's not going to go to pegatron or Foxcom and say, can you make us a car?
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.360]   Tesla has been making their own cars. I mean, they get a lot of they get a lot of heat for the
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.960]   build quality on a lot of those cars because they're they're focused more on battery life than they
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:25.360]   are on build quality. And it really varies greatly, but they've ramped up manufacturing
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:29.040]   to a level. I think a lot of their critics didn't think they'd be able to. Yeah, consumer reports just
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:38.080]   said the Model 3 has the highest customer satisfaction we've ever recorded and is among the worst in
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:44.400]   repairability, which is bizarre. But that I as its former Tesla owner, I'll testify to that.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:50.000]   But people love Tesla's despite the lack of build quality. You don't buy a Tesla because it looks
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:56.240]   so greater. You buy it because it's cool. Together so well. There's little duct tape and some of
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:01.600]   them and people are happy. Yeah. You also a lot of customers they want to identify themselves as
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:06.000]   Tesla customers. Yes. So that's that's that's an intersection with Apple. There's going to be a
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.440]   lot of people that who want to buy an Apple car. That's right. Because they totally not simply
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:16.800]   as a style thing, but because they feel as though this they've invested they've invested wisely
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:22.160]   an Apple as an extension of their own lifestyle because they imagine that a lot of their beliefs
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:29.200]   and their style cues overlaps with apples. And it's I again, I still I still am baffled as to why
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:34.320]   Apple would get into anything approaching a consumer direct to consumer sort of car company. But
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:40.880]   then you look at certain car companies like like Lotus that what makes cars that were that are
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:45.200]   not that much more expensive than what we imagine an Apple car would cost if we're thinking that
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:51.360]   Apple's cars will approach $100,000. Lotus is start at about $100,000. And they only make a couple
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:57.520]   thousand cars a year, which is a lot more doable than even the model S is the Tesla Model S is
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:02.160]   launched, which was tens of thousands now they're up to hundreds of thousands. But if we think of
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:07.040]   it as more of a Lotus sort of plate, meaning people are going to spend $100,000 and then bump it up
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:14.640]   with extra RAM for $130,000. And you know, and and if Apple can get away with just manufacturing a
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:20.640]   few thousand of them, that could be interesting. I again, I'm still Beth. I still have no clue as
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:25.680]   to why Apple would want to do it. But at least it's not as silly as some reports saying, Oh, no,
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:29.280]   they want to take over the car business the way that they took over the phone business. No,
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.000]   no, they're not going to build millions and millions of cars. I don't think so.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.480]   >> I think the analysts are championing it a bit for that just one or two percent of revenue
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.440]   from the car market though, because it has such a huge potential.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:44.000]   >> Just just like what Steve Jobs originally said about the target goals for the iPhone only not
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:50.880]   being not being humble breaking, humble, whatever. >> What if it's just that ploy to sell more like
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.560]   Apple music subscriptions, like you're locked into the car, you can only have Apple services.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:48:01.520]   >> Yeah, it's a wall of hard early works. It's a walled car. Everything Apple, you know,
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:07.120]   it's a wall chariot. I really, I hate the idea. I resist the ecosystem play and all that stuff.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:13.840]   But I noticed I can't help it. I'm being slowly drawn into it with an Apple watch, an Apple phone,
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:19.680]   a Macintosh, and I've always loved Macintashes, but now with the M1, it's like I just, I
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:24.480]   resistance is futile. I'm just part of the board. >> But the antitrust office getting them to open
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:28.960]   up more, Leo, you can choose your own music. >> I saw that. >> One app at a time there.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:36.240]   >> Thanks to your review, by the way. And Micah was on your video reviewing. I bought five of those
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:44.240]   candles. What do you call them? Home pod minis. I bought five of them. >> They're so cute.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.880]   >> They don't sound bad. >> Micah can sell me anything, Leo.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:51.600]   >> I know. Micah's a good salesman. They don't sound bad. They don't sound as good as the home pod,
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:58.160]   but they sound fine. And I have them all over the house. Intercom has turned on now, which really
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:04.560]   annoys everybody when I use it. I'm coming home. >> Coming home, I'm coming home. Leo says I'm
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:09.920]   coming home. >> When is the follow thing going to happen?
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:17.040]   Because now it does sort of follow with the new version of iOS. It says, I see you're in another
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:23.360]   room, but I want it to literally follow me. Like just start music. >> Music stalker, dude.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.520]   >> Is it not going to do that? Did I misunderstand what Apple was promising at WWDC?
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:32.480]   >> I don't know if it'll do it automatically. Right now you can just tell it to switch to
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:36.160]   whatever room you're in. Or you can just tell it. You can say move music to the kitchen and it'll
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.360]   do it. But it doesn't do it proactively yet. >> I want to follow me.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:46.160]   >> If you detect my wife, that should be a shortcut. If you detect my watch within two meters,
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.120]   switch the music to here. >> Isn't that what headphones are for?
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:54.800]   >> Headphones. I guess I could wear headphones. That's actually what I do.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.480]   >> But then your family is not enjoying your choice of music.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:05.040]   >> Right. I don't get to arrest them. >> You kids are going to learn about Sam Cook right
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.200]   there now. >> We're going to do it. >> We're going to do it.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.360]   >> We're going to do it. >> We're going to do it tomorrow. >> We're going to do that tomorrow.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:14.000]   >> We have an 18-year-old who's stuck with us because of COVID living at home.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.200]   >> Going to school. >> Going to poor kid.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:22.080]   >> He is Ms. Roger Whitaker 24/7. >> And I do. I'm not trying to do that. I'm just saying,
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:26.400]   you really should know Roger Whitaker's music. >> Is he doing the opposite?
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:31.360]   >> Is he like a lot of us? >> He's being surprisingly nice about the whole thing.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:34.240]   >> He's up to something. >> It's called the Wapley Milow.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:39.280]   >> There you go. He's up to something. That's exactly right. It's too quiet.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:44.960]   >> Yale University was a time of tumultuous change in 1971 to nobody fewer than a young man
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:50.880]   by the name of a flea of the fort. >> Dan Ricchio, we talked about him, and now
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:59.680]   Mark Gurman says, "You said Renee, I think." When he left running all of hardware to go to a new
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:04.320]   project, it was probably not going to cars, but AR/VR. That's what Gruber said as well.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:10.000]   Gurman says, "That's correct. That's correct." Apple moves to--
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.840]   >> You already ran it amid a lot of sense. >> Yeah. He ran it along with everything else.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:18.880]   But if AR is going to be the next big thing, then it makes sense to put somebody like Ricchio
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:29.120]   in charge. Then Apple has also told Steph that it's moving the group working on in-house displays
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:35.040]   in camera technology to Johnny Suruji. >> Right.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:42.480]   >> Suruji's already in charge of processors and modems. He's now got displays in camera technology.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:50.320]   That seems to all be together in one head-worn device. Yes?
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:56.480]   >> It's platform technology. He's hardware technology which includes-- but it's the stuff that is
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:02.240]   core to every product that Apple's going to put out, not specific to anyone. It's the things that
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:08.080]   make the things, so to speak. >> Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry. I meant to mention that in our first
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:14.880]   segment. I left that one out. Wonderful, I thought. It's a little bit-- it's a geography, but I
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:20.320]   liked it anyway. A story about in Bloomberg Business Week by Mark Gurman and Austin Carr about it.
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:29.840]   Really, an ode to Tim Cook. It's been about 11, almost 12 years since Steve passed,
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:36.800]   and Tim Cook took over. I think this is absolutely accurate. You can really
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:42.240]   say that Cook put his stamp on the company, and its success is very much--
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:49.600]   for a long time, we said, "Oh, it's just Steve Jobs. It's the momentum Steve created." I don't
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:57.520]   think you can say that anymore. August 2018, the company's market value reached a trillion dollars
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:09.440]   two years later, two trillion dollars. The article's interesting because it talks about Tim's
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:16.080]   political acumen as well. That's one thing Steve Jobs never had. They recall a dinner
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:23.520]   that Jobs was at with President Obama, and Obama asked him, "When are you going to move
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:28.960]   iPhone production in the United States?" And Jobs bluntly said, "Those jobs aren't coming back."
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:39.200]   Cook went and asked the same thing at dinner with Trump.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:44.880]   Anyway, another dinner was so diplomatic, nobody remembers his hands.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.840]   It's like Dave Suits at the hearings, Leo.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:52.640]   It's those beige suits that he wore. Remember, at the scientific hearings, they wore the beige
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:58.800]   suit. Nobody could even see him in the background. I love the conclusion that no one
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:04.320]   can remember the answer, which means it was very diplomatic. They explain why at the end, though.
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:08.320]   It's just they don't have the same realities in North America anymore. We didn't invest in the
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.760]   same time. Times have changed. Times have changed. It's still not a great...
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:20.800]   I don't think that Tim Cook should be lambasted for trying to create such a close
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:27.680]   relationship with the Trump administration. However, it's unfortunate that Trump, who needed
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:33.200]   certain optics, was able to exploit his relationship with Tim Cook to create those optics that he needed
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:38.720]   for his ongoing PR campaign. I wish that Apple had been a little... collectively had been a little
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:45.440]   bit more resistant against that. He was one of many CEO... Tech CEOs at the table during the first
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.840]   couple months of Trump's administration about, "Hey, look, I'm having a conference with all the
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:56.400]   tech heads. Look how informed I am." But the idea of allowing Trump to use the Texas plant
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:02.480]   as not only as a photo op, but also to almost blatantly lie in front of Tim.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:08.000]   You don't have to have Tim leap in front of the microphone and contradict the president in front
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.800]   of everybody on a live camera. You can have Apple release, a press release, a day or a diplomatic
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:18.720]   period later saying, "By the way, what the president said was a slip of the tongue, let's say,
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.040]   here's the fact about what we're using this plant for."
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:28.080]   Politically, I agree with you. But from a pure, capitalistic point of view,
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:38.160]   I think you can say that it's succeeded. Tim maybe wasn't as he grinned and buried it.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:41.840]   Sometimes his grin really looked like he was just barely bearing it.
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:46.720]   He danced for Nero and Nero bestowed him with pleasure. That's not exactly a great thing for
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:58.880]   the resume. Tim's responsibility is not to politics, but to the stakeholders for Apple.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:02.720]   He's certainly done a good job for them. I agree with you, Andy, morally and ethically
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:14.080]   questionable. I'm not necessarily suggesting that, again, there are many CEOs at that first
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:22.880]   table. It's not as though he was unique in it. He did have a lot of very good business reasons
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:31.840]   to make sure that in a coming, not necessarily very well thought out or justified trade war
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:36.880]   with the country that manufactures all of the company's stuff. It was a very, very good plan
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:41.840]   for him to have this company's ear. Also, to be able to say, "Perhaps you could delay this
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:48.080]   decision that you've handed down for several months until we can at least get the iPhone out."
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:53.760]   That also worked out well. I'm saying that when you look at looking in the past,
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.720]   who do you want to shack up with? Who do you want your name associated with?
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.000]   Did you have to be quite that? At what point do you think?
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.400]   It may not be kind to him, but the stock market is.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:07.840]   I'm just saying that it means that when you go on to say that, "Oh, we believe in freedom,
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:13.760]   we believe in..." We believe that everyone should be trade for that. Racism is a bad
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:18.800]   it's a horrible thing. We believe an opportunity for all, but then you're willing to...
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:23.840]   You're already a trillion-dollar company. You're not like a struggling company that's really trying
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:28.240]   to stay afloat in a highly competitive market. Now, you own the markets that you are in. You have
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:36.160]   enough leeway to not have a hostile relationship with the president, but not to simply say, "Yes, by
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:43.120]   all means, stand next to me." I'm going to have to correct myself. I call it a geography, an overly
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:51.440]   pleasant biography, but no. In fact, here's a paragraph. "Cook came to Apple in 1998 after
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:57.040]   a dozen years at IBM and a six-month stint at Compaq and seemed at least to old Apple
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:04.560]   hands devoid of any obvious personality. He'd work 18-hour days and send emails all through the
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:09.440]   night. When he wasn't at the office, he seemed to live at the gym. Unlike jobs, he had no pretensions
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:14.880]   to being an artist. One former Apple executive who worked with Cook said, "Tim was always pure work,
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:23.680]   grind, grind, grind, grind." I always found him exceptionally boring. I feel so attacked.
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:33.760]   Is that not normal? Anyway, if you're interested in... This is not the first kind of long profile
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:38.480]   piece of Tim Cook I've seen, but if you're interested, here's that picture of Tim.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:45.280]   What's his name? At the factory. Then we were talking a couple of weeks ago, apparently Tim gave
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:52.000]   President Trump the first Mac Pro. I'm so jealous, which I'm sure immediately, as you said.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.600]   It's revisionary hardware. You never want revisionary. You never want the first.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:02.080]   Apparently, we're guessing immediately to Jared and said, "I don't know what to do with this here."
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.640]   Is he using it as a Minecraft server? Are you tweeting with this? No.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:08.480]   Probably try to pay an electric bill with it or a hotel bill.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.600]   I really doubt he tried to pay any bills for a hotel bill.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:14.240]   Exactly. Who'd know for a fact he did not?
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:23.760]   It's funny because there was the same kind of victory lap for Satya Nadella after his six years
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:29.840]   running Microsoft. Really turning that company into a powerhouse. This is similar.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:36.880]   Apple is the $2.3 trillion fortress that Tim Cook built. Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:41.280]   He definitely has very strong ideologies. He believes in many different things.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:45.680]   Some of them in conflict, I'm guessing because just human. He really seems to believe that you
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:50.720]   have to be engaged in order to affect change. That includes being engaged with people who
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:56.960]   represent ideologies that he is dramatically, personally opposed to. In some cases, that works
[00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.840]   to Apple's benefit. In some cases, it works to his personal equity detriment, especially with
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:10.240]   certain administrations or certain countries. He does the same thing every time he stays engaged.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:15.360]   I don't know if in the grand sum of history, he'll be thought of worse for it. He really
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.480]   seems to believe that's the only way he'll have an impact on them at least eventually.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:23.360]   There are a lot of different ways to be a CEO. There are a lot of different ways to...
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:30.000]   Steve Jobs, he must lead. Yeah, a lot of paths to success. I compare it to chess world champions.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.440]   There are the guys who are slashers, attacker. Steve Jobs is more like a Bobby Fisher type.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:44.880]   And then there are the very boring technicians who get the job done. But both are paths to success.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.760]   Maybe the key is getting the right personality in the seat at the right time.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:58.800]   You look at Jeff Bezos, who is clearly a master strategist. Also brilliant at execution.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:08.000]   I know. Would you call Tim Cook a great strategist? He's very different, though. He thinks in terms
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.200]   of logistics. He's more about logistics. If I would come to him with a spreadsheet,
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.040]   and he'd remember that this cell was different eight months ago in the spreadsheet that I gave
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.960]   him. And he could keep all of that. The same way Steve Jobs could look at the future and see
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:27.040]   personal networking and this and that Tim Cook can see these numbers almost like
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:31.600]   floated like the matrix floating in front of him. And he is very good at knowing he doesn't know
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.880]   where the puck is going to be in terms of products. But he knows where those numbers are going to
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:39.200]   be. And he can let other people worry about the puck. I wish there were a statistic like there is
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:47.120]   in football or baseball for unforced errors. It seems to me there have been no unforced errors
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:53.840]   on Tim Cook's watch. John Brallitt comes to mind. Who certainly hired him to be head of retail.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:02:00.240]   Oh, the retail. That was a floppy right. But he fixed it. I forget if paper master was jobs or
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:05.600]   or a cook. I don't remember. But there's been a few. Yeah, he does fix them fast. He doesn't wait.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:12.000]   Yeah. So he replaced Ron Johnson with a guy who was clearly not fit for the job, but then replaced
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.680]   him with his that when Angela Arens came in or yeah. So I mean he may that was a very good move.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:24.480]   Very successful. And you let them backline. Don't completely the wrong direction for a good six years.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.160]   Yeah, I blame Johnny. I for that. I feel like that was Johnny. I've
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:37.520]   misprioritizing thinnest and you know design over technology and Tim let him.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:43.200]   But a good manager obviously that's part of what being a good manager means. And he also inherited
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:48.640]   Johnny I've from Steve Jobs. Once Johnny left, I think that Johnny was off doing Apple Park and
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.760]   Apple stores for a long time. So I think it probably went deeper than just Johnny I've.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:57.120]   You don't blame the yet butterfly keyboard Johnny. I do. I mean, not singularly. I mean,
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.280]   it's never a person. It's a department like he certainly let created the philosophy for that.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.720]   But if you're not there paying attention, that philosophy can be interpreted in the wrong way.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:12.000]   Right. Yeah. The gold Apple watch comes up. I think it will still be the most embarrassing
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   product Apple has made. Unfortunately, I agree. You can see Tim's face. Right. Like remember during
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.320]   the presentation, he spent all of like three seconds on it. Yeah. He knew it was a bad idea.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.080]   Bad look.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:27.840]   Do do do do do do.
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:33.040]   And clearly not getting into Dodgecoin fast enough with Apple's massive, massive reason.
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:39.840]   Dogecoin. If you're going to talk about the doge. Dodgeball Dogecoin.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:47.440]   Dodgeball Dogecoin, which is now what is it? Two thousand? What is it? Seven cents. And how much
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:53.360]   did Father Robert have? He had 20 million of them. 20 million doge.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:57.360]   That's the second Vatican. It's all about knowing when you got to know when to hold them.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:08.000]   And he folded too soon. I saw it was from clubhouse. It's probably wrong. We did see the Tesla
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.920]   bought one and a half billion dollars with Bitcoin. Then somebody said Apple.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.760]   Has been widely reported. Did Apple bought some?
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:19.040]   No, the Tesla bought some. But we know the Tesla did. They had to report it themselves in there.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:25.040]   Financials. But Apple didn't buy Bitcoin. Did they? I would really disappoint me.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.200]   That would really make me sad. I don't know why.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:35.200]   It's hard to know. There's a part of the tech business that I'm aware of, but
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.040]   don't get involved in because it's way, way out of my experience. I able to understand. But
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:43.520]   I'm surprised by how much of their business is tied up and actually using their money
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:48.000]   to create investments and make money off of very conventional investments.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.760]   So it's not always about making phones, not always about creating the right services.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:55.680]   It is also about having an investment fund that is very well-managed.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:01.360]   No, they're very obviously very good with finances. Of course, there was the Dutch sandwich and the
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:09.200]   whatever it was. The Irish whip to the dust. But then they also have been taking their cash
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:15.280]   and borrowing against it instead of spending the cash to buy back their stock. They just borrowed
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:22.080]   on Monday, yesterday they borrowed eight and a half billion dollars with a four-part bond deal.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:31.360]   So investment grade bonds, and I don't understand business well enough to know,
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:37.120]   but it's cheap for them to do that. For some reason, it's better to do that. Actually,
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:43.040]   that was in May. I don't remember how much they issued this year. They're like, "Well,
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:50.480]   bonds, but for apples." So that May, it was 8.5 billion. In August, it was 5.5 billion.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:56.960]   I mean, it goes on and on. Let me see what the most recent, they just most recently borrowed more.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:08.640]   Let's see in the past month, 14 billion. 14 billion. And all of that to fund
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:17.360]   stock buybacks and dividends. It's cheaper to borrow the money than it is to spend it, apparently.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.440]   Maybe it's offshore money they're borrowing against.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:25.120]   No, no, no. Oh, okay. Yes, it was when it was offshore. That was for sure why they borrowed.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:32.560]   So maybe that's still the case. Did we ever find out how much money they brought back into
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:39.760]   the United States when they were offered that deal? A few years ago, they were offered
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:44.320]   the offer to repay traders. You said you could repatriate for a much smaller tax bill.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:51.360]   Let me just check. Apple repatriation. Apple plans to repatriate $285 billion.
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:59.760]   Oh, gee, I can't put that in here. That cost them 38 billion in tax, which is a significant.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:03.840]   That's 15.5% as opposed to... I mean, but quarrel with the US is that the US is one of the few
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:08.080]   companies who wants to tax you money that you made in other places and pay taxes on in those places.
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:11.680]   I mean, regardless of your Irish whips and things, a lot of countries, whatever money you make in
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:15.760]   other countries, they just let those countries pass. But the other argument is that Apple moved
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:21.600]   that stuff off short to avoid those taxes. So in fact, that's why they took the deal. Good.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:27.600]   We got the money back. So yeah, that was two years ago. So I don't know why they're still borrowing
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:32.160]   bonds because that was the initial. Maybe they still have more money overseas.
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:36.240]   Or the interest rates are so low or something. That's the real reason. It's
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:41.200]   cheaper for them to borrow the money and then make money. I wish I were rich enough to do this.
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.960]   Borrow money to invest in the stock market and then you make more money back and then you pay
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:51.440]   off the bonds and you're rich. How come I can't do that? She can lend you 10 bucks. You can lend
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:56.640]   Andy 10 bucks and we'll see how we do. Good news, everyone. Tim Cooks headed to Foxwoods.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:00.320]   Everyone's going to get bonuses. If somebody would just make a TikTok explaining this,
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:04.560]   I'd appreciate it. Thank you, Brian. All right, let's take a break. We're going to
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:10.240]   have more news. We've got a great panel. Renee Richie, Andy Inako, a wonderful visit from Heather.
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:16.720]   Kelly of The Washington Post who is not wearing VR glasses at the moment.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:21.600]   Or a baseball cap. It's kind of weird to me out. But wishes she was. Yeah.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:31.200]   Why the baseball cap? Why? Because I've been working all day. Andy and Renee are both wearing them.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:36.960]   It's not a style thing. I don't want to get my hair working. I'm getting a haircut Friday.
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:41.280]   So you what? I'll purchase at least were actual glasses so that you guys don't feel so lonely.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:46.800]   If you want to wear glasses, I have to put on glasses. I'm the only one not wearing a baseball
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:52.240]   cap and glasses. All right, you put yours on. I'll put mine on. Okay, she's getting her glasses
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:56.080]   out, folks. Oh, that's good. Oh my God, you guys are hideous.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:06.560]   Oh, you couldn't tell by the way we speak. I've got more value out of this one prop. I feel
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:13.440]   like Gallagher. I'm going to turn it on. I haven't charged these in years. These are the Snapchat
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:18.560]   spectacles. Okay, I put them away now. I've worn them like nap four times in the last two weeks.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:24.160]   Yeah, you heard it. Yeah, remember like before there was TikTok, there was Snapchat. Remember them?
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:30.640]   They're doing well. Are they doing well? Snap? I mean, they're they're there. They're making money.
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:38.640]   They're getting new users. I'm as baffled as you are. I'm trying to think my older kids, 26 and 28,
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:46.000]   my 26-year-old still snaps. He's the Snapchat generation. I think it's generational.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.600]   Should we stop using like Gen X, Gen Z and just go buy our main media? Yeah, yeah, social media.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:56.960]   I think I'm going to say, Heather, you were in the AIM generation, the AOL and Stemeter's
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:03.360]   generation. Oh, yeah. Yeah, grew up like all the time on AIM. I was talking about it.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.920]   I didn't get it until I was a senior. I'm not that bad. Oh, okay. Yeah, my daughter was aiming
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:13.280]   all through high school. I think middle school. Andy and I are Morse code and we're proud.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:18.320]   Hey, hey, grandpa. I'm UUCP. Thank you very much.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:24.800]   Unix, Unix system, copy protocol. Thank you very much. Our show today brought to you by Express
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:34.000]   VPN. You know, it's not, you know, it's not right. Netflix. That's what not right. They look at your
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.800]   location and they say, oh, you're in the US. You can only watch Netflix US and then they increase
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:43.040]   the prices. They're going to raise the prices again at the end of this month. Of course, you could
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.640]   cancel your subscription. You could say, I've watched it all. I don't want to watch anymore or
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:55.040]   you could use Express VPN. This is really, this is really awesome and get your full monies worth
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:01.680]   and then this is not illegal. I might add you fire up Netflix. It says you're in the UK or you're in the
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:06.800]   US rather and then you fire up Express VPN. There's a button on there. Now, this is the trick. I
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.280]   might tell you that if you press the button, it's going to pick the Express VPN server nearest you
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:15.680]   for best speed, but you can there's a little drop down below it. You could say, I want to be in London.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:21.840]   You do that. You refresh Netflix. All of a sudden says, oh, you're in the UK. Well, we got all
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:28.800]   these other shows you can watch or Japan or France. There's all sorts of, you know, you want to
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:36.000]   practice your Spanish? Go to Spain or Mexico. That's what's pretty amazing about Express VPN.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.480]   It's so fast. They invest in their servers, their infrastructure. And this is important. This is
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:45.840]   why you want a good VPN as opposed to a cheap VPN. They invest in their infrastructure. So they
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:54.560]   have high speed servers in over 90 countries. You can search around and watch orphan Black
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:02.960]   in the UK or friends. Yes, it's still on in the UK. Change your location. And it's fast enough.
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:07.680]   You can watch HD video. That's the amazing thing. In fact, I know a lot of people put Express VPN on
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:13.840]   their router. It works for the number of routers. And then the whole family is protected. The whole
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:18.960]   family is private. It hides your search. You know, if you're searching on Google, they don't see your
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.840]   IP address. They see Express VPNs IP address. They don't know who it is. It hides from your internet
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.080]   service provider might be logging what you're doing. So they can sell that to marketers hides
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.200]   that as well keeps you secure to nobody can nobody can attack you because you all of your
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.760]   internet traffic is encrypted all the way to the Express VPN servers. Now, I've always said this
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:45.040]   is really important to choose the right VPN because if that VPN is is engaging in improper practices,
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:51.360]   like like logging what you're doing, that's just as bad as your ISP. But I can assure you Express VPN
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:56.480]   is not regularly audited by PricewaterhouseCooper. Their privacy policy is what it says it is. And
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:00.800]   they use this. This is how committed they are. They actually wrote something they call trusted
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:06.560]   server. It's a RAM based VPN server. So when you log into that Express VPN server in the dock
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:12.400]   lands in the UK, it spins it up runs in memory sandbox. So it can't write to the hard drive cannot
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:17.440]   log you. And then when you're done, it's gone. And there's no trace of your visit literally zero
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:23.520]   trace of your visit, you can even use Express VPN. Don't tell him I told you this to watch BBC i
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:30.000]   player. Don't tell him I told you that though Express VPN no buffering high speed super secure,
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   most importantly, super private no logging be smart, stop paying for services you don't

[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:31.040]   know study from Mount Sinai. I don't know how we can turn this into something useful but the Apple
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:38.960]   Watch can predict your COVID-19 diagnosis up to a week before testing this is published in the
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:46.000]   peer reviewed Journal of Medical Internet Research or as we call it Jommer found that
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:52.960]   that's not what we call it found that wearable hardware specifically the Apple Watch can predict
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:59.200]   a positive diagnosis up to a week before the test it was called the Warrior Watch study
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:04.960]   used a dedicated Apple Watch and iPhone app included participants from the Mount Sinai staff
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:11.680]   they use the app for health data monitoring and collection they also filled out a daily survey
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:19.040]   to provide feedback on their symptoms and other factors including stress and they were able to
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:27.200]   combining that information I guess it did help to have the the survey but the biometric signal
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:34.400]   including heart rate variability that was the key was a key indicator of strain on a person's
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:41.360]   nervous system when combined with symptoms like a cough they were able to predict infections up
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:50.000]   to a week before tests heart rate variability actually this oral ring I wear also does that
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.480]   they used to be a sponsor I still wear the ring I can see heart rate variability where do you see
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.920]   it on the watch Renee I don't remember where you see that is in the I don't know what they're
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:03.040]   using I don't know if they're using the pulse oximeter or they're using they said HRV heart rate monitor
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.680]   but do you get that I don't think you normally get that information I'm just going to the health
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:16.480]   app and you can go into the health app yeah you know athletes use that to tell them
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:24.400]   their readiness yeah I see a lot of health data holy cow heart rate variability is it
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:28.640]   doesn't require a new sensor it literally is what it says the here's my is exactly how
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:34.560]   how irregular is the space between your heart beats oddly your regular is better than regular
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:39.600]   right you want more variability I think mine's there is where is it there's
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.840]   oops yeah mine 17
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:51.040]   ah how do you use this thing how does it work oh there it is there's a there's a I was looking at a
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:57.680]   Harvard Harvard uh Harvard Health uh note from uh from the Harvard blog saying that it's it's a sign
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:02.880]   of your flight or flight your body's like or flight reflects that there's more variability when you're
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:09.920]   calm than when you are like in a your photos high more hypo thalomatic activity on that cheat
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:16.000]   is it's about to chase you down yeah there's and it's still it's still apparently
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:22.320]   it's a factor that's getting a lot of traction like in 2017 there was first thinking about well
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:26.800]   that's this is a thing but what is it going to predict for us so it's it wasn't something
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:30.320]   I certainly wasn't something I was I was aware of so there's a man who's stress
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:36.560]   yeah the stress on the it's not not the kind of stress where you're feeling anxious and nervous
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:41.360]   but basically how well is your body chemically responding to what's going on inside it sometimes
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:44.720]   it's not something that you perceive it is something that there is something that's causing the entire
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:51.440]   system to go erratic do you wear an apple watch either I do not I had a loner that I never used
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:59.600]   see there's the problem well I'm just cheap but I wanted to try fitness plus um oh yeah I installed
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:04.640]   it but I didn't have a big enough screen for it and so I gave it to my husband so we could use his
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:11.280]   iPad instead of buying anyways it's all a racket sorry it's all a racket yeah that's the review
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:16.560]   it's all I don't want to know if I'm about die I kind of wanted to be a surprise yeah yeah ideally
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:23.040]   a surprise that you just wake up to one day and you did you wake up and you didn't say that when I
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:29.120]   got sent when I got sent like the first apple watch with EKG to review I'm like okay charged it did all
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:34.080]   the setup then before I put it on I just had this I don't have this moment of like calm say okay now
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:40.080]   Andy realize that when you put this watch on it might give you information in the next hour that's
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:44.800]   gonna change your life materially because you have never had EK not nothing I've been worried about
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:49.200]   it but it's like oh come on please don't tell me that I have this heart situation is gonna kill
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:54.080]   me at any second because right now I don't feel as though I have that and I'm doing I feel okay this
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:19:03.920]   is the I have I believe I have the X-ray from your sleep last night there it is that's an air pod
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:11.600]   this is a guy it's only one it's interesting because it's very close to where Andy lives in Worcester
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:19.200]   he was to Worcester man swallows the air pod while sleeping and does not realize it that headline
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:23.840]   it's just so beautifully spade for it especially but does not realize it part that's not really I
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:28.320]   never I've never slept that deeply I'm very envious apart from the ingesting something that's
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:32.160]   both expensive and health and and like again a battery that you probably should not be small
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:37.760]   this is from uh Tom so found there the house cat this is from 22 w w l p you probably watched
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:43.760]   that Andrew uh in Worcester a Worcester man lucky to be breathing today after accidentally swallowing
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:51.760]   one of his air pods Bradford go TA good good French Canadian woke up Tuesday morning noticed he had
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:57.440]   a little trouble swallowing he attributed it to a dry or sore throat and carried on with his day
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:03.440]   the day before he had been shoveling snow for two hours after the nor Easter you remember that Andy
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:08.560]   that was a nightmare he was wondering why metallic I was coming out of his mouth he says he went to
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:15.520]   sleep that night all worn out I went back in the morning and shoveled snow for an hour when I came
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:22.000]   in I tried to drink a glass of water again and couldn't says go TA at this point go TA also
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:31.920]   noticed one of his air pods was missing his family began putting clues together by that point my
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:36.560]   wife and son had gotten the idea I may have swallowed it they brought it up jokingly at first but it
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:43.280]   seemed too coincidental then I would be missing it when I knew I went to bed with it while I felt
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:49.760]   a distinct blockage in the center of my chest he went to the emergency room and much to the doctor's
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:58.080]   surprise and X-ray showed his missing air pod lodged in his esophagus he didn't chew it enough
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:05.360]   you know one shot this is a very common problem people do not chew their food sufficiently
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:10.960]   as a result they gulp they gulp and things get lodged in your esophagus they did an emergency
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:19.200]   endoscopy to remove it unknown whether the air pod continued to work after the endoscopy is
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:23.600]   that covered under apple care I don't know here it is here is the errant air pod
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:30.960]   oh let's see we're getting worried about nothing it wasn't it wasn't an air pod pro is one of the
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:35.600]   first generation oh no big deal I've lost I probably swallowed many of those I don't know where they
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:39.840]   ended up they're not anywhere the battery is probably going to dine it in a week anyway yeah
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:46.720]   yeah he said it never occurred to me that sleeping with headphones could be a safety hazard I was
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:53.280]   really quite lucky so a happy ending this man suffering errant was concerned now that the
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.960]   probably is going to appear in the next season of Ted lasso I'm thinking
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:05.360]   by the way Ted lasso for Golden Globe nominations for Jason Sudakis
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:11.680]   as actor best television series musical comedy
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:19.760]   so and and that on the rocks movie that was an apple movie too wasn't it with Bill Murray he got
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:24.400]   nominated wolf walkers which is an animated feature multiple
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:32.480]   multiple Golden Globe nominations for apple TV plus 91 people you can easily buy them
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:38.240]   it's nice but okay the how well that way but you tell me the Hollywood Foreign Press Association
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:47.440]   is only 91 people actually I think it's in the high 80s it's very very very fun press it's
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:53.200]   it's such a small it's such a small amount of amount that as film studio could easily like buy
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:57.520]   each of them a gold watch and grade with thanks for being him keep it open up a watch keep it fair
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:03.440]   it's kind of it's kind of known to be if you if you if it's advantageous for you to make sure
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:08.640]   that your network gets lots and lots of nominations there's a jig open the checkbook you'll get it
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:14.000]   well and of course they make sure that there are at least 100 categories for awards which makes it
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.040]   more easy to to find one you would like to win best actor in a TV series musical or comedy series
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:24.160]   Jason Sudeikas who was really good in Ted Lasso best performance by an actor in a supporting role
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:29.120]   in any motion picture Bill Murray and on the rocks Ted Lasso also nominated for best TV series
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:33.920]   musical or comedy wolf walkers for best motion picture animated I haven't watched that one yet but
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:41.040]   so there you go actually it's my favorite award show to watch because everybody's drunk
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:46.960]   not this year I know I'm pretty sure they'll still be drunk but they will be drunk at home
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:53.680]   on zoom maybe oh that's a they got they brought back Amy Poehler and
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:24:02.480]   Tina Fey Tina Fey to host is it not Amy Poehler is it Amy Poe I don't know I think so I should
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:07.520]   read more people magazine I don't keep up on this stuff I have to ask my wife when I want to know
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:12.560]   this stuff yeah Amy Poehler and Tina Fey who are very funny yeah but the fact that I had to
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:17.920]   remind myself that the five bloods by Spike Lee didn't get nominated for anything snubbed pretty
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:22.720]   that's pretty much all you got to say yeah and Emily and Paris did get nominated and if you'd
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:27.600]   like to have another hour long show where I discuss why that's bad I'm available yeah why Emily and
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:32.240]   Paris tell me about that I don't know that show is it a good show it was like the worst show
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:39.360]   no the worst show excuse me the worst show was on HBO Max it was the flight attendant
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:44.480]   with Kelly I loved that did you really I was very entertained which is all I really need
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:48.560]   right now because everything coming out is dark and depressing and people die and I just
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:55.440]   but you didn't like Lily Collins in Paris she had a whole season to learn how to speak French
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:02.000]   she just never did oh I won't want to watch that then what about Cobra Kai and WandaVision Leo
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:10.160]   uh what about them that also they can't be snubbed I know well one of them is this year right does
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:16.240]   it that's right yeah I'm sure it's not eligible yeah uh Rick you're a baseball everything host
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:21.440]   everything now because he insults the executives two years in a row they kept bringing him back but
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:27.520]   I think they finally you know what Tina and Amy were hysterical they really were good but you're
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:32.400]   right I forgot they're not gonna all be sitting there in the Beverly Hills Hotel and drinking
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:38.080]   heavily and stuff that's gonna be no fun did you see the five bloods Andy is it great
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.400]   yeah it's it's really good I kind of fell I kind of fell out of
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:49.600]   Spike Lee for a long time except for his documentaries but yeah it is intense it is it looks like a
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:55.680]   huge budget movie in terms of every single every single environment that they've needed to have
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:03.520]   to absolutely sell a complicated story that takes place in multiple times times they actually sold
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:10.240]   but once but more of anything else it was one of those like your what made the mistake of starting
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:16.080]   it at around 11 p.m. because two and a half hours yeah because I'm like sitting there like on the
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:21.040]   side oh my head in my hands like I'm gonna have to stay up for two or three hours after this just
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:26.720]   to make and watch cartoons because this is just so a really great intense sort of thing Netflix
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:31.840]   so yeah that's so that that was pretty it was pretty dramatic for not to get any nominations
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:38.080]   no performance no direction no pretty yeah so I think widely considered a snub is I think the
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:43.760]   phrase oh I'll have to watch it and I'm gonna watch Emily in Paris just so I can mock it with you
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:49.600]   next time Heather look forward to that in French please mock it in French do you speak French Heather
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:57.920]   okay no and now I feel silly but you never to you're not a fan so they're never lived in Paris so
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:02.880]   no and if somebody wants to pay me to move to Paris I promise I will learn French absolutely
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:11.840]   absolutely uh apple got 11 nominations as we're talking award season for the 50 second annual
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:23.360]   NAACP image awards outstanding variety show for apple music as well verzuz I haven't heard that
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:31.920]   the banker got four nominations the Oprah conversations little voice your show your favorite show Renee
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:39.600]   Central Park also got nominated I don't know am I putting words in your mouth no I Ted Lassel
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:43.920]   is my favorite I love to and this year I'm looking forward to foundation I hope I just hope they
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:50.000]   don't disappoint me that's my fault yeah I think you might I don't know that's gonna be tough I know
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:57.120]   I know I know that's so nervous did you reread it Isaac Asimov's classic science fiction I I am
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:02.800]   considering it but I don't know if I wanted that fresh in my mind I was it you John somebody reread
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:07.840]   it and said it's a little disappointing it's kind of thing we all read in high school yes and maybe
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:13.200]   doesn't age as well so maybe yeah just a lot of that stuff doesn't age really well yeah a lot of
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:18.000]   lot of science fiction does not age well Dune hold held up for me I read Dune again recently Dune
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:23.520]   is well at least the first volume is very very good yes that's a movie pandemic release ever or
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:28.640]   is it yes coming out it's going to be one of those time Warner straight to video releases later this
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:36.560]   year yeah Deneville you have soul angry so salty I he's a great director I like his stuff I like
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:42.480]   his stylistic innovation but that's another tough one to put on film I think
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:55.360]   long Twitter thread from a developer Costa Elatherio who apparently he's had a number of
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:02.560]   successful apps he says the app store has a big problem and it happened to him you and
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:08.800]   honest developer working hard to improve your IAP conversions your competitor a two million
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:14.160]   dollar a year scam running rampant yeah over the years I've worked incredibly hard to create what
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:17.680]   I think is the best Apple Watch keyboard app in the world when I started I had two gold well
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:24.560]   yeah I believe I it became the top paid app of 2020 I failed to stay ahead of the competition but
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:32.480]   not for reasons I anticipated he got copied first they made an app that appeared to fulfill the
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:37.440]   promise of a watch keyboard was practically unusable then they started heavily advertising on Facebook
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:43.440]   and Instagram and using my own promo video of my own app with my actual name on it
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:52.800]   and you have to pay it's a 400 because you can't really use the app until you pay for it
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:30:00.160]   the ends up being four to sixteen dollars a year yeah it's so gross a year they keep getting five
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:06.320]   star reviews because Costa says they're fake he says it's obvious they're fake because the app
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:10.960]   doesn't work once you pay for it and yet all these people saying oh it's great it really like it
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:16.960]   doesn't fake ratings fake reviews quickly push the scams to the top of the search results leaving
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:23.760]   honest and hardworking developers in the dust and he says this is it's not just me there are
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:30.880]   hundreds of these this happens all the time why doesn't apple fix this how come apple can't fix this
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.840]   david barnard has been beating the strum for years as well he did a great job over this
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:40.800]   week surfacing like articles from groover from like 2018 talking about the desperate need for a
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:46.240]   bunker squad on the app store because there are so many scams and they're even worse now than they
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:50.400]   used to be because they're taking advantage of something that shouldn't exist which is like weekly
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:56.080]   subscriptions there's very little need for like an absolutely terrible a weekly subscription and
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:01.680]   the apple has made tiny bits of progress like they made it harder for you to be tricked into
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:07.120]   tapping the wrong thing to authorize them and the little things like that but just the the amount
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:14.320]   of compute of pure scam apps on the app store they seem to come in waves and surges and i don't
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:17.760]   know what apple is doing but obviously it is not effective and i don't know why this isn't like
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:23.600]   a huge glowing neon priority because apple's whole thing is faith in the app store that's the
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.480]   whole promise of the app store is that it is a safe trusted place for you to spend money you know
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:33.120]   whether that's in-app purchases or direct payments for apps and this totally destroys all of that
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:39.680]   good faith equity that they've built sorry is that absolute no it's really terrible i feel so
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:45.440]   bad for cost is that app still up but there's so many of them like any time there was a popular
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:49.520]   game or something it would get cloned and there'd be a scam version of it and any category there's
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:53.920]   all these scam apps and all they do is rope you into what looks like a small like first of all i
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:57.760]   don't know why people pay subscription for stuff i will never victim blame but this stuff is not
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:01.840]   worthy of your subscription money and then they try to obfuscate the fact that it's a weekly
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:06.560]   subscription and i don't know who's falling for it but there seems like based on their sales a massive
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:11.600]   amount of people falling for these things and it does become incumbent on the platform to protect
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:16.960]   us from ourselves at a certain point well a scam app should never appear on the platform
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:21.920]   and even even if they don't have the resources to police all of them any of the apps in any of
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:27.200]   the top lists should be routinely scrutinized like daily scrutinized because there's just not that
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:32.880]   many in the top lists so i i should say that uh a week ago apple did in fact take it down
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:40.800]   that all that twitter activity brought that to their attention but they didn't take down their
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:47.760]   developer account and they have another scam called gps pedometer which is also $200 a month
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:56.720]   and it's just crazy gross 200 200 thousand dollars a month they're making it i'm sorry yeah
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:03.920]   it does it does feel like they've got enough data to track to basically have a scam app like
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:09.600]   these trigger warnings that get escalated immediately to a human review that if you have some if you
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:15.200]   have an app that's a watch app particularly that's causing that's charging and a relatively enormous
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:21.520]   amount of money per week that gets immediately checked up by your real life human being to see
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:27.440]   exactly what's going on there because yeah this there's app any any company that is
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:32.800]   trying to sell thousands upon thousands upon thousands of items in a store they have a certain
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:38.160]   amount of cover here saying that look we we don't we have an automated system for submitting we can't
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:43.200]   simply human review every single app or else we will never be able to get people developers to
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:47.520]   get their stuff on the app store but nonetheless when you have enough metrics to say this should
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:53.840]   this person this person who's working at McDonald's and making one dollar over minimum wage per hour
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:59.840]   seems to own a lot of boats for some reason perhaps we should find out if if they're they've
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:04.560]   got their hands anything else in the corporate structure this is then this is the similar
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:11.600]   sort of thing i think so a couple of proposals one obvious one is to mark our mitt suggests
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:18.240]   just eliminate the weekly subscription billing option yeah uh Dave Barnard posted part of this
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:26.080]   is apples fault because they don't give you the information you know in a clear way to understand
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:34.640]   what you're paying for he suggests redesigning the buy sheet uh so that it's clear that it you
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:40.800]   know ten bucks a week and uh you know it's it's gonna it's you get a three-day trial it's
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:47.120]   it's it needs to be more clear they do it with the the privacy uh statements they should do this
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:52.320]   with the subscription statements too are those you want to say again so those better because
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:59.280]   those are also self-reported so we're relying on these companies to to oh yeah in fact yeah in fact
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:06.960]   Jeffrey Fowler your colleague did a really good job i think of tracking down how many people lie
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:13.360]   on their privacy label like most of them apparently i was just shocked that there was no it's i
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:17.840]   guess it's like a spot check system and that might also be the case here just the pure volume of of
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:22.320]   stuff in the app store beans it's done by spot check or if it's flagged but Andy i like the idea of
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:27.440]   anything is making a certain amount of money that that should raise your little flag yeah yeah
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:33.600]   the other thing that occurred to me is this like if you if you if you go to the market uh yeah you
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:38.080]   trying to figure out how much something actually cost there is actually by mandate not only here's
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:42.800]   the here's the here's the price of the thing but here is the price per unit and i think that in
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:48.000]   addition in that little table of of price information on app store it should basically say here's how
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.720]   much this cost per year of operation and if it costs five dollars and ninety nine cents and you own
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:57.120]   it outright it will say five bucks ninety nine forever if it's if you're charging by the month
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:01.280]   it'll say here's that times 12 if you're charging by the week here is that times 52
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:08.400]   that's just it seems as though in an easy first step and yet another indication that apple i don't
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:13.120]   think that apple doesn't care i just think that the app store is such a big business for them that
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:17.360]   they really haven't planned on how difficult it's going to be to manage it and so they aren't
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:21.920]   managing it very well yeah and there's a tricky thing about apple manages your subscriptions because
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:25.520]   it's it's all lumped together and if you look at your credit card statement that's right charge
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:29.840]   you don't see it it's an extra step to go see what everything is unless you have emails turned on
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:36.080]   that's a good point so it's kind of a surprise we talked about uh jeffries uh really good work on
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:41.040]   the privacy statements last week is there an update heather as apple responded if you see
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:47.120]   any movement in that or is i don't think so not that i've heard about um i know he's staying on top of
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:54.000]   that um the slit we talked about the satisfying slime simulator which says it gathers no information
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:01.440]   but in fact it shares with facebook google and game analytics the unity software it uses
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:07.120]   provides the the inform not only your phones id but your battery level free storage space general
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:15.440]   location and volume level he contacted the satisfying slime simulator and as as of this article which
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:21.760]   is on the 29th of january he hadn't heard back i i hope that he shakes that tree and and it
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:27.040]   produces some fruit maybe apple should of course the threat is if apple does catch you you're gone
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:32.320]   but well this thing like this thing is like brand new and i'm gonna i'm i'm expecting that
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:37.280]   everyone is gonna be terrible at it even apple like especially apple but the bunker
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:43.280]   scam apps are like five years old yeah that one's been well yeah i'm getting their act together is
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:51.760]   long path somebody posted the the groover link from 2018 yeah i mean uh that's that's almost that's
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:56.640]   two years ago this should have been fixed by now there's something that apple already does have
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:01.120]   in place they could use i mean they have this whole team that does the uh the editorial side of reviewing
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:06.480]   apps and writing them up um five five apps we looked at this week and if if they could find a way to
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:12.160]   sort out things they've actually looked at versus things that were just sort of uploaded on their own
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:16.560]   that would make the app store so much more usable and useful to people and it's also like to the
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:21.360]   apple theoretically unified the app store like before it was split between multiple different
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:24.880]   organizations which meant that a lot of stuff was just not their problem not that they didn't
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:29.200]   want it but they just assumed somebody else was handling it and then phil shiller became head of
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:33.760]   the app store but he's really head of the app store app and the u.s. app store and all the
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:38.800]   international app stores are still run by ed cues organization and even beyond that like a lot of
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:44.000]   the business infrastructure has been moved around so like i think it's it's a huge problem but it's
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.160]   also one that's just never never had that that one person whose job it is to wake up in the morning
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:54.800]   and see what developers and users are angry about and to make sure that all they do that day is fix
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:01.440]   anything that people are upset about it's pretty much an endless battle to eliminate scammers from
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:05.760]   the world it's just full of them but you gotta make them work harder though you gotta make them
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.920]   make them harder yes make it a little harder at the very minimum you should drive them towards
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:16.080]   the android platform where they belong really yes go get on that play store it's so much better
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:20.720]   for you really google could use the revenue and all in their in their annual reports
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:28.720]   we're just progressive web apps all right i think it's time for our picks of the week
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:35.280]   um let's start a picks of the week with our guest heather kelly so great kelly so great to have you
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:44.640]   from the washington post san francisco based tech report her her her and heather kelly on
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:49.440]   the twitter what do you so i've never seen how you guys do this you want to just tell you my
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:55.360]   pick of the week yeah i know what it is because i use it also and i loves it i so i discovered this
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:59.600]   recently when writing an article about subscriptions which is obviously a passion of mine because i'm
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:06.480]   boring and the app is called true bill and it's it kind of goes through you link it to your credit
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:10.960]   card accounts and your bank accounts and it will pick out what the reoccurring statements are and
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:16.160]   this just does something that i've been annoyed for years that mint doesn't do like tell me what
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:23.440]   ridiculous things are monthly yes or annual and cancel them for me it can do that and it also has a
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:28.640]   cool thing which doesn't really apply to me but it it can try and negotiate some of your bills down
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:35.200]   yeah i i've never used it and i was curious if you had because it doesn't so it has a list right now
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:38.880]   a thing it's it can negotiate down and a lot of them are big name cable companies but like i use
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:45.120]   monkey brains here which is a small isp and they very amusingly have the new york times and the
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:50.960]   washington post on there so if you'd like to negotiate down your subscription you could do that um i
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:55.520]   don't think they'd appreciate it if i tried that yeah hey can you can you can i pay less for my
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:00.800]   free subscription it seems like i'm paying too much but you know what you know look at these are some
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:04.960]   of them you paid i don't even i'm embarrassed even show this but a huge amount of money to
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:12.000]   Verizon wireless that seems a bit high we've seen 85 percent success rate negotiating bills like
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.760]   this so i you know i don't know i just like the reporting i like the information and i agree with
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:23.520]   you Heather just knowing that you've got a subscription uh it helps a lot um because we've
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:28.480]   all been signing up for so many like yeah free trial i mean one day apple tv is going to charge
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:33.520]   me and i want to know about it i knew that netflix increased my bill because they actually told me
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:40.320]   bill increase netflix increased by a buck bill increase audible increased by a buck bill increase
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:46.560]   google phy increased by 31 cents i don't know why that is team mobile went up so you know foreign
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:52.480]   transaction fee i'm gonna have to check that one i wonder what that is uh so these are this is
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:59.440]   you're right i use um a mint like tool call personal capital same idea and uh but true bill
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:04.720]   does give you information you don't get now do you feel i worry always when i see these because
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:10.400]   i for a long time i used to unroll me for getting rid of um email subscriptions and then i found
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:16.720]   out they were going through all my gmail and doing nefarious things with it um do you trust true bill
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:24.720]   i mean do i trust anybody no i talked i talked to the founder uh did you oh good and it seems a
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:27.760]   little more on the app and up because i did look out a few of these to pick the one that i kind of
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:33.280]   wanted to mention in the story i mean the problem is you're giving anybody access to your bank account
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:37.440]   and if you talk to the banks they'll tell you that these apps are paying your account constantly
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:42.000]   throughout the day when you're not even using it so it's always a risk to to let somebody have
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.440]   that information but i'm cheap and just want to save some money so uh and they do use plaid
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:52.320]   or one of those back end services so it's not like they're holding your credentials true bill doesn't
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:57.120]   hold the credentials they use a third party service which is the same service the banks use so they
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:01.680]   already know all the stuff anyway everybody already knows everything about it yeah yeah yeah your
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:07.600]   your article uh is uh in the washington post came out uh i think the last week or the week before
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:14.080]   um how to and it covers all of these so uh that's a i i think that's a great tip and i actually have
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:19.520]   been i have never mentioned it because i i didn't do the the good work that you did
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:24.480]   researching it's it's you know origin stuff but i've been very happy with it and i
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:28.800]   it's big on tiktok too is it big and a lot of advertising dollars so everybody's
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:34.560]   on tiktok is like a really sick and chewy little ads there you go i should watch less tiktok
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:41.280]   and the inacopik of the week very very simple app uh it's called battery buddy you can get it
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:46.400]   battery buddy dot app and all you need to know about it is it's tagline like imagine the the
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:53.120]   the the macbook battery indicator but cute meaning so it's a battery indicator but instead but
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:57.120]   and where is the way to think it is with height well but it has a cute little face so that when
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:01.440]   it's really charged it's smiling when it's sort of halfway through it's just sort of like non-committal
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:05.920]   when it's down it's like sort of frowny but then when you plug it when you plug it in and it's charging
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:13.200]   it it smiles again and i'm sorry it's it's all it says by the way right this is aspirational for
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:19.600]   the power of creative computing to basically put something onto people's desktops it's free it works
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:25.040]   it gives you if it gives you a fractional amount of additional joy well that's some joy you did not
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:30.000]   have of course the day and so i'm completely completely supportive of it all the other cool
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.120]   thing is that uh there is twitter feed and also through the app itself i did not know that
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:41.840]   menu icons can actually animate so if you when you plug in to a source of power it actually animates
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:48.240]   the plug appearing on the on the indicator so this is this is really really adorable i'm just
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:53.280]   afraid i'm sorry there isn't a you know here's an address to send a small box of money to this
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:56.960]   developer because i would i would like to send a small box of money to this developer just to
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:03.120]   encourage this mind to complete to continue to divert itself into cool apps i can install on my mac
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:09.280]   by the way heather i forgot to mention and i i think this is good news that the post has
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:17.120]   hired eight new tech reporters oh thank you hey guys we're hiring it's a couple editors mostly
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:23.360]   reporters dcsf um and we're casting a wide net so if anybody wants to apply and they'll all work for
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:28.320]   you right you'll be the boss right no so i've i've been a boss before and i've decided i don't ever
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:33.680]   want to never never ever handy i think might agree with me it's it's just a much happier existence yeah
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:40.560]   yeah yeah i i i like to i prefer to be the causeer of stress not the person who receives the stress it's
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:46.160]   and this other thing i'm just i just throw this out there if the one who most ever wants a podcast
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:53.360]   network it would be a very easy acquisition i mean i've got Jeff no he's got some free
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:59.120]   just tell Jeff to send me that bigger box of money yeah in in-flight entertainment for blue
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.600]   origin there you go yeah when you're going out of space on an instagram you need mac break with
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:09.600]   weekly rene richie pick of the week so mine is entirely self-serving this week because i
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:15.440]   finally finished my first nebula original which is a slightly longer form slightly more involved
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:22.080]   video and in this case i decided to interview and put together a bunch of youtube creators
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:28.400]   talking about the influence the iphone it had on them personally and professionally from
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:34.480]   the original keynote to how they first first iphone they got their favorite iphones how they use it in
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:40.080]   their daily lives in their careers and what they want to see from it next and it ended up being a
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:45.360]   20-minute video that took a very long time but i am very very happy there was no question that was
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:52.320]   oh you interviewed marquez nice we're gonna make some history together you interviewed steve
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:58.880]   iphone oh really just he has changed i mean my life in so many ways it was the keynote every
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:07.200]   group and had always wanted apple to deliver nice the one single thing that's had the absolute
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:13.280]   biggest impact on my life and the lives of so many creators in the tech space if not the world
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:22.720]   began on january nine two thousand seven so all you have to do is go to uh watch nebula dot com and
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:28.720]   as you can see i'm not signed in uh and uh you can sign up what is there a cost to this
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:34.880]   yeah it's i forget what it is i think it's five dollars a month but if you sign up for curiosity
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:41.360]   stream which is like oh fifteen dollars a year you get nebula for free oh nice oh curiosity is very
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:46.400]   affordable slash for nay richie do they then you get both of them do they own is it the same company
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:52.080]   no so nebula is a bunch of us creators started nebula as a way to create videos that wouldn't do
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:57.520]   well on on um youtube but curiosity stream loves educational content and we're primarily
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:01.840]   educational youtubers so we we worked out this deal where we would sort of co-promote
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:06.800]   and it's worked out really really well for us yeah and a good deal with curiosity stream that's
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:10.880]   great and i made very very deliberately and surely that it is not a video filled with just a bunch
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:15.840]   of white dudes again so there is a wide assortment of there is at least one woman and one black guy
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:19.920]   i noticed no there's there's there's a group and there's a group and we have people talking about
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:25.600]   accessibility and about all of the different facets of what it meant to a wide wide range of
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:32.000]   creators that's actually a challenge isn't it because um uh everybody uses iPhones and there's
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.680]   all sorts of ways same thing with the apple watches all sorts of different ways people use it and
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:41.440]   find with andrew edwards and jackaland dallas and carolina millinese talks about the analyst
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:46.400]   especially because she was in europe at the time so she and it was nocea everything and
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:52.400]   it's and how her daughter's second word was iphone not mama it was data then iphone that's depressing
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:59.440]   that's really really depressing but it's just wonderful stories from a wonderful group of people
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:04.800]   nice well that's it for mac break weekly speaking of a wonderful group of people so nice to have
