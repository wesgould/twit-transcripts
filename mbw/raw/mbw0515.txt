[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.000]   Show where we talk about the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.440]   Alex Lindsey's here joining us from his dungeon in San Rafael.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.640]   How are you, sir?
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.560]   It's a nice dungeon, though.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.600]   It's got a lot of walls.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.640]   There's not a lot of stone.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.240]   Some call those padded walls, but OK, soft.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.400]   They keep on telling me they're nice walls.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.560]   I was like, if you seem like a lot like padded walls,
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.640]   then they do let me out of the vest for the show.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.360]   Is it underground?
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.240]   It's not underground.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.600]   It feels that way.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.080]   Yeah, it does.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.080]   One of the reasons I ask--
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.600]   Do you like it that way?
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.040]   Our new studios-- the studios now are really nice
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.040]   because as you know, you've been here many times.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.360]   In fact, you're even more in that used to work
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.560]   in this building, Windows, which is rare for a studio.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.120]   Really annoying.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.600]   Well, it's hard to light.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.280]   So the new studio has no windows.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.720]   And I just realized, oh, I wonder how I'm going to react
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.360]   to that because I really like the idea
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.880]   that I could see the outdoors now.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.160]   And I don't know if I'm going to like having six or eight hours
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.720]   a day in a windowless room.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.360]   But it's OK, especially if the walls are nicely padded.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.280]   I don't like-- I don't like--
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.400]   no, I don't like windows.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.160]   Neither do I.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.600]   Well, the problem is windows give me a sense of what time it is.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.720]   And then it reminds me of--
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.240]   No, editors hate windows.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.880]   So it-- so I like it to just be controlled.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.840]   So I'm just working.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.840]   I'm in my little space.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.880]   And it's not connected to a certain time.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.840]   And then I don't feel bad that I'm
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.960]   working into the middle.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.080]   Traffic designers, editors, gamblers.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.320]   They all hate windows.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.520]   Yes.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.160]   Renee Richie is here from imore.com, which is of latemanpokimongo.com.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.680]   Sorry, Leo.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.400]   I'm just trying to capture a very rare Laporta Mon.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.240]   I just-- I keep missing him.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.120]   I love how you guys, even though you're in Canada, jumped on this.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.920]   Although, Serenity is in the US.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.480]   And she did most of it.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.720]   Most of us are in the US.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.800]   I'm one of the few who's doomed to be.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   You and Georgia were all over it, right?
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.200]   Georgia was away camping.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.880]   And now she's all upset about it.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.080]   But yeah, so Daniel Bader is the other one who's in Canada.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.800]   Serenity was all over it.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.320]   Laurie Gill, Micah Sargent.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.480]   Everyone just dropped everything, came in.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.480]   It was interesting to watch all of the tech blogs go Pokemon, go crazy.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.200]   There's Georgia playing it with you.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.560]   Well, I mean, the funny thing is that--
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.520]   we can get into it on the show.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.600]   But there was a lot of anger, resentment, and, oh, why are you covering this?
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.960]   And that was from the 0.5% of people who consider themselves a tech elite.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.360]   Meanwhile, tens of millions of people were having the time of their lives
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.320]   and just wanted to know how to play better and easier.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.560]   And I think that once in a while, we need to reorient ourselves
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.880]   with the rest of the popular--
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.720]   Well, I for one read all the articles, because they don't give you any instruction
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.360]   on how to play the game, which is smart.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.120]   That's the new thing is not teach anybody anything about all of these.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.000]   Serenity was out all day trying to figure out
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.080]   how to get each Pokemon.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.960]   I mean--
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.360]   I'm not in a hurry.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.480]   I'm going to enjoy this for a while.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.440]   Andy Naka is also here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.640]   Great to see you.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.200]   Great to see you as well.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.480]   I saw this.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.040]   I saw a talk about Pokemon suddenly, like, research all over Twitter for reasons
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.480]   that I, at the time, didn't understand.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.840]   And then I found out what it was.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.760]   And then what I didn't understand is, wait a minute.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.840]   So lots and lots of people are having a lot of fun with the game that they enjoy.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.600]   And their enjoyment of this thing doesn't affect you in the least.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.560]   You always should be careful about making a statement that translates to other people
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.800]   or having a good time.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.120]   And this offends me in some fashion.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.040]   But if you don't want--
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.680]   I mean, if you're not playing for any number of perfectly good reasons,
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.000]   it must be a little annoying that every tech journal in the world is now just obsessed.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.560]   Even like, I'm watching the Nightly Business Report on the stock market,
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.840]   because the Pokemon stock is at its highest point, it's 1983.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.800]   And so it is a business story as well.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.600]   And I think part of the reason in the United States certainly that we were really welcomed
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.840]   it on Wednesday is it had been such a rough week that got even rougher the following day.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.840]   And so having something a little lighter and fun that brought people out of their houses
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.480]   into public spaces, talking about light things and fun things, was more than welcome this
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.040]   week or this past week.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.160]   So there's a lot of reasons.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.880]   And the guy who-- the CEO of Niantic, which created this, they're the folks who-- he came
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.240]   from Keyhole, which was the satellite mapping company that Google bought to add satellite
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.640]   mapping to Google Earth and to Google Maps.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.360]   Then he and some of his engineers, I think, said, hey, Google, we got some ideas to add
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.400]   using mapping in a recreational way.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.720]   They created a company within Google called Niantic.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.600]   They did Field Trip, which was an interesting but ultimately kind of annoying app that told
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.920]   you points of interest as you walked around town, actually spoke them out loud to you.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.200]   Then they did Ingress, which is very popular.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.600]   I know Father Robert walked hundreds of miles playing Ingress.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.200]   A few of the people around here got the Ingress bug.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.200]   I tried to play it.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.000]   It was a little opaque, a little complicated.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.720]   Our guys in Rwanda play it.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.720]   There's a place right out there.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   There's a little dark, I think.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.880]   Some of the hotels that they keep on taking back some other team.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:54.200]   Yeah, I didn't like the thing that you would go up to government buildings.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.080]   And then the thing would say hacking government building, and then you would be doing these
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.080]   things out front.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   It seemed dangerous.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   Yes.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.080]   You know?
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.200]   I just-- so I kind of-- and it was also a case, and I bet you that people feel this
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.200]   way now that if you didn't get in early, like all of the pokey stops and the gym-- not
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.200]   the stops-- the gyms are all immediately occupied by avid players who spend a lot of
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   time.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.200]   And if you don't spend a lot of time-- and Ingress was the case-- the thing about Pokemon
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.000]   is at least it's light, fun, and lively.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.200]   And it appeals particularly to 20-somethings who played Pokemon, the Nintendo games or
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.440]   the card games in their--
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.440]   Suge nostalgia.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.440]   --in their view.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.280]   You're that age, right?
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.280]   Did you play Pokemon as a kid?
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.360]   I mean, I was always saying this, but I always preferred Digimon to Pokemon, and I guess
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.680]   I backed the wrong horse in the ultimate.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.680]   I thought that was just a much better property, but now it's gone nowhere in Pokemon.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.680]   It's everywhere.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.400]   But yeah, the minute you hear the theme song, you just think of your childhood.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.400]   So it's-- so you know?
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.680]   It's got very powerful vectors.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.880]   For me, it's my kid's childhood, because Henry was really into it.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.840]   I remember we had to stop at 7/11s every time we went by to buy a new pack of Pokemon
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.840]   cards.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.840]   He played the card game, which was actually-- I thought-- I encouraged him.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.240]   It was like magic.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.600]   I think it was a good, challenging, and interesting card game.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.960]   They did a lot of card trading, but I remember that as a kid baseball card trading.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.120]   It didn't seem so very different.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.120]   So I encouraged that as a passion of his.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:23.160]   The funny thing is when I texted him when this became all the rage he's 21 now, he poo-pooted,
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.960]   because I think it reminded him of his child.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.960]   It was like two childhoods for him.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.960]   So he said, oh, yeah.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.400]   Finally, they came up with something to get the nerds out of their basement.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.080]   So one of our most popular articles is how to do Pokemon Go without having to walk anywhere.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.920]   So I mean, go figure.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.600]   How do you do it without walking anywhere?
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   You have a lot of incense.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.040]   I forget what those things are called.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.640]   The lures, a lot of incense and lures.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.640]   Well, we're lucky.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.640]   We have a Poke stop across the street.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.080]   So yesterday, somebody put a lure in it.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.520]   A lure draws Pokemon so you can just relax, sit around.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.240]   They come to you.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.560]   But what also comes to you is a bunch of players.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.640]   There are all these people skulking and storeways going.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.280]   And now we go, Pokemon!
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.280]   And then you say, what team are you on?
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.280]   And sometimes I've had a number of conversations with people around Petaluma.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.280]   And boy, you see a lot of people walking around.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.280]   Are they Jet's Leo?
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.280]   Are they when you are a jet?
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.280]   You're a jet.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.280]   No.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.280]   No.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.280]   Everybody's pretty jolly about it.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.280]   I stole somebody's yellow team's gym yesterday.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.280]   And I saw them sitting on the picnic table at the park across from it.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.280]   And I said, I just got this gym.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.280]   What team are you on?
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.280]   He said, yeah, that was mine.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.280]   And it was fine.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.280]   It wasn't, I think, fisticuffs or anything.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.280]   Well, that was the point.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.280]   My colleague Russell Holly, he lives in Maryland.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.280]   He went out to the big park to see how many people were playing.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.280]   Because he didn't want to assume that it was getting people out and getting them together.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.280]   And they were.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.280]   There were just tons of people from all over the place.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.280]   And there were groups of people who had nothing in common.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.280]   But Pokemon were sort of brought together in this sort of collective moment.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.280]   So I think we could agree.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:53.280]   And the CEO of Niantic said that was the goal of the game.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.280]   Get people out and about walking around much like Ingress, talking to one another.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.680]   There's a third goal that's hidden, which is that all of your mileage is recorded in
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.680]   kilometers.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.080]   And I think it's a secret plot to get the United States to convert to the metric system.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.480]   You're one of three countries left, Leah.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.980]   We'll get you.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.180]   By the way, only three countries so far can play Pokemon go legitimately.
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.920]   That's the US, New Zealand and Australia.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.680]   And they've slowed down the international rollout because they can't keep the servers
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.680]   up.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.360]   It's very much like are the early days of Twitter with the fail whale.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.360]   It's always.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.360]   Did you see the metrics?
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.320]   They were about to pass Android active users on, sorry, Twitter users on Android.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.560]   They were more popular as a search term than porn.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.120]   Like how often does that happen?
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.120]   And just the growth spike.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.120]   I've never seen a girl.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.120]   I've seen iPhone launches.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.120]   I've seen Google launches.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.680]   I've never seen a spike like that.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.840]   Have we, is this unprecedented?
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.120]   Is this, or is this like flappy birds say?
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.360]   Oh, this is way bigger.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.800]   I mean, flappy birds was interesting.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.160]   And maybe we did like three or four articles on it.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.440]   But I don't know if Google got caught by surprise too.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.280]   I was just trying to backfill search, but they were taking anything that anybody would
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.280]   write.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.280]   And then of course, like yesterday, the business pubs woke up and Wall Street Journal is all
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.280]   over it.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.280]   And it's for reasons.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.280]   It's just the demand demand.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:06.400]   I've never ever seen demand like this for any form of connected product or product.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.840]   It went from you haven't heard it didn't exist to it's all anybody's talking about.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.600]   That's the biggest success that anything can have.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.280]   I can't think of other.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.280]   This morning, this morning, yesterday morning, it was like monologue jokes everywhere.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:25.000]   Yeah, Stephen Colbert had a really good one saying that its developers have done the
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   impossible.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   It's invented a phone game.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.400]   You can't play on the toilet.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.640]   I felt pretty excited about it.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.960]   I was looking for a new game.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.040]   In fact, I said this a couple of weeks ago, I need an there's no, I don't, there's nothing
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.480]   underneath like the poke, yeah, the Pokemon like is something that attracts a lot of people,
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.480]   which is why Ingress probably didn't take off to the same extent.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.960]   But the technology underneath it is fascinating.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.720]   You have this augmented reality and you have a way of interacting with a virtual world
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.720]   around you.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.080]   And this is all super interesting stuff.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.160]   And if it gets that more into the mainstream faster, I think that's a wonderful thing.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:00.400]   It's bad news for Apple's iOS 10 beta because if you do the iOS 10 beta on your iPhone,
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.800]   their augmented reality stops working.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   It's still working for me.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.960]   Like it works like 90% of the time.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.160]   It says it can't detect the phone's orientation.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.160]   So we're going to knock it.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.160]   I go on a.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.160]   Oh, I just ignore it.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.160]   I just click.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.160]   Okay.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.160]   And it's fine.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.160]   Oh, okay.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.160]   Yeah, I've had zero problems because once in a while I can't see the creature like I
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.160]   turned it off, killed the creature, went back and it was fine.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.280]   There is a bug and I don't know if it's iOS 10 related.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:29.360]   I don't think it is where you catch a Pokemon and you know, you catch these creatures with
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.800]   this Pokey balls, little bit ghost busters goes to the ball.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.040]   It falls there, it struggles a little bit and then you get it.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.040]   But I haven't had this problem on Andrew, but on iOS, it fairly frequently freezes at
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.040]   that point.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.160]   I think if the servers go down simultaneously and you have to force close it to start the
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.160]   game.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.160]   I haven't had that.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.160]   You haven't had that.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.160]   Maybe you're better in Canada.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.300]   Maybe the only thing that I see in the complaint about is that some people got really nervous
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.480]   because of the Google account permissions on iOS.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.160]   And I just made a secondary Google account and went on with my life.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.000]   So here's the story on that.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.240]   And this was an IANTIC says this is a bug and they're going to push a fix.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.800]   You can sign up in one of two ways.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.280]   They have a Pokemon trainer club.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.800]   You can sign up through that, which is, you know, kind of more traditional email.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.800]   Which wasn't working for me for most of the weekend because again, they're swamped.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.440]   And so many of us just chose to use our Google account.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.360]   Normally when you do OAuth, the Google account, you get a page that says, "Here's the permissions.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.640]   Do you allow this?"
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.040]   I did not get that as I remember when I signed up.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.080]   And so then I checked on my Google account.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.480]   You could quickly do this too.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:37.960]   If you check your connected apps with Google, you can see what permissions apps have.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.960]   And the highest level of permissions is basically all access.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.480]   It can read and write your email.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.120]   It can do anything with your Google account except change the password.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.160]   And this has those permissions.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.280]   It doesn't need those permissions.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.920]   It's too bad that they made this mistake, but they say they're going to fix that.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:03.760]   So if you go to the page that says apps connected to your account, you can go through them.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:09.480]   Now a browser is going to have full access to your Google account because, of course,
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.880]   if you want it to open Gmail and look at Gmail, it has to be able to do that.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.440]   But you'll notice in the operating system, same thing.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.880]   But only a few apps have that kind of full access.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.840]   Most of the time they have limited access, but here's Pokemon Go.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.640]   It has full account access.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.920]   So you can email drive photos.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.920]   Everything.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.360]   Now they say, "Oh, that was an error.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.760]   We're not going to take advantage of it.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.960]   We're going to push a fix out."
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:39.120]   But if you're worried, you could do what Renee did, which is remove the app connection.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.480]   You see there's a big remove button and then sign up with a different Google account or
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.480]   try it.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.480]   It's super easy to make.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.280]   It took me all of two minutes to make a dummy account and sign back.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.440]   I don't want to be paranoid, Leo, but if you were a giant evil movie company and you
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.680]   did want to map every single person on Earth, giving them a fantastic game is the best way
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.680]   to do it.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.600]   A lot of people are concerned about that because, in fact, Jonathan Zadarski, one of our favorite
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:07.680]   Apple security gurus, said, "Boy, they've figured out a way to get the GPS coordinates
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.320]   of every human on the planet."
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.320]   But so what?
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.240]   Every fun, loving human on the planet, Leo.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.200]   But the grummy people are just fine.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.200]   What do you do with that?
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   I don't think that's...
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.280]   Well, but that's the question.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:23.200]   It's very, very smart that every time a really cool new game or really cool new photo app
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:28.960]   or anything appears and they're not charging money for it to at least just ask yourself,
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:34.640]   what is the purpose of this thing from the developer's point of view?
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.640]   You shouldn't necessarily go into full alert mode when you find out that it has access
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.960]   to Google, but because, again, new release, it could be just a mistake.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.800]   But these are questions that you really, really should be asking yourself every time
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.120]   you use something.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:51.880]   There's never forget that you are giving this app an unknown operator's access to your
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.680]   location, perhaps access to other data off of your phone.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:01.240]   And you were probably so dazzled by the dancing cartoon figures that they're reporting
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.120]   to the accept the terms of agreement and let's have fun together thing that you didn't
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.720]   know what's going on.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.720]   And it's also a good...
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.080]   A lot of really good things are happening, I think, because of this game, including people
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.040]   going out and seeing getting some vitamin D into their systems.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   But one of them is that a lot of people who are terrified of Google don't understand that
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.520]   well there is, you go to security.google.com, you can basically look at everything that's
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.760]   going on and say, "No, I don't want that to happen anymore."
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.760]   "Boop, you're gone."
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.640]   And like Renee said, it's easy to...
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.680]   If you know how things work, it's very easy to simply create dummy Gmail accounts and dummy
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.680]   Google accounts.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.280]   You actually have several Google accounts for different purposes.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.320]   And so informed is best shielded.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:48.960]   We should point out that this is a free meme game because it has in app purchases.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:54.720]   Just like Simpson's tapped out or we rule, you probably strongly incentive to end up
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.720]   buying some coins with real money.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.280]   I just wanted to point out Leo, there's a secondary advantage using a dummy account.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.200]   And that is some people are getting frequent log outs and trying to log back in and that
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.000]   gets flagged by two FA as almost like an attack because you're doing it too often and they
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.040]   get rate limited and then the locked out.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.480]   So if you are seeing flakiness or anything like that, it's easier to just move it to
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.440]   an account you don't care about.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.240]   My big thing is I have a dummy account that I use for most every log ins that is a game
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.160]   and that keeps everybody disconnected from most of my stuff.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.360]   And if someone hacked into that, I guess they'd take over all of my gaming, but that
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.360]   would be about it.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.600]   Yeah, if I look at my apps connected to my account, most games use, connect like this
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.560]   board defenders to Google Play and that's how you would have a gaming account.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.380]   But I understand why they wanted more than that because what's nice about using the Google
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.680]   account for Cookie Mango is I can use it on an iPhone or Android phone and it's the same
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.680]   character.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.000]   It's cross platform, which it wouldn't be if we're Google Play connection.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.120]   And I like it also because it's not connected in the same way like Facebook really bothers
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.800]   me when they say, and we want a list of your Facebook friends and we want to list of all
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   those things.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:06.040]   But I'm saying any of them I prefer to always use my Google, you know, I suspect they will
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:11.480]   do that though because they're talking about ways to team up and know what team your friends
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.480]   are on.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.560]   They're talking about additional, you know, be able to trade Pokemon back and forth,
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:22.040]   which is a big part of the gameplay in the card game.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.720]   And I imagine they'll add many of those features.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.640]   So I wonder, you know, how many permissions they'll want.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.760]   And if you do look, you should look at your apps connected to your account as Andy said,
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.640]   security.google.com.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.040]   You'll notice there are apps that have full permission.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.760]   All your browsers do your operating system.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.240]   I have Ubuntu, for instance, has full access.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.040]   And to Google's credit, they pop up a request you're asking you to look at the stuff periodically,
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.480]   which I really like.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:50.040]   So I mean, it's not unprecedented to have full access to your Google account, but it is
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:54.360]   I would say I'm president for an app and a game to do that.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.080]   And in fact, I don't have any other the only things that have full access are my browsers
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.080]   and operating systems.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.120]   It's like the radio shack.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.080]   What do you need my phone number just to sell me a set of batteries?
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.000]   Yeah, you don't need to know that I know for a fact that you're selling this information
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.200]   to the Russian National is like, no, it's like, do you need this information?
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   No.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.920]   Okay, that I'm going to opt not to give it to you.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.960]   Just like every time you buy something online, the big form is you really need to know
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:26.120]   my PayPal information and you need to know my address and maybe you.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.360]   But it's like when you start asking what's your what's your Twitter handle?
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.360]   What's this?
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.360]   What's that?
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.960]   Try leaving things blank because you don't, you know, don't give people information that
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.040]   they don't you don't think they need.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.520]   And if they insist on getting it asked them why they need that information.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:44.240]   Yeah, you don't tell somebody is, you know, you don't have to worry about it getting leaked.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:49.160]   There are also cranky people who many, many of our viewers who would like not to hear
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.160]   about Pokemon anymore.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.840]   There is a Chrome extension that you can add to your Chrome never to see Pokemon again.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:00.080]   And at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, there are three Poke stops inside the
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:07.080]   museum and they have asked visitors, please, it's inappropriate here to not catch a Pokemon.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:15.000]   There also been some private homes that are gyms and that is also attracting people and
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.920]   there is a there is a mechanism I think you documented on I'm more for removing your your
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.400]   place from just your house if you don't want people gathered around your doorstep, which
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   is totally right.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.400]   Completely reasonable.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.800]   Could you put a law and like I can imagine putting a Lord and it's on and having a cranky
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.240]   neighbor and putting a law in front of their house just, you know, the Washington Post
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:42.160]   interviewed one Holocaust Museum visitor who was playing the game and asked her Angie a
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:50.480]   37 year old visitor said it's not like we came here to play, but got to catch them all.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.960]   Okay.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:57.400]   I'm wondering if like how long is this going to go for?
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:03.320]   Is this a bad is this a I think this might have some staying power to be honest with you.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.760]   Not especially an antique can evolve it like if my antique does nothing with it is probably
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.280]   going to go, you know, the way of the flappy bird, but if they if they do start doing really
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.400]   interesting things with it and bringing more of the Pokemon elements in it and especially
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.000]   as other countries come online because there are some there are many big big countries
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.680]   that haven't launched yet that'll at least keep them going with some momentum.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:25.120]   You can bet when I go on my tour of the Baltic in September, I'll be bringing my my Pokemon
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.120]   go.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.120]   He's so cold Leo.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.120]   He's so cold.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.120]   I hope so.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.920]   Hermitage in St. Petersburg is a pokey Jim.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.120]   I'd like to take it over.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.120]   You'll be you can you can you can you can he's Jim.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.120]   He's Jim.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.240]   The Pokemon you can slice them open and crawl inside for warmth like the time like on the
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.240]   time.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.440]   I need the time time Pokemon.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.440]   I have to admit that now it's like one of those things that there was a I was had a
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:53.240]   long line yesterday at a post office or whatever and I which I don't do very often.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.000]   I don't know what to do and I was like, well, I wonder if there's anything around here.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Oh, over there.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.640]   I can go over there and grab some, you know, grabs and new ones.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.640]   So I think the game mechanics are team.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:10.280]   Yeah, I think there's enough there to to keep people entertained for some time.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:17.120]   So I will I will only do I will only do one boring old person comment, not not a complaint
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:24.080]   but a comment that from my own life, there was a time two or three years ago when it sounds
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.320]   like the dumbest thing ever.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.320]   It occurred to me.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.800]   I'm I'm I'm on a I'm on a tram to take me from like the airport to airport parking.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.400]   And of course, the first thing I do is like grab my phone like, okay, only got four minutes
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.560]   of four, four percent battery left.
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.320]   What am I going to do with this four percent battery?
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:43.080]   And only then after that many years, I realized, you know, Andy, putting your phone in your
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.080]   pocket and just like staring off into space for five minutes is an option here.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.640]   No, never.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:55.320]   You might even consider that a challenge to yourself that can you just like think of
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:59.640]   nothing for so all I'm saying is to have enjoy enjoy the game.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:04.120]   Don't forget that, you know, spending a few minutes in line and just looking at the people
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.400]   in line and enjoying the enjoying the 1922 styling of the ceiling is an option.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.520]   Just just make sure it's an option.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:17.080]   I think it's not unusual for people to consider boredom a spur to creativity.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.840]   I think that that's that's kind of accepted lore.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.000]   Is that state that's actually a goal in many societies?
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.600]   Yeah, is because that'll spur the creativity.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:32.560]   So we live in a society where we are to steal Neil Postman's term, amusing ourselves to
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.560]   death.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.760]   We're counter Buddhists.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.760]   I can I can I can say that there there's there's so many reasons why not not replacing
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:45.240]   my car has led to really positive things in my life.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:51.960]   One of them is that by taking the bus and and getting there in like 40 minutes instead
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.160]   of 12 or 13 minutes.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:58.680]   It means that I have time at the waiting for the bus stop that I'm doing nothing.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.400]   I have time writing on the bus where I might be reading a book, but I also might be doing
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.400]   nothing.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:08.360]   And this has had a really intense cumulative calming effect on my life that I have so much
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:12.360]   time programmed in in which I'm not responsible for not killing people.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.760]   I'm not worried about not going to get there.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.640]   If I go take this exit, I might be able to get that a little bit faster.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:22.000]   It's all this time that I have that is spent just I'm going to simply just simply look
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   at the side of the road.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:30.080]   Go, you know, also also I did find some kid dropped his sweet ass Texas instrument calculator.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.080]   Oh, no, he's he was on the way to the SAT test.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.680]   Yeah, his exams are not so well.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.680]   You are.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:41.920]   And so and so had I had I been playing Pokemon, I would have noticed that it's $13 value.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.160]   Unless unless Pikachu was on top of it.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.880]   I'm finding them everywhere.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.080]   They're just all over the place.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.080]   I think I write this game to run in this.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.080]   The Apple store.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.080]   There's a Pikachu.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.080]   Yeah, right on the Apple area.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.280]   Oh, man, testing the whole the watch.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:03.600]   Nowhere these places aren't they're just I mean, iPads, you know who benefits from this,
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.160]   of course, is the battery people like anchor the battery manufacturers because it's such
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.000]   a battery drain and the businesses who are paying for lures to get people to come.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.800]   Hey, I'm telling you that I have a drink.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.840]   I saw our local bookstore, which is brilliant.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.840]   I mentioned this before the show.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.600]   But I'll say it again in the show that the local bookstore posted on Instagram, we're
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:25.840]   setting a lure at 2 p.m. this afternoon come by, have a cup of coffee, read a book and
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.120]   catch some Pokemon and what a brilliant marketing.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.360]   How long does the lore last half an hour?
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.800]   It's very desirable though, because it's not much.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:40.200]   So what if I were Starbucks in our coffee shop, I would be doing that every day at whatever
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.200]   the post schedule.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.760]   Yeah, I could say like a 10 a.m. rather than 80 eight a.m.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.480]   Starbucks is already going.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.560]   But at 10 a.m. we're going to have a lure, you know, I think.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.560]   I think brilliant.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.680]   Anyway, we'll take a break and come back with something besides Pokemon.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.920]   You know, somebody in the chat room said this is the fact that we're spending all this
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.440]   time talking about this game, which is an iOS game.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.840]   I mean, there is a tie in.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.760]   It's not completely out of character, but just shows that it's Apple's taking way too
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.880]   long to release a new laptop.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.560]   I would agree with that.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.000]   Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.120]   You know there's a new phone coming along and you know that it's probably going to be the
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.120]   phone you want.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.840]   And you know you have this phone and really it still works perfectly well.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.840]   What do you do with it?
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.840]   Well, don't throw it in a drawer.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.880]   They'd be like throwing a $100 bill in a drawer.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.600]   Go to Gazelle.com.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:41.920]   Gazelle will buy your old device, smartphone, tablet, even Samsung phones, iPads, broken
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.200]   or not, iPhones, broken or not.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.760]   If you have an iPod, yeah, they still buy those.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:56.080]   They'll buy tablets from a variety of manufacturers, not just Apple, including your Microsoft surface.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.480]   And they'll give you a top dollar for it.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.440]   They pay the shipping, but here's the best part.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.440]   You have 30 days.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.960]   So basically you can lock in a price without a commitment on your part.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.080]   It's only on their part.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:10.040]   They commit that for the next 30 days they will pay you this much for that device.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:14.680]   And then you have 30 days to decide, 30 days to get a new device to transfer the data
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.680]   over.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.800]   Once you've decided they'll send you a box postage paid so you don't even have to pay
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.880]   the postage on it.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.520]   It could not be easier.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:27.040]   Then they'll send you a check, a PayPal credit or if you'd buy a lot of stuff on Amazon,
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.160]   isn't it Amazon Prime day to day?
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:35.160]   If you had, yeah, if you had, if you were big Amazon, get the Amazon gift card because
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.440]   they bumped that up by 5% so you get a little bit extra.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.400]   That's the sell side, but you can also buy at Gazelle.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.240]   Gazelle realized, yeah, we've got a lot of this cherry stuff.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.160]   And they used to sell it on eBay.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.160]   I think they still do have an eBay store.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.040]   But they said, why don't we just sell it direct?
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:57.880]   We'll take the very best stuff and we'll go through a 30-point rigorous check to make
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:02.120]   sure not only that it works but doesn't have any major defects or scratches on the screen,
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.120]   things like that.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.120]   And sell them back.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:09.720]   iPhones, Samsung Galaxy phones and iPads.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.760]   You can get the iPhone 6S, 6S plus the iPad, the Galaxy.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.080]   But a very affordable price.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.840]   In fact, you can kind of choose your own price because you can get it like new or you can
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.520]   get it slightly used and the price goes down, of course.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.160]   And the beauty part is you have 30 days to return it, so there's absolutely no risk.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.360]   And you can even get financing.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.960]   They have financing by a firm now and all their devices.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.960]   Very easy to do.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.960]   Write a check out.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.960]   You just provide some basic information and you can get approved at the checkout, which
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.240]   is really cool.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:46.400]   They also have warranties from assurance solutions that cover not just the usual stuff.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.360]   12-month warranties that cover water damage, cracked screens, hardware defects and more.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.080]   Gazelle, it's a great service and I love talking about them because I hate seeing all
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.920]   those gadgets just go in the drawer.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:02.360]   It's a great way to recycle your old gadgets and get cash or to buy new gadgets, a replacement
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:06.080]   or for your kids, gazelle.com.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.520]   You're watching Mac Break Weekly, Andy Anako from the Chicago Sun Times is here in A.Ritchie
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.520]   from I'more.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.760]   Mr. Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:22.080]   I have to scroll all the way down the page of show stories to get past Pokemon Go.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.680]   It's hard to imagine how big the story is, though.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.640]   I don't think people appreciate just how big a launch this was in terms of sheer volume
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.640]   of interest.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:34.600]   And people are annoyed that they're seeing so many tech sites write about this.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:38.400]   It's because they're responding to all kinds of interest in it.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:43.640]   I think I don't know that Ren Caldwell was speaking specifically about the Pokemon stuff
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.640]   she was writing, but she said that she said, "Isn't it great sometimes when you write
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:52.440]   something that gets more reads than what you normally write gets for an entire month?"
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.400]   I don't know if that was the right one, but I know other people who were in that business
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:02.880]   saying, "I'm both pleased and a little bothered that something I wrote in 90 minutes about
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.760]   Pokemon Go is being read by far, far more people than I reviewed that I took three weeks
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:08.760]   on."
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.160]   One thing that happens when you see, and we'll see in a month or two, we'll see revenue
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.160]   numbers.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:20.400]   You can easily play this game with that spending any money at all, at least so far anyway,
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.520]   and I'm up to level 10, so I haven't noticed any need.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:28.560]   However, I bought $20 worth of coins just because I want to pay for it.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.640]   I want to encourage them to keep developing and that kind of thing.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.760]   I'm sure they're going to make hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.320]   This will be a very, very valuable game even though it's free.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:43.360]   I wonder then when you start seeing those numbers, does this not spur a whole nother
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:48.720]   crazy app bubble in which everybody and their brother tries to cash in and make the next
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   thing?
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.720]   50 months stop.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:55.200]   Isn't that what happens is people see these, it started with Instagram sold for $1 billion
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.000]   and then WhatsApp for $22 billion and then people go, "Wow!"
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.360]   And then all these kids come out of college and say, "I'm going to write the next big
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.480]   app even my son who has no experience in this.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.960]   He and his buddies have gotten together and they've decided they've figured out the next
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.560]   big app.
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.360]   They spend probably hours thinking and talking about it.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.680]   None of them is a programmer who has any skill doing this.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.440]   They asked me, "Well, how do we get somebody to write this?"
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:25.120]   And I really want to say, don't waste your time.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.960]   If you could figure out a way to scare Mark, I guess I would say I would say you're taking
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:28.960]   attention.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.960]   You have a billion dollars.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:34.120]   Yeah, but I guess I would say that go ahead and give it a shot.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.560]   That might not be the one that's successful, but learn how to code.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:37.840]   I wouldn't say find someone to code.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.320]   I would say, "Go out there.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:44.080]   You now have the hardest thing about learning how to write code is having something applicable
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.080]   to..."
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.080]   That's true.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.080]   That's true.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:51.080]   You know, like when I learned hypercard, I didn't know anything about hypercard and I
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:55.840]   wanted to run the radio station that I worked at.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.160]   I had become assistant program director and I wanted to run the radio station on it because
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.400]   it was all on paper cards.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.440]   You know, and I was like, "This is crazy.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.440]   There's got to be a program for this."
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:09.080]   And so I got my Mac out and learning how to do it was mostly me just whacking my head
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:12.320]   against a wall until something came out the other end.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:17.920]   And before the dust settled, I then had a little program that would tell you what to
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:23.680]   the ads and the reads and the next songs and all the rotations and all that stuff was
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.840]   built into it.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.400]   But I learned a lot about hypercard.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:31.840]   And that's how I learned how to, before that it was basic and before that it was assembly
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.200]   and machine language and all of those things were just, "I'm going to get a book and I'm
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.760]   going to sit there and figure out how to get done."
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.360]   Now I have to admit that right now I feel like, because I'm just getting back into coding
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:47.040]   now, that it's much more complicated than it used to be.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.200]   So getting started on all the interfaces and the inner chain, I wasn't used to using
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.360]   other people's classes of code and all of the stuff you used to do.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.360]   It's a marvelous time now to do this.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:04.440]   It's great if you can, I really did have to like, pretend that I had never programmed
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:09.880]   anything before in my life because the idea of the modern style of programming where you
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:15.560]   really do have to think in terms of objects and basically create little Pokemon, set them
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:21.200]   free inside the window, figure out what these modules you would need to exist, what they
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.880]   need to do, what they need to talk to each other, using other people's code, going to
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.200]   code repositories and just simply copy pasting stuff because it works.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.440]   It was so hard for me to like change my mentality about that.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:40.360]   But to the original point, I wish that, I hope that people who get into programming,
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:45.480]   particularly kids, start off at the stage that every brilliant inventory starts off
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:50.880]   that either, "A, I'm curious, I want to try to do this," or this thing needs to exist,
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:54.560]   no one else is making it, I guess I'm going to have to figure out how to make it myself,
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.960]   because if you start off with any endeavor, whether it's starting a restaurant, whether
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.200]   it's writing music, whether it's writing a book, with the idea that I'm going to start
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:05.440]   a business that's going to make us a lot of money, you will always fail because you can
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.920]   only copy what's already out there consciously or subconsciously.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:13.320]   And by the time you train up and actually build that thing, you are the hundredth person
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.920]   to want to capitalize on some existing success.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:21.560]   So I mean, it's great, the great opportunities for anybody who just wants to create stuff,
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:25.640]   the difficulties that a lot of the ground has shifted because you can't, I don't think
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:30.680]   that an independent developer could have a success on the level of Pokemon Go because
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:34.360]   a lot of people are capable of writing that app, a lot of people are capable of writing
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.400]   it even better than it exists right now.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:42.240]   Almost nobody can write that and then set up the business and the infrastructure so that
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.320]   when it becomes the thing that everybody wants to play on the same weekend, it doesn't
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.040]   all just crash and take over exactly what it is.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.400]   Well, and I think that one of the things that's important to think about with app development
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.960]   is how your business model is going to work.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.400]   And I think the hardest part is making sure that you can front load, you're either going
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.440]   to get investment or you're going to front load the cost where you're going to charge
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.560]   something for it so that if it scales, you can, you know, because if you build this into
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:13.080]   the cloud now, whether you're using Firebase or Heroku or many of the other options there,
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:19.040]   you can scale up pretty fast with your, you know, with your demand, but you have to make
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.200]   sure that you're getting revenue connected.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.600]   You have to think, you know,
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.440]   Niantic into it because they do it, but they're not right.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:31.080]   I mean, they're having Amazon, Amazon tweeted, Hey, we can help you, bro.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.520]   I think this is a unique challenge.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.920]   I mean, obviously we know a lot about scaling these days.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.600]   Can't they call alphabet Leo and ask for a solid?
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.760]   I think so.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.200]   I think that there's two things there.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:45.080]   I think one is I think people can get themselves into an infrastructure.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.080]   If you don't think about it from the very beginning, like we're building, you know,
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.720]   our question and scale.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:50.720]   Yes.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.280]   And we built it into one platform and realized that it wasn't going to scale.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.200]   And so we're now in this huge ugly process of moving into another platform and that
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.920]   will scale and, and, but you have to write all the code from the beginning in a way that's
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.920]   going to do that.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.760]   And a lot of times you don't do that because of course it takes a long time, you know,
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.880]   and it's painful to get that off the ground.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.960]   So you just want to get it done, get it out.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.920]   The perfect example is Twitter.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.240]   Twitter was not written to scale at all on Ruby or something.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.800]   The fail-well, you were mentioning it earlier.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:22.320]   Yeah, but they learned and that's kind of my point is I think we understand now what
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.880]   it takes to scale.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.280]   And Zuckerberg famously was incensed the first time they went down.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.280]   Really?
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.760]   And since the first time Facebook went down.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.040]   Facebook does not go down.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.320]   That was, I think, the mantra.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.680]   So I think the knowledge is out there and I don't think it's what's interesting, what
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:40.920]   I find very interesting is companies like Twitter and Facebook seem to share freely what they've
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.920]   learned.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.920]   It's not like it's a business.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.200]   But a lot of people don't want to either they think in the, at some point they're going
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:51.120]   to save money by doing it themselves with their own servers or they want to keep control
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.120]   of the content.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.120]   You know, they want to keep it secure in a way that they don't want it to be sitting
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:59.960]   on, you know, Google's servers or Amazon servers or anything else like that.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:06.120]   So inside of those restrictions, they get themselves into trouble, I think.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.120]   Great.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.880]   Niantic is in San Francisco.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:17.200]   And one of the things you hear people talk about is how the, one of the reasons to be
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:23.600]   in San Francisco is everybody's walking around South Park and talking to each other.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:28.360]   And there's this kind of collegial frenemy thing going on where they go.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.240]   Well, so how did you scale that?
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.880]   And they're sharing that information as apparently I'm told very valuable to these companies.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:41.320]   I'm sure I would love to be a fly in the wall right now on server ops at Niantic and
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.320]   see what they're doing.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.800]   I mean, I'm obviously they're working 24/7.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.680]   I think anytime you can get yourself into a location where there's a lot of other smart
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:55.080]   people around, you know, it accelerates, you know, I, you know, working at, when I was
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.640]   working at ILM, I mean, you know, it was the, you know, when you had a question about
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:02.240]   Gonzi and Blur, I mean, the guy wrote it, you know, was my supervisor, you know, and
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:06.080]   so, so the, but it was like that for every person sitting around you.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.880]   So when you were, you were able to basically every time you had a question about something,
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.240]   somebody had an answer and it was a really good one.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.320]   And that saved me hours of trying to figure something out and someone said they're in
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.120]   draw it on a board and then I was done, you know, and, and I think that whether it's,
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:23.120]   you know, that was visual effects, but whether it's, you know, business stuff having, you
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.600]   know, having that environment.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.840]   And that's, I still think the power of things like user groups and, and other things like
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.720]   that that, that haven't been totally replaced online yet because it's just not, it's just
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:37.160]   hard to have that kind of casual conversation over drinks about how, you know, a, you know,
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:42.720]   for us how a streaming server is built to handle seven CDNs and, and handle six million,
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:46.040]   you know, viewers at one time is the kind of thing that you have over beers with a friend,
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.480]   but, but, you know, you would never find online is still not Googleable.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.360]   Here's a nice little script.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:58.040]   If you want to learn how to code a little Apple script that will dump all of your keychain
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:03.320]   passwords and clear text without any escalation necessary.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:06.440]   Computers are hard.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.760]   Brett and Henry discover this.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.800]   Now we should point out that somebody has to have access to your computer.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   It just works.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.520]   Somebody has to ask access to your computer, but it could be remote access.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:21.400]   So this is a huge problem in the Windows world where somebody pretending to be from Microsoft
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.580]   will call you and say, we see you have a problem on your computer.
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:29.640]   Our servers are noting a lot of virus activity and then they run you through some rigor
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.520]   moral that, that purportedly proves this and then they say, can we have access?
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.400]   We'll, we'll clean it up.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:40.920]   Don't fall for this if you are an OS 10 user because this person can literally open up
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:46.880]   a terminal and paste in some code and dump your entire keychain, all of those supposedly
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:53.120]   encrypted passwords into a text file which they can then download.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.040]   I am a little surprised.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:03.720]   This has apparently been a known method for at least two years.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:10.160]   You know, so I don't, Renee, I presume this is something Sierra will now fix maybe sooner.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.360]   Yeah, I mean, attention is like putting a spotlight on something is a faster way to
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.360]   get it fixed.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.360]   And I looked at it briefly.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.400]   I don't have time to dive into it, but it looked like if you'd unlocked your keychain,
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.400]   you could just pull things from it.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.800]   If your keychain was locked for any reason, then when you're locked in, it's unlocked,
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   right?
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   I see.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.160]   I'm not sure about that because if you go to the keychain app, it's not unlocked.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.320]   You have to unlock it to get any access to any passwords.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.120]   And I'm not sure what state it's, it's not the case.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.120]   Okay.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.320]   That's not the case.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:41.160]   You must have some, if you change your password for your login, then you're, then you'll be
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.000]   out of sync with your keychain.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.920]   But when you first set up a Mac, your keychain password is the same as your login password.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.360]   Logging into your account unlocks the keychain.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:54.280]   And it's been my experience because I, I, I, for change my password that then if I open
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:58.040]   keychain access, I can look at any password.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.040]   So I can't.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.040]   It asks me for a password every time.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.040]   I put in my password.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.040]   So many hand me my Mac.
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.200]   It's the, I think it's over there.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.200]   I'll try it.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:08.560]   Cause I, it's been, I don't remember ever being asked for a password, but it should,
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.400]   it should get the, it should be an escalation, right?
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   Totally.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.320]   Like if I look for, let me just go to a little password.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:20.480]   If I open, come on, open.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:27.000]   Well, this, this exploit would require that it had, that you didn't have to enter the
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.320]   password because this is the idea is that the run on runs unattended.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.400]   But again, not to fear that somebody didn't have to have access to your system for that
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.400]   to work.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.800]   So if I click on show password, it prompts me to enter my Mac password.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:40.800]   All right.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.800]   Maybe that, maybe I just don't remember it.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.800]   Let me open.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.440]   Make sure that that's the case on my, but it gives me a lot of information aside from
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.440]   the password.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.600]   You know what I should do is just run this script.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:51.600]   See what happens.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.160]   Make sure the script is safe.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.880]   Oh, what could possibly go wrong.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.680]   I mean, like, like every week I listen to security now, I'll remind it about how hard
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.680]   it's hard.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.680]   It's hard.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:03.680]   All right.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.680]   Keychain access.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:09.600]   Let me just, uh, the amount of engineering or two way they're in that password.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:14.880]   And let's see if it's showing the internet password attributes show password check a
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.880]   box.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:21.640]   Keychain access wants to use your confidential information stored in your key chain to allow
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.480]   this other little login keychain password, which is the same as my.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.480]   So it does ask for that.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.080]   However, if you then say, always allow, it will always allow that.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.600]   Yeah, I've never done that.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.320]   Yeah, don't do that.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.960]   And it looks like this always allow thing.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.960]   All right.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.160]   Let me, let me, let me get this script and we'll try it out here.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.760]   This could, this could be a lot of fun.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.760]   Do you want to run it or shall I?
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.000]   I don't have it.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   All right.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.760]   And I don't know if I trust it.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.360]   Well, it's just an Apple script.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.360]   I know.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.360]   If you don't trust it.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.360]   I don't send it.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:43:03.360]   I didn't see the RM startup start.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.360]   All right.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.640]   No, that's the beauty of the Apple script.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:12.800]   It is as clear and simple as reverse is a reverse E and you run it now.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.800]   Haha.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.800]   All right.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:15.800]   I have to.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.800]   I'm using a mushroom emoji.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.280]   I'm using security reasons.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.640]   I'm using a Linux laptop, but I'll go over to my Apple lip tip.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:25.400]   Well, while you're doing that, let's go over another really important tip.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:29.240]   Realize that one of the reasons why this thing works is that somebody answered the phone.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.040]   And if you just don't, so bad things happen if you've answered the telephone.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.040]   Haha.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:39.960]   Well, and you know, I don't, I don't think I certainly haven't heard of and I hear about
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:43.920]   them all because I do that radio show where normals call.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.920]   I don't think that anybody's calling now yet to say, hey, I'm from Apple and we see this
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.920]   problem.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.800]   But if there's so many more Windows users that it's also keychain is kind of not like,
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.240]   I don't know how many of my friends actually even know there is a key chain.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:02.440]   Well, but well, it does doesn't matter because it stores it there anyway, right?
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:08.640]   A lot of it given the it just works sort of mentality of Mac OS where the there was tries
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.960]   to suggest useful and helpful things.
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.000]   It's storing so many times when you're logging into servers and stuff that you want to add
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.520]   this to the key chain so that so that humble user you never have to type this password
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.520]   in again.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.520]   I wouldn't want to do that.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:25.960]   I think basically I think a lot of people don't know everything that they've stored in the key
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:26.960]   chain.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:30.680]   So that's another thing where it's I think it's a good idea with because of this exploit
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:35.480]   or not occasionally open up that key chain directly and key chain in the key chain app
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.960]   and just take a look at what's in there.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.520]   You might be surprised what's up there.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.360]   Yeah, that's probably good advice as well.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.160]   And it's really hard to guard against user intent.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:46.760]   I mean, that's why fishing works and that's why, you know, if you have a system that I
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.280]   don't want this on my system, I'm deleting it.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.440]   Oh, no, no, no, we're reinstalling it.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.440]   I hate that stuff.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:53.680]   But if it's like I typed this in and now you have access, yes, protect me from that.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.960]   But at the end of the day, I type some stuff in and that's hard to, that's hard to stop.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.160]   Well, I can't just paste it to the terminal.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.480]   So I mean, I think it's AppleScript, isn't it?
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.480]   Yeah, it's got to tell in there.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.960]   That's AppleScript.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:09.760]   So you probably have to save it as an AppleScript.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.400]   So I guess pull up the BV at it, right?
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:16.280]   Yeah, I mean, anything that requires physical, there were a couple other exploits over the
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.320]   weekend and anything that requires physical access.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.720]   That's one more step on your failure chain.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:26.400]   I think all people were worried about iOS 10 letting you text from, if you allow it, you
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.040]   can do notifications and texting from the lock screen.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.440]   That's again, the battle between convenience and security.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.440]   And you can turn that off.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.960]   It's less convenient because you have to unlock your phone every time.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.520]   But if you leave it on and then you walk away and leave your phone on the bar, someone
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.080]   else can start answering your text messages.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:44.240]   By the way, let's talk about iOS 10 because the public beta came out last week and a
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.680]   lot of people have adopted it.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:50.640]   I did, wouldn't recommend it if your iPhone is your only phone.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.800]   Although it's pretty stable.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.560]   It's mostly just that some apps don't work quite the same or work at all.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.560]   Right.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:00.720]   And developers still can't upload iOS 10 versions of the apps until it goes into Golden Master.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:04.680]   So you don't leave bad reviews, but also don't.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.840]   They literally cannot fix it for you right now.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.440]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.680]   Are any of the Apple apps still, are they still all down?
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.320]   I haven't updated from there, but like pages and numbers and.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.480]   Do they not work?
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.440]   They were kind of on the iPad.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.120]   They were open and shutting.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.120]   Like they're not funny.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.120]   They're not.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:25.320]   There's so much depends on what else you have installed that they're working fine for
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.560]   me, but that doesn't mean they're going to work for you.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.560]   Oh, interesting.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:32.400]   Well, like you, you don't seem to have problems with Pokemon Go either.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.400]   No.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.740]   And you know, we were talking the other day because Tweetbot on my Mac was just crashing
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.160]   for me in beta one all the time.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.480]   And then I looked at it and it was keychain that was actually crashing.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.960]   But you know, two people that I work with, it was working fine for them on their systems
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.840]   and another person was having the same issue as me.
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:49.040]   So it really, there's these things just so complicated now.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.480]   It's like the butterfly effect.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.560]   If you have this and this installed, then that will crash.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.040]   But if you have only this and this installed, then that is fine.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.120]   So it's more complicated to troubleshoot than ever.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.280]   I have to say that my kids have become totally enthralled with the.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.280]   Messages.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.280]   All of the new messages.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.800]   I mean, they're drawing little pictures and I guess the new thing with the suggesting
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:13.360]   the next word, my daughter who's who's seven or six, she'll send you these huge paragraphs
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:14.960]   that she just adds next next next.
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:15.960]   He just winds the next next.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.600]   Well, but it's a random list.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.760]   He's trying to like create something crazy.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.760]   It's like poetry.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.760]   So he tied together.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.600]   It's actually a really fun little English project for her of like what the next thing.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.760]   And so she sends you these paragraphs that you think at first she might have actually
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.680]   written and then you were like, she would have only written this if she was on mushrooms.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:33.680]   I don't.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.680]   She's not on mushrooms.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:35.680]   Oh, man.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.840]   I'm sure she's not.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.640]   So I, you know, it's a but yeah.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.960]   Alex, did you, when you, when you became a parent, did you realize that part of this would
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.760]   involve a daily touring test with your children?
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.240]   She a robot.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.720]   I am a robot.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.360]   You're, you're in bed watching playing video games.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:56.280]   You must be somewhere else.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:01.320]   So the two biggest things you'll notice immediately with the iOS 10 upgrade and again, you should
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:06.480]   only do this if you don't mind if your phone doesn't work reliably or some of your apps
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.720]   stop working.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:11.680]   In other words, probably shouldn't do this on your main phone.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.840]   But the two things you'll notice are, as we mentioned, messages has really got a lot
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:18.640]   of new features and not all of the ones they talked about though.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.920]   And then the new notifications, but let's start with messages.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:25.480]   Renee, is there a way to make the, because they said you can make text bigger.
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:26.480]   You can have working.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:31.400]   So you, all you got to do is force eventually all of force touch stuff, I believe will work
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.120]   with long press on older devices.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:37.080]   But for now you've got to use force, they're working for the force, sorry, the 3D touch
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.400]   enabled devices.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.880]   So there's a little blue send button next to the text field on the right.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.200]   And if you tap that, it'll just send the message.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.800]   If you 3D touch that, which means if you press firmly on it, it'll take you to this new
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:52.080]   screen, which has all the text effects, the bubble effects on one side and you can tab
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.080]   over.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.040]   Does it have this invisible link?
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:57.040]   And once laser is Leo.
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.320]   Oh man, I couldn't find it.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.320]   Okay.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.320]   So force touch.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.320]   Okay.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.320]   Or 3D touch, I should say.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.320]   Oh, okay.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.240]   So 3D touch the send button before you send it.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.840]   You can annotate previous messages, right?
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.160]   Or you can add text to that.
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.200]   So Apple last year, I don't know why they didn't, they waited this year for it.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.200]   Maybe they were testing it.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:17.520]   So they made a little application called markup and it was an extension and it only
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.520]   worked in mail.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:21.080]   You could double click in mail and now they've moved that extension because extensions really
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.600]   do work everywhere into the photo app, into the messaging app and into other apps where
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:29.320]   they think that it'll be good to put like lenses or, you know, customer call outs or
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.800]   lines or signatures or anything on that stuff.
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.840]   I love that feature.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.200]   And there's a better one because digital touch can also, you can also take a photo
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.240]   and a video and then use the digital touch stuff on it.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:42.800]   So make your head into a giant throbbing heart, draw pictures on it, it taps over it.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.720]   Oh, I'm missing out on most of it because I've only, because I didn't, this, it's a
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:47.720]   little opaque.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:52.480]   There's a lot of, for instance, you, if you have to tap the controls on the right when
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.200]   you get the touch thing to get a broken, you can do a broken heart.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   There's all these hidden things in there.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.800]   And there's three apps you can download from Apple which mirror the animated emoji from
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.800]   the Apple watch.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.640]   So you just go to messages apps and then you download those very quickly and you get the
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.640]   thumbs up and the gloves.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.640]   Okay.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.160]   But there's a little button on the side.
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.040]   Like when you first open the app, you can see them all easily.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.160]   But then there's a little button on the side that you push and that'll open them all up
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.640]   again and then you can.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.640]   Right.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:23.000]   You initially in the, when you open the text messaging in messages, you get three, three
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.440]   controls, two new controls.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.040]   Go ahead, show us on the screen.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.080]   So that's, that's if you want to do an effect.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.440]   So I can choose, for example, the slam effect.
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.440]   I'll do that again.
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.040]   So you can see or here's the.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.040]   Oh, look.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.040]   Grow effect.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:39.440]   And then you, you go to screen effects.
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:42.240]   Also if you type stuff, like if you type happy birthday, it'll automatically be the
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.240]   balloons.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.240]   I did that.
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.240]   You type congratulations.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:47.240]   This one is the one's, one's, one's lasers.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.320]   Actually, put the sound on for this and I'll do it again because it's just so funny.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.240]   Let's see if this works.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:57.000]   It's not doing sound, but it just fills you, fills you up with lasers and there's also
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.600]   the more you know, comment, you do, do, do.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.400]   So that is actually, I'll cancel out so you can see.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:09.760]   So when you have a message, you, instead of just pressing on the, hold this up, instead
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.400]   of just pressing on the messages button, you force force on it.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:13.600]   Oh, and then you see all that.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.840]   And then it gives you the selector.
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.360]   I did not know.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:22.720]   I don't have an iPhone with me or I would show you folks, but I have stupid.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.720]   Oh, it's so much fun.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:28.560]   And on the Mac, the animation for the, the only bubble effect that works on the Mac is
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:32.360]   the invisible ink, but it's really delightful because you have this little congregation of
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.360]   bubbles and blur and you move them out of the way and they quickly try to come back
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.360]   and hide your message.
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:37.560]   You got to swipe them out of the way fast.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:43.440]   How do they handle messages created in this new iOS 10 messages when you send it to an
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:46.600]   un-updated phone or a Mac or a camera?
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.400]   It gives you descriptive text.
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.000]   So if you say, I don't know what it does on Android, but if your iMessage user on an
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.440]   older one, it'll say, so enter to you responded with a slam effect or Laurie respond with balloons
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.680]   and then you can just read it off.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.160]   And then the Mac only supports a few of them.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:02.040]   So you'll get that sometimes on the Mac as well.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:05.800]   And have you, is there a way, because I couldn't, one thing I thought was missing is being able
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.680]   to take a photo and then being able to draw on it and send it to somebody.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.280]   And that, I couldn't get that to work.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.080]   Is that working?
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.080]   It's an extension.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:17.760]   So I'll double check on how you do it in the messages app, but you should be able to tap
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.840]   on it and just start, you know, marking it up.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.080]   Yeah, because I couldn't.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:27.080]   So there are some things you should download when you go to iOS 10.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.080]   How do you find those?
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.040]   Do you look for under software from apps from Apple?
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:33.720]   So when you, if you're in the apps, there's a, I'll hold this up.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.720]   People can see it.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:39.400]   If you're in here, you tap on the apps button and that gives you all the apps that are available.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:42.760]   And there's a plus line that'll take you to the store and it'll show you all the apps
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.760]   that are eventually a bit less.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:45.760]   So how do you do this?
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:49.640]   Snapchat, Pokemon Go thing where you don't, you know, you have hidden features that people
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.280]   discover.
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:52.760]   There's something fun about that.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:53.760]   And then,
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:54.760]   Totally.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:59.760]   And if I do the app store thing again, I can, you know, you can choose like I can send a
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.000]   broken heart emoji or something to people.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   Right.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:09.760]   Somebody's pointing out that when, when Microsoft did this with Windows 8, you know, had hidden
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:13.320]   corner effects and things and you had to know to mouse over to the corner to get the
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:16.320]   charms bar and stuff, people piston moaned.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.480]   But when Apple does it, it's good news.
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.880]   I'll tell you why people who are using Windows are using it for productivity.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:23.880]   So it's a lot of.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:24.880]   Let's around with it.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.760]   They were trying to get work done.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.960]   There's a very simple UI theory.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:31.960]   And you can go back, you go back to iOS 7, you, Blackberry 10 was about this deal.
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.600]   You cannot hide critical functionality.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:36.800]   If anything is critical to using the operations, but it has to have an affordance.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:37.800]   It has to be apparent.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:41.360]   It has to have a button that in text and every affordance you can give it to make it
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:42.360]   discoverable.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.640]   If it's something that just adds value, then you can create what they call, you know, some
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:46.800]   people call it a moment of delight.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:48.560]   Some people call it a lot of harm.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.560]   All that stuff.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.800]   And it makes you think, oh, I was rewarded for engaging with this.
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:52.800]   Right.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.480]   And when a UI is really good, it hints at it.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.880]   Like you move a little bit.
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:54:00.040]   That's why Lauren Bricter was so brilliant with that pull that scroll to unlock or that
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.040]   pull to refresh.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.440]   Because you pull it down a little bit.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:03.440]   Yeah, it bounces.
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:05.440]   And people would just play with their phone.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.440]   So they were doing that anyway.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:10.160]   And then they discover something and they're like, oh, wow, you know, it's a great feeling.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.560]   So that's so those are the keys.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:13.240]   It can't be a necessary feature.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.720]   It has to be just a delightful feature.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:22.160]   It has to kind of hint at it or or somehow show up.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.240]   And that's one problem with 3D touches.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.120]   I'm still not in the habit of 3D touching everything.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:30.080]   It's not rewarding enough to get you to do it all the time.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:33.320]   And they can't make it dependent because so many people have the voice that don't support
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:34.320]   it.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.600]   If it was if you were forced to use it, you'd get in the habit of using it.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.160]   You can use the entire phone without it.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.560]   So people just never get the habit.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:40.560]   Right.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.560]   Right.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:47.320]   Let's also point out that this like this is not a feature through absolutely need to
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.600]   be able to access in order to use the app.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:53.600]   But let's also I'm often in the position of following up something Renee has said with
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:58.760]   just adding that last puzzle piece because I feel like I have to realize that this but
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:02.840]   this is also something that often happens like in our community.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:08.560]   Like remember how the idea of all the all the Android phones and Windows phones that
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:12.800]   had like the camera element was like bumped out a little bit to accommodate a larger sensor
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:17.200]   or some other camera feature and all of the moaning about Oh, you see, it's just so ugly
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.200]   and stupid.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.200]   You know what?
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.360]   Johnny I would have a show.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.160]   And Apple does it.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:25.440]   And Apple does it's like, you know, it's it's great.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:29.840]   It gives us the it gives us the benefit of a super slim phone and an improved camera.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.640]   Only Apple can do this.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:34.360]   That's just, you know, that's what you want.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.560]   That's what you're hoping for in life.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.440]   If your company can create that feeling, maybe just have it work for you.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:43.440]   And I will say that for me, I'm now learning mostly for my, you know, my kids are playing
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.440]   with it.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:48.160]   You know, the two of them, if kids find this stuff right away, that's why Snapchat.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:49.760]   Doesn't need to show any UI.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.360]   Well, the two of them are like, as soon as someone, you can see these little conversations
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:56.160]   back and forth, like, like is available to do something in Malachi, I'll be immediately
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.240]   like, how did you do that?
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.680]   You know, and like, you know, and then the two of them go back and forth and they're
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:01.200]   always trying to show some new thing.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.760]   And that incense them to discover.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:07.040]   And then, and then I just, I just get them a cookie and show me every time.
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.040]   That's how I learned Snapchat.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:09.040]   Is it Henry?
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.040]   Yes.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.040]   How do you use this?
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:14.160]   And there's momentum to like, if your friends start using it and you see it and you discover
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.400]   it, but it's like, that's why when companies go bad, they go really bad because it sort
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.400]   of shatters that impression.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:21.480]   They're like, oh, this is stupid and everyone starts thinking it's stupid and nobody uses
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.480]   it.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:26.920]   But as long as people are bought in like Snapchat, it's not, oh, you know, that Dalmatian lens
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.120]   is the dumbest thing I've ever seen is, oh my God, how did you get that?
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.120]   Can you show me how to get that?
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.120]   Right.
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.120]   And then you're rewarded because you become like the teacher mentors.
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.120]   Yes.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.120]   You're the smart one.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.120]   You get credit.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.120]   There was that great art that great story about the Bloomberg terminals where they spent
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:42.240]   a fortune redesigning them, say, be easier to use.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.320]   And the Bloomberg analysts said this is ridiculous.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.920]   We don't want people to think they're easy to use.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.320]   And we want this to be incredibly, incredibly difficult to use.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.240]   And they had to go back and put all the old software on it.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.000]   And they're, they're Snapchat has the same thing.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.160]   It's like, oh, oh, you taught your dad how to use the VCR.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:00.440]   I'll show you how to use Snapchat, dad.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:02.600]   Let's see.
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:06.640]   Apple Maps has 30 new flyover locations around the world.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:10.520]   These are, these are created by airplane helicopter.
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:13.920]   I'm betting now by a drone as well.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:14.920]   Right.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:18.120]   I bet you most of them are actually helicopter.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:20.600]   They said it was airplanes when they first started doing this.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.120]   I bet you it might be airplanes, but I bet you it's helicopter.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.480]   The most common way to do this is, is a stabilized.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.320]   It's like one of those expensive though.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:28.320]   Right.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:31.320]   For some people, but not for, I mean, especially if you're doing something that you're going
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:32.320]   to show.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:34.840]   So if you're going to do a bunch of New York ones, for instance, it would cost you the
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:41.240]   helicopters cost about $8,000 for a couple hours of shooting.
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:43.720]   But you know, in the grand scheme of what it's going to take to actually do this because
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:46.600]   what they're going to shoot is they're going to shoot something where they do a whole bunch
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.600]   of passes at the same thing.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:51.360]   And then they are going to take it back and they're going to stabilize it.
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:54.760]   And then they're going to, in this case, it looks like a lot of times they're slowing
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:55.760]   it down.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:00.840]   So they're probably doing a high speed camera inside of the, inside of the helicopter with
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:02.560]   a stabilized camera system.
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:05.640]   And then they are shooting at 60 frames a second, 120 frames a second.
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:08.960]   There's definitely some of those that you can see that they shot, that they've slowed
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:13.560]   down a fair bit because the cars are moving really slowly.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:14.880]   To get whatever effect that they want.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.480]   But it's, they are amazing.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:19.800]   I have to admit that I sit there and watch my Apple TV.
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.080]   Who was it we interviewed?
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.080]   Was Chase Jarvis, wasn't it?
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:27.880]   That we interviewed on "Tranulation" who did the book of Ariel's shots.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:32.320]   And I was looking at some of his videos and I said, "Boy, that looks a lot like the Apple
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:33.320]   TV screen savers."
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:36.560]   And he said, "I can't comment."
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:38.560]   And those are all, that's all helicopter, I think.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:40.560]   It looks like it's been drawn.
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:43.280]   Those things blow me away though because it's not just, "Hey, let's put up a camera in
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.520]   a helicopter and fly a pass."
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:49.400]   That approach to San Francisco, they go completely down.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.400]   Excuse me.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:58.800]   But by the time they finish processing the video, it is like from the Pacific Islands,
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.800]   they helicopter in and they wind up lined up for...
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:01.800]   Oh, it was Vincent LaFoure.
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:02.800]   That's who it was.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:03.800]   Yes.
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:08.240]   Razor lined up for a market street and you wind up this by sexting the screen with market
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:14.160]   street and I'm like, "I don't know what skill was required to line up that shot perfectly
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:19.600]   or what technology was required to post processes or look like it was lined up perfectly."
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:24.540]   But I am annoyed for exactly eight seconds saying, "Oh, wouldn't it be...
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.440]   I'm listening to music right now, Apple TV.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.160]   Wouldn't it be more useful for you to screen save the title?"
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.120]   They're like, "Oh, oh, Hawaii!
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.120]   Oh, all right.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:33.120]   I'm listening to him.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.120]   I'm looking at the Hawaii footage."
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.120]   Vincent was amazing.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:41.560]   He has a lot of still stuff, but he also does a lot of aerial stuff and super slow-mo.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:46.880]   Yeah, just gorgeous stuff.
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.360]   Of course, Vincent LaFoure.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:53.720]   Yeah, highly recommend that book from the year.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:56.120]   So anyway, I don't know how Apple got him.
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.840]   Apple's not going to tell us.
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.320]   And whoever did it is not allowed to tell us, but there are now many more 30 new flyover
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.320]   locations.
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:13.240]   Kind of like Catalina Island in Southern California, Pinnacle's National Park, Martha's Vineyard.
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:18.600]   Look, there's a Kennedy, a wild Kennedy, Omaha, Nebraska, Poughkeepsie.
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.600]   I don't know why...
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.720]   Let's go to South Dakota.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.560]   It's just nothing but like no features whatsoever.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:28.040]   And then the University of South Dakota, and then more nothing.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.880]   Nebraska's a lot of corn.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.720]   Columbia, South Carolina, Allentown.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720]   What is it, Allentown?
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.320]   There's a Billy Joel song.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.800]   Yeah, it wasn't actually in Allentown, but...
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.000]   It's about Allentown.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   About Allentown.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   Naples, Italy.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.280]   Go for the pizzas.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.120]   Stay for the mob.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.160]   Palermo, Akita, Japan.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.080]   That's kind of cool.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.680]   Acapulco, Quernavaca.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.720]   So these are like, if they do as they did, Stoke on Trent in the United Kingdom, it's
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:01.960]   the whole town, or is it just like a little bit of a fly around?
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.960]   It depends on the area.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.480]   Some of them are really, really good, really, really detailed, and other of them just have
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.640]   a few big buildings.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:11.160]   The idea is that you could like, here see the Statue of Liberty, and then you get a
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:15.880]   photorealistic 3D view, and you could pan and rotate and stuff.
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:16.960]   It's not like a tour.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.880]   It's not like those movies in...
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.080]   They do have tours, where it'll like...
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.080]   It's more of a special effect.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:25.320]   It'll like zip you around and rotate everything in 3D space and label it for you.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.760]   It's not an actual movie.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.760]   It's a...
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:28.760]   No, yeah.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.880]   It's like a 3D animated sort of a guided thing.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:37.560]   Apple settled with a patent troll, $25 million chicken feed for Apple, but...
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.960]   All that's up.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.040]   Yeah, not good to settle with patent trolls.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.000]   It was brought by a company called Network One Technologies.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:52.400]   They say they had a patent from 1999 that describes an operating system in which documents
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.320]   are stored in a chronologically ordered stream.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.280]   Wow.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:02.080]   The patent actually was from Yale in 1996.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:05.160]   Its creator founded a company called Mirror Worlds.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.760]   They started suing Apple.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:12.320]   That lawsuit resulted in a $625 million judgment.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.000]   Later overturned, the patent was then sold to Network One, which followed up with a new
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.360]   one, and they've got $25 million.
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.240]   Apple's also getting licenses, though, to other Network One patents.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.760]   I wonder what patents.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.760]   But the process is so broken because the US patenters would rather people just sue each
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.880]   other than them have a hard decision on anything.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:33.880]   No, that's what they say.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:37.000]   They say, "Well, we'll give you the patent and we'll figure it out."
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   Subtle in court.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   That's horrible.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.720]   Well, it's a weakness rather than a, I think, a totally broken thing.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:48.680]   Unfortunately, the patent office can't hire an expert in networking software.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:52.440]   They can't have an expert on switching technology.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:59.520]   They can't even afford to hire in as a one-off contractor, a fill of a conference room full
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:04.120]   of pizza and Diet Coke and say, "Here are all the patents regarding switch technology,
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.200]   you expert engineers tell us which are unique."
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.280]   They really have to say, "First pass is this unique or not.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.200]   Looks unique great.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.720]   We will let the industry themselves decide whether this is really unique or not by fighting
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.720]   it out in court."
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:21.720]   I don't know how else they could do it unless they're given a military-style budget.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.720]   I agree.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:25.160]   It's messed up, but it might be the best hand if they can do.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.760]   In the percentage of future litigation, one percent.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:33.080]   They should do it like jury duty where it's like they just get 12 random people and say,
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:38.160]   "Have you ever heard of a computer that has a screen without a keyboard?"
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.160]   No.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.160]   Okay.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.160]   There you go, patent it.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.160]   Next.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:45.240]   It's a thing you hold in your hand and has buttons on it.
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.240]   Never seen that before.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.240]   Okay.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.240]   I've never seen that.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.240]   I blew it.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.240]   We were talking about iOS 10 features.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.920]   I said there were two big ones that everybody would see.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:54.920]   We mentioned messages.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:55.920]   We didn't talk about notifications.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.920]   Let's take a break.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:57.920]   We'll talk about notifications.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:01.720]   Then if there are hidden features in iOS 10 that are exciting but people aren't paying
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:05.120]   as much attention to, maybe we can cover those two if such things exist.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.520]   But first, I thought it would be fun to open my trunk.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.560]   My trunk is here from trunk club.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.640]   I've talked about trunk club before.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:17.760]   Trunk club is for people who want to look nice, dress nice, but don't like to shop.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.040]   In other words, most of the men I know.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.040]   Use the deal.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.880]   With trunk club, it's not a subscription.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.400]   It's a service.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:32.320]   You get a free stylist who will help you pick stuff that suits your style, what you're trying
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.320]   to project the image.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:36.400]   You're trying to project, you know, they say dress for the job you want, not the job you
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:37.400]   got.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.560]   That's why I dress like a bum.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.240]   With trunk club, I can dress a little bit nicer.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.760]   I have my own personal stylist.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:48.680]   I talked to her, explained what I'm looking for.
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:52.880]   I want to kind of dress, you know, I don't do it wear trunk club stuff all the time.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:57.400]   It's like when I go out, I want to kind of snazzy is the word I use.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:01.080]   She laughed, but I think she understood.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.520]   You give her your measurements, your likes, your dislikes.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.080]   She helps you find the clothes.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.720]   But what they do is they put up a page, you say, yes, no, yes, no, yes, they have maybe
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.720]   whatever.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.640]   Then they pack them in a trunk.
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.000]   This is my trunk just came.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.960]   I have not looked at it.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:20.520]   By the way, you still pay nothing, not a penny, no nothing for shipping, nothing for the stylist
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:24.880]   time, nothing for these clothes, unless you keep them.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.920]   And that's when you pay, you pay for only the clothes you keep.
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:34.360]   I don't even know if you can see over my shoulder here what's in this trunk, Carsten.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.760]   Hey, you kind of can.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:36.760]   There you go.
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:37.760]   It's a lot of focus.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.360]   So you see, it's nicely all nicely packaged up.
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.040]   I got some shoes this time.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.600]   Here's the contents list.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.040]   I even they even have bow ties.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.120]   I love my bow ties.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.720]   So I like that.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.160]   So here's the deal.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:53.560]   You have a little fashion show with your girlfriend, your honey, your boyfriend, whatever.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.320]   And you show them and you say, what do you think?
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.900]   Should I keep the the Gingham checked shirt?
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.200]   How about this nice chambre shirt?
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.600]   Oh, here's a pretty dusty rose.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.280]   This is all stuff that I picked on the website.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.640]   But you know, you want to try it on and make sure it looks good for you.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:08.920]   They even have shoes.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.920]   Let's see what I got here.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.480]   I can't remember what we picked out.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:12.480]   Oh, I like these.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.880]   Some night here you could show it up on this.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.760]   Yeah, there's some nice canvas boat shoes.
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:18.400]   Perfect for the season.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.880]   So your stylist, my stylist has taken the time to know what I like.
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.920]   And I have to say, this is I think my fourth trunk or fifth trunk.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:28.040]   You don't, they're not shipped automatically.
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.680]   You say, OK, I'm ready for another trunk.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.520]   And then you go through the process again.
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.920]   But I noticed as I've done this, she's gotten closer and close.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.600]   She pays attention to what I didn't pick and is getting closer and closer.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.960]   So every trunk gets better and better.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.840]   You just keep what you want.
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.840]   Then that's the only thing you pay for.
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:47.120]   You've got 10 days to try on the clothes.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.280]   It's not a subscription service.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.760]   Shipping is always free.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.760]   Keep what you like.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.760]   Send back what you don't.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.960]   This is the easiest way ever to shop.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.800]   Well, this is another set.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:57.800]   OK.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.160]   Is it the same or they're slightly different?
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.160]   Maybe they're slightly different.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.640]   So trunk club, here's the deal.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:07.200]   Make a statement at the next big event in your calendar with a look that's handpicked
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.400]   just for you and your style.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:13.600]   It started today at trunkclub.com/macbreak.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.880]   And by the way, this is from Nordstrom.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:22.560]   So it's backed by the highest quality standards and quality and customer service.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.760]   They have it for men.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.400]   They have it for women.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:30.000]   Premium clothes, expert advice, no shopping.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.600]   OK?
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.600]   Now you know what I'm talking about?
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.600]   trunkclub.com/macbreak.
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:37.600]   And it's nice when you get the trunk.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.600]   It's so great.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.600]   It's so smart.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.600]   Isn't it?
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.800]   Yeah, I wish for this for years.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.600]   Like who want-- I really-- I mean, some guys really like to go shopping.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.000]   Well, everybody likes to shop.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   It just depends what you're shopping for.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.200]   Like, you could take me to a hardware store and I'll stay there for days.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.200]   Yes.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.200]   But clothes shopping, that's so much.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.000]   I just pick up something off the rack.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   Make sure the slide is approximately whatever my back being.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   Exactly.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.200]   And then I walk out and I get it all when I can't wear it and it goes on a pile.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.200]   Exactly.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:04.600]   And the trunk is ready to send back the evens and the shipping back.
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.200]   You don't pay anything for the shipping to or from.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.200]   And then you're done.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.880]   It couldn't be easier.
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:13.080]   And you get-- you know, what I would do is I'd like every season I'll get a new trunk.
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.800]   That way I get seasonal clothes each time.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.200]   Trunks, make me look good.
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.200]   Make-- that's all I want.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.200]   Just make me look good.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.200]   Yeah.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.200]   That's what I said to them.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.600]   I just want to add that that's another revolution of the past three or four years.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:28.200]   I can't remember the last time I bought-- the last time I bought clothes on an actual store
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.880]   was for an upcoming wedding where I needed like really nice dress clothes and they needed
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.400]   to make sure that-- I was leaving in three or four days.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.400]   And I went to Nordstrom actually.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.400]   Right.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.920]   Retail store and it worked great.
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:44.400]   Everything else, if I have time to quote shop, I will just buy it online.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.400]   I do it.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:47.240]   It's like you get it.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:48.240]   It fits.
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.680]   If it doesn't fit, yes, it's a little bit of a hassle to send it back but not as much
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:56.000]   of a hassle as marking out an afternoon to drive to a store or mall and try things on
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.800]   and be told that we're not used to serving sir who is quite so short.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:01.800]   I hate that.
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:02.800]   To his waist size sir.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.800]   His jeans and I rose are not off the rise.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.800]   I hate that.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.600]   I love my stylist because I was honest with her.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:11.240]   I gave her a message and then not once did she laugh, not once.
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.240]   Nice.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.440]   Thank you.
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:15.800]   All right.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:17.280]   Let's talk about notifications.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:21.240]   I have to say I think this is the biggest change in iOS 10.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.120]   Messages is just a toy.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.880]   Notifications changes how you use your iPhone.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.880]   It's a very conceptual change.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:33.080]   They've sort of created a notification space that's persistent.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.480]   It used to be you had a quick replies and you could quick like if Andy sent me a message,
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:39.440]   I could quickly respond to it and then it would disappear and I go back to what I was
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.440]   doing.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:43.400]   But if we were trying to have a conversation, I'd have to either stop what I was doing,
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:46.760]   go to the messages app and try to find my way back which has always been laborious in
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:50.440]   iOS and just sort of like ping pong around.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:54.400]   But now when a message comes in, you can again 3D touch eventually able to touch and
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.720]   hold two and it brings up this persistent notification space where I can engage in a
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.560]   full conversation using full functionality with Andy and then when we're done, it's
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:03.560]   a yes, you have the comic store.
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:04.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.560]   Press the button.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:09.960]   Press the cancel and I'm right back where I was doing and that's a huge spatial revolution.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:14.000]   It's made we've had this kind of sort of with widgets before and series sort of its
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.200]   own space and now you have these very distinct things and Apple is really smart about it
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.240]   because I was when I first saw the demo, I was do not take widgets away from the notification
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:24.240]   center.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.120]   The ability to swipe down from anywhere, use one peak out swipe away is the most really
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.120]   convenient for me.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.920]   And if I have to go to the home screen, swipe over to find widget space and use it there.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.240]   I'm going to feel like I'm back in 2010 again and they didn't.
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:40.040]   Now on the lock screen, there's widgets to the left on the home screen.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.360]   There's widgets to the left on notification center.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.760]   There's widgets on the left.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.280]   There's notifications in the middle on the lock screen.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.800]   There's notifications on the middle and notification center.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.440]   And when you're in an app and that notification comes in and you press that button, it's
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:56.200]   especially exactly in the same place and it lets you sort of become accustomed to what
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:01.160]   would otherwise be a much more advanced, sophisticated and maybe even complicated interface.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:04.040]   And after a couple of days, I was just using it.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.120]   It's really frustrating now because some apps, you know, they just can't update for it.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:11.040]   So you get a Facebook notification, you 3D touch into it, expect me to interact and
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.840]   all you get is a dismiss button.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:16.400]   And I know like in my head, I'm like, ah, you know, I know that they can't update for
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.400]   it.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.400]   Otherwise, I'm just like, this is so inconvenient.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.920]   It's like going back to iOS 9.
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:23.800]   It's just, it's really powerful once you get the hang of it.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.880]   Yeah, I mean, this is this is more than just adding a feature to the notification system.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:32.040]   And it's even, I think, bigger than overhauling the whole notification system itself.
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:38.160]   I really think that this is an extension to the very concept of how people interact with
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.160]   iOS because it really isn't notifications.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.800]   It really is the concept of widgets, making them meaningful.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:51.640]   It's an extension of what 3D touch was able to bring to the experience.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:58.120]   I think that the whole movement is to try to avoid forcing a user to launch an app unless
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:02.360]   they absolutely need the full functionality of that app.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:09.760]   Because if they can, as Renee said, people don't necessarily need to launch messages.
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.560]   They don't want the fully operational firepower of messages.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:17.360]   They just want to participate in a rich conversation with this friend who wants to talk to them
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.600]   about this thing.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:24.240]   And, similarly, the Maps app, I don't necessarily need to find out what the tramway service
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.840]   is across a gorge in Austria.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:32.040]   I just need to know when is the next train home and how do I get there?
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.760]   So all of these things are ways to put it, for instance, on the lock screen.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:40.280]   I love the way that now the lock screen can be kind of the hub of the whole iPhone experience
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:42.760]   if that's relevant to you.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:46.600]   How many times do you just take your phone out of your pocket to either find out what's
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:51.640]   going on or action on something that's just happened?
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:55.400]   Now the lock screen is not just a place to let you know that you're going to want to
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.280]   wake up the phone and launch an app now.
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.280]   It really is.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.800]   Here's the information.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:03.400]   Here's what you can do that's relevant, operations that are relevant to that information.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:08.800]   And because of 3D Touch, you can, Apple can bury all that behind a very, very simple interface
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.680]   that works great in a card style metaphor.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:16.080]   So this is one of those things where it's going to be pretty exciting, not necessarily
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:21.880]   this fall, but a year from now when all of these apps are out in the field, when you
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:24.680]   3D touch on something, you don't necessarily get launched the app.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:29.680]   You will get something that's built from months and months and months of user experience
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.160]   and feedback.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:34.880]   And it really is an exciting time for iPhone.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:40.280]   It could be something that if we were to take a look at the iPhone from two years from
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:47.240]   now, the phone itself might be almost indistinguishable from the iPhone 6, but it will be such a completely
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.000]   new thing.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.520]   You might think that, oh, God, too bad for Apple.
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:54.880]   This is the new revolutionary phone operating system that absolutely kicked the iPhone's
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.880]   ass.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:56.880]   And, oh, damn it.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:57.880]   I wonder who makes it.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:58.880]   Oh, no, it's an Apple logo.
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:02.720]   Yeah, it's super interesting because it didn't just like it sounds like it's just notifications,
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:06.680]   but to Andy's point, if you're in maps now, because maps have app integration, you don't
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:10.920]   have to leave maps to do open table or to use Uber, and it sounds like a simple thing.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:14.560]   But again, when humans change context, when you change rooms, when you change apps, you
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.120]   forget, you see what's in front of you.
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.000]   I was supposed to call an Uber now in five minutes late.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.320]   I'm not going to get there in time.
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:23.880]   Instead, you see the address you Uber immediately, and it's a better human interaction.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.280]   And that's true for Siri and it's true for messages.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.080]   Now, just the ideal that we could all get together.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.840]   And Andy's order for food and Alex's order.
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.480]   And then all of that just comes together.
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:33.480]   The delivery arrives.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:37.040]   And none of us have to open all these different apps or try to explain to each other what we
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.040]   want to get.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.200]   It's just so much more convenient.
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.680]   It's really, we've mentioned this before, but it's interesting because I think both
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:48.360]   Android and Apple, iOS are moving in the direction of getting away from launching apps into
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:53.600]   more of a contextual experience where the phone just does what you want to do wherever
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.600]   you are.
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.040]   It's like the move from websites to web services within that with app staff services.
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.040]   Right.
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.360]   Yeah, and I think that there's a lot of just in time kind of information that you want
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:07.280]   to log into something, whether it's a receipt, whether it's a little bit of information,
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:13.720]   all those things that is really cumbersome to go through that whole process of just get
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.520]   that piece.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:19.160]   So having these things kind of fly up and disappear I think is going to be amazing.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:22.800]   What is required for this to work?
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.720]   Apps have to be rewritten to take advantage of this?
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:30.160]   Or they have to add the iOS 10 APIs.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.160]   Okay.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:35.720]   And also, I think a lot of these things are going to have to be re-conceptualized.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:36.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:40.600]   Over the past couple of years, Apple, but the Apple Watch and other technologies, Apple
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:48.000]   has spent a lot of time sort of encouraging developers to, again, take a three-day retreat,
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.360]   do not take any technology with you and just have a notepad and a pen and decide what is
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.200]   the purpose of your app.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:57.520]   Because if you just say, here is the interface that we've spent three or four years building
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:02.000]   over five different larger versions, and you try to, I'm going to take that and I'm going
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.480]   to put it in a widget screen or I'm going to put it in a watch screen, you will make
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.120]   something that's very, very bad.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:13.200]   But if you say that our app is an app for capturing your ideas, you will start to think
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.840]   of, okay, so if I'm going to do that, if I'm going to, in a widget form on a lock screen,
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:22.760]   what part of that feature of that function is the user going to expect?
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.920]   That's why I think there's going to be a year when we see the really elegant stuff coming
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:26.920]   up.
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.120]   And the actual conceptualization is going to be necessary.
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:31.120]   And are you still required to have an app?
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.160]   You can't just live on it as a basically.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:37.720]   On iOS, yes, on the Mac, they've allowed some, for example, some photo filter extensions
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:41.920]   don't have apps, they're called headless apps because there's no downloadable container.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.440]   On iOS, it's a management thing.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:48.280]   It's the same reason why if you delete a stock app on iOS 10, it doesn't really delete because
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.200]   they're so tiny and they're so integrated.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.560]   It just hides the icon, but to get it back, they just have you go to the app store.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.720]   It doesn't really live on the app store, but it's expected behavior.
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:00.160]   So you could theoretically have a headless app because they've done all the work to make
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.160]   that possible.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:04.400]   But if you downloaded just, that was just a keyboard and no app, how would you know how
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.400]   to use it?
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.520]   If you wanted to delete it, how would you know how some people, I think they've kept the
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:11.760]   container idea around because it's useful to people.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:16.000]   But I remember Brad Ellis, who's really, really well known iOS designer, he was at Pacific
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.800]   Elm for a while and he's done a lot of really famous apps.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.280]   He was saying when the Apple Watch and iOS 8 came out that you don't really need an app
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.280]   for some things.
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:26.560]   For some things, the notifications are going to be the most powerful and important experience.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.680]   And if you just spend your time nailing that, then you'll have 90% of the functionality
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.840]   all your users ever want.
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:35.400]   I think there's a lot of, to what Andy said earlier, a lot of truth to that.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.800]   And we're working on something that is heavily notification based.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.840]   And one of the things that we're really thinking about is having the app really just manage
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.640]   preferences and how you set things up.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.120]   And if you're going to some of the management tools, and that's really all it does because
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.720]   the whole thing is designed to sit inside of notifications.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:54.600]   And we're just trying to figure out that whole process.
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.400]   Now, there's resource constraint.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:00.080]   So some of the keyboards still use the app because there's not enough RAM or storage
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.040]   for them to have all the functionality on that keyboard.
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:05.680]   So that's why they ask you for extended access so they can actually pull the app, get more
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.480]   stuff and present it to you.
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.480]   Right.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:10.080]   It also changes lock screen behavior.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:16.960]   Now this is going to be an interesting situation because the full functionality requires you,
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:21.560]   as you mentioned earlier, to allow people to send messages on your behalf.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:23.360]   And see all your widget information.
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.960]   And you can't play Pokemon in the lockscreen.
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:26.960]   Okay, you're right.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:27.960]   You're right.
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.120]   Some things you might have to say that same.
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:48.360]   But that's a really good point that I think that a lot of people are going to want to make
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:53.720]   the and make for them an intelligent choice that I don't care if I'm compromising my
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:57.080]   security by keeping all these notifications visible.
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:01.800]   Just like I'm in the habit of not leaving my wallet on the restaurant table when I leave
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:02.800]   to go to the bathroom.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:06.480]   I actually I'm willing to take my wallet and put it in my pocket to avoid having to put
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:07.960]   it in a box and lock it.
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:11.800]   I think once the next iOS comes out, a lot of people are going to say I would much rather
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.520]   have no restrictions on what can go on my lock screen.
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:18.760]   But I will now be much more careful about making sure that my phone is screened down
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:21.640]   when it's when it's out where people can see it and making sure that I take it with me,
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.640]   even if I'm leaving for just a minute.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.840]   You can imagine a period in time when the home button goes away and the biometrics are
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:31.920]   in the screen and there may be ubiquitous in the screen and it recognizes you can set
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:35.360]   it so that recognizes the touch of your finger and then shows you that information.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:38.120]   Well, I think it's built for the future.
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:42.280]   I think I think that we're you know, multiple verifications with, you know, I think we're
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:47.120]   going to see, you know, some of the Jason Bourne type type stuff where we're looking
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:52.200]   at facial structure plus your, you know, plus, you know, your voice recognition.
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.640]   Windows 10 does that already?
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.160]   My voice is my passport.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.640]   Yeah, Windows 10 with hello has looks at your face.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.080]   And I think that those things, I mean, Iris will be very complicated.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:06.280]   I, Iris and Retina are probably not a probably a long way out, but the other ones are fairly
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:10.440]   easy and you know, it's one thing to hack your fingerprint.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:13.920]   It's one thing to hack other things, but you get to two or three of those and it would
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:17.320]   be almost impossible to hack those well.
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:20.960]   And I think a lot of times now that I'm used to using my Apple Pay and I'm used to getting
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:26.280]   in with my, with my finger, I find, you know, code, you know, password seem to be frustrating.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.440]   The funny thing for me is how our behaviors change because the iPhone really only has
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:33.240]   two hardware buttons and they, that means that it should be highly differentiated.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:36.520]   But because of the way the home button worked, we use it as a de facto wake button.
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:40.040]   So you had the wake button on the side and the home button on the front, you could push
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:41.880]   either one to wake your iPhone.
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:45.000]   And that really wasn't the intended purpose, but it became the purpose.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.040]   And then you got touch ID and touch ID too was so fast.
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:51.200]   You know, Craig, I think he said you just blow past your lock screen and people had
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:53.760]   forgotten there was a sleep wake button because no one ever used it.
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.120]   You just use the home button.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.240]   And so then they tried saying, well, use the sleep button for that and use the home
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.760]   button for that, but you can't really fight habit.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.280]   So now there's no more swipe to unlock.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.560]   One of the most distinguishing features of the original iPhone is just gone.
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:09.400]   And it says, so now you put touch ID on and it says, just click the home button to open.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:12.960]   But first you get the lock notifications, then you can press your way in.
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.640]   And some people had a lot of trouble adjusting.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:19.200]   I think people aren't going to like it because it means if you don't want to sit on the lock
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.200]   screen, you have to do two things, right?
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.960]   You have to unlock it and then press it again.
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:27.200]   And previously the people were upset because it would go right through the line.
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:28.200]   I know.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:29.200]   I understand.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.200]   I understand the issue.
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:31.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:33.200]   It's challenging.
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.200]   And I think there they'll probably be a setting that lets you choose which one because it's
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.200]   the same action.
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.200]   Yeah, that would be nice.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:40.200]   So what are your features?
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.200]   Go ahead.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.000]   One of the to relate what we're talking about.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.520]   Notification Center now, it groups things by apps, which is great.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:47.840]   And it has a little dismiss button like it always did.
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:49.600]   And it just dismisses one section.
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:53.560]   But if you 3D touch that, it gives you like the Apple Watch dismiss all, which is something
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:57.000]   people have been asking for on iOS for years and years and years.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.360]   So you can 3D touch that dismiss all notifications are gone.
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.360]   Everything is clean.
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.360]   You can relax again.
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:05.080]   So if you get iOS 10 beta and again, be careful.
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:06.840]   It's not fully baked.
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:07.840]   It's still a beta.
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:08.840]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:11.760]   But if you get it, you will certainly notice the differences in messages and notifications.
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:16.760]   But are there other things that you would point to that people should pay attention to?
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.600]   Some people are saying the new control center is a big.
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:20.920]   I have a mixed feeling.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:25.800]   So like on Notification Center, you swipe sideways to tab, but the visual doesn't change.
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.960]   Control Center used to be one thing where you had all your toggles, all your apps, all
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:29.960]   your media controls.
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:30.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:31.960]   And it would just be there.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:34.880]   Now there's a 3-tab control center.
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.720]   And in some ways, it's nice because it's more roomy.
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:41.040]   A lot of iOS 10, the information density is much lower.
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.040]   So you have fewer things.
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.600]   Those notifications are really big now on the screen.
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.200]   And yeah, you can scroll through them.
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:50.360]   But for people who want to see a lot of data at a glance, it's less good because you have
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.680]   to scroll through them.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:55.000]   And control centers like that, you don't get as much on each of those panels.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.920]   So yes, you do get beautiful album art if you swipe over and see the music panel.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.480]   And if you swipe over again, you have the HomeKit panel.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:03.200]   And you see these big thumbnails.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.840]   And you can turn on your devices.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.800]   But you have to actually swipe between tabs.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.200]   And you see those tabs change.
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:10.920]   Those are rounded rectangles.
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:12.160]   And you see them physically move.
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.120]   And to me, that's visually slow.
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:17.880]   So even if it's really not slower than Notification Center, it looks slow to me.
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:21.880]   And if I want to get to the music controls, I launch this, I have to go.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.040]   It's got great new functionality.
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:27.360]   You can 3D press on the flashlight button and choose the intensity of your flashlight,
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.360]   for example, or 3D.
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:33.920]   It may have overloaded what was a very simple and should probably be a very simple interface.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:38.040]   Well, once we're just visually make it look faster.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:43.320]   I do think that area of the experience is ripe for revolution.
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:48.240]   I've always wondered how long it was going to take before you could force touch on,
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:53.640]   for instance, the Wi-Fi widget and get popped up here are a list of active Wi-Fi networks
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:58.200]   you can switch to right now because it still takes way too much, too many operations.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:05.520]   When you're home and you're on the wrong Wi-Fi network or you are, I take out my iPad at
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:10.360]   a Starbucks and I really want to use my phone as a Dunkin Donuts.
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:12.360]   The Dunkin Donuts has really bad Wi-Fi.
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:15.320]   Wendy's and Starbucks has great Wi-Fi.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.480]   And so I go into Dunkin Donuts.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:22.760]   I really want my iPad to connect to my phone and not to the Honor Wi-Fi, but it automatically,
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:26.240]   the first one it saw was the in-house one.
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.480]   And it takes me so many taps every single time I enter the space to switch from one Wi-Fi
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:31.840]   hotspot to another.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.920]   And I feel like, "Why can't I do that right here?
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.320]   There's a local that's going to be turned it off and turned it on.
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:41.200]   Why can't I do it from right here?"
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:48.560]   The public service announcement, Pokemon Go, has been updated minutes ago to 1.0.1.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:51.680]   They say they fixed the Google account scope issue.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:55.000]   So they made good on their promise not to do that.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.800]   They also have fixed some other pain points.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:00.840]   Trainers don't have to enter their username and password repeatedly after a forced log
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:01.840]   app.
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.440]   That will stop people triggering the Google timeout.
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:09.520]   It's new stability to the Pokemon trainer account login, which means maybe instead of
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:11.880]   using Google, you'd want to use that.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:15.800]   Fixed resolved issues causing crashes.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:21.800]   And at the end, the Niantic team says, "Again, we are humbled by the overwhelming response."
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:24.200]   Thank you.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:29.520]   If you're concerned about the permissions issue, you might want to hithy to the app store.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:31.680]   I think you have to log in again once you update.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:35.840]   You won't lose anything, but you do have to revoke it and then log in again.
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.720]   That would make a lot of sense.
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:40.240]   What else in iOS 10 should we...
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:44.840]   By the way, playing on Pokemon Go on an iPad really is a luxury experience.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:47.960]   Especially when you're out at the park and you're just holding it up and people think
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.320]   you're taking your photograph and going to get angry.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.720]   If I'm not taking a photograph, I'm playing Pokemon Go.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:54.560]   If you have the pro, you're really golden.
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.960]   You can say, "I'm painting a picture."
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.320]   Oh, 0.9 inches of Pokemon Go.
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:25:59.320]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:01.320]   There's a Rattata.
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.320]   I better go get that while we...
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.400]   Anything else you want to mention about iOS 10?
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:11.000]   We talked about it a fair bit before, but I think that Swift Playgrounds is definitely
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000]   worth the point.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.680]   Oh, I forgot to even download it.
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:15.000]   You have to download that separately, right?
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.400]   Yeah, you download that separately once you have it installed.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:23.760]   And it is...I was just last night, before I was sitting with my daughter, six years old,
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:28.000]   and she's like pretty deep into the levels.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.560]   It's kind of working through the stuff, and it's just a lot of fun.
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:34.120]   And she's learning how to code, and just excited about it.
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:37.480]   And so if you think you want to get your kids into it, it's really important to have
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.800]   them thinking through that stuff.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:40.160]   And they may not become programmers.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:46.200]   I mean, she sees herself as a ballet dancer, and she's very good actually.
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:49.800]   And as well as an incredible artist.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.680]   But having her have that, I think the mixture of all the things she's already doing in life
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:59.000]   that is kind of more analog with thinking about functions and things like that.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.200]   That would be a good reason to upgrade your extra iPad or something like that.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:03.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:08.920]   I'll be honest with you, I'll be honest with you, really thinking about if you can, it's
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:11.520]   worth getting an iPad for your kids to learn how to program.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.080]   To get iOS 10 beta, go to beta.apple.com.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:17.080]   You'll have to sign into your Apple account.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.680]   It doesn't have to be a developer account.
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:21.120]   That's why it's because it's a public beta now.
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.960]   And you don't have to register the UDIDs anymore.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.840]   I mean, it's much simpler.
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:27.480]   So what you'll do is you'll log in, you'll enroll your device in it.
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:28.680]   In fact, I'm going to do it for the iPad.
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:30.520]   I think it's worth doing it on the iPad too.
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:35.280]   Georgia, who won't update production software, put the beta on her iPad and both her kids'
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.280]   iPads, and they sit there together doing playgrounds.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.280]   It's amazing.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.280]   Yeah, I think it might be worth doing.
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:41.640]   So I'll do that.
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:46.000]   Even though this is the one I use for iOS today, might as well just go all in.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.840]   What will happen is once you enroll, you'll get an email with a link to a profile.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.560]   You want to go to that on your device, iOS device, download the profile.
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.480]   Once you do that, you've modified your device.
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:00.200]   You've told it that you're a developer.
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:02.080]   Sorry, I have to do what I'll be right back.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:03.080]   Just do it back up.
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.080]   Even do it.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:05.080]   Please.
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:08.800]   Before handing case, you want to roll back because some people just won't be happy.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:09.800]   And you'll want, yeah.
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.520]   It just gives you the flexibility.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.400]   One more little tip, and I mentioned this yesterday on iOS today, check the box that
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:20.160]   says encrypt the backup because that way your passwords are preserved and it makes
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:22.320]   it a lot easier if you decide to roll back.
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.040]   It's not a big pain in the butt to roll back.
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:25.760]   You have all your settings will be there.
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:28.760]   And the people have been asking about the remote app and it is available on the developer
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:31.880]   site, but it downloads as something you have to install over Xcode.
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:35.880]   It's not as easy and it's not available as easily as the playgrounds app.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.080]   That's why you won't see it when you.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:38.880]   Oh, there's a new remote app.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.480]   Yeah, it's got all the Siri functionality for the Apple TV.
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:42.480]   Oh, that's right.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:43.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:44.480]   Exciting.
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:45.480]   Okay.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:49.680]   I don't think that there's I don't want to walk over one of our sponsors today, but
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:53.680]   I don't think that there's any other manufacturer or operating system that benefits holding on
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:57.200]   to your own your old phones and your own devices like Apple.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:01.080]   It's like I have a bunch of previous Android phones that are kind of okay, but they're
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.800]   not really that useful.
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:07.160]   But every single iPad and every single iOS device I have is still in use somewhere, not
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:12.280]   as a primary device, but as a beautiful nightstand device or as a beautiful second screen somewhere
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:17.400]   or as will be the case in iOS now stuff that will be I think will be taken out of drawers
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:22.760]   and again, snatched back from children because you can find so many new uses for it as this
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.680]   system builds out.
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:26.120]   So I'm going to go ahead.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:32.560]   After you enroll the iOS device and download the profile, you just go to settings and they'll
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.520]   be a new update for you.
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:38.320]   Yeah, so basically it puts you on the beta path and you'll stay on that beta path.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:41.720]   If you want to stop getting beta is just going and delete that profile.
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:46.560]   It's in general assistant, sorry, settings general configuration profiles and get rid
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:47.560]   of it.
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:48.560]   Oh, and then you'll roll back.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.560]   Oh, that's good.
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.560]   Well, you won't roll back.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:53.200]   You won't like you'll want to restore your phone, but if you just want to stop get like
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:58.160]   let's say iOS 10 comes out 10.0 comes out and you don't have any interest in the 10.1
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.160]   beta.
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:02.000]   You can just go delete that configuration profile and it'll no longer pull for it.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.080]   It won't say you've got it anymore.
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:07.480]   And you'll see not just the Sierra beta, probably beta came out as well same day.
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:09.320]   Yeah, I was just about to ask for that.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.320]   So it's same process.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.400]   You enroll your Mac in it.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:15.480]   Yeah, and it gives you a coupon code for the Mac App Store.
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:17.560]   Then you go there and it downloads it for you.
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:18.720]   Okay, good.
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:19.800]   Cool.
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.600]   And what do you think?
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:24.160]   Is that worth doing or is that something to hold off on?
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:28.000]   Yeah, I mean, there's there are some things that are a little bit goofy with it and they're
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.760]   different for everybody like and like any beta, but it adds Siri, which is fun to play
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:32.760]   with.
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:35.800]   They changed the command key, like the default keyboard shortcut for that.
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:39.360]   So now you instead of just pressing command space, like you would for a spotlight, you
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:40.520]   hold it down and you get Siri.
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:44.160]   And I've been using Siri more than I thought it would because again, they've made it persistent,
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:47.000]   which is really weird when you think about it because you're used to asking Siri for
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.600]   something, then it goes away.
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:52.640]   But now Siri can just hang out if you want and you can add the results to notification
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.640]   center.
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:56.680]   So if you do a search and you want that search to be updated live, just add it to notification
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:59.320]   center and then you can leave Siri results out.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.600]   So if you search for something, you can go over and work on it and then just ask Siri
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:03.600]   for something else.
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:06.920]   And if you're in a full screen app, it's really handy because you can have Siri do like basic
[01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:10.840]   settings changes and things for you without you having to scroll over, go back to a, you
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:13.080]   know, multi-screen mode, pick something.
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:14.480]   So I found it to be pretty convenient.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:18.480]   It doesn't seem like the massive change that iOS 10 is in terms of the concept of what
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:22.840]   an operating system, how it interacts with you in very short intervals, much less what
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:25.000]   like the watch OS differences are.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.800]   But it once again adds really important features to the Mac, the least of which is accessibility
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:34.400]   for people who just didn't ever had voice command functionality on the Mac at all.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:38.120]   And I think that's found improvement for them.
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:43.920]   You'll have a restart on iOS and I presume on Sierra on Mac OS as well.
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:46.080]   And once you do, then you get to do the.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:49.520]   And again, you'll stay on the beta until you decide to get off.
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:50.520]   What happens then?
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:51.520]   Okay.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:54.920]   So as I remember them, when the release version comes out, you're no longer in the beta track.
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:55.920]   You are.
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:56.920]   So you stay on the beta.
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.560]   Previously, I believe you, I have been and I don't know if there's a difference between
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:03.120]   the developer beta and the public beta, but I think once you're enrolled, there's a chance
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:04.120]   you might get it.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:06.040]   So that's when you delete the profile and start over.
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:09.360]   If you don't want to continue and some people do and some people just stay on it, don't
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.480]   download any software.
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:17.400]   So here is just, you could show this.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:21.440]   There's what you'll get eventually, iOS 10 public beta one, you'll be invited to download
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.440]   it.
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.960]   It's not a huge download, is it?
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:24.960]   I mean, it's it's 1.8 gigabytes.
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:27.640]   No, they're way better at optimizing that stuff.
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:32.600]   And what with mine on one of the devices I had that I have a 16 gigabyte iPad, just that
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.840]   I got because I didn't really need an extra iPad.
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.440]   I just needed to review it.
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.720]   And it said, you know, we're we've optimized your storage.
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:41.680]   We're deleting these two large gains, but we'll put them right back for you after we've
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:45.200]   installed the operating system because we need the room for staging.
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:46.200]   That's good.
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:48.000]   That's the way to handle it.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.920]   So sorry, you don't get an email.
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.600]   Somebody scooter X, thank you for correcting me.
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.480]   I thought you read somewhere you got an email.
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:55.480]   I didn't get an email.
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:56.840]   I just got to go here.
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:33:00.120]   You could sign up to find out when the public beta would be available.
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.120]   That's what you know.
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:03.200]   That was what the page used to have on it.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.200]   Got it.
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:05.200]   Got it.
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:08.240]   People were asking why there's no public beta for Apple TV or for watch OS?
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:13.320]   They're both harder to install and much, much more difficult to roll back on.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:16.360]   For example, the previous watch OS, not this one, you actually had to ship your watch
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:17.760]   back to Apple.
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:21.320]   So it's better not to have people like it's fun to play with those things.
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:24.640]   But if anything goes wrong, it's a hard thing to fix.
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:32.640]   A guy who styles himself muscle nerd on Twitter and iPhone hacker is pointing out that there
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:42.600]   are even more unencrypted chunks in the new iOS 10 beta, the boot loaders, which had previously
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:48.080]   been encrypted or no longer encrypted, the RAM disk, the kernel and the main file system.
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:49.080]   What do you make of that?
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:52.360]   And why would that be significant?
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:57.080]   My understanding is that they just, they took an honest look at the system and they realized
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:00.720]   that there was no user land data there and there was no need to encrypt it.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:03.600]   And that just made it easier for them to maintain and easier.
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.680]   There was some slight performance enhancements, but basically it just loud and optimized the
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:07.680]   system better.
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:10.040]   No reason to encrypt it if there's nothing private in it.
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:11.040]   Yes.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:14.320]   It's the same thing for all of us, right?
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:18.360]   And just, and with Apple as an interesting company, because if, yeah, they'll sometimes
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:19.960]   keep doing something just because it's easy.
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:23.200]   Like there's no reason to go back and change it, but they often go back.
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:25.240]   They just look and they say, well, we did this this way last time.
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.560]   We'll just keep doing it.
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.800]   But the actual process is do we still need to do that?
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:29.800]   Was that a good thing to do?
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:30.800]   Was it a good decision?
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.040]   Is there a better way to do it?
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:33.040]   And if they can, they'll change it.
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:34.840]   And this sounds like it's one of those things.
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:41.040]   If you want a reason to go to Italy, Apple is opening its first iOS developer Academy
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.000]   at the University of Naples.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000]   Wow.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.160]   That sounds really, really cool.
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:52.800]   Sanjivani Ataducio is coastal suburb of Naples.
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:57.360]   The free Academy will provide more than 200 students with practical skills and training
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:01.880]   and developing apps in the first year.
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:03.400]   That is really cool.
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:05.200]   Is it free for non-Italian?
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:06.200]   I don't know.
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:09.000]   You can find out more at the University of Naples website.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.120]   You do have to take an online test in Italian or English, and then you go to the interview
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:15.120]   stage.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.120]   So it's not automatic.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:17.840]   You've got to get in.
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:21.320]   Once you get in, it is free.
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:22.320]   It's interesting.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.920]   Apple's obviously subsidizing this.
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:31.280]   And their goal is to get the next generation of entrepreneurs in Italy.
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:36.120]   I'm curious if they're picking this based on, they're seeing in the back end, they're
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:40.320]   seeing a high demand from a certain country with a low supply.
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.320]   Must be, right?
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:44.360]   Developers would say, "Okay, we're going to put something," or if it's some kind of deal
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.360]   with the government.
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:50.120]   There are a lot of things going on like that.
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:53.600]   Google, for instance, just announced that they're basically giving away free Android
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.040]   training to just thousands and thousands of installations in India and basically trying
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:05.600]   to get everybody learning how to write Android apps in India, which is not a big mystery
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:14.000]   given that Android is well prepared to have been the biggest phone platform in India.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:19.200]   And now that Apple is looking for other places to sell phones that haven't been buying iPhones
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:23.840]   in bulk yet, it's probably best to make sure that the next generation of really great developers
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:29.280]   starts off on Android as opposed to being seduced by iOS.
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:32.360]   I think we talked about this previously, but I signed both my God Kids Up for the, they're
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:35.840]   doing Apple's doing the Apple Camp, which is a free camp offered at all the Apple stores
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:37.040]   in the summer.
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:40.360]   And they have a week of code this week, this year for the first time.
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:45.080]   They'll learn video game programming, not with Swift because Swift is for 12 and up technically,
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.640]   and this is for eight to 12, but they're going to learn basics of video games with some script
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:49.640]   tools.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:53.120]   And then they get to program Sfiro, like do some robot programming with Sfiro.
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:54.560]   And it's, I forget which week it is.
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:55.960]   I think it's two weeks from now.
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:57.520]   And you can just check at your local Apple store.
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:01.240]   But those are great too, because they have a high ratio of instructors to kids and they
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:05.360]   provide a really good opportunity for kids to get introduced to that stuff.
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:11.360]   And beware of a new attack, you know, we've, we've done this a lot on the show.
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:16.120]   Sometimes accidentally, sometimes I'm ashamed to say intentionally triggered your echo or
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:21.880]   your slo-mo or your cool by saying keywords.
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:24.560]   Apparently bad guys are trying to do the same thing.
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:35.360]   And embedding hidden voice commands in a black box code, dying things, robots, you know, toys
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:41.760]   that have secret Siri commands in the sounds.
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:45.840]   The attack works by playing specifically crafted obfuscating commands, easy to recognize by
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:50.680]   the targeted devices, but are difficult to understand by human listeners.
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:55.320]   This is a YouTube video that says it's going to demonstrate this attack.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:01.080]   The purpose of this demo, the phone was placed 10.1 feet away from the speakers as shown.
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:07.560]   They have a phone and a desk in the conference room.
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:08.560]   Command one.
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:09.560]   Copy Google.
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:10.560]   Wow.
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:16.200]   So that was kind of a kind of a robotic okay Google.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:17.200]   Copy Google.
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.200]   Okay.
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:22.840]   It's the city of Hong Kong.
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:23.840]   Hmm.
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.880]   Just like it's working.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:27.560]   Whatever it's doing is working.
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:33.880]   I don't know though if you can get slow mo or Google or Alexa did I mean I mean echo to
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:35.680]   do anything bad.
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:37.920]   It's the city of Hong Kong.
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:40.600]   We need the master control processor from Tron.
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:45.600]   It's what well that's what they're saying is you could put this in a you know a a toy.
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:49.480]   For instance and people would think it was just a toy a sound and this demo is all with
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:51.200]   Google but they say they can do it with Siri.
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:55.120]   Well when you think about the internet things I mean I can see a spy thriller where someone
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:39:00.080]   you know gets into their stereo system or or something else or has something like this
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:04.040]   that calls out something that then attaches to their lighting system which then you know
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:05.040]   blows the house.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.040]   Right.
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.080]   I don't think you know so there's a lot of interesting things when you certainly could
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:09.080]   be annoying.
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:10.080]   I mean you could be annoying.
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:15.440]   You could turn up somebody's thermostat or you know you could definitely well it's
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:16.440]   prank them.
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:22.320]   It's it's it's not that this one that this thing can buy and of itself kill or change
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:23.960]   a thermostat or anything like that.
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:28.240]   It's more like the things that I more worry about are is there a weakness in this really
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:32.680]   easy to get to device that could establish a presence on my network.
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:37.360]   So basically I've got I'm on the you you've got the you've got your attackers on the beach
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:42.240]   at the very least because you have this really really poorly secured refrigerator or this
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:49.000]   really really poorly secured media player inside inside a stereo and because the people
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.200]   who made that aren't thinking like security people they're thinking about stereo makers.
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:57.120]   But now it's just a beach head they still have to storm the beach and get into the concrete
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:02.760]   pillboxes but there they're one level closer to success than they would have been if not
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:07.600]   for the fact that someone did not put a simple piece of open source security software on
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.160]   my toaster.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:16.320]   So I'm installing iOS 10 on the iPad we'll see if it's done before the show is over it's
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:20.200]   moving pretty quick though I have to say it's only been a few minutes.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:24.080]   Our show today we're going to get your pics of the week guys queue them up our show today
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:30.920]   brought to you by Squarespace the place to make your next professional website even if
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:36.040]   it's just your personal website from a simple cover page to the perfect portfolio a professional
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:41.320]   blog an online store Squarespace makes it easy you start with templates designed by the
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:47.640]   best designers but also the best engineers to give you the state of the art in web design
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:51.640]   mobile responsive so the site doesn't have a separate mobile site it looks great on all
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:58.680]   size screens just kind of automatically magically e-commerce is built into each and every page
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:05.600]   they have some amazing specialized templates for musicians for photographers for writers
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:09.440]   I use the I started it's very easy to get started you just go to squarespace.com and
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:13.040]   they've got a free trial for you and I started just setting up a cover page and I wanted
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:17.320]   just a one page with some images and links to my social networks it was so easy then
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:22.680]   I thought I should attach my blog to it so I did that imported all my blog stuff easily
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:27.160]   and then I thought you know I should put my pictures there too used to keep them on smug
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:32.320]   mug when I put and that was easy now my event calendar is there it's so easy that you just
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:37.400]   do more and more and your site looks like it was designed by a pro because it was but
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:41.600]   they're not cookie cutter and I think so many of these other web hosting companies give
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:46.560]   you sites that you can tell I know immediately where it came from not Squarespace they really
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:53.120]   are beautiful they just unveiled some really fantastic new magazine style templates you
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:56.960]   know with the grid style landing pages that have infinite scroll at the bottom related
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:02.600]   posts the author profile integrated search right in the header all of which means if
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:07.680]   you're if you're publishing for instance on the web this is the best way to do it regardless
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:11.200]   of skill level Squarespace websites can be made to look unique with just a few clicks
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:17.280]   and if you're a developer the sky is the limit you can do anything you want they have a blank
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:20.320]   template you can start with or start with one of their existing templates get access
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:26.360]   to all the code modify it at will and of course there are and Lisa did this with with her new
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:31.920]   business she wanted a really nice website and and she said you know I'm just going to
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:37.160]   hire a Squarespace designer there are a lot of independent designers and developers and
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:43.200]   setup experts for hire very affordable what a great job they did work directly with her
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:48.080]   they don't work for Squarespace but Squarespace has a directory of them it's all there and
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:53.280]   by the way if you have built or contribute to three or more active Squarespace websites
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:59.320]   they want you to know about the Squarespace circle which is a kind of a club for heavy
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:04.000]   Squarespace users circle membership includes advanced guides optimized support six month
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:10.680]   trial periods for new projects and more and if you have an idea as I said they not only
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:14.120]   have designers and developers but even if you don't want to do that you just want to
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:20.160]   get the domain name they now sell domain names Squarespace domains over 200 top level domains
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:27.320]   of course dot com dot net but many many more you can register domain and then unlike these
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:34.480]   many of the other hosts they'll give you a clean spam free parking page that looks great
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:38.040]   until you're ready to start building your site so what this is definitely the best way
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:42.960]   to get that you know lock in that domain name before you know when you're ready to go I
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:48.000]   love it I've moved my blog to it about a year ago and I couldn't be happier start your
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.960]   free trial Squarespace.com and when you do buy just always ask you use the offer code
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:56.840]   MAC break that way they'll know you heard about it on MAC break weekly and you get a
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:05.480]   benefit to 10% off Squarespace the place to make your next website time for our picks
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:12.480]   of the week who should I start with today I better start with Andy because if we don't
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:20.320]   start with Andy somebody's gonna steal his pick exactly what it is now yes yes yes it
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:25.560]   is of course Prisma that really cool cool photo filter app and I in my in the show notes
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:29.040]   I said that I'm sure that there are three people who have picked this if you do if you
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:34.320]   have if you this is the only one you've picked I have an alternate no Andy you're the first
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:39.000]   nobody picked it yesterday and IOS today you are the first congratulations we saved it
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:44.880]   so so if your eyeballs roll at the oh good another another photo filter app oh look now
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:49.520]   I can make my my I can make it look like a different kind of old polar right from 1963
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:55.760]   no this is a really amazing app that when I say that it takes photos and turns it into
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:00.960]   art I don't mean that they add a blur filter and then increase the contrast so that it
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:05.880]   kind of looks like oil painting I mean that they use it's actually using AI it's actually
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:12.120]   using deep dream type technology to basically reinterpret it intelligently into different
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:19.400]   sort of formats and the results can be almost shockingly good I just put up a Google Photos
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:27.160]   album that will I quickly gave you an Instagram but I put together a Google Photos album and
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:31.640]   it's a here's a pick go to the picture if when you get it of the of the flower I took
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:38.160]   in the in a hot house where it's a nicely done picture of a white flower look at this
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:44.920]   so here's the original which is a beautiful picture with lots of texture and just gorgeous
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:50.120]   and then and then picks them up without doing anything but oh one of these filters oh you
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:54.760]   would think that this was a really beautifully done water culture Georgia oh Keith could have
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:46:00.920]   I mean she's out of business yeah I mean and then I there's so many of these are in filters
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:04.120]   and it's not like you can you have to screw around with a whole bunch of different settings
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:07.160]   there are enough of them and they're different enough that you just here is a photo that is
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:11.240]   interesting to me I'm going to see which of these filters does the most interesting thing to it
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:16.680]   and there are stuff where if people did not know that this app existed if I just I feel as though if
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:24.440]   I made a really good archival print of it of let's say no greater than let's say five by seven and
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:29.640]   put it in a nice $40 frame and put it on the wall of a coffee house I could get money for it as
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:35.880]   you're tending to be actually cool like original art it's really gorgeous wow it's just yeah
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:40.200]   again sometimes it's just shockingly good and the other thing it's it really made me think a lot
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:46.760]   about how I used to be and maybe to an extent still am kind of a snob about you know Instagram
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:51.240]   filters and oh is this really photography and okay yeah you're adding a fun effect it's it's
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:57.000]   good to make photography fun but is it really stuff it really has gotten it really has apps like
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:02.280]   this have gotten have turned my thinking around that it's like in the 35 millimeter days in the
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:08.440]   70s and 80s you could buy like kits of different kinds of really wacky literally color filters like
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:14.040]   grade gradiated like tobacco stains sort of filters and starburst filters and no you're not
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:19.080]   creating the starburst yourself but you made the choice that I'm going to choose and use this filter
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:27.000]   it really does usher in a new generation of photography where really the phone just or your
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:34.600]   camera only does data capture and then apps will then create an image based on that capture
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:42.200]   and I have so much more fun with these images it really is like it's like someone told me about
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:46.600]   the fun that what happens every time you buy a chainsaw or saws all for the first time where
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:50.120]   you take it out of the box and the first thing you do it that is you cut up that fell tree limb
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:53.880]   that you bought it for and then that takes all five seconds and then you spend the rest of the
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:59.240]   day spending playing the game a game called let's see if it'll cut this and in Prisma's the exact
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:03.960]   same thing it's like I will I will I scroll through his I bet that flower picture might look
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:09.240]   interesting and then there I am like fast forward like three hours later I'm still like on the couch
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:13.320]   like going through photos that oh I haven't tried that one yet haven't tried on that one yet
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:19.160]   really really remarkable stuff it's just it's just amazing there is there was a small bit of
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:23.800]   controversy when people found out that oh my goodness it's actually sending day there's a stuff in the
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:28.360]   user agreement that says that we're going to be taking your data and doing things with it that
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:32.200]   actually turned into well no we're not doing all this processing on device we have to send this to
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:37.480]   a server and then send the results back down again in order to make it make things happen so far
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:42.360]   really wow so far it looks like a benign app but there is like a one of the filters is sponsored by
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:47.080]   Paul Mull of it appears so maybe that's where they're getting their money but good happens it's like
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:52.040]   I you would have to do some really awful things with my personal data for me to think that it's not
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:57.960]   worth it to get to get an app of this quality by the way be careful because it is so popular
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:03.640]   it's not available on Android there are a lot of apps claiming to be Prisma they may be malware I
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:08.760]   don't I wouldn't be very careful what you download it is at iOS only right now although
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:16.440]   Android's coming and get it from Prisma Labs Inc Prisma Labs Inc there's also a pro tip when you
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:22.280]   get it it puts a watermark on all your images and at first I thought oh I guess I have to pay
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:27.960]   to get rid of that no it's just a setting go into the settings and turn off the watermarks I actually
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:31.560]   I actually think that's too bad though I was looking forward to oh my goodness if they want
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:37.320]   anything that's not it by the way so you just did exactly what I said not to do karsten that's not
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:43.880]   it do not get that one look at my screen karsten there's a difference did I give you the wrong
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:52.040]   no this is it Prisma Labs Incorporated it's such a great app too so again I don't know I doubt any
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:56.120]   of the Apple stuff is malware Apple's pretty careful about that but it's not Prisma if it's not from
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:02.680]   Prisma Labs Inc and it's free that's some fake Prisma yeah that does happen a lot for people
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:08.120]   the developer will try to like game the keywords so that if someone is searching for x they'll find
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:12.280]   why instead and that does happen on the app store too it's usually not malware but it means that
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:16.840]   you're not getting the app that 100 people on the same weekend are saying oh my god this is the
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:21.240]   greatest thing ever you're instead getting a creepy stupid the one karsten showing is the one I
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:26.200]   downloaded from android and then i'm an app is not available in a platform or a geography there's
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:29.880]   a fake app they're trying to take all its attention yeah I got all excited about it and then I read
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:33.960]   the reviews and one of the reviews said this is not the Prisma you think it is don't get it it might
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:39.960]   be malware you should look at the reviews that'll kind of help not as good as the original yeah
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:46.200]   and I deleted immediately I hope it wasn't malware who knows you never know so be careful but get
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:51.240]   it from Prisma Labs and it supposedly is coming out soon on android which will be nice but boy it is
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:57.560]   you know there's also a trick I don't know how I did it but somehow I got it I took a picture and
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:04.680]   then I got a grid of all the possible app effects and somehow it did them all so in them my photo
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:09.720]   stream had like there's 30 effects or something I had 30 different ways to see the same image
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:14.360]   I'm looking forward to the next update to it not like version two but I think that there are some
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:19.560]   quirks that they need to fix for instance when I it's a very familiar interface it will just simply
[01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:25.400]   either take a picture or look through gallery and whenever I have it load up my gallery it's missing
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:30.200]   like first there are a whole bunch of photos that I think are just plain photos but for some reason
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:34.200]   they're just not showing up they're like empty spots in the grid and I don't know whether it's
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:38.520]   rejecting some because we can tell already this is not going to work out happily for you right if
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:44.600]   you try to use this one or if it's just a bug yeah and it has this activated promo code and I'm
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:49.880]   not sure why maybe there's some additional feature maybe in the future there's going to be like yeah
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:53.800]   they're going to release new filters or something like that yeah oh I know this was the button
[01:51:54.680 --> 01:52:01.400]   click save works on art works automatically and you will suddenly get every possible one of these
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:09.080]   saved so I'm going to use this and I'm going to say next and there's a video and then anyway
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:13.560]   so it's doing the server side that's real no wonder I mean that's really interesting I believe so yeah
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:19.640]   um and there's also I tried it on a couple of different devices and they seem to work
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:25.240]   as quickly on each one of those and there's also you can slide the effect into that yeah yeah
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:30.920]   pretty cool for it 100% 100% always yeah version of Leo yeah I know it's a little
[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:36.680]   it doesn't work you know it does seem like and you did the perfect pictures it does seem like
[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:42.600]   some pictures work better than others the other thing they do that I love is they randomize the
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:47.160]   filters so you don't always use the same filter right you get a different one every time oh that's
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:51.800]   very much coverage because yeah right it's all there it's just it's not that the same filter will
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:55.960]   be in the same place right so it really does encourage you to at some point you will have seen
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:53:00.280]   the effects of every filter that's that's there and this is the one you said it was sponsored by
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:04.360]   Paul Mollive I don't know why does I don't know well I think that there's just like a banner ad up
[01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:08.520]   there I thought that is gonna be put like Paul Mollive logos no it doesn't do anything it's just
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:13.000]   in the filter for some reason that's I'm I'm fine with that yeah go ahead do anything you want
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:19.320]   pomolive naturals it's a nice thing enough money to keep the app going yeah Prisma Labs again
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:25.640]   some images do not let themselves well yeah it looks like I have some sort of fire damage
[01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:28.120]   this could I don't know if this would ever work but if you could just tap a button and make your
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:32.200]   favorite comic book artist draw you right here's a Jim Lee version of Andy here's the
[01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:35.720]   they do have some comic bookies there's a like wait there's like four to seven weeks but
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:40.760]   looks and yeah it's cool here's the art Adam's version of Andy Prisma Prisma
[01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:48.280]   you know I better on not on faces let's just let's just leave it's not bad unless it's you Leo
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:52.040]   if it's anybody else that looks fine yeah I just mean like when you see yourself you always
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:57.240]   love it when you see other people it just try to try to take a picture yourself with like the
[01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:01.480]   lights like directly in your face as opposed to from the top down creating all those all those
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:07.640]   shadows oh okay that might okay make something better okay uh those shadows in other words
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:12.600]   okay that's much better
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:17.800]   much better in some ways
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:31.880]   so much better you have a tar Alex Lindsey you're picking the week
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:36.920]   I'm not sure if I if I pick this if I have the long time ago and I thought I'd at least show
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:42.840]   an interesting use for it so I don't know how many of you guys use these nest cameras but
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:48.360]   used to be drop cam and I think we've talked about on the past but we use them more and more and
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:53.400]   more like so they're all through our office and and which has really helped us a lot but I thought
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:59.880]   I'd show an interesting use case this here is that's my truck uh we have a box truck that's my
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:05.240]   truck and it's stuff and it's somewhere in Indiana going across the you know going across country
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:09.640]   and I know exactly where my load is and if it's shifting and and not working and everything else
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:16.760]   now what that is is it's actually a uh it's our nest camera that then was uh that then paired up
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:23.960]   with a uh a my-fi right so um and then the two of them there's a little bit of geek in there that
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:29.560]   the two of them are the uh in our in our office uh wired the power to the 12 volt that is in the
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:35.960]   you know in the truck so he wired that hardwired it we didn't just use the the cigarette lighter
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:40.360]   um but outside we took it out of the the light actually um that was in the back of the truck
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:46.120]   and so uh so they got power all the time uh and they're connected all the time and we use them a
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:49.640]   lot for work site uh you know a lot of them are just kind of like these little portable ones that we
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:53.720]   just kind of uh you know we have them in our in our office and having our office but they're
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:58.200]   great for I just want to you point kind of two of them on either end of somewhere that you want to
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:02.840]   keep track of looking at each other it's kind of hard to sneak up on them um and uh and we use them
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:07.480]   a lot with uh uh you know for a lot of our location stuff where they're just something you can throw
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:12.360]   in your bag and if you're leaving something behind uh and you're working they're really really easy
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:17.240]   to just set up and and hook to a to either a my-fi if you want to be totally self-contained
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:21.720]   uh because they're you know easily easy to power you know you can you hook them to we hook them
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:26.840]   oftentimes to mophie batteries or some kind of battery um and so all of those things are are
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:30.920]   really easy to use and if if you haven't used them I think maybe we talked about it years ago
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:37.000]   you know the drop cams but the uh they now come in I think sets of three which turn out to be a
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:42.680]   little cheaper if you really want a bunch of them which we often do so um anyway so we're really
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:47.560]   I I just we've been um I've been amazed at at how much we're using them somewhere so I thought I
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:51.560]   would bring that back up to the surface if people aren't aren't looking at them I haven't found a
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:56.280]   you know there's a lot of other cameras uh and you can't talk to people through them um we
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:01.000]   try not to do that in the office it makes it worse. It's like carry whatever voice comes out of the
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:07.480]   camera I just have to point out. It's yeah it's it's kind of funny so uh so anyway but it actually
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:11.400]   it actually carries pretty well so if you want to talk through your phone and and a lot of times
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:16.760]   what happens is my my phone has uh you know working with our security uh my phone anytime
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:20.040]   anytime someone's coming in the office I get a little notification I can hit on it I can see
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:25.560]   the you know see what's going on uh there and um and so it helped a lot when we first moved into
[01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:30.040]   our office because the alarm kept on going off there was some bad sensor you know and uh and so
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:33.560]   they could they'd call me at like four o'clock in the morning and I did not have to drive over to
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:37.720]   figure that out I would just uh look at my phones they know and it falls a lot. This is a good time to
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:42.520]   uh to actually get in the market for something like that Amazon Prime it's Prime Day right and
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:49.080]   Amazon Prime has a bunch of deals on uh security cameras right so um I don't know if they have let
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:53.000]   me just see if there's one on the the drive and there are a lot of them out there I will say that
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:58:00.120]   uh I have I probably have half of them yeah half of the options I bought through a lot of them and
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:04.760]   that's why I thought I'd bring it up is that I just haven't found one that had the same ease of
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:11.560]   use as far as setup clustering six or eight or ten of them together uh the record settings um and
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:15.960]   you know you discover all kinds of things about you know your kids you know you find out mostly
[01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:21.960]   that your daughter has been instigating all the fights with her and then and then he's only caught
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:28.120]   hitting her you know you know like but after after being you know viciously like poked at for
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:32.360]   for 15 minutes and 20 minutes he's been ignoring her and then she and then he finally hits back and
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:36.200]   then he gets punished for it so those I'd also be careful we've learned uh we mentioned this a
[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:41.000]   couple of times on security shows that some of these cameras don't have the best security in one
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:46.280]   case somebody bought a camera send it back uh because it didn't work and then he found he could
[01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:53.640]   see somebody else's house uh so that worked and then people have recommended this to me it's very
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:59:04.520]   cheap the yi the yee cams and um this is also an amazon prime deal 39.99 for these cameras and now
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:09.400]   you have you tried these yi cams these yee cams I have a couple of them they're a little bit more
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:15.560]   geeky to set up so um and then I would also worry a little bit about this security issue because
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:19.960]   these Chinese cameras I don't think really pay a lot of attention to yeah I think Nast is a big
[01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:24.440]   enough brand that I feel a little yeah it's from google for crying out loud right no but whatever
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:29.320]   one any of our information no well they keep it to themselves that's the good next act yeah yeah
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:34.600]   exactly so so I think that but I I found that these are the um ease of force because they're
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:38.600]   expensive to like 200 almost 200 bucks hundred well yeah and if you buy the three pack they're
[01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:43.320]   they turn out to be a little less like 160 or something but do you really believe these are
[01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:47.560]   the I mean we have them all over the place here of course but of all the ones I mean I
[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:51.240]   literally you can definitely find cheaper ones I definitely will agree if you're looking for
[01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:56.280]   something that's ease of use that is easy to put up it'll you'll get it set up in in 10 minutes
[01:59:56.280 --> 02:00:01.400]   you know these I've set up six of them from you know bottom at the store at a location where
[02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:05.400]   we forgot them or decided we want to add more and bought six of them and you know in a half an
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:09.960]   hour talking to someone having coffee I get them all attached to the Wi-Fi and inside my account
[02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:14.200]   and everything else so so they're they're pretty they're pretty easy to use they do
[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:22.280]   they do mess if you have an osmo just as in little note an osmo which is the dgi little handheld
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:28.840]   you know you run around with a little controller and you have your phone it turns out that the
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:34.120]   phone doesn't work doesn't can't connect to the osmo when you have a lot of nests so
[02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:39.240]   that's interesting it's a very obscure technical thing it's not a lot of bandwidth
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:45.240]   consumption right we found that that's the HD cameras like a megabit each so yeah yeah so
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:51.160]   bogged down a Wi-Fi network if you're paying per meg or per gig it can it can do that yeah it
[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:56.840]   can take up some some of that so you want to think about giving it its own uh its own network as best
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:01.800]   you can and it also you know what I'm doing for with it is a fairly expensive way to
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:06.760]   solve that problem on in the truck because it's three days of just streaming now we did turn the
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:11.240]   resolution down so it's not full resolution right if we really need something we'll turn it up but
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:19.400]   we hit we didn't leave it at HD quite a 1080p the whole time okay nest cam security camera three
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:29.080]   pack is 500 bucks the lunder 500 bucks so that's not quite as expensive your pick mr and a Richie
[02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:33.960]   so i'm bringing us full circle back to pokemon for a couple minutes i'm not picking pokemon but
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:38.680]   i am saying if you are using any app like pokemon yeah if you're playing ingress if you're playing
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:44.200]   anything outdoors there's tremendous health benefits to that getting us out walking get your sunscreen
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:49.000]   absolutely do all those things but also get a good step tracking app so on the iphone i really
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:54.760]   love pedometer plus plus it's uh underscore david smith's app he has a bunch of them sleep plus plus
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:59.160]   and others and he's very good about updating them and it's one of those things that just runs in
[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:04.520]   the background but keeps a tally of your steps and has a nice color coding so that you can
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:09.160]   sort of get a sense of your progress and while you're out there catching stuff this is a great
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:15.160]   way to sort of see how much exercise you're getting at the same time and if if you can benefit i mean
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:19.560]   one of the reasons i don't walk as much as i should is like i you know i kind of don't have that much
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:23.160]   stuff to do and i'm in a city i walk all the time but in the suburbs it's a little bit boring
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:26.840]   but now you know you walk over here and you catch those things and you walk over there and you do
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:31.400]   that and suddenly it's miles and miles and miles or sorry kilometers and kilometers and kilometers
[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:37.160]   and it's worth keeping track of so that's an app i really enjoy the larger sense is if you're
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:42.520]   doing anything a lot that keeps the screen on and uses the radios a lot or uses gps or uses lte or
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:48.200]   uses anything uh power is consumed by radiation so the screen being on consumes a lot of power
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:53.480]   gps being on consumes a lot of power lte being on consumes a lot of power i've been using backup
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:57.160]   batteries and i know everybody has their own favorites i've just stuck with mophie because
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:01.640]   they've always worked really well been super reliable for me and i use the power station duo
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:06.920]   because it's got two plugs in it so i can charge two devices if i have to it'll charge an ipad and
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:12.600]   it'll charge a lot and often and most of the time my friends just haven't brought anything with them
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:17.320]   and they'll start to wear out and this i can easily share i can plug my phone in i can plug
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:21.960]   someone else's phone in so i've been using the power station duo for a couple years uh usually
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:26.600]   when traveling but now i'm using it domestically because i am out there using all this battery and
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:32.600]   using all the screen and using all this uh gps and all this radio and it's draining things fast and
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:37.240]   especially being on the beta uh some people complain that the beta drains a lot of battery yes it's a
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:43.000]   beta it's re-indexing everything it's it's doing all the photo processing and it tries to do all
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:47.800]   that when you're plugged in but even just downloading it and syncing photos and doing all these things
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:52.360]   it's greater demand on your phone and with the beta it's not optimized the way it will be for the final
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:57.160]   release so if you're doing any of these things i can't recommend enough having either a good battery
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:02.520]   case or a good battery pack with you it can be it can be not a life-saving but phone-saving it's
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:10.200]   yeah yeah yeah yeah if you don't if you don't have one just big big burrito-sized phone charger i mean
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:13.800]   it's because it's not it's not just that it's like you are good if you it's one of those things you you
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:18.760]   buy it you have it inside your house and that at some point in the course of the next six months
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:23.080]   you're going to be glad that you have it either because there's a hurricane coming and you've got
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:27.480]   three days and now you at least have this little brick you can carry in your pocket that will give
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:33.800]   you five days of charge uh or the first time you realize that oh i've if i'm using my ipad as my
[02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:39.240]   notebook now i can basically spend the entire weekend not giving a damn who's sitting at Starbucks
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:44.520]   for five hours at the one table it's next to a power outlet it is it's something it's it's basic
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:49.320]   it's basic material at this point yeah and i had by the way just to extend that having a little one
[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:52.760]   is also great when you're at the airport and you just need something in your pocket with your phone
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:56.200]   so having like a little like a little extra one that just kind of sits there and if you're giving
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:59.800]   away things that that you want to spend a little bit more money and have people who actually walk
[02:04:59.800 --> 02:05:04.040]   by your booth or special clients or whatever little batteries are great with your logo sound
[02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:10.200]   of yeah sound about maybe one and i just was like i had it for until i just accidentally destroyed it
[02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:16.360]   but it was it was great until then i just want to quickly point out that the other great thing
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:20.120]   with but some people don't know about these is that the modern ones they have really really good
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:24.600]   power management chips in there too so you charge it you put it in your laptop bag you forget about
[02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:29.160]   it until your phone or your ipad is low and then you dig it out i think oh well it's probably dead
[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:33.880]   it's been in there for three weeks but no it's still at five bars so just put it charge it up put
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:39.160]   it in there it's it's like an mre for your phone uh one of the things i discovered i was in Winnipeg
[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:42.680]   a lot and it turned and i i didn't know why my battery was draining so much because i'm not
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:46.840]   roaming and it turns out that those buildings were all so old and so solid that the signal to barely
[02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:51.400]   get in and my radio was ramping up trying to grab even a bar or two and it just caused drain so
[02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:57.560]   i was reaching for that power battery over and over again i don't have a pick but i thanks to your
[02:05:57.560 --> 02:06:04.920]   suggestion rene and yours Alex i finally have updated to ios 10 on my ipad and i've got a swift
[02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:10.440]   playgrounds is it is it uh you know go either way um this is the very first thing and i you know i
[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:17.000]   have to say i'm really impressed with how they describe programming um and how they and how they
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:24.200]   do it um i think this is this is really going to be in fact it might even be the reason to get ios 10
[02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:28.920]   now if you want to learn to code or if you have kids who want to learn how to code let's enter
[02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:35.720]   some code we want to get hit what is he called a bite to move move to it collect that gym so
[02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:41.000]   they give you uh they give maybe if i'd have to do it this way to get the suggestions unavailable
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:46.920]   well they had some sessions wwdc with this and they are really as educationally focused as they
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:50.920]   are engineering so cool and i and i love this so now i'm going to run this code here let's do it
[02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:55.800]   here like this i'm going to run this code and see if i've actually got him to do the right thing
[02:06:55.800 --> 02:07:05.320]   and uh he's moving forward he's moving forward he's mo and he's collecting the jam and happy day
[02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:10.520]   i've written my first lines of swift code this is great this is adorable and you know my
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:13.640]   my daughter literally gets up and does that little dance when he does it
[02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:22.600]   a lot of fun and you can see what a different angles is really cool and it's just it's beautiful
[02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:26.520]   like this is educational material and it's beautifully designed it's captivating
[02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:32.600]   i mean they've got top talents oh my gosh i mean if they did a good job or what let's see
[02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:36.760]   this puzzle just is like the last one but now he needs to turn left he needs to go one two
[02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:42.760]   and then turn left whoa i shouldn't have tapped him i think i made him jump straight up in the air
[02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:51.720]   uh puzzle time all right there you go hey thanks guys this was a lot of fun and i
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:54.840]   apologize for the amount of time we spent on pokemon go but hey
[02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:59.960]   gotta catch him all you're welcome you're welcome if you like this gotta catch him all
[02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:07.880]   and we have a title no no nobody would download it that's Alex Lindsay he's at the pixel core
[02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:13.320]   follow him on twitter @AlexLindsay with an a lynds ay if you want to find out what he's up to
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:18.440]   lots of interesting stuff and he posts posts much of it on the on the twitter including
[02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:23.400]   workshops and things you can do with Alex and his team at pixel core thank you for being here Alex
[02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:28.120]   thank you Andy and i coz at the Chicago Sun Times where he scribble scribble scribbles all the time
[02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:31.880]   when he's not taking pictures of squirrels and making them look like more diglionis
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:38.360]   we your pictures are you putting them on your flicker flicker.com/andii
