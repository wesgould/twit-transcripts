[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.600]   Thanks to Jason and Andy and Alex for showing up even though I am really by
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.440]   tell a little bit congested from the Rona Lady Rona. Hello Jason Snell six
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.240]   colors.com. Hello. Still a unique one. I like your studio. First time I've seen
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.360]   your backdrop with all those antiquated Mac and is that a 2c to CI behind you?
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.880]   No let's see what do I have to see to see. I have an Apple 2c I have a Bondi
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.760]   iMac a G4 iMac studio display of the old kind of cube and of course the
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.280]   original Mac classic they're the one 20 if they run and that's why it's on
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.880]   is there it is. They all run but that one I booted today. But the lava lamp does
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.920]   not. The lava lamp is on a smart switch Leo and so I will I'll turn it on
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.600]   momentarily. But you know what's wrong with lava lamps they he that takes a
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.160]   while for them to start lavaing. It does I really am. You have to think ahead
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.640]   of a lot. You have to play ahead. I do. Which is your favorite of those six
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.800]   computers behind you. Oh geez I mean the G3 iMac sort of saved Apple so that
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.040]   would be high on my list. Bondi blue too. The original. You can't and I think the
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:19.600]   G4 is actually the the G4 iMac is I think the best designed the lamp. The
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.360]   Luxo. Beautiful beautiful piece of art. Yeah very nice. Something that in the
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.840]   discord says it's a snowball Mac. I guess it is. I always think of it as like a
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.280]   volleyball sawed in half is basically what it is Wilson Wilson or just will
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.360]   maybe not some. Andy and I go from WG BH a Boston Hello Andrew. Hello yeah I
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.800]   love your backdrop Jason it's also because you've got them set up and kind
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.840]   of a grid so it's almost like you got like a Mac Hollywood squares going. So
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.720]   it's like okay I'll take I'll take the Apple to see the block. Is the Apple to
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.800]   see the Paul lend of the yes. And it's not terrible just it's not terrible
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.960]   that you for a Mac people are taking taking apart to make desk lamps. Oh like
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.440]   oh please don't do that. It's inspired by a desk lamp you don't need to turn it
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.520]   into one. Also Alex Lindsey from I'm gonna start saying 090.media because the
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:25.400]   pedance the internet of pedance say I know I went to 090 and nothing's there. 090.media
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.880]   office hours. Global Hello Alex. Hey how's it going? It's okay. Yeah you know you
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.080]   you shamed me you said all because you got a couple of weeks ago so that was
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.480]   better three hours. It's been a few more hours. A few more hours for me but it
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.880]   wasn't too bad thanks to being a vaxxed and boosted. I didn't it was like a cold
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.160]   kind of but still you know I'm sealed just for people want to know I and you
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.760]   might look a little different. It kind of looks like the old days of Mac break
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.640]   weekly. You remember those right? Yeah. I'm sealed in my main and my little office
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.480]   here with a triple box of you guys behind me. You look good. We're like
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:19.760]   Neopolitan ice cream for tech. I have to apologize though because before the show
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.040]   I should have come in here and and completely cleaned the room and removed
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.520]   the Linux penguin in front of me the Altair 8800 in front of you guys I'm
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.960]   sorry I apologize. It's got the blinky lights I love that. It is it is you're
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.440]   kidding? You know what's doing? Blinky lights are amazing. I have the program
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:47.560]   that I run on it here. This is a game called turn on the kill bit and I think
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.960]   you're supposed to flip switches and stuff but I have the instructions by
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.400]   the way completely appropriately on a Newton message pad pad of paper turn on
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.960]   kill bit switch stop up reset up switch one up all others down aux one down
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.120]   left-docs and then it starts playing the game. It's lucky for you that's a Newton
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.960]   message pad piece of paper because it was an actual Newton message pad none of
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:19.000]   those words would have made sense. Farm. Zing take that old hardware. Oh let it go.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.640]   They did the very best. It was ahead of its time. It was. It was. It was. It was. By the way if people
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.680]   haven't been watching for all mankind on Apple TV Plus. Oh Jeffrey is set in the
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.200]   90s and they do all of their video chats and stuff on on Newton's because the idea
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.680]   there is that the technologies advance a little faster than our timeline and it
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.120]   is such a great Easter egg. It's all Newton message pads with little like
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.360]   video things on the top and they secretly it's like an iPhone inside but
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.000]   it's in terms of the world the Newton is the iPhone basically it's hilarious. It's
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.480]   so cool. It's so cool to see it and some somebody must have suggested you. Oh but
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.440]   you know it would be really accurate. We can have a palm trio in a cradle because
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.080]   it can actually do the. Wait wait wait wait wait. It's too early. It's just a little too early for it.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.560]   For security with everything in my desk and a box. I love they there's a
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.480]   on Twitter at least I saw an interview with one of the production designers and
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.160]   they did one of the things they had to do is figure out what would a Newton
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.080]   video conferencing module piece of hardware look like and it's kind of like
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.960]   a Connectix quick cam or something but in Newton black and it just kind of like
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.280]   lives on the top of the the Newton shell. I love something that that is
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.640]   somebody's job. I love it. It's amazing. No it it looked to me it looked almost
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.520]   exactly like the camera you could get for a for a Game Boy or a little bit like
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:40.520]   a yeah yeah. A few cartridge. Yeah. Yeah. It was amazing. It was lovely to see
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.160]   someone to start try to say what if frog design continued to make really
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.840]   cool handhelds because now I'm like yeah if someone made if someone made like
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:54.240]   an iPhone case that looked like frog design 1993 1994 that's $40 I would
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.800]   find some money for so this is a real camera though right so because they
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.760]   because they can do the or are they using the Apple camera. I don't know I
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.200]   mean depends on how they are or are they shooting a TV right so they might
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.320]   even be shooting it separately and compositing it on there. It does work
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.840]   though as you can see from this shot. Yeah it looks chunky. Yeah it looks chunky
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.320]   just like a Newton camera would look in a scenario like that. Yeah I love that
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.240]   it's that's just such a great piece of work. This is a picture on Apple and
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.760]   Sider shared by Ben McGinnis who's a producer and part of the team showing
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.800]   the most unlikely product placement on an Apple TV+ show you will ever ever see.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:39.840]   Yeah yeah well isn't it wild. Wow but you know what they did that for us. They
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.880]   did. They did. There's a lot of stuff like that. A lot of Easter eggs in there like
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.760]   that. They knew we would it's a new message pad 120 best use ever and
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.040]   correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't there a connector on the top there that you
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.400]   could slot things into. I mean that's that would have that would have been
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.480]   like a PC card slot yeah the top there. So yeah there would have been
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.720]   there would have been something that could plug they could slide something
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.320]   into it though those all those although that was mostly used for external
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.520]   storage you get a fax board for it so yeah.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.080]   I think I think though the argument would be that how could would Apple
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.920]   approve any other device but some sort of an Apple TV. Right it is Apple TV so
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.800]   they said you can't have an iPhone but you can have a new so yeah this is the
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.440]   message pad 120 and you you're nailed it exactly right there's a
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:33.200]   that's protected right by a release of some kind. There's a little ejector
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.280]   on the side of it. Yeah yeah good luck getting it working. Oh the lock it's
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.160]   locked now I can inject and this is the dummy card it came with.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.000]   Yeah it says keep this card in your communications assistant when you're not
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.760]   using another card. Copyright 1993 Apple Computer. Made in California
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:58.240]   designed by Weirdos. That's cool that's fun. That is not news but
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.240]   hey this is a light news week as it will be for some time.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.200]   Let's see what we can talk about I guess is that the quarterly results are
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.960]   coming out Jason you fired up your Excel spreadsheet you've got your finger
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.280]   poised over the colorized button. Charts charts charts charts charts yes
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.240]   to be for the record I use numbers because numbers make of course
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.920]   beautiful. I'm saying it. Did I say it's actually I am one of those weirdos who
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.560]   uses Excel numbers and Google sheets for different tasks
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.760]   but for charts I use numbers because the charts are pretty.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.880]   Yeah numbers charting engine is really nice. What do you use Excel for?
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.320]   I use I use sheets and and number and keynote numbers but I don't
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.600]   I just I find the export to somebody. Pivot tables baby pivot tables.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.120]   You know I'm not an Excel expert but I learned on Excel and there's so many
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.320]   things that I'm very comfortable doing in Excel and then I get into numbers
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.120]   where they've got the kind of arbitrary like if you're on a canvas and they're
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.480]   going to be spreadsheets on the canvas and I'm like look all I want to do
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.680]   is some really quick logic here in a spreadsheet and that's what I use
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.720]   Excel for and then just to answer the question Google sheets
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.680]   is mostly for collaboration when I know I've got a bunch of people involved
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.920]   that's like like for example Mac break weekly where we have a
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.200]   we work in sheets. That's right. Yeah that's our running system.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.760]   What do you guys use? Go ahead Dan. What do you
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.960]   are you still using AppleScript to automate it or even moved on to the
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.040]   modern alternatives? I actually have both so when I do my
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.480]   charts they do I post them on the web like super fast I put in the numbers and
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.400]   then they're up on six colors dot com real fast. That is an Apple script
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.000]   still on the Mac. I have a shortcut that actually runs on iOS that does the
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   same thing so at some point I'll probably switch. I think
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.360]   I'll have to see in the next version of Mac OS because they're supposed to be
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.280]   speeding up shortcuts if the shortcuts will be faster than AppleScript but
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.640]   either way basically it takes a PDF and sections it up into little pieces and
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.680]   uploads it to my website. For extra credit I want you to write a Python script
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.000]   that scrapes the Apple website for the numbers. Oh man. So then there's no entry
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.400]   at all you just push a button it goes. Yeah it's a challenge because that stuff
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.640]   comes out in a PDF so you got to. There's no API is there. Yeah right right but
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.160]   I would love to do that. It's not exactly structured data but still yeah
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.520]   wouldn't that be cool. The Thursday will be the quarterly results.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:21.280]   Of course this is not a great quarter in general although there are new Apple
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.760]   computers to talk about right and did the MacBook Air get into the
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.120]   No just the 13 inch pre-win this quarter and they did remember this is the one
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.200]   that three months ago they waved the sort of the warning flag and said we're
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.160]   going to do two supply chain issues and a lack of being able to fulfill
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.760]   demand we're going to fall I think they said four to eight billion dollars
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.920]   short of what we could have sold in a quarter which is that is a real
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.680]   powerful warning sign that they're going to have a rough quarter plus it's a
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:56.160]   tough what they like to say is a tough compare. A little jargon there and the
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.400]   idea is that last last year they had some good product
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.960]   releases during this quarter and this year they didn't really so you know it's
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:08.160]   going to be I mean it's going to be rough for Apple which is not to say it's
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.440]   necessarily going to be rough they're still going to make a lot of money but
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.600]   they have waved that warning flag that this is going to be a little bit you
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.560]   know because they can't make them fast enough basically to sell them it's not
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.320]   a bad problem to have unless the people who would have given you five billion
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.360]   dollars walk across the street and buy something else instead.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.720]   This from Mark Bloomberg Mark Bloomberg. Mark Gurman in his Bloomberg column a
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.760]   couple of days ago analysts predict revenue will climb by two percent but
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.720]   that's you know not very fast compared with the 36% jump they saw in the third
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.800]   quarter of a year ago revenue expected and by the way
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.040]   Apple does they do they still sandbag the analysts by downplaying and then
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.960]   excluding. No there was a time I get the feeling I get the
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.320]   distinction somebody who sits on those calls every time and does the charts I
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.680]   get the distinct feeling that somebody at a government agency came to
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:07.920]   Apple and said your forecasts are yes yeah don't do that anymore and they
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.000]   did some like rejiggering and since then their forecasts have actually been
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.200]   pretty close they're not obviously they're not exact but they've been pretty
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.800]   close however what happened with covid is that the moment covid hit they said
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.760]   oh the world is in a turmoil we can never predict and they stopped giving
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.840]   guidance altogether. Yeah all of this because the SEC and
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.880]   the you know the government and other agencies want
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.880]   investors to have accurate information and Apple you know can't
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.560]   mislead investors they're putting their money in. Revenue expected to come in
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:42.080]   around 82.7 billion iPhone around a little under half that according to
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.400]   german and the analysts services now up to 20 billion
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:51.360]   again we'll find out what the facts are on Thursday but this is what the company
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:56.000]   warned as you said four to eight billion dollars because of supply chain issues
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.680]   and Chinese lockdowns third quarter had last quarter that is or third
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:07.120]   sorry third quarter of last year had a lot of pandemic induced spending
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.440]   which kind of boosted mac and ipad sales don't expect that this time
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.560]   around. Many customers held off buying the macbook
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.320]   air while they waited for the new model which as you said does not show up in
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.400]   this quarters results and then of course there's a bad economy
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.960]   with the middle of a recession but ain't on blah blah blah so
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.440]   and in the bottom line is they're gonna they're gonna do well
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.520]   kind of fair better than than most uh you know in any kind of
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.400]   downturn uh i think they're probably gonna
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.400]   fare pretty well but they uh but it might be a little slower than normal.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.880]   Yeah but it's i don't even know if they'll go into a loss i think they'll just
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.920]   be growing slower exactly. Third quarter has never been
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.320]   a big quarter anyway so yeah right. This may even be
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.640]   it's it's possible this will still be apple's best fiscal third quarter ever
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.920]   wouldn't that be hysterical? Even with all of this yeah and that's what i mean
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.200]   when i say you know rough for apple is not really
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.720]   rough. No uh german has a bunch of new products he says
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.720]   i still think apple will be able to bounce back fairly quickly
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.240]   uh for one thing it has a flood of products on the way to attempt even
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:21.200]   recession where he shoppers four iphone 14 models a new apple watch se at apple
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.320]   series eight and we'll talk a little more about this high-end
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.880]   pro apple watch that's been rumored updated home pod new apple tv oh
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.080]   i need a new apple tv they seem to fail pretty
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:38.880]   quickly updated ipad pro models with m2 a low-end ipad with usb c finally
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:44.320]   a revamped mac pro that's gonna be this year right but it might be december 31st
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.240]   long anticipated mixed reality headset what do you guys think is that gonna be
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.480]   this year? uh not this year i'd be surprised next
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:58.080]   year next year uh larger 15-inch macbook air new m2 and m2 pro mac
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.040]   minis that i think is reasonable for this year
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.720]   upgraded air parts pro yeah they do have until the end of this year if
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.200]   they're gonna keep their promise to at least announce a pro a mac pro yeah
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.840]   because they said last year that by the end of this year they would have
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.640]   refreshed the entire line for our solica so that's the only person who
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.720]   remained a drop so uh let's talk about this pro watch
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:24.800]   that there's been a lot of rumor about uh and and the german is kind of doubling
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:30.960]   down on in this uh in this newsletter um a high-end pro watch with a larger
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.240]   display longer battery life perhaps multiple days on one charge he says
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.600]   via the new low power mode which no one will want to run
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:46.240]   a body temperature sensor okay well fine um the high-end model a good bit bigger
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.480]   he says i'm told now so this is not speculation on his part this is from
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:55.200]   his sources good bit bigger big enough that it might only appear to a subset
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.840]   of customers hulk Hogan in the like i guess
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.240]   seven percent larger that's a little bigger uh it's a saltine on your wrist
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.680]   a saltine on your wrist the device will have a fresh look
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.320]   a fresh look first update in the design since uh they watch
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:17.520]   uh came out in 2018 yeah it would be very very interesting if
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.040]   they decided to take the apple watch in the same direction as they have with
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.480]   the iphone where they're going to have a a pro or a
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.880]   top top top model that will have all of the new hardware and the new features
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.800]   first and then in a year or so those features will
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.000]   become table stakes for all of the other models that go underneath it
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.640]   uh we haven't seen that yet in the uh in in the apple watch but
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.800]   if they were to say if if i'm intrigued by what they could do if they simply
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.480]   said look here are here is what we if internally they said what here's what
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.120]   we could do if we made the watch a little bit bigger
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.840]   here are a couple sensors that the only reason why we can't put them on the
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.680]   watch is because we can't fit them in their current configuration right now
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.640]   if we were to make a larger watch that would
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.520]   definitely be require a lot of uh it would definitely be a statement piece
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.560]   more so than the uh than the current watches we have but we could still
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   but now we can get the temperature sensor in there
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.200]   now we can get a limited blood pressure reader inside there and we could have
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.840]   a a battery that would last two or three days
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.440]   and we would start comparing with the lifespan of fitness watches
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.040]   that would be interesting although it would be a shift wouldn't it
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.560]   there are some people i'm sorry to say i'm one of them
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.160]   who'll buy a high end anything from that one that's i can afford it
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.080]   so this will have a titanium so it's more rugged yeah
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.720]   a lot of them a lot of them a lot of folks say well it'll be a limited number
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.800]   of people and generally apple we use just to prove
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.240]   that the limited number it's the higher end of this of the higher end of that
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.800]   is usually the hardest one to get we're like oh what do we how do we turn this
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.680]   to eleven so yeah you'll buy it again for
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.520]   again for apple i i think it's funny mark uh german when he did this
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.760]   report initially he was a little more vague about it he was like uh
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.960]   they're gonna do a sports version and yeah i think a lot of us were thinking
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.120]   well what does a sports watch look like and it's probably just a
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.320]   ruggedized apple watch but he did this little pivot where he got more
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.120]   information a month or two ago where he started talking about it more as a
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.920]   pro watch and if you think about it that actually like
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.280]   Andy said it kind of makes sense that it goes with the pro max kind of
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.360]   philosophy which is well what if we did a bigger watch so instead of two sizes
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.640]   there'll be three sizes we can get more battery in there if we do that
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.280]   and then you talked about nobody's going to want to use the low power
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.040]   mode but i have a friend who went out hiking and he wanted you know
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.760]   one of the use cases for these sports watches is
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.040]   um to take them out if you're going like on the Appalachian Trail or something
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.000]   you're going out from or camping and you want to
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.400]   you're not going to be able to recharge it every day right
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.520]   and the idea that you could that one of the selling points of this might be
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.480]   also a new mode inside watchOS that lets you put it in this lower power
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.000]   mode where it'll last combined with its battery for many days
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.280]   and you can still do some fitness logging and it cranks down the
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.120]   how often it does sensor monitoring of you
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.640]   but it's still available for emergency calling if you really need it like
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.800]   i can when you think about it that way which is they might sell it with some
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.560]   adventure sport kind of features and say that it's got a new titanium
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.160]   formulation that's rugged but when you're what you're really thinking about is
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.240]   it's kind of just a new high-end apple watch with some new features
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.160]   i don't know that rings more true to me than we're going to just take a
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.680]   new apple watch and do a rubber version that you can
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.600]   you know kick into the stream and retrieve it and the rock won't have
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.160]   cracked it like that is that's a lot less compelling than
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.720]   oh no we have a new fancy expensive apple watch that is also rugged and if you
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.400]   look at the sports watch category i i came into it thinking because i've
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.920]   never had a sports watch of any kind that it was like you know
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.320]   in the three hundred dollar range and the answer is there sports watches of
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.040]   thousands of dollars it actually does kind of make sense if apple were to do
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.320]   a thousand dollar ruggedized big apple watch
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:55.520]   but they wouldn't want to just sell it to extreme extreme sports enthusiasts
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.960]   right is that a category they'll sell it to anyone who wants the biggest
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.720]   latest greatest apple watch it shouldn't just be for people hiking the
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.160]   Appalachian Trail what if i just i might want to sleep in a few extra days
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.120]   and you know yeah exactly oh it's part of the narrative they're like one of
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.080]   their stories like i can picture the video now of somebody out on the
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.520]   Appalachian Trail who's had their apple watch their new apple watch pro on for
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.320]   five days and it still has battery but you're right i think that that's a
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.520]   attack by julis let's yeah that's a nice that's right
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.360]   battery life and use your voice dictation to detail all of the
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.960]   attacks yeah i can see that but for most people it'll just be hey it's a bigger
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.720]   nicer apple watch with bigger battery i think you know lying in a ditch
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.760]   day three the watch is still going strong but i'm getting angry i'm not
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.640]   closing my rings down here it's the it's the it's the concept of uh you
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.240]   know um we were looking at some jeeps and we were driving around it was the
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.640]   the jeep thing down in quarter madera and they were like
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.600]   i was like so how many people come back with like muddy jeeps they're like
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:56.560]   how many yeah nobody buys a jeep to go off road or you
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.640]   kidding me $55 000 on rubicon or something like that you always cracks me up when
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.160]   you see these guys driving around traveling with a snorkel like yeah well i
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.040]   might be in five feet of water mate you never know
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.680]   it's not gonna happen dude you're in marine county come on by the same
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:17.200]   by the same token uh i rarely see people who have their iPhones without it in
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.720]   some sort of a protective case and that's true they have they have a screen
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.880]   protector on top of it because it's fragile so yeah it's fragile and to
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.120]   and to be fair to my own point it's it is oftentimes a fashion thing where they
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.480]   want to distinguish theirs from others but people acknowledge that there could be
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.440]   more protection they're willing to give up some bulk for more protection
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.360]   so i do i have always liked the idea of having sort of a g-shock version
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.440]   of the apple watch because these things they do break and they do get scuffed
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:47.680]   and scratched up and i've got a i've got a g-shock watch from casio i've had for
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.560]   ten years that if you need to it needs a new battery every
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.920]   couple years but i'll i swim with i swim in the ocean with it
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.840]   salt water without any thought whatsoever about whether it's going to
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.040]   survive or not whereas if it were an apple watch
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.000]   yes it has yes it is it does have a swimming uh
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.960]   swimming uh the health sensor but health the app mode but i'm not sure that i
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.240]   would trust it in salt water and i've seen people complain that hey my my
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.600]   watch died after an ocean swim and what's
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.880]   and the last thing it did was tell me exactly how well how well i closed my
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.080]   rings on my last swim before telling me oh by the way i'm just i you just
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.440]   kill me with the salt water so it's it would be very interesting if they were
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.840]   to do that i think there are people who would buy it
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.720]   see i i have a g-shock app i have a watch it's
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.160]   pretty called like a 30 dollar it's 30 dollar case it's called a case it was
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.440]   yeah it's case i in mind i swim in mind all the time
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.560]   in my pool i don't have to worry about swimming in the ocean because we live
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.280]   in northern california that that would be absurd
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.200]   um so the uh the um but i but i do think that you know
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.280]   some of these rough ones i i know that i've taken you know this phone is loaded
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.840]   cost me two thousand dollars when they'll dust settled
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.000]   and i've dropped it solid three or four times and i'm really glad it has a
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.040]   case on it you know so like it makes me very happy i
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.720]   i see it fall on asphalt and i go oh just pick it up and it's just gonna be just
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.920]   point well also it is a it is a watch and there are people who
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.720]   kind of would they would be very very interested in
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.120]   a visual sign that they can afford the nine hundred or a thousand dollar watch
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.320]   they're not using they're not using the same watch that's
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.680]   people might have bought three years ago for two for two forty nine
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.600]   it's it's if there's a if there's an ego money sort of thing going on with
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.000]   watches as uh as an as a fashion accessory and i i would put to you that
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.680]   there is uh the the there would be a disadvantage to the
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:43.040]   fact that i can spend uh the minimum dollar two hundred bucks for
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.160]   the cheapest apple watch and it actually looks physically
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.080]   identical to the latest and greatest and you still would have to look very very
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.880]   closely to see that uh that it's not aluminum that it's
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.240]   actually like the the top of the line casing so that that would be another
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.120]   factor that if you if you had the larger watch or something with
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.040]   extra detailing that made it more rugged yes part of the feature would be that
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.280]   it would make it more rugged but another feature would
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.560]   be to show the world that yes you can afford the nine hundred dollar one
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.440]   the the the big downside of making it larger though
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:16.880]   would be it's already it's um a phone is something you can stick in any
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.720]   pocket whether you're um uh what no matter uh
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.360]   no matter what gender clothing you wear on a wrist now it becomes a really
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.920]   gendered thing because i've been i've got i've got beefy workman like
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.720]   wrists from from eastern europe slash russia i can wear a large watches and
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.680]   it doesn't look silly but if i were to if i were to wear a
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.440]   watch that was like that was like this big on my wrist
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.040]   that would be a statement piece to be sure so what do you do with people who
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.800]   have a very very slender wrist and you now have this watch that is the premium
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.360]   watch has maybe has extra features maybe has extra
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.400]   cache but it looks ridiculous on anybody but
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.760]   someone who has big big thick wrists that's another thing that they have to be
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.960]   thinking about i think although let's not be sexist because i know uh plenty of
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:06.960]   women like chunky big old watches um so i don't think you have to be an eastern
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.000]   european man with hairy wrists to wear well
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   but yeah but nonetheless proportion is important in fashion
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.960]   oh please no it is really come on you don't you don't see women walking
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:26.000]   around with gigantic bangles or watches or i mean i i don't i think that that's
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.160]   a personal thing not a no i'm i'm i'm i'm not saying
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.960]   i'm not so many people don't want to have too big a watch on
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.600]   men included but uh i think that sometimes big is is fashionable as well
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.400]   anyway who cares it's not about fashion it's about
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.800]   knowing what your heart rate is which is the by the way the lamest
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:50.640]   extra feature you could possibly add um it's what what your heart your heart
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.120]   rate oh temperature i mean temperature yeah
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:59.680]   temperature i i don't agree with that i i think that the idea there and we don't
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.560]   know how they're going to implement it i have my suspicions that
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.720]   and actually mark german i think in this report says
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.360]   it's not going to tell you the temperature it's just going to alert you if
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.920]   you're running warm yeah that's what the that's what the
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.440]   aura does yeah i'll tell you your base it doesn't
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.240]   tell you what your baseline is but i'll say or your plus point one you're down
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.120]   point one and that kind of because part of that is that it's measuring
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.920]   your skin temperature which is not your internal temperature so they they would
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.200]   have to fake it and can you imagine temperature gait if they faked it
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.240]   right so they're not going to do that but i think that there is probably value
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.920]   isn't enough to buy a new watch no but to throw in this idea that the apple
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.960]   watch is going to watch your body temperature and if you're essentially
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.040]   running hot for a little while it may say are you running a fever basically
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.760]   like you might want to you might want to look into this i think there might be
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.040]   some value in that i don't think that's ridiculous but again is that it's just
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.400]   one cumulative feature on top of all the others it's not the must have
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:52.000]   feature there's a there's a readiness value too i know uh for some athletes
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.720]   that has to do with their red you know their overall readiness i just think
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.680]   there's value in if you've got a sensor strapped to you all the time
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.560]   you're not temping all the time right probably unless you're trying to get
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.960]   pregnant or something you're basically not temping all the time
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.040]   and so to have your have that sensor say whether it's like your heart's doing
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.560]   something weird or or you seem like you have a
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.840]   fever or maybe even like your your body temperature is really low you may have
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.960]   something going on with your circulation like i can see there being value in
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.920]   that because it's it's passive not active yeah
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:25.040]   actually that is why i wear the aura ring um i was wearing it during covid to
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.640]   watch for temperature changes i stopped wearing it because it's
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.800]   hideously inaccurate with regard to activity it's not even close and i'm
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.240]   wearing an apple watch uh but i've you notice i've strapped the
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.760]   or a ring back on because uh now that i'm infected with covid i do want to kind
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:44.480]   of monitor my uh temperature up and down so you know there is some i agree with
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.280]   you obviously i'm wearing this silly i mean there's
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.880]   right there's the the way i think apple watch sensor marketing is the most
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.400]   fascinating thing because it's highly regulated right it's like how apple
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.240]   now has these features like the blood oxygen where it's like look look look
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:03.840]   we're not saying this is your actual blood oxygen don't use it for anything
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.680]   but you can look at it but don't use it for anything it's just for fun
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.760]   and and we use it to manufacture this weird number that is not a number that
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.280]   really you're blood oxygen yeah and this is gonna i feel like it's
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.840]   fascinating because apple really wants to stick this stuff in there but they
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.880]   have to walk that line between how do we market it
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.080]   and what will be fda let us claim about it and you get in this weird scenario
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.160]   where you end up with these super narrow it's like you can take an ecg
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.320]   but it doesn't tell you anything a lot of doctors yeah a lot of doctors will
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:38.800]   say i'm not going to trust any of those metrics if you want to blood oxygen
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.320]   monitor they're cheap buy one put on your thumb if you if you want to test your
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.080]   temperature taken there's a thing called a thermometer and that's why i think the
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.040]   best place for them to steer the apple watch is
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.800]   unlike all those things you just said leo the apple watch is able to monitor
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:57.280]   you at all time so the the advantage is really to look for trends and warn you
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.200]   and have you then go somewhere else as long as you don't oversell the capability
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.680]   i think apple is very careful about that and
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.120]   and again the i think that the big thing is especially with an optimized data on
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.960]   some of these studies i mean i think that the opportunity to learn things about
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.920]   there are trends that we see three months six months in advance that lead to
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.640]   something down the road and it doesn't matter if whether it's
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.840]   precisely the right number what it matters is reference to
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.200]   itself just seeing this this change
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.400]   um means something you know and and we don't even know what those things mean
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.560]   because we've never had a sensor on someone's
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.320]   on a tens of millions of people's risks at one time
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.000]   to gather that data and so i mean i think it's just invaluable to have
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.120]   as much data as we can get there as long as it's protected and you know like
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:43.040]   the blood oxygen thing again is silly in the sense of putting a thing on your
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.640]   finger and saying you know do i have covid is it 99 or 92 or whatever
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:50.320]   that's dangerous one of the ways they use it is they're using it to
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.080]   figure out you're with this weird metric figure out your
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.160]   aerobic fitness level right and that's what they're focusing on
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.360]   this is coming last year and there is a chart that shows like you
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.120]   started running and your lung capacity improved and that's based on that
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.800]   like long term over of course of like a year looking at the heart rate
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.240]   looking at how it recovers looking at the oxygen rate and how it recovers
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.160]   that's great right but that's what it's for
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.680]   yeah because mine says i'm below average i've been below average for a long
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:24.000]   time i don't want to what's your my mind says 25.2 VO2 max what's yours
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.400]   do you know off the top of your head although i i fell in bruise my ribs
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.840]   five weeks ago so i haven't run in five weeks so it's it's i don't want to look
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.000]   at it because it's going to say you know you know you're in bed but i think
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.520]   this is risky though then i understand athletes especially elite
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:41.840]   athletes they there's a readiness scale that the
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.760]   the ora ring and other athletic instruments use there's this heart rate
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.400]   variability there's some valuable stuff but i
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:53.520]   also think it's risky about getting to uh to call even call it's like
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:58.640]   elan musk calling it autopilot calling it VO2 max let me tell you a risky
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.200]   if elan musk was regulated by the fda it wouldn't be autopilot that wouldn't be
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.800]   called autopilot the fda is way more serious it turns out
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.760]   than the whoever's in charge of cars right like it's
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.120]   that's the case they they have actual power to shut things down yeah
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.720]   but the it's but that's but what Jason's talking about really is part of the
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:21.680]   secret sauce that apple has to really hold on to because
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.040]   the the world the the marketplace has changed a lot
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:30.240]   since the apple watch achieved its dominance now you can get just a basic
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.520]   fitness watch that has all of this all of the most important sensors that apple
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:40.240]   used to used to tout his breakthroughs so if you want something that has
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:47.440]   oxygen-sensing ecg heart rate max min all the gps making phone calls
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.160]   making making payments through through the watch
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.200]   you don't even have to get if you don't even have to make the the
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.520]   incredibly dangerous motion of getting an android wear device
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.760]   uh... which is still not just a good and goodness gracious it's it's a ghost of
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.280]   a watch but uh... you can you can buy a fitness watch from garmon you can buy
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.320]   a fitness watch from fitbit for less than two hundred dollars that will give you
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.040]   those basic things on a lit on a nifty color screen
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.880]   that and like and just like the apple watch you won't be able to change the
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:18.880]   uh... the the clock face beyond a couple of a very very simple tweak so
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.960]   there's no big difference there too
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.480]   so i think what apple has to do is until they can figure out how to put a
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.000]   sensor in there that nobody else has until they can find some sort of a
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.800]   breakthrough application that hasn't existed before that's
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.120]   difficult to replicate what they can do is simply say here's a packet we've
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.160]   we've looked at this package of data we're collecting for you
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.720]   and we're going to give you the the happy face
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:44.560]   uh... blob or we're giving you the skeptical face blob and if it's the
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.560]   skeptical face blob maybe cut down in the salt today and maybe take an extra
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.160]   walk uh... when it's actually giving you the sum total of a lot of different
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.360]   sensory readings that are telling you just as jason said you're
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.320]   we're we can't we can't give you the the numbers that you probably couldn't
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.440]   understand anyway but we're telling you that whatever you're doing you're doing
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.560]   good keep it up
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.200]   well and and again i mean the biggest thing is is that because you have
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.200]   sensors all the time it's like that when you
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.560]   trying to lose weight you you know you can weigh yourself every day but that's
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.280]   not very accurate you know there's so many things that are going on you have
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.600]   to weigh it you know you have to look at it week to week to week to look at
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.960]   those those trends to see whether you're going the right direction or not and i
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.320]   think in the same case
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.440]   i think one of the big advantages that apple has again is like those other
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.560]   watches is that except that it's also tied into your apple ecosystem you open up
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.240]   apple exercise and it all pops up by the way i was showing my wife the
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.440]   the apple fitness thing and they just keep adding
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.040]   videos there's so many videos like every section
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.360]   she's like does it have pilates yeah it has 270 you know videos of pilates and
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.400]   it does the same thing with yoga same thing with strength training
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.160]   and they're shot so well you know as a production person it
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.760]   makes me want to use them yeah so i've been i've been using like little five
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.960]   minute ten minute ones and they they've been uh they're really good and
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.080]   again they're all tied into the whole thing and they track it and
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:02.080]   there's definitely other things that do that just not many things that do it
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.760]   as integrated and that's always apples advantage is that you have a single
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:10.320]   experience that's just kind of all part of the package
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.840]   all right let's speaking of health take a break come back with a more mac break
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.920]   weekly is on the air with jason snell and a nato
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.960]   mr. Alex lindsey i can now go left to right
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.560]   because they're all in my little screen behind me i showed today brought to you
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.680]   by couldn't be better timing for this zachtok
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.800]   zachtok before you book any brunch what do you do you pour over the lists and
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.280]   lists of reviews right but why is it that you do less
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:41.120]   due diligence when you're booked in a doctor a physician somebody for your
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.800]   health with zachtok you could see real verified patient reviews

[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.880]   i mean isn't fine in the right doctor a little bit more important than finding
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.280]   the right eggs Benedict well maybe not actually i don't know
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.160]   expand it's pretty important but i think for your health
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:08.160]   yo yourself zachtok and you know it's great it's a free app
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:12.160]   cost you nothing shows you doctors who are patient reviewed

[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:47.200]   find and book doctors with a few taps you could find and review local doctors

[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.640]   they verify that and now when you walk into that doctor's office you're all

[00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:00.320]   the entire story that i had prepared for this week
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:04.960]   it's the summer we're nothing i always refer to this as like the cruise
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:10.080]   they introduced the betas at WWDC and then we just got the long slow
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.840]   cruise to september when the iPhones come out we got the new macbook air but
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:17.440]   that was two weeks ago that's old that has anybody did you
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.240]   anybody got the macbook here did you get that Jason
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.520]   yeah i got i mean i got probably talked about last week right so i thought we
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.480]   did talk about it love it it's uh it's real nice um
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.000]   it's really nice i've always been a macbook air user since the first one so
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.200]   really happy to have it and nice to have magsafe back i honestly like it's such
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.320]   a little i know people are like oh well it's just magnets whatever it's like
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:44.640]   well first off it means that my two ports are ports exactly exactly i actually
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.520]   bought one of those little magnet things you stick in one of the ports to get your
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.440]   fake magsafe and i bought many a doc with an additional power port so you can
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.800]   have it right you know i mean that yes this is that's the obvious reason for
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.880]   magsafe so that's yeah i i mean why they got rid of it at all i just uh like
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.600]   let's not realliterate what what happened you know in the late 2010s for apple
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:08.160]   out tops but what a disaster is it so here's i fix this tear down which
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:12.560]   came out uh i guess exactly a week ago i don't even know if you got to talk about
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:17.120]   it as we were speaking about it yeah um i'll give you the lead
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.080]   this summer's m2 macbook air is looking like a
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:26.320]   dana summer as in hot hot hot wow you know the thermal the whole thermal
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.920]   thing is so overblown it's ridiculous it's passive
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.960]   these are we knew it would be so was last years
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:37.760]   it exactly right this it can run faster which means it runs hotter apple put up
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.640]   that chart that showed that it runs faster and hotter
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:45.760]   at the highest end the truth is nobody is using a macbook air to the point
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.440]   where they're going to kill it like this and if you do it'll throttle eventually
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.200]   it's the wrong laptop for you the net result it's probably the wrong laptop
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.680]   for you and what happens when it throttles well guess what it just runs a little
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:00.480]   slower it will cools off big deal and this the net is still faster than an m1
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.400]   um i it does get warm if you really push it you've got to really work hard to
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.000]   push it but if you do you will feel some warm thunder there's no doubt about it
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.560]   it's not gonna burn your legs or anything but that's the point here is that apple
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.560]   apple wants the macbook here to be a fanless laptop and and that's what it is
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:20.480]   and if that's not what you want like if you want more performance you could get
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:24.160]   you could get the m2 macbook pro and it's got a fan but honestly it's not that
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.120]   great either you really should probably get
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.080]   one of those really nice 14 or 16 inch macbook well
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:36.880]   good m1 m1 m1 pro m1 max they're way faster than m2 should you wait for the m2
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:41.600]   uh macbook pros i wouldn't if you're if you're want a laptop right now
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.800]   those macbook pros are great they're the 14 and the 16 they're fantastic i have
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:49.920]   the 14 love it beautiful fine the screens better it's got more ports it's right
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.800]   it's got more you doesn't have 24 gigs of ram
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:57.520]   it's got it's got so much going for well you can have the on the m2 or m1 max and
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.800]   pro you can have way more ram did i get 32 to be added around over
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.400]   yeah sorry yeah there's so many reasons for that one so this is the
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:10.560]   48 gigs doesn't have 48 gigs of ram i forgot it's definitely not it's doubled
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:14.640]   uh somebody said there's a lot more air in the macbook air than we expected is
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:19.360]   it not a tight fit i mean looks like looks pretty tight to me
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.600]   looks like they're not doing like the terraced
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.720]   batteries of old but you know here's the good news from iFixit is they say
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:31.280]   apple will be they say they tell us sending us parts
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:35.440]   so that's very good news apple is going to stand by it's a right to repair
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.560]   and send parts to iFixit so that's very
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.920]   uh very good i think if you if you want a macbook hair this is a beautiful one
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:45.520]   did mica get his did he get his pretty mention did he get his midnight blue
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.400]   yet mica did you get yours is the midnight blue uh
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:55.120]   what color is it really um i i have i don't have one here but i saw it in
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.240]   kupertino it is oh they say you lack they say you
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.840]   it is they said me it started i got no i got stuck at starlight
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:06.080]   uh but but the mid-night one it it looks black in most
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.840]   circumstances but if there's a bright light reflecting off of it into your
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.720]   eyes you say it looks like a blue oh it's actually blue
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.000]   it's just what i want it's super dark that's exactly what i want
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.680]   it looks like it's black until it doesn't and then there's a surprise
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:25.280]   who it's blue perfect perfect so mica did get his i'll have to get him to
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:29.920]   bring it in once i'm uh testing negative and then i can run my hands all over
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.760]   watching the discourse this last week uh about the macbook hair there was a
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.840]   quin nelson who does youtube videos snazzy labs uh did a video about it that i
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.280]   thought was really good but i thought his criticism of apple was fascinating
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.560]   because unlike so much of the criticism we see about things like oh god it
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:50.960]   throttles oh no it's the end of the world um quince criticism was that apple
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:55.040]   by following the design of the 14 and 16 inch macbook pro with this air which
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.640]   they've said in an interview with gq that we talked about last week that that
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:02.000]   was the idea they're all of a family they aren't
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.200]   doing what sort of like the original premise of the air was which is try to
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.640]   make it as small as possible and he brought up the 12 inch macbook
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.680]   and basically said look this thing is so much smaller than the
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.440]   than the new 13 inch macbook air there's more room here and i know there are
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.000]   some rumors that apple actually is working on
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.720]   a 12 inch laptop that would be more like that but i like quince video mostly
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.920]   because i think he's right in fact one of the things i thought when i opened
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.680]   it the first time is there's a lot of room on either side of that that
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.960]   keyboard you can just cut it right off make this a much smaller laptop
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:38.880]   and i i agree they the 13 inch m2 air is really nice but it is not
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:43.200]   apple making the smallest laptop they could it's not i think i think because
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.000]   of the screen i think because most people
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.240]   would rather have that nice 13 inch screen yes and that's the gating factor
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.600]   yes yeah but you know what know it else has a really really awesome screen the
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:58.480]   12.9 inch uh i uh ipad pro and one of the most
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:02.080]   desire the ipad my 12.9 inch ipad pro with the m1
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:06.320]   and and the magic key magic keyboard is one of the most desirable computers
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.280]   that i've ever owned but it's roughly the same size as the
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:13.040]   air isn't it roughly well it's it's it's thinner it's flatter of course it's
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:17.200]   square and of course the keyboard is a pro removable flat
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:22.960]   for exactly yeah but but you know what if apple were to create a true
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:26.800]   like macbook air which is no we we are going to try to make this
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:32.720]   make a macintosh as thin as light as as as trivial to throw in a bag as
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.920]   possible we want to kind of like make people
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.400]   you know do a double take at this that would be a hell of a form factor to
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:44.800]   to make it in and and they i'm not i'm not suggesting this will
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.960]   break their uh break their promise to themselves to never ever ever do a
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:52.800]   touch pad do a touchscreen based mac but it would
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.720]   still be having something that thin that light that that would justify
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:00.800]   only having the two ports on the side of it one for power one for data
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:05.360]   that would justify having a micro thin sort of keyboard make it really
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.600]   the make it make it make it so that every single windows tablet
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:15.440]   just looks like a big old shunker cat in comparison to it make everybody
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:20.320]   who plops this on to a desk onto a desktop just own that conference room
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.720]   table is having the most advanced interesting uh and and focus
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.160]   attentioned uh mac on the on the on the planet
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.200]   i mean even if you even if you want to even go a little bit smaller make it a
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:35.120]   10.9 inch so that now you're not even necessarily limited to
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:39.440]   a standard laptop bag to carry it in that now a lot of just little side bags
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.720]   would fit it i would love to see apple really
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:48.080]   prosecute the concept of the macbook air which is at the very beginning we
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.320]   forget the first generations of these things
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:54.640]   the the deal was look we're not saying this is going to be the most
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.120]   the the most convenient mac to use ever we are this is for people this is not
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:03.360]   to replace the entire macbook line this is for people who specifically are
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:07.840]   willing to trade off performance ports a whole bunch of stuff
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.400]   in exchange for having the thinnest lightest most most most mobile mac we
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:16.000]   can possibly put on put on to put on to the market
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.560]   and so if they were to really prosecute that
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:23.200]   and it would not only restore a good line of delineation
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.800]   that we've lost between what is a macbook air and what is a macbook pro
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:31.440]   but it would also really be a yet another shot the on for for mac
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:34.720]   especially if it were also the only mac in the first mac
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.800]   you could actually get 5g so you actually have always on internet
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.320]   just built into the thing that is an incredibly for me
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.760]   persuasive device and something that would love to see apple make
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.520]   you mentioned youtube and you made you reminded me that i forgot to mention
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.960]   something that we found out about our friend rene richie
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:58.560]   uh... this week he tweeted after over two years as a full-time creator i'm
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:03.360]   taking on a new role we finally know what rene is going to do as
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.240]   creator liaison at youtube at youtube liaison
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:13.040]   uh... so i can't you know think of a better job for uh... a guy who is so good
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.520]   at making friends making relationships
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:20.160]   uh... it knows the inside out that the challenges of being a youtube creator
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.280]   so for him to be really good really good for youtube creators and really good
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.240]   for it is to have someone like rene there i'm just because
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.160]   you know he's the right person to he he is practical enough to be able to
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.320]   talk to youtube and understand like what they're
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:36.160]   dealing with but also pushing for what needs to you know what really
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:39.440]   needs to be done and he also obviously understands the creator of so
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.240]   i think it's just a perfect i don't know if they find anybody else in the
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:45.440]   world that'd be as good as they know it kind of explains too because he
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.920]   he said when he first told us he was going to leave the show he said i can't
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:51.040]   tell you where i'm going but no it's not where you think
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.200]   so that meant well it's not apple
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.360]   right but then i knew it would be fun i had it had to be some sort of
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:00.640]   big deal corporate thing because we couldn't say anything about it
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:04.240]   he wouldn't tell us where until the press release came out
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.360]   so i thought we tried we tried you can tell us we
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:10.720]   you put him in tell us you put him in the house what we knew it was an apple
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.440]   because he said he might come back and visit from time to time yeah that doesn't
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.960]   you know what apple would come back but he also said i can't do the show i'm
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.320]   not allowed to do the show so i knew i thought it was like a government job
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.440]   to me that's with the Canadian government maybe he's going to auto
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:26.240]   or something but no uh this is this makes perfect sense now so
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:29.440]   congratulations rene and yeah as you can tell we all think it's a great
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.280]   i love i love the fact that it's for all the reasons that big that we know
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:37.680]   him for also the reason that uh he's not someone who's been on youtube
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:41.120]   who's been successful on youtube for 10 years he came to youtube
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:45.440]   rather late recently so he's really familiar with what you what it's like
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.800]   right now to try to try to gain gain a follow ship
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.800]   in youtube his channel is big enough to demonstrate that he knows what he's
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:56.080]   doing not so big that he's been insulated from right
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:59.920]   from the problems that exist all the other things the only the only one i
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.880]   won't even call it a gripe let's let's call this a comment
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.320]   that a lot of the stuff that he's going to have to advocate for
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.920]   when the stuff where it's not going to be a polite conversation between himself
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:14.560]   and uh executive youtube is about things like representation about
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:19.440]   uh diversity about are you promoting more white guys or are you really trying
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:24.080]   to find those channels that represent the entire spectrum of humanity out there
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:28.160]   it would have been lovely to see someone that was part of that that was part of
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.280]   that one of those communities but i'm not saying that as a
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:34.800]   complaint i'm saying that simply as an observation yeah but other than that
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.840]   it's it really is a wonderful hire i'm looking forward to seeing
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:41.120]   what he does i i'm not looking forward to what he has to do to
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.280]   again there's a lot of stuff going on youtube right now where he's going to be
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:49.040]   forced to jump up and down on people's desks and yell if he's not going to be
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.000]   heard uh because they've got a lot of problems i got to
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.720]   deal with but uh he's a good person for the job i think
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:58.640]   every everything you know that youtube creators have had to deal with that
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.280]   all people like us have been talking about out on the outside for all this
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:06.720]   time those all those cans of worms like rene is now in the worm factory so
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:10.960]   like i don't envy him that because she's gonna see why those things are like
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.840]   that on the inside and has to hold in his mind like
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.360]   being a creator in the frustrations you have on the outside and then
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.480]   the kind of narrative on the inside of all like well this is why that happened
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:24.720]   and then trying to be a conduit that's a tough job being a bridge between those
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:29.120]   uh those groups but i think he if anybody's gonna do well at it at him
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:33.920]   i also want to say that it's really funny that um his colleague serenity coldwell
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:37.680]   who was also my colleague she worked with him and i'm more and she went to a
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.840]   developer relation position at apple so like both of them are doing
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:46.480]   very similar jobs of trying to be a bridge between the inside and the outside i
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:49.360]   think it's uh i think it's a good use of their talents and for people who don't
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:53.360]   know what rene did before he did i'm more he's also using a lot of his kind of
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:56.800]   communication brain power from his previous career
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:00.560]   that uh i think is going to serve him well inside youtube yay
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:03.920]   good going rene we're proud of yeah congratulations and he did say he'll
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.560]   come back from time to time so we'll look forward to getting him on and we'll
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:10.080]   let you know ahead of time so that you can be like a jedi ghost he's just
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:14.160]   gonna appear and so oh like obi want hello i didn't see you there
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:18.880]   oh we could do that rene if you want we'll just have a ghostly image of you
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:23.680]   floating over a hologram of rene richy first thing i say leo have you ever
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:27.680]   have you considered doing this it's over to in 90 minutes two hours doing this
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:31.200]   as a short a short a short get some that get some of that
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.680]   tik tok action in yeah oh i have seen the light
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.600]   uh and it shuts off after one minute 23 seconds getting back to the um
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:45.680]   macbook air uh john groover's gone on a kind of a rampage over this whole
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:48.400]   thing and i think it's kind of interesting i wanted to get your take
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.840]   it started uh when he was looking at wire cutters
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:56.000]   review of their best laptop he says not best windows laptop
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.920]   best laptop full stop a del xps 13 that costs one thousand three
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.360]   hundred forty dollars but is slower and gets worse battery life i'm reading
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:09.680]   john right now from daring fireball dot net and has a lower resolution display
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:13.360]   than their quote best mac laptop the one thousand dollar
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:18.000]   m1 macbook air they do have a mac or windows or something else preface to the
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.760]   whole comparison but if you're going to name a best laptop
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:26.400]   putting aside o s preference it's incompetent not to conclude that macbooks
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.560]   are both technically superior and better values for the dollar
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:34.720]   thanks to apple's exclusive silicon advantage he goes on later uh to point
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:40.800]   out other magazines kind of ignoring the fact that apples laptop is kind of
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.640]   lapped pc laptops is that the case do you think that's a fair
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:49.680]   thing to say uh that that there is no comparison that clearly the best laptop
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:55.200]   is the apple m1 and maybe m2 no um i i disagree but i think it depends on
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:54:00.080]   your point of view um i i i think that he has a very valid
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:03.760]   argument there uh particularly when you're talking about power per watt
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:08.800]   uh excuse me c p u power per watt consumed uh that is just uh
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:13.280]   it's it's almost a non-starter it's not even not a not a race but the thing is
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:18.800]   how are you going to define a laptop and for uh i would be more i would be happier
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:23.280]   if wire cutter defined it as the best windows laptop you can buy versus the
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.240]   best uh mac laptop you could buy although i do see
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:29.040]   its point of view that this is still a world in which
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:32.640]   the default setting is still windows but what if you were just going to say what
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:36.080]   is the best overall laptop would you still put a
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:39.520]   condela exp i love i think by the way i'm sitting in front of a del exp 15
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:44.000]   i love the brand new one the twelfth generation intel i love the exp 13 i'm
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.840]   not going to disagree that it's a very very good laptop but would you
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:51.360]   well i think in the i think in the same vein that
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:54.640]   as a mac user you were like well it might not be as fast as the the windows
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.200]   laptops but i'm not going to go use windows right
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.920]   in the same way it does a windows user is going to be
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:03.440]   the you know it doesn't really in my opinion
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:06.560]   i mean we can talk about it but it's really hard to say
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.200]   that the windows laptop is better than the mac or the mac is better that the
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:12.560]   user is is embedded in that into that in that environment so maybe it's foolish
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:16.480]   to say the best laptop for everyone it's actually i just don't think
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:20.160]   i i do think yeah i think i mean i i agree with Alex i think
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:25.520]   you're in this situation where it's a uh there's a certain person who is going
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.720]   to just want a windows laptop right but i do think that there are a lot of
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:32.160]   people who don't care and if and they just assume that the
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:35.760]   best laptop is a windows laptop and that windows laptops are cheap and that
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.760]   therefore right and so i it doesn't the the wire cutters readers a little bit of
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:44.720]   a disservice to say the best laptop is a del and the best mac laptop is the mac
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:50.080]   book air because it does imply that the del laptop is better than the air and
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:53.040]   it's not i think Andy's exactly right as somebody who used to run
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:57.360]   a few big websites i can tell you i the my bat
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:01.680]   that signal no that's not right my spider sense it's marvel marvel zombie
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:05.840]   my spider sense went off and i thought you know what this is this is that they've
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.640]   got those two categories and they don't want to change them
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:12.080]   probably for seo and so they've kept them the way they are because the right thing
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:16.320]   to do is to say that's the best windows windows laptop and then have a
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:21.280]   section in both that says look this is we think we think the best overall laptop
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:26.640]   is and then you choose and say but people have these two operating system choices
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:30.160]   and so here's the best of of of either world you know what else is changed you
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:34.960]   can't really run windows on an m1 so you might have reasonably said a mac
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:38.960]   as Walt Mossberg once did the mac is the best windows laptop because you could
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:42.080]   run windows on it yeah when it was an intel device
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:47.600]   there is a later post on during fireball where he talks about ours technica
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:52.800]   uh leaving apple out of its uh mentions and in fact
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:57.920]   um somebody he's quoting a blogger jack well-born
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:03.920]   at worms and viruses saying if memory serves including macs in a pc hardware
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:10.160]   comparisons was more or less the norm until a few years ago now john has a great
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:14.080]   conspiracy theory i'm not sure i buy this but i'll i'll float it for you
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:19.440]   uh he says reviewers it ostensibly neutral publications are afraid that
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:24.800]   reiterating the plain truth about x86 versus apple silicon that apple silicon
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:29.920]   wins handily in both performance and efficiency is not going to be popular
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:33.840]   with a large segment of their audience he's basically saying they're pandering
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:36.640]   they're not telling them the truth because to say
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:42.880]   apples the best is a profoundly in his words inconvenient truth
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.240]   for many computer enthusiasts who don't like apple
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:51.200]   so technically those are al gorets al goreswords yes yes he's paraphrasing
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:56.480]   paraphrasing the vice president um that's a little bit that's going a little
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:00.400]   far maybe i i i i i i i i'm gonna give you the institutional argument again
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:04.080]   which is never ascribed to malfizance what could be described by incompetence
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:07.600]   or institutional drift which is it's just
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:11.680]   easier to separate the mac in a pc and not talk about them in the same context
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.880]   because they're so different yeah but i think there is a least a little bit of
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:19.440]   truth again is it a conspiracy or is it more that they are so used to
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:25.200]   the the order of things in the old world that they that apple silicon
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:29.840]   should have caused them to reflect and they just didn't because they're just
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.880]   too busy moving on to the next thing i think that's more again i would just
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.840]   say it's more i don't even want to say laziness i want to say limited
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:40.080]   resources leading to people make it you know letting the status quo kind of
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:43.840]   run but i i do think it's it i get what john saying here which is
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:47.360]   finally apple is sort of like pulled up this trump card on intel
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:52.160]   and uh nobody is is i mean they're saying it but yet parts of their sites
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:55.600]   aren't saying it i get that but i don't think it's a grand conspiracy is it
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:03.600]   accurate to say that apple is the best apple silicon is the best
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:06.480]   and it wins handling performance and efficiency
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:09.360]   is that is that if that's john's assertion is
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:13.200]   well it's just obviously apple's the best why aren't they saying so
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.920]   if if you're talking about what you're trying to do
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:20.080]   yeah i mean go ahead and i'll i'll i'll i'm i just have a quick thing to say
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:24.720]   which is that if you're talking about the chip itself
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:31.680]   it's hard to argue that apple isn't ahead of what intel and amd are doing
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:35.840]   however it's not you're not buying you don't go to best buy to buy a chip
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:39.920]   you buy a computer because that chip has to be attached to these things
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:43.920]   called ports and for some people expansion is going to be an
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:46.400]   important thing for some people being able to
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:51.680]   run not just benchmarks but a specific type of uh of uh
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:56.480]   of of solution it's not you i don't think you can
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:59.760]   basically put what this is not an industry in which you can basically put
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:04.160]   a crown on the head of one person i think that's a very very glib way of
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:09.120]   trying to describe a really really complex series of of calculus is
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:13.360]   i think that i think that yes on the cpu on the silicon side yes very much so
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:19.280]   but no there's no way to say that uh that that uh as a laptop as a mobile
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.520]   platform uh the fact that this that this machine is running apple silicon
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.920]   makes it a better computer overall than windows i think that Alex what do you
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.480]   think i'm about to group apples yeah Alex what do you think yeah
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:34.240]   no i think i think that the thing is is anytime someone asks me about technology
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.480]   like what do you recommend i'm like well what do you want to do yeah
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.480]   that's the first question you want to do with it you know yeah you know like
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.200]   what do i do with it because because if you if you want to do this then this is
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.240]   better if you've never used a computer and you're not going to
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:48.080]   integrate with a big company and you you maybe already have an
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:51.200]   iPhone you should definitely get a Mac it's really fast and it's really easy to
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.440]   use if you are embedded into windows or if you're using autocad or you're
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.760]   using you know there's a bunch or you're in a
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.600]   corporate environment that requires it then maybe the you know maybe that makes
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.120]   sense and so it just depends on on what you're actually trying to get done in
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.080]   the same way that we were talking earlier about you know whether what
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.960]   spreadsheets should you use you know should you if you're doing really heavy
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.160]   pivot tables and doing really big calculations that are like on the
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:19.280]   verge of erp excels way to go like that is the one that is the one that does
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.320]   that if you want to organize ideas build small
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.160]   budgets and have something that's a little more pleasing to look at
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.800]   numbers is the right way to go if you're on a Mac numbers is the right way to
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.760]   go and if you want to collaborate sheets is the way to go and so
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.200]   so those are the you know that i think that in in all of these things you
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.200]   have to figure out what does the user want to do and how complex they want to
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.840]   be i think that i do think at this point though i mean
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.880]   you know for a start for someone getting started with computing if they were
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:48.560]   doing that um and they and they were point blank i think a
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.680]   Mac makes a lot of sense i think but i think that if they want to do gaming if
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.080]   they want to use oh yes oh yes is a good example
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.120]   you have a lot of people in office hours that use obs does not
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.840]   should not run that on a Mac oh interesting okay actually read
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:06.400]   lennox i might actually this is and some of that is because they're not using
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.040]   the api's and apple did a bunch of github check-ins for it which is
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.800]   hilarious but i wanted to say the um there's the theoretical uh general
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.440]   computer buyer right who always comes up in these scenarios which is
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.360]   yeah but most people don't use their computer for all of that stuff they're
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.000]   using the basics and you could argue that by a chrome book is what i
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.960]   argue that's what i was going to say is is not necessarily a chrome book but like
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.320]   you could argue that okay for the basics like
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:34.880]   yeah maybe an m1 macbook air is a really nice computer for you but the truth is
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.640]   and this is something that's changed in the last five maybe 10 maybe even
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.280]   15 years but the basics literally any computer
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.160]   basically being sold anything that can run a browser
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:50.240]   yeah a lot of a lot of folks can cover most of what people want to do so i
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.840]   think i i'm actually going to strongly disagree with grover because
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:03:00.800]   if you say it's power per performance per power usage okay you might say
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:05.680]   apple has a strong advantage but there are plenty of intel chips that best the m1
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.440]   and m2 that's that's not a nobody's disputing that even apple doesn't
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:16.000]   dispute that they always say per watts so it's ridiculous to say apple is far
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.480]   and away the best uh processor and then i agree completely with you guys
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:23.680]   it's how you use it if you're a gamer apple a macbook
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.360]   air is not the right choice i mean when yeah when someone who when someone who
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.920]   says they have they don't you know i say well what do you use with a computer
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.720]   and they're like well i check my email and i surf the web and i
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.280]   write some documents i'm like you just get an ipad
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.720]   get an ipad keyboard you know like there's many more choices that it is
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:43.520]   it's easier to turn on it it lasts longer it's yeah just get it you know you so
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.360]   and and literally when i go out and about i mean i almost never take a laptop
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.720]   anymore i'm taking my ipad and then off i'll go you know so unless i feel
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.080]   like i'm gonna have to do some graphics processing also i'm gonna i'm gonna
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.200]   stand by what i said which is that maybe it was different when apple mac and
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.040]   tush is were intel and ran windows but they don't now
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:05.680]   so so now really it's such a it's such a heterogeneous world
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:10.160]   it is certainly foolish to say to claim there's a best laptop and i agree with
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:13.360]   john in that respect wire cutter was wrong to say that
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:17.120]   but i don't think it makes any sense these days to include max
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.440]   in rundowns of pcs there's there are different beasts anywhere
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.680]   means to include an ipad exactly put an ipad in there if you want to in that
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.680]   case yeah there are different beasts uh more than ever before and that's a
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.560]   good thing that's a sign of maturity and computing
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:37.520]   uh that there are different tools for the different jobs you might want to do
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:43.760]   um but is a good point is a quarkam sucks but okay other than that
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:48.880]   yes it's funny because they you know on the windows side they keep trying to get
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.800]   windows on arm to take off and they you know quarkam keeps announcing the
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:58.000]   latest greatest desktop class arm processor and they're not even
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.040]   in the ballpoint if you run if you ran if you booted bootcamp
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:08.240]   windows for arm on apple silicon it would be really really good
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:13.280]   but every report that we've seen is that windows for arm basically exist due to
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:17.360]   uh an agreement with quarkam where quarkam is subsidizing it and so we can't
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.000]   really appear anywhere but on quarkam's process only in beta
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.440]   womp womp and if you do run it by the way in emulation in a vm on the uh silicon
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:29.680]   uh apple silicon it runs great yeah because it's not emulated right it's just it's
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.520]   just being translated and yeah and they're using and then they're using windows
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:38.560]   is code translation to get back to intel instead of using apples and so even that
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:42.160]   works pretty well it's just it's one of those things where like windows on arm
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:47.520]   is not fundamentally a problem it's that quarkam is is your problem
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:53.120]   uh a lot of people in our chat uh i'll quote dug-em have been saying all along
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:58.720]   that oh you got it you got to really try uh parallels and windows on arm on an
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:02.720]   m1 it runs great he just said windows 11 arm runs wonderfully
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:07.680]   in parallel 17 as good as windows 10 on a macbook 16 inch in bootcamp
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:15.760]   on nate bare metal so uh yeah so maybe maybe apple is the best choice
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:20.160]   for it's the best choice for macos and windows on arm okay we'll grant you that
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:24.080]   i think ultimately what we're saying is is that this is nuanced and that the best
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:28.640]   way to look at this is that you know whether you want a mac or a pc or an ipad or a chrome
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:34.240]   book is actually kind of question one and so to say that there is one right answer
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.160]   is impossible because it really does depend like alex said on what are you going to do
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:42.720]   with it and what are your personal preferences and it is true that apples you know new chip
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:48.000]   has given them the lead in lots of areas over intel but it doesn't really matter
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.880]   if you don't care about those areas and you you you'd rather have whatever it is
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:57.840]   running obs or running windows because you're comfortable with it it's but you know it's yes
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:03.200]   and qua com makes everybody sad that's the other thing and somebody in the chamoises
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:08.000]   you think they're bad now when they merge with broadcom oh that's gonna be good uh
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.320]   let's take a little break it's so fun to be back with you guys i missed you guys man
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:17.600]   that's all though thank you to everybody who joined us on the twit uh cruise it was a blast
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:25.120]   i just uh reporting back to you guys they love you guys we talk a lot about uh all of the shows
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:29.600]   they said in greetings back to all three of you everybody's very happy about jason snell
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:35.040]   joining the panel um we have the best day gone cruise ships and i know you are you know if we
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:38.400]   so that was the other thing is everybody at the end of us is okay when we're doing it again
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:43.920]   so and uh this will all recover from yeah after i get better from covid then uh i think we can
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.640]   consider it is this happening again leo is this like 20 years ago where suddenly the cruises are
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:54.480]   back next yeah no they're not bad can i just say they're not um but next time i am calling the
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:59.520]   obama because uh of insect cruises who did the geek cruises at you and i spent some time somebody

[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.800]   created a i don't know what happened a google photos albums so you know everybody can upload
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:06.400]   their pictures and then i know i didn't do it because i was on the plane it disappeared and so
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:13.200]   i've recreated it again uh i will briefly put up the qr code uh in between shows if you uh we're on
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:17.600]   the cruising you want to add your pictures there are already some good ones in there our show today
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:23.600]   brought to you by hover.com all right show of hands how many of you have a custom domain names
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:31.280]   some of us have a bad habit of rushing out registering domain names a minute you know the
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:40.320]   idea strikes us i uh i still own tunic time.com fancy pants.com and many hundreds of other
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:46.880]   domains that i probably should let lapse it's so fun and easy to make a domain at hover.com that's
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:52.400]   probably you know i'm blaming them they make it they make it easy you don't get 20 pages of upsell
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:56.480]   you don't get all the other stuff it's just very simple you go in you get a great price
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:02.320]   you register a domain name they've got pro level tools that makes it easy for you to associate that
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:09.120]   domain name with email in fact they have a great email service very inexpensive email service
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:14.000]   probably the number one reason i encourage people to get a custom domain name is for their email
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:22.240]   so many people even businesses i run into at aol.com at hotmail.com come on guys
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:29.440]   that does not project a professional you know reputation you want to have one that's your
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:34.480]   business's name i have a family name for my email that's nice too and the other good thing about that
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:39.760]   is hover can do the back end they've got web mail it'll work with all your existing email clients
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:44.800]   it's very easy to set up you can add as many mailboxes to your domain as you need when your
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:51.040]   domain renews your mailbox does too automatically if you choose their most popular mailbox is a
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:57.600]   no-brainer solution for business owners unbeatable price plus you get access anywhere any way you
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:03.760]   like it use email app you're already comfortable with the web mail is great you'll feel very
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:12.080]   comfortable with it and when you're using hover as your domain and your email you can use it for
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:17.600]   say i for instance i am always using it to keep track of who's stealing my email address i never
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.160]   give the same email address twice one of the great features of controlling your own domain names
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:29.040]   uh also nice if you want to move if you own the domain name that your email's at it's easy to
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:34.320]   forward it to anywhere you're never locked in to hover to anyone else and that is really great too
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:39.360]   you don't have to notify people that you're moving you just do it hover whether you're a blogger
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:43.520]   an artist a portfolio you're building an online store you're a business person or you just want
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:49.600]   to make a more memorable redirect to your linkedin page hover has the best domain names and email
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:56.800]   addresses just for you i use the pro-level tools uh very powerful domain and email management tools
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:01.920]   for your dns they're intuitive they're easy to use i like them but they also have hover connect if
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:07.760]   you say oh i don't want to do dns no problem you pick the service you want to use to build and host
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.680]   your website connect helps you start using your domain name with just a couple of clicks in here
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:16.800]   i'm going to add a footnote do not get your domain name from the company providing your website
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.280]   because then they control both and it's really good to keep them separate it's just good hygiene
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:27.360]   and hover you're a customer by the way not a source of data take back control of your data with a

[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:53.200]   i'm guest hosting this summer i'm guest hosting clockwise on relay with mica and last last week
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:14:00.640]   um during the show we joked about the concept of is the moon still orbiting.com and by the end of
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:08.400]   the episode guess what mica had registered mica and it really it just goes to the clockwise page so
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:15.600]   thanks mica for the the impulse buying domains is a real problem i think lots of us have so sad
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:22.240]   uh and eventually i'm going to go through those and say okay do not auto renew because you know
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:29.200]   i but what if but what if we do need that domain might not be in orbit and then we need it we need
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:35.360]   it we need it hey i got up by the way for you Jason a sit you got a slot for the sixth computer
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:42.720]   right there right yes you only have five that's bothering a lot of our ocd viewers actually
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:46.240]   there is believe it or not there is a macbook air back there with a six colors logo on it but
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.280]   it's very low key that what are you talking about and it's an m1 so it's not an old computer is
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:56.400]   it midnight blue well it is m1 so now it's just got a few hundred thousand a spare
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:02.960]   steve jobs prototype for the original apple computers being auctioned off
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:12.000]   this is the thing that that the was hand wire wrapped so that steve could then go around and say
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:21.120]   hey uh we need the chips um it's up for auction at rr auction hand soldered by wasniac in 1976
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:26.160]   we should check the bidding uh they expect it'll be as much as half a million dollars
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:33.920]   it was used to secure apples first major order in 1976 they this is the device they brought
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:40.640]   very famously to the bite shop and showed paul tarell and said would you be interested in carrying
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:47.600]   this computer as a kit right the prototype according to a business insider has some minor
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:55.920]   damage including a crack that runs from adjacent to the power supply area steve did it he dropped it
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.800]   it wasn't so pissed let me go look at the uh let's see if i can find the auction listing currently
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:08.400]   three hundred no sorry two seventy eight oh five fifteen bids it ends august 18th if you want a bid
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:14.080]   for this jason uh the next bid will be three hundred five thousand oh boy let's get jimmy gray
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:19.280]   wall to bid on it right he's the one with the makotosh museum in yeah fire wherever yeah that's a cool
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:26.880]   museum yeah this is the apple computer a prototype not not even an apple one this is an apple a
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:34.800]   um really great story yeah i think the option record is something a little under 800 thousand
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:41.040]   dollars i think wow look at this it is i wonder who had not first something as good as this yeah
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:47.920]   this is history this is not obviously operating mitch wait came by we did a triangulation with him
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:54.560]   some time ago the old publisher of many many computer books and he had an apple one that he
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:59.760]   got working again uh took a little bit of work to get the capacitors you had to think he had to
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:05.520]   replace them and so forth this is not in good shape this is kind of and wasn't there a story about like
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:13.120]   to as an illustration of exactly how lack of interest uh steve jobs had in apple history
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.600]   that he just like cleaned out his office of all kinds of like here's an apple one here's like
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:22.720]   prototypes of this here's sketchbooks of that and it was just like and as he just like left them like
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:28.320]   in like boxes outside his office and eventually people just start taking them because steve expected
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:33.040]   them to be just tossed in the trash this is how they uh have identified the provenance of it by the
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:41.280]   way this is a polaroid taken by paul tarell in 1976 when was and jobs came over it said hey man
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:48.480]   you want to buy some of these men so uh and it matches exactly so that's how they know this is
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:54.480]   i love your 70s drug dealer voice man oh that was really great okay oh teaching chongy but i'm like
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:03.040]   are you you're implying that like a 1976 the most valuable like lid of pot was ever traded
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:11.040]   was not here man was not here man i just want to be clear also in that slot where the macbook
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:15.600]   areas there's a 12 inch this is uh as yet unopened but this is a 12 inch power book so
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:21.200]   the collection grows oh boy don't tell my wife that i got this one 12 inch power book from what
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:30.160]   year is that oh i don't even anybody 2000 aluminum so where you found these at ebay or you go to the
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:34.160]   rr auction this came from uh this came from a reader who said i want to get rid of my 12 inch
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:40.960]   power book would you like it and i said sure okay i have started declining those offers we had so
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:46.240]   much stuff when we know i'm selective yeah i'm selective but this is like one of the best uh again
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:54.640]   to our earlier discussion about small laptops like i i really like apple when it is striving to make
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:19:00.960]   the smallest possible laptop and it hasn't done that since the since the macbook that 12 inch
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:05.520]   macbook and and the 12 inch power book from back in the day which is like the weight of eight 12
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:10.960]   inch macbooks uh was also part of that kind of striving to be small and light as possible yeah
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:17.840]   that's what by the way all collectors say oh yeah whatever i want that dodge in the backyard where
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:27.520]   the grass is growing that's that's very special yeah 1971 you know someday i'm gonna fix that up someday
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:35.920]   we have there's a family friend who uh uh i don't know how much i should say about this the uh county
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:43.280]   government came to him and said uh you know those hundred cars in your backyard i mean literally
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:49.920]   uh you got to get rid of those man those are those are an eyesore yeah well we call them morning
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:55.760]   situation but they're all special man they're all special that was a oh you wouldn't go oh man you
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:01.440]   can't get those anymore but that that's the same guy who uh sold the apple yeah it's a pretty good
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:09.840]   one not here man uh apple and cost what do those two names have in common remember cost
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:16.560]   remember how many have not it maybe you're old enough Jason that you wore the eight eight pound
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:22.640]   cost pro 440 a headphones when you don't you don't even remember that i remember wearing some
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:27.200]   cheap headphones i don't remember wearing in the old days people over probably you probably have to
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:33.200]   be over 60 to remember this we you know the new uh paul simon and garfunkel album would come out
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:36.800]   and you'd get it and you get it home from the record store and you take it out you put it on
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:43.120]   the turntable you'd put on your cost pro 440 a headphones which would make your head kind of
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:47.280]   waffle because they were so heavy and you lie on the ground you look at the album cover while you
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:53.040]   listen the whole album 50 times front to back and what would you say and what voice would you use
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:59.040]   to say it is why you were listening this is rad dude you sure you sure it wasn't a beanbag chair
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:06.720]   i actually all right you see you're getting me started sorry i i did have my mom was a weaver
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:14.240]   and she made me the weirdest thing it was basically a long she called it the fire chair it was a long
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:20.560]   worm she had we actually had to go up in the balcony and load it with styrofoam peanuts and
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:26.560]   then seal it off and then it would twist around and it had like she was like a shag carpet worm
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:31.200]   and you just stood around you lying i so desperately need pictures
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:35.920]   i will find a guy but i visited the only reason i remember this i was talking about with my mom
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:42.560]   yeah club twit pictures yeah this explains so much yeah oh my god oh dude oh don't bo-guard that
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:49.840]   joint man i'm listening to paul simon right the snake snake is running on the worm
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:59.920]   anyway cost is uh was i guess they're still around a long time manufacturer of uh at the time
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:06.000]   they were the pro headphones they had pro in the name when were they when were they pro 77
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.640]   yeah because i was like i was like i remember having cost headphones but they were like the cheap
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:15.280]   thing we got it well when they were suing apple i was like really these are high-end
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:20.320]   a patent and well i thought it was amazed and they would always break they would fall apart in the
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:27.040]   worst because they were cheap not only were they cheap they were heavy so yeah anyway uh apple has
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:36.480]   agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by costs over the earbuds and beats headphones uh the trial was
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:43.600]   set to begin yesterday the companies told wakeo texas there you go back in wakeo mmm famous west
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:48.960]   texas federal court that they had resolved or at that's east texas and resolved allegations
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:55.520]   that apple infringed cost is wireless headphone patents judge alan albright dismissed the case
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:02.400]   with prejudice which means it can't be refiled it's over it's done we don't know how much they sued
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:07.840]   apple two years ago saying they had a wireless headphone system they developed in the early
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:14.960]   two thousand so you know it's good uh they also sued bows and skull candy those are still penning
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:19.440]   this is that all that famous you know patent stuff right well the hard part is if they if they get
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:23.120]   apple aside i'll look at everybody else to set them right i mean that's that's what you do though you
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:29.440]   get you you fund the lawsuits usually you don't start you don't start at the top yeah the patent
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:36.640]   system is broken yeah yes that's it i mean somebody has an idea for an imaginary wireless
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:42.640]   headset twenty years ago and then somebody else gets uh it gets companies to write them checks 20
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:48.800]   years later i mean i i will say a little a little more defense in this one that they actually are a
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:54.240]   headset company and they yeah they're not what we call a non-tragassing entity they actually
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:59.200]   practice and and the thing is is that if you work at a big company i i don't know much consulting
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:03.280]   it's a pretty large technology companies and one of the advice that i was given is hey
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.280]   if you're in a field and you don't see anyone around you talk to our lawyers
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:12.080]   i think you know like if you if you realize that whatever you're doing nobody else is doing like
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:16.640]   you're figuring something out that you can't find any information on google and you can't find any
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:22.080]   um whatever we should talk about patents you know like that that was the kind of the you know
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:25.040]   because you're now you're now but these weren't that kind of somewhere else these were
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:30.000]   that these were real but those obviously but no no no what i'm saying is is that these companies
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.480]   when you look at apple having hundreds of patents on cars and yeah yeah that's why what what people
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:38.320]   are told that these companies is that as soon as you start thinking about something new and you
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:41.760]   don't see anyone around you you can't find it on google and you you don't know anybody that knows
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:47.120]   it let's start let's start papering all of that up and so these companies do that as a as a defensive
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:52.160]   master and also that you don't want to you want to be building stuff on top of patents so i think
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:57.200]   the patents make sense i think that the when you aren't an operating entity i think that's when
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:02.160]   this is shouldn't be this is also more complicated because apple had begun
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:08.960]   licensing discussions so they kind of admitted they knew that they were going to have to license
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:17.120]   this stuff apple um cost brought the lawsuit saying the complaint apple suit san francisco
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:23.040]   shortly after cost brought the lawsuit arguing that cost is complaint included confidential
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:30.080]   information from their licensing discussions so they went they said they sat down they said okay
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:36.080]   how much is going to cost and then and then they sued or cost sued and then apple countersued
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:42.480]   uh apple cost wanted royalties for all sales of i airpods and beat headphones
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:46.000]   which is got to be a lot of money i don't know if they got that much money but they got enough
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.200]   they're happy i get i mean everybody does it um apple does it too you want to have those patents
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:55.920]   you want to be able to have those mutually assured destruction patents where somebody comes to you
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.000]   but you've got the patent on them and so you're like okay we'll do a cross licensing agreement
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:06.080]   that's all true but there is something fundamentally wrong for anybody including a headphone company
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:11.520]   saying well we came up with this idea 20 years ago and we want you to pay us for it like there
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:18.160]   has to be on a 14 14 years i thought was the limit when did the airpods come out and it was early
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:23.840]   2000s and maybe maybe they wanted royalties for like a year's worth of airpod pro sales or something
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:29.920]   like that i don't know it's kind of ridiculous and stifles innovation and is unfortunate i mean
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.640]   like i want a patent should encourage innovation right but there is a point at which that's the
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:40.480]   whole point of a patent which is you reveal your technology then you get a license to use it for
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:46.880]   17 years after that it becomes public domain and that's why these suits always happen right you know
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:52.000]   at the end of the term here's 16 yeah because now we're going to try to do it yeah but it's
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.600]   reasonable that's why that exists the whole idea thank you ben franklin was that if you're going
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:03.040]   to spend money in r&d and innovate you should get to own this for a certain period time so you can
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:09.280]   recoup your investment and make a profit but at the same time we want inventions to be disseminated
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:13.920]   widely to all so this is a good i think it's a good compromise and but and patent trolls are
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:21.200]   something else and adjacent point our technology moves a hundred times faster than when the patent
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:28.880]   rules were set up you know like it took it might take you 17 years 17 years is like it back
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:35.280]   changes 17 you know i don't 200 years ago 17 years might be how long it takes to go to market
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:40.400]   right whereas you know but i do think i mean i think seven years is very reasonable i think 17
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:44.480]   is a little in the outer edge i think that in i think it's i'm now looking at 20 now
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:50.480]   so it used to be the destiny of the patent that's granted right is also part of the problem is
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:55.040]   that some one of the problems with the patent system is updated the patents granted are too broad
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:01.280]   and part of my feeling is like i don't know what cost patented in the early 2000s and you know good
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:06.160]   on them for doing that but i have a hard time conceiving of whatever they were granted as being
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:13.040]   so specific to what apple was doing 15 years later that they are really the originator of the
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:20.000]   concept right it probably was more like again so many patents get it's like hey i've got an idea
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:25.040]   what if we had a radio transmitter and a receiver and headphones it's like okay that's patentable
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:29.120]   and then you know in some cases it might be and in some cases it might not be and that the patent
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:33.120]   office has to decide and i think that one of the problems we see with patents is these very broad
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:37.920]   patents that get uh that are for obvious things that should be rejected and then you end up in the
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:42.800]   the court case where or the negotiation where you're saying we might be able to find prior art or we
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:48.400]   can argue that this is uh an obvious thing that should not have been granted as a patent but um
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:54.320]   because i like i i don't want to be anti-innovation i just think that that this is the needle you have
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:59.360]   to thread is how do you support innovation while not stifling innovation with patents
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:08.320]   in 1970 cost set the standard for full-size professional headphones with the iconic pro 4aa
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:14.160]   at the time of their introduction the pro 4aa were regarded as the first dynamic headphones
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:20.720]   to deliver true full frequency and high fidelity performance with impressive noise isolation
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:26.240]   capabilities you know how i did that by the way it's sealed it gave you a headache because it was
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:32.720]   so tight on your head thank you uh retcon five for finding the uh history of the pro 4 and i was
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:41.840]   saying 44 it's pro 4 stroke aa but i do remember those here's the patent term in 1790 when the patent
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:48.560]   act was established i'm looking at wikipedia it was for 14 years in 1836 they extended that
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:57.040]   adding a seven-year potential extension if the investor hadn't had a reasonable remuneration
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:02.400]   for the time ingenuity and expense so you can see the intent of this all along is to give you
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:09.600]   you know payback for your invention in 1861 it went to actually there was a brief period it was 21
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:17.040]   years 1836 to 1860 then in 1861 it went to 17 back to 17 and according to the Uruguay
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:24.320]   around agreements act in 1995 is now 20 years from the earliest filing date and you know that
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:29.600]   because well we we were got involved in the patent action with uh there was a guy who said
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:38.640]   i invented podcasts exactly 19 years ago and uh he uh he got tossed out because he did not invent
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:45.680]   podcasts but that you know thank you at adam corolla for fighting that and winning and the eff who
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:56.000]   eventually also won so cost got their whatever their their pound of silver whatever it is 10
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:04.080]   what is it they're 20 pieces of silver thank you the pound of silver is from uh shylock in the
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:09.280]   Shakespeare or something pound of flesh see i confused the two you know you can see why yeah
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:15.200]   apple since 2000 speaking to what you were talking about alex has applied for 248 car
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:20.560]   patents doesn't mean anything it just means that they thought of something that they haven't
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:25.120]   looked at and see someone else do and so you write it down and and it doesn't in the grand scheme of
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:29.840]   things uh patents are not that expensive to write for the if you have in-house lawyers and so you just
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:38.480]   keep pumping them out yeah i got a um a press release from uh apple saying they're opening a new apple
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:48.960]   store and where is it i think it's in the uk i've lost it now um but this gives me a chance to show
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:56.480]   you the apple store time machine yay from department map dot store looking at this at office hours
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:03.120]   this morning it was so so so you've seen this already what is it it is a i mean someone has rebuilt
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:09.600]   the in in great detail rebuilt these now i believe that this is an there's an iphone app that you can
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:14.320]   download that is so this is a walkthrough but is it it's not real this is like a 3d rendering of it
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:19.840]   or this is a 3d render and i and i what based on photos we just yeah based on photos and and uh
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:26.960]   but it's it is very detailed now i i think i believe that this is all 3d in the so you can like
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:32.480]   um you know tour around uh inside of this this is just showing you what it's what the experience
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:36.000]   is like you want to get the app obviously if you're gonna yeah you want to download the app if you
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:42.400]   want to look at i think it's got four stores right now um and uh it looks um it's pretty slick yeah
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:46.160]   so it's not just the one store so they'll show you i think there's i think there's four of them i
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:49.360]   believe that they're covering right now there's like the they have the one with the spiral staircase
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:53.920]   that's the fifth avenue one they have oh and this is from grand opening day so this is what it looked
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:33:02.560]   like so tisis corner may 2001 that's the first apple store that's in maryland right uh then stanford
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:07.760]   shopping center 2004 i was at that opening that was steve jobs did that opening he was real proud
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:13.680]   of that that's the mini store hello that's yeah yeah that's the mini store uh the fifth avenue store
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:20.080]   that beautiful glass which is gone now it's different but uh the original spiral stairs of the glass
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:29.200]   cube and then the infinite loop storage opened in 2015 and this is a free download nice very nice
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:36.880]   Brompton road opens day after tomorrow that's a new london store apple Brompton road
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:44.960]   in the city's bustling night's bridge neighborhood mmm look at all the foliage in there
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:52.960]   it's like lousy with foliage i gotta say i love whoever is doing apples real estate and design
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:57.440]   i love that especially in places that have historic buildings which is like not the united states
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:02.240]   um how they integrate i mean grand central was like that but like if you look at the Brompton road
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:09.440]   one they have integrated with what this building was right and and they've kept some of that flavor
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:14.560]   of the old building it's like not everything must be a glass rectangle right and i like that
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:18.800]   about what they do with these historic buildings that they go into they did in LA though they did
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:23.840]   that tower theater yeah they have there's a bunch of them that are like that and it's really great
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:29.280]   yeah beautiful that's a very big deal it's it's also taking these places many of which were
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:35.040]   originally designed as public spaces and maintaining them as private property private
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:39.840]   store but still a place where you can walk in and enjoy the beauty of this location uh
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:44.320]   not in this original form but at least it's not at least hasn't been torn down or turned to condos
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:48.720]   or at least the theater has not been turned into some sort of private the private club space i have
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:54.720]   not seen this uh this tower theater store i can't wait to see it this is old classic golden age movie
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:01.040]   theater yeah in the heart of LA and they kept the balcony which is hysterical and they've kept the
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:07.280]   outside and and much of the uh much of the detail inside so this is one i'd very much like to like
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:08.160]   to go visit you can you can you can heckle the geniuses like step
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:08.160]   you can you can you can heckle the geniuses like step
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:08.160]   you can heckle the geniuses like step
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:10.160]   you can heckle the geniuses like step
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:14.960]   yeah and a you and i should do that we should go we should sit in the front row
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.560]   we should go that's not how you hauled it
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:23.840]   there's so many that are great i mean i've had the opportunity to go to a lot of apple stores
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:28.400]   over the world around the world and it's got to be so much fun to be on that team because it feels
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.800]   like each one of them just about except for the malls the malls are all kind of the same but but
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:38.880]   in these things like the one in paris is just stunning like it it's just an amazing
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:43.600]   um space the one and i think it's Regency Gardens i think in you know is Regency Gardens
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:48.320]   it's it's a gardens something rather in in London that you know it just each one of these really
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:52.880]   cute cute girls here cute gardens no i don't think it's cute gardens either i think it's okay else
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:56.800]   it's something it's a couple syllables type and as being a geography tyson i'm being told
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:01.840]   Tyson's Corner thank you web 8898 who obviously logged in just to tell me Tyson's Corner is in
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:09.360]   Virginia oh yeah i should have went i was nearby given a mark and so i actually visited it
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:16.880]   uh and and because did you huckle did you heckle the geniuses then no uh basically i i protested
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:20.400]   them giving me the bums rush saying that you definitely look the sort of riff forever
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:26.800]   Covent Garden Covent Garden that's where it is yeah the famous flower store from my fair lady
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:35.840]   if you want to go to Brompton Road there's going to be a big event on uh on the 28th
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:42.160]   with apple fitness plus trainers i don't know any of them you probably do Alex
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:49.200]   Corey Wharton Malcolm Jamie Ray Hartzhorn and really Kim Kim go and Janelle Lewis will join
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:54.960]   Jay Blonick i know you know his name he's VP fitness technologies for an in-store Q&A followed by
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:00.480]   a three kilometer walk that's for me and a five kilometer run in Hyde Park
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:07.120]   although i will say that my you know my wife works for a meditation center and we looked at the
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:10.720]   the meditation one she's like oh i know that person like so they're really picking i'm sure
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:17.200]   they've got the best yeah yeah um of course i just didn't got that great tour a couple of weeks ago
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:22.320]   of the facility where they shoot that you should go look at that Alex i bet you give him some
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:28.080]   tips some pointers i'd love to see it i just from Justine's walk through it looked it looked
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:32.560]   pretty amazing looked like they were there was definitely a spared no expense kind of thing going
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:43.280]   on there um let's see what else here um tiktok is the fastest growing new source in the UK oh lord
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:47.520]   i don't even how that works and tiktok like how would you find news in tiktok like it's right
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:54.160]   all my news tiktok angry alligators yeah it's all about discovery like even the
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:38:00.400]   is even even google's like it's chief of basically every division inside google that makes google
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:06.000]   money was completely saying that 40 percent of searches are now happening like inside tiktok and
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:12.320]   social media uh for like a lot of the profitable things that google sells ads for and that's starting
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:15.920]   to become a really big problem it's why everything's it's why everything's turning into tiktok these
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:24.080]   days yeah including instagram i am i am right there with the Kardashians that uh instagram is a
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:30.560]   wasteland i hate to say it but yes it's like i youtube youtube and instagram it's like my feed
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:34.800]   used to be filled with like lots and lots of really interesting like individual pictures now youtube
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:40.080]   is like i see that vertical format like uh dammit like a one third of like all the different
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:43.920]   things i've subscribed to and i don't blame them you you got to make money off of your channel and
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:49.600]   this is where there's it's oh they're just no they're just blatantly copying tiktok they don't have a
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:55.120]   good idea no no well well no well because it's i've talked about the creators that the creators
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:39:00.080]   yeah oh they have to do it yeah you can well you can tell that he's big on instagram now he
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:04.960]   does the same thing he does in tiktok because instagram supports it yeah well because it's you
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:12.560]   can tell like when they start when they start offering the decent money to creators uh the blind
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:16.880]   without having to really caut out to the algorithms like no just please upload more
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:23.120]   shorts please upload more more more videos uh in instagram that's when when they're basically
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:26.800]   telling you here's how much money we were going to pay you extra if you if you post more of this
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:32.880]   content you can see how scared they are about well and tiktok and it it always ends you know like like
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:38.720]   facebook was like hey we'll we'll we'll share when you go live we'll share it to everyone in your network
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:42.240]   you know without you having to pay for it and then in one week they were like yeah no i can do that
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:46.000]   anyway no i was like yeah like and now now you've now all these companies and everything else
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.960]   built up their infrastructure inside of something that is not sustainable i mean it is uh it is such a
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:58.560]   uh you know snake water i'm disappointed because i really uh as a photographer that's the place i
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:03.760]   want to share my still photos and as it turns into tiktok yeah tiktok uh adam misteri who's the
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:09.840]   president uh facebook guy who was brought in to run instagram my love vice motherboards headline
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:16.240]   instagram admits it's not good after kardashians beg it to stop copying tiktok the things you hate
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:22.800]   about instagram will continue until morale improves uh uh ryan bradarik who writes the garbage
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:27.360]   day newsletter his tweet was hey guys i know you all hey well we did to our app we hear you you know
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:32.640]   what we agree we think it sucks too but we're not going to stop it'll probably get worse because
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:36.960]   we did some math and we can make more ad money this way exactly i hope this helps yeah well
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:41.440]   literally here's the quote i need to be honest i do believe more and more of instagram is going
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:47.120]   to become videos so bye bye i guess because it's more people it's it's way more it's it's way
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:51.120]   stickier for i mean from a from an ad perspective it's way it's way easier i mean and there is a
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:55.680]   little bit of one lesson that that youtube didn't you know taught everybody else was youtube trying
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:02.800]   to go to real names and the creators were up in arms and youtube backed away and it's why their
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:06.960]   comments are really bad like you know like if they if they had just stuck with it there was a
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:11.040]   there was a hard road of of two years to push everybody into into something that would that would
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:15.920]   bring calm you know to what they're doing and they didn't do that because they just didn't have the
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:20.160]   intestinal fortitude so i think a lot of folks who made have learned from that and a lot of the
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:24.640]   that team ended up everywhere and i think that if they i think the decision is not they have to
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:28.320]   think about it but once you go down the path you just have to keep plowing forward you know
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:37.200]   i guess i i guess i could countenance it if they're what they're saying is look uh this is what we
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:42.720]   have to do to survive but what it really looks like is we have no idea what we're doing so we're
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:49.520]   just going to copy the hot thing right now which is tiktok and leave it at that and we're not feeling
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:54.400]   the data is is is on video side there's some of us i mean i've never put a video on instagram so
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:59.520]   i mean i mean i've been a long time supporter of tiktok you you were one of the first people i know
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:04.080]   who said look this is gonna this is huge this isn't well here's the thing though there's there's
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:08.400]   there's the product of instagram which was photography and there's the fact that video is
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.360]   successful the problem i have is that it's a site that was based on photography saying you know what
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:20.080]   video is more successful so see you we're gonna do video exactly okay but like your photosite was
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:26.240]   also good and just because video is more popular or hotter than photos doesn't mean that photos aren't
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:30.560]   good and what you're really doing is saying we've decided to throw this in the garbage yes to do
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:35.280]   this other thing and it's like i get it from a business standpoint but it also shows you that
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:41.600]   it's they're they're feeling about the value of what instagram was is apparently like not very high
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:46.800]   because they just threw it away to do video instead like both can be good but instagram is not willing
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:52.560]   to be second fiddle to tiktok they would rather kill their existing product and replace it with tiktok
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:58.480]   yep and the hardest thing about social media is is trying to figure out they i mean i i think
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:02.880]   part of their problem is is they think that certain things are popular in tiktok and tiktok got to
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:08.720]   where it is by having a certain culture that's that's not necessarily easily reproducible you know so
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:13.280]   so i think that and snap is the same way they've survived because even though stories ended up
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:18.480]   everywhere and everything else there's a certain culture that was built up in tiktok the idea of
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:27.360]   kind of the mixing other people's content with your own using other you know music content
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:34.000]   you know all the early musically stuff that that that came into it it all built up into this
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:40.320]   into this culture that it does not exist in instagram or in youtube so while there's a certain
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:45.120]   acceptance of that excitement in that you want people want to be building off of each other some
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:50.240]   people only put up examples for other people to use they don't even make their own videos you know
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:54.880]   they just put up stuff that people can use and so so that's a that's a very different culture i think
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:59.200]   so it's not just vertical video and it's not just that you can scroll from one thing to the next
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:03.360]   there's a lot of other things in tiktok that i don't see being reproduced by these other platforms
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:06.960]   because they can't you know because of their licensing is there a replacement i mean i tried
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:12.480]   glass which i loved is very pretty's top photographic but it wasn't a social network and i think oh of
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:17.280]   the photos yeah i think instagram needs to be a social network or as well as a photo
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:22.560]   story there's nothing to replace it right that's the part of the problem no messages we send
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:26.320]   we send things to each other our messages yeah but that's not a social network that's just your
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:30.880]   that's messaging it's not it's not good for your parasocial relationships they're social it's right
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:35.680]   they're friends and relatives i will always be able to like send texts and messages to
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:40.160]   but the thing is there are people that are i consider friends that i either haven't met or
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:44.800]   maybe get to see maybe once a year maybe once a twice a year and that's what instagram is so
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:48.800]   really really good how about be real have you guys played with the be real yet that's all the
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:54.880]   that's the hot news this week i i when you for every time someone mentions one or i see it in the
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:58.960]   notes i immediately try to register because i want to keep my name yeah and someone else already
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:04.640]   p p to it what how can Alex Lindsay there's no other Alex Lindsay and there are there's uh there's
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:09.040]   like three and the three of us are always like competing for who's gonna get some Alex Lindsay
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:14.160]   so there's one that's a photographer in London because he's Alex Alex Lindsay one at you know
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:20.160]   something that was like us i got you so anyway the um but the um there's only one day i'll
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:23.840]   afford it but there's a crazy one and there's a crazy Alex Lindsay in Australia and then there's
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:28.560]   someone who's the oral of Crawford or whatever and so so yeah oh you mean lord Lindsay oh yeah
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:32.480]   i get you Alex lord Lindsay sure yeah the garden i every once in a while i get an email about the
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:38.800]   garden you know and um so uh so anyway so the um but we're always competing for this and i so
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:43.440]   i went up there really quickly jumped in and the moment it asked me to take a picture i took the
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:47.680]   picture and i realized it's taking a picture of me and i'm the other it's in the other camera as well
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:52.800]   it's not good i was like nope it's like i was like terrible privacy i didn't even i couldn't get
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:57.840]   out i was like just quit the app delete the app that's what i did like yeah i was like in my jammies i
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:01.600]   didn't let that pick and then the thing is it takes the picture with the front and the back camera
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:07.200]   yeah so the idea is you're being real and then you get this notification once a day and you have
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:13.360]   two minutes to take the picture so it's what you're doing right now the problem is if you don't want
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:19.440]   to do it and you take it later like i amp proof posted his one minute late and then it scolds you
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:26.800]   it says oh that was one minute late go to hell go to i get i get i can see the business plan i can
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:31.680]   i can see the slides that's the problem you don't want to you should never see the business plan
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:36.480]   yeah but we can get past the the the artificialness of instagram and pass the
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:41.440]   artificialness of all these things by forcing people to just just jump into it but but as someone i
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:45.360]   was like no i i'm not interested it's like that that's like the what was the one that was like place
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:50.560]   was it a place or um the one that was passed you think it passed that was yeah that was
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:54.720]   that's i said that went away because that was actually pretty good i took a couple photos there and i
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:59.760]   was like and and i got them you know like i don't post generally don't put pictures of my kids
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:02.720]   and i just took a couple pictures of me and put it on path and he was like i don't want
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:06.480]   play like i just like i was like yeah eventually you know this is this is a bad this is a bad thought
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:12.720]   process apparently according to how many of me dot com there are 23 people in the u.s
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:17.600]   named Alex Lindsey but there is only one Alex Lloyd Lindsey well there's like three in my family
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:23.440]   four in my family so that's very common day when i was a kid there were 21 leo loports in the
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:29.760]   providence phone book so yeah it's a good it was a popular Canadian name yeah french Canadian
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:31.920]   uh where did you find that?
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:37.680]   Providence how many of me dot com scooter x or in the chat room okay there are how many of me
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:43.600]   dot com yeah there's got to be more than that wolf from alpha would tell you probably too all right
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:48.640]   yeah i think we've run out of stories did i miss miss anything uh we're getting down to talking
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:54.080]   about be real that's pretty much as bad as you can get um can i can i have for one correction it was
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:48:00.640]   30 pieces of silver not 20 thank you let's get that right okay because because because if there's
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:05.200]   one person is definitely going to correct you it's people who know their bible yeah it's i uh i was
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:09.520]   in the last big trip we took before covid we were in the garden of guesthemone where those
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:16.880]   30 pieces of silver were paid off and take this cup away from me you know they say that the olive
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:21.200]   trees there are still the same ones two thousand years later they look two thousand years old but
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:26.080]   i don't know if they they're the same ones and then next to it there's a church which has a big stone
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:31.040]   in it that's where supposedly jesus lay he didn't i don't know if he slept in the garden but he
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:36.640]   he lay down while his while the disciples went off and partied and uh so that stones there and
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:40.800]   the faith will come and they touch it and Lisa went and touched it she said yeah yeah it's there's a
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:47.360]   whether the vibes are from jesus two thousand years ago or but they were the 18 million people who
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:51.760]   then touched it i'm not sure but there was definitely a vibe she said it took a
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:58.000]   different part if every body part of an apostle vrk likwari were actual actually authentic
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:03.040]   the apostles must have been like 80 foot high and many finger bones many many fingers
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:10.000]   uh we did the whole thing though the you know all the in the jurisland visited all the sponsors

[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:09.920]   thing sitting there in front of it i see it this is the floppy emu it is basically like a little
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:17.360]   raspberry pie kind of device and what you do is you attach it to the floppy drive on the back of
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:25.280]   early macs and stick an SD card inside um and the SD card is full of disk images and it will boot
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:33.520]   the old macs off of the SD card just like it's a floppy oh my god it also is apple hd 20 i think
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:39.040]   or hd 80 emulation so you could attach hard early hard drives via the floppy port it also supports
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:44.400]   those so you can really load any app you can think of that you find on the internet onto that one
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:50.640]   volume and have it accessible at one time this is a an upgrade into a plus uh version that is running
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:56.320]   it's six oh eight system six oh eight wow so so with not system seven it looks like mac right you've
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:02.000]   got i've got that's actually word four up there because it gave me more typography options but uh
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.360]   you can choose what you want pretty much all that old software is available to download on the
[01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:12.560]   internet now and yeah you just stick the SD card in a mac or pc or whatever and you can open up the
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:17.120]   disk images and drop files into it and then stick them into the floppy emu and the way it works is
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:20.960]   really clever it actually has a little screen and some buttons so when you turn it on you can
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:26.880]   actually use the buttons on the floppy emu to decide which disk image you want it to mount
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:32.640]   and then it mounts that and the mac boots up and and then you've just got a mac so basically it opens
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:38.720]   if you've got a very old mac it opens you don't need to find floppy drives or or how do i get
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:43.520]   something into it right is always the question instead the answer is copy a two and SD card and
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:48.640]   plug it in with the uh with the floppy emu and if you're saying i have an old mac but it's not that
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:54.800]   old there is a project called blue scuzzy that does the same thing with a scuzzy drive where you
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:53:00.400]   stick an SD card in it and then it emulates uh the the scuzzy version but this is the floppy emu
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:07.200]   from the very aptly named big mess oh wires dot com yep big mess oh wires dot com and they'll
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:11.360]   sell you the bare board or they'll sell you a little kit with a little plastic container it's
[01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:16.400]   great it is it is awesome if you've got a very old mac and you are sad because it turns on but
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:22.400]   all you get is the question mark because you know that's uh you don't have any disks for it and you
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:28.880]   lost your disks this is actually my wife's college computer oh wow uh from the late 80s and um this
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:34.720]   is it go boom it's it still works you have the whole thing works great wow so how much is the
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:43.600]   bemo floppy emu deluxe bundle i just want is it 129 or 120 for the if you and that's what i bought
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:48.560]   but you can get the bare board for 99 if you don't want a case and stuff like that but is the where
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:52.560]   is the uh is there a port on the back forgive me for not remembering that you could plug this
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:57.840]   there's a floppy there's a floppy port on the back here is of a lot of early macs and also apple
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:02.400]   twos and in fact this will also work in an apple two plus with an adapter or an apple two e with
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:07.120]   an adapter or on the apple two c although i think there's an adapter if you want to boot from from
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:14.320]   this so a lot of old apple stuff has that apple floppy port on it and this floppy emu will emulate
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:19.920]   any of the malisa too if you've got a lisa you can boot the lisa from this thing wow i wish i had
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:26.080]   a lisa never could afford the lisa that would have been a nice thing to have and kids before you run
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:30.080]   out and spend a hundred twenty nine bucks on this and find your about my wife's old mac plus
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:36.160]   you might want to go to archive.org and just run some of this old software to see do you really
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:40.080]   of course of course you know all this stuff can happen in emulation but i think part of the fun
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:45.120]   of having retro hardware it's a it's a shame if you've gotten old mac yeah you could run an emulation
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:48.880]   but if you've gotten old mac and it's just sitting there i mean there's nothing
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:54.240]   sadder than having an old mac where there's nothing to boot off of and it's just like i know it turns
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:59.600]   on but then what and so this is an answer to that question and after this has been in my garage
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:04.240]   for like 15 20 years um and it's still booted up but there was nothing for it to boot into
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:08.960]   and now it's completely functional again which is pretty awesome and fun well you just made
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:14.880]   Rachel and our chatroom happy she says she has six mac se's all the floppy drives are broken
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:21.200]   she's very excited now she can get them booted up and uh you can make a cluster cluster them together
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:27.440]   and you can run uh dark castle you're playing net trek net trek and eonako pick of the week
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:35.680]   uh mine is a fun one it's a it's an app called airshot and all it does is it will create a a new
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:43.200]   desktop wallpaper based on aerial aerial photography of of your location oh no it actually does a
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:47.280]   a bunch of different things you can either uh always set it to whatever your location is so if
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:51.920]   you've got like a macbook and now you're dallas fort worth as soon as soon as you set up in your
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:57.920]   hotel it'll it'll it'll change to like the the hotel uh at dallas fort worth you can also select
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:03.760]   like random aerial photography or satellite imagery and it's just it's just an interesting little fun
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:08.560]   thing for those few of us that don't have their desktops completely covered by windows at all
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:14.720]   times uh and it's uh it's and it operates through uh it's an app it operates through a uh menu let
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:20.080]   so you can set the preferences set features set exactly what it does how often it will change out
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:25.520]   uh stuff like that a little bit of fun uh and also if you get it but before the end of july this is
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:30.400]   the first anniversary of airshot and so they basically made it free until the end of the
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:35.120]   end of july you can download it and just have this this fun little thing just just download it
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:41.840]   and install it right as you spoke i'm very excited so i could i could uh let me see if i
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:46.720]   where does it where i've opened it let's see where does it go is it a is it a in the menu
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:54.160]   um should be in the it should when you run it it should exist in the menu bar oh it's a menu bar
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:57:02.640]   why do i do that you know uh because it's because making something run as a system extension is now
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:07.840]   way too much trouble in this world and if you make it and or if you want if you want it to behave
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:11.920]   like something that should be in system preface it's way more way too much trouble things worth
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:17.680]   but if you put it in the menu it's it'll give you a similar to this sort of thing yeah there's my
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:23.280]   map so now i right click and i can make it a uh a wall paper oh that's cool and it's free
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:27.840]   and it's free for the for the end of the month after that i think it's it's not expensive i think
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:34.000]   it's a few bucks i i i can't remember uh but yeah it's it's definitely worth it for free for a few
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.880]   bucks it's also a nice little bit of fun like i said i like i like these apps are just a little bit of
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:41.920]   fun it's not gonna it's not gonna solve any problems for you it's not gonna increase your
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:48.240]   productivity but it's going to give you a a a amount of pleasure commensurate with what you paid for it
[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:50.880]   even if you paid like five bucks for it nice
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:59.200]   mr. Alex Lindsey saved the most expensive for last i don't know i don't know it depends on how long
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:04.800]   you keep it um yeah so i i really like listening to the news i don't really like watching the news or
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:10.400]   or reading the news that that much um and uh i was you know i listened to a lot of foreign affairs
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:15.040]   and one of the things that sponsored us for it was news over audio and so i kind of
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:19.520]   died dived into it and it's it's pretty cool if you like listening to the news um it's about eight
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:25.360]   bucks a month i think um you can test it for free so you know you can you can try it and uh and listen
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:31.200]   to it and see if you like it but it's really high quality reads um and it's lots of different articles
[01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:36.320]   wired and economist and you know a lot of you know obviously foreign affairs and other ones and so
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:42.720]   they um it's kind of a wide range of of magazines that you can um that you can listen to um the
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:46.800]   new york times and you know a lot of other ones and so you can listen to those articles while you're
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:53.360]   doing something else and is it uh my strong preference is it a computer or is it uh i have it on my
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:57.360]   phone so i listen to it on my phone and i can make it go faster but i mean it's important who's
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:02.720]   reading is it a human or is it a computer human human to really or really good ai
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:09.040]   so so you know like but it's it sure sounds like a human um and uh you know it's it's and it's good
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:13.440]   it's humans right now with good diction and the reason that i'm touching about that is that
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:18.400]   um a lot of audible things i stop listening to my spouse i hate my schmuths i can't go i can't
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:22.640]   well they're much mouse setup at 1.75x and i can't understand what they're saying
[01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:28.960]   so so like i need i need people to have a certain level of diction so i can read it at speed or
[01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:33.920]   listen to it at speed um and so um so so far i can listen to just about everything here in fact if
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:41.120]   you slow it down to 1x i always find funny audiobooks to be very funny at 1x i'm like wow that is super
[01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:46.800]   painful yeah to to listen to something at 1x is really hard yeah but um and so if someone doesn't
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:53.040]   really have great diction i don't want to i just want to not use it so so far yeah diction is really
[01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:58.640]   important and it's it's actually why i like listening to kindle is because the ai is super sharp
[01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:03.200]   you know um as far as that goes who probably has really good diction is Alex Lord Lindsey
[02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:05.360]   i bet his diction is fair
[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:08.960]   yeah but it is not very good at the arse though you know
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:14.560]   yeah it's a little roller good in his in his cute that he'll be you know he's
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:22.080]   where is this generation's Thatcher coming from but this is what Britain needs from
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:28.800]   that's it Alex Lord Lindsey on be real you'll be working classes of the working classes for
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:34.960]   a reason because they are mental work that unfortunately is the voice you should use the
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:40.640]   Wi-Fi is not working on WGBH in Boston be very appropriate for public radio in Boston in the
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:48.640]   Boston public library Andy and Ico when you give me on next uh mhm mhm Friday at uh 1250s or 1245
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:54.080]   at the Boston public library go to wgph news.org to stream it live or later we also have
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:59.040]   who are also streaming it on youtube so again after shaving comba here and that kind of stuff so
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:05.520]   that's that's always fun hate again that the video keeps chasing me i keep trying to give me
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:11.120]   give me a venue where i don't have to look presentable but no unfortunately i'm now expected to
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:15.680]   look like a human being who takes care of himself and i don't know it's it's a struggle the
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:20.240]   struggle yeah i i have to take i have to take showers on Tuesday mornings now thanks leo
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:26.080]   there you go ha doing what i can for personal hygiene that's uh that's uh mr six colors it's
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:30.640]   gonna be very busy on Thursday make sure you go to six colors charts dot com for all the color
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:39.600]   charts showing you apples q3 2022 six colors dot com of course he podcasts do and thanks to me
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:46.560]   and my hectoring he has added a page six colors dot com slash podcasts list all the podcasts
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:51.360]   yes you you said there was no page that said all the podcasts i was on and so now i i think
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:56.960]   it's like six colors dot com slash podcasts you can go and you can actually see the list of all
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:01.600]   the podcasts that i'm on i bullied him into it well we're glad you're on this podcast anyway
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:07.360]   and thank you for shaving you select that menu and suddenly the fans on your on your macbook air
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:11.920]   starts spinning spinning too much it's a list too many go list a lot of data a lot of data is
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:19.200]   for girls girls croll Alex Lindsey's 090 dot media is his day job but most of the time you'll
[02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:24.720]   find him at office hours dot global uh which we were all commenting on how great it is on the
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:31.280]   cruise uh office hours dot global is kind of just uh your side gig i guess uh what's going on
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:37.440]   finish it by 9 a.m yeah you know then i go back to work it's tested microphones this week we're
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:42.560]   we've been testing my i have i have i have so many i have microphones like all over the place we
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:47.600]   do this i i order i have like six or seven of them and we've been it's really you know it's a really
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:52.320]   fun lab environment because i'm putting them together but there's like seven or eight people
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:56.000]   that are going well what about this and what about that and then there's people online that are
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.040]   watching that are putting going to the the chat and the everything else and pointing out oh but we
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:05.360]   we need to test this and this is the wrong environment or switch over to this and so it's
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:09.680]   it's like a lab and we're just experimenting with this idea right now it's like a lab but it's like
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:15.120]   a whole bunch of people all at one time and and i feel like we're learning a lot more together
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:22.160]   you know do it that way and so um it's what you have a best do you have a favorite um so it you
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:26.480]   know we we've been kind of thinking through some of the requirements of what we need specifically
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:33.680]   so it has to have us be um you know and and and so you're testing for uh zoom and skype and podcast
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:37.680]   yeah we're testing we're testing we're trying like in what we're doing yeah what makes a difference
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:41.920]   there and so so one of the things that you know do i have to have a big dead cat like that
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:47.760]   like a limp wimp the courtney you're supporting by the way you know he that that
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:54.720]   like who's on there he that's he coined a new term of a wind weasel oh that's a good wind weasel yeah
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:59.920]   dead catting you gotta do the wind we so anyway so it's which is very apple apple pro anyway so
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:04.240]   so the um uh so we've been testing testing lots of mics because we're trying to um
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:07.760]   especially for micro crasney show we've been sending mics out like i don't want to have any
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:11.760]   i don't want to listen anybody's yeah and we've been mostly still sending out the mv7 the mv7
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:15.440]   still kind of the leader but it's two and a few dollars and so we've been looking at ones at
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:21.040]   100 and 150 and 200 trying to find something like do we just keep on buying the mv7s or do we do
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:26.080]   something else is the consensus that it's better to buy a mic with its own usb interface or have a
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:32.720]   pro mic with a set set standalone usb well the one that we like right now is is to do both so the
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:39.520]   mv7 has an xlr out and a usb and the nice thing about that is the the sure mv7 i can plug it in
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:45.760]   and it just works if i get a better interface or i want to make it part of a round table or whatever
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:50.480]   i have an xlr output that i know that i can use as well so so there's a couple of in the mv7 the
[02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:54.080]   samsung there's a couple of these other ones that have that have these outputs and so we're
