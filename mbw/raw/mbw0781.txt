[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Andy Renee, Alex.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.200]   They're all here.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.680]   First thing we've got to do is talk about this rumor
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.400]   that the next iPhone is going to use satellites for communication.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.000]   I think we figured out what's really going to happen.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.360]   We'll talk about that.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.760]   The debate over the app store and how poorly it treats developers.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.640]   What do you do?
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.960]   How do you fix it?
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.800]   We've got some solutions there.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.800]   And then we'll talk about something both Andy and I
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.440]   are both excited about and a little worried about.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.440]   Apple just bought a big streaming classical music
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.840]   service.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.240]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.840]   And a lot more on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.680]   Podcasts you love from people you trust.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.840]   This is Twig.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:55.480]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 781, recorded Tuesday, August 31, 2021.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.040]   Reball my plupi.

[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.440]   The show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.440]   Alex Lindsay, aka 24/7, Office Hours is here.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.880]   Oh, and I know that I'm meeting.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.720]   Office Hours is only two hours a day.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.400]   Well, three with the pre-show.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.760]   And then after Hours is the other 21 hours.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.800]   Yeah, sure.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.040]   Whatever you say, buddy.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.440]   I'm just glad you take a couple hours out of every week
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.440]   to join us.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.920]   But Office Hours is not global, in case
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.280]   you want to see the rest of Alex Lindsay's life.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.400]   He streams it.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.920]   Pretty soon it's going to be like Justin TV, right?
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.760]   It's always on.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.880]   You know, the funny thing is that about when I'm not on--
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.080]   obviously, when I'm not here, but most of the time
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.920]   when I'm working, I have it now just turning out of the grid.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.480]   It's well-- I'm not streaming it.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.320]   It's just in Zoom for Accra.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.320]   But it's just plain because people are just
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.920]   discussing technical things.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.120]   You should sell them.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.360]   But you need an Office Hours television set
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.000]   that doesn't do anything but play Office Hours.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.680]   And you can sell it.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.960]   You can hold back many to it.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.880]   Just the Mac mini.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.880]   Exactly.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.640]   There are other things that are coming over.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.640]   You sell them.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.840]   We need to--
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.440]   Raspberry Pi, be enough.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.840]   That's actually what John does, right?
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.320]   John, you stream to it 24/7 at home through a Raspberry Pi.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.600]   Also here, Mr. Andy Inako from WG.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.480]   BH at Boston.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.560]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.080]   Hello.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.200]   I'm almost done with my pitch deck for the Milton Bradley
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.600]   Office Hours board game.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.120]   It's like hours of fun for the entire family.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.200]   Age is 8 to 80.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.120]   And you flip it over, and you can play Mancala.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.120]   So it's perfect.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.120]   It's like everything you need for home.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.520]   We're trying to license the Pop-O-Matic technology
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.080]   because we think that any forward thinking show like this
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.640]   needs to have a Pop-O-Matic or--
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.560]   Absolutely.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.720]   Absolutely.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.040]   Also from Canada and YouTube fame, Renee Ritchie at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.200]   Hello, Renee.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.800]   Hello, Leo.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.840]   I'm doing like three videos in a row about how everyone's
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.040]   wrong about the new iPhone.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.360]   And the nice thing is I can start one and then watch Office
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.880]   Hours and then finish one.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.080]   And I can see Alex just finished cutting the stake
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.880]   by then.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.040]   And then I can do another video.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.080]   He's grilling the stake.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.280]   And it's a wonderful company.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.040]   Everybody's wrong about Office Hours.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.400]   I mean, I know about the iPhone 13.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.480]   That'd be a great video.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.560]   Yes.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.640]   It is the season for the Flood and Mischief.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.320]   By the way, breaking news.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.760]   Windows 11 comes out October 5th.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.560]   Oh wait a minute, wrong show.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.080]   Sorry about that.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.440]   Why not October 11th?
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.360]   Why wouldn't they do October 11th?
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.200]   Why would they do so perfect?
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.680]   What are they such a hurry for?
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.920]   Windows 11.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.480]   Did you see that they're going to require
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.400]   that Windows 11 PCs have cameras?
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.000]   November is a number 11, by the way.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Oh yeah, it could be 11.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   It could be 11.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.520]   It could be 11.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.120]   But then that's in a memorial day.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.360]   So I don't know.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.200]   All right, let's talk about Leo, which
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.000]   is my favorite kind of satellite, low Earth orbit.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.040]   It's our second favorite, Leo.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.800]   After another reason to hate Elon Musk.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.240]   Thank you for ruining our skart dart gazing.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.560]   So this rumor is a cray cray rumor,
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.440]   although Mark Gurman kind of confirmed it
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.960]   and then denied it at the same time this week.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.840]   Apple's iPhone 13, which anybody get an invite yet?
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.120]   No.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.640]   Not yet.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.600]   It's too early.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.840]   If you got a tomorrow that would be for the 8th,
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.080]   I think it's going to be the 12th, right?
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.280]   The second Tuesday in September, right?
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.640]   That are the week after one of those two.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.920]   The 19th, even that late.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.840]   OK.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.360]   And any--
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.960]   Or whatever.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.200]   It's 2020, June, year Leo.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.840]   We have no idea.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.760]   We have no idea.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.320]   What do they do in October last time, right?
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.680]   So it could be the 8th because they
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.080]   don't want to do it the day after Labor Day,
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.040]   or it could be the 14th because that's the following Tuesday.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.400]   Or it could be the 21st because COVID.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.800]   Or what would be a good ship date for the phone
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.520]   and how early would they want to get them out.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.720]   Although I have seen--
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.800]   It's a virtual event.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.600]   Some rumors, some retail leaks that
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.160]   say you'll be able to order on the 17th, which
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.560]   would indicate a 14th event date.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.120]   And the 24th for launch date, which
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.040]   would be 10 days after the event.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.560]   That would all be kind of--
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.280]   So I'm going to put my Bingo marker on 14, and we'll just see.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.400]   But carriers often just put in place holder dates.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.760]   They don't get a date from Apple.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.000]   Apple's very careful not giving those kinds of things
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.560]   to carriers.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.080]   So they just put their best guess in there,
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.760]   and then people see it.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.640]   So they're doing the same thing we're doing.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.080]   But I guess we should talk about a German's article first
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.080]   because he agrees that there probably
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:28.600]   will be this new Qualcomm chip in the new iPhone for this year,
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.200]   which we think will be the iPhone 13.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.320]   I think warming chime made a huge mistake.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.960]   Yeah, warming chime said that it will work on spectrum
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.760]   owned by Global Star.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.440]   Some have said your new iPhone will
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.560]   work with satellite networks just as well as with cellular
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.920]   networks.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.440]   I think he got it out of it.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.960]   German is saying it's going to be for emergencies
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.200]   when you don't have, which would make a lot of sense
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.720]   for Apple to kind of slowly roll this out.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.560]   I think he yada yada a whole paragraph out of his thing
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.720]   because he has this one part that everyone glommed onto that
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.680]   said, "Apple, Qualcomm is working on the N53 band,
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.160]   and they're working with Global Star on this."
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.160]   And then there's a period-- and I see a black cat walk
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.640]   across this whole article.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.520]   And then he says, and this is all satellite technology.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.200]   And Global Star actually does several different things.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.920]   They're a huge company.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.960]   They do hundreds of different things, agriculture.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.240]   But they have a terrestrial technology
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.880]   and a celestial technology.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.520]   The terrestrial technology is band 53,
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.400]   which they managed to get.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.280]   And they have an LTE version and a 5G version.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.320]   And it's often used as a carrier or aggregate signal
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.280]   for 5G in general.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.120]   And there's been rumors for a year now
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.360]   that Apple is going to incorporate that as a way of making
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.000]   their 5G package better.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.720]   And then Global Star also does the satellite stuff
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.240]   that includes the ability to make transponder-like features
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.320]   for emergency messaging and for disaster signaling.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.920]   And yes, it is easy to believe that Qualcomm would
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.600]   do a special version of an N60 modem that preloads band 53
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.320]   for Apple because everyone else is getting it
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.360]   with the X65 modem.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.600]   But that is completely separate from the ability
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.720]   to receive let alone send satellite signals, which
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.240]   is probably two iPhones from now.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.200]   Stock market believed the rumor Global Star
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.800]   stock went up 64% yesterday.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.000]   It'll be here eventually.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.200]   Well, the stock market is always weird because if you're
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.480]   an analyst-- excuse me, if you're working in the stock market,
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.200]   a lot of it is not what reality is,
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.760]   but how are people going to react to panicking
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.280]   about what the reality might be?
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.280]   Exactly.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.640]   So-- and yeah, this is both an interesting rumor
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.600]   and a non-interesting set of analysis
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.760]   by most people that I've seen so far
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.040]   of re-excluded, of course, because the fact
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.560]   that it might have bandwidth that is associated with an LEO
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.000]   satellite does not mean a satellite phone.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.640]   It could mean that this is a-- this is a band that,
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.800]   as Renee said, is very useful for packaging
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.240]   a lot of different wireless services together,
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.320]   a lot of different access together.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.240]   It's possible that it is in preparation for a service
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.240]   that is being planned that has not even been announced yet
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.080]   and might not even be available for the next couple of years.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.080]   But it makes sense to say, well, if we don't want our entire phone
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.080]   lineup to be obsolete the day that we ship it,
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.560]   let's have-- there are a whole bunch of phones
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.600]   that have the ability to receive FM radio signals
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.720]   because that's the chip they bought.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.280]   And they just don't activate it.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.680]   So there's a lot of-- there's a lot of wait and see regarding
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.120]   this.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.560]   Garmin's cold water on this, I think,
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.160]   seems to me to be the accurate take on it.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:41.040]   He said that Apple's plan is initially more limited in scope
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.840]   according to the person--
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.880]   personally talked to it-- with the focus on helping consumers
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.480]   handle crisis scenarios.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.280]   Of course, Apple has no comment.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.920]   The first component, Garmin, says,
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.560]   is dubbed emergency message via satellite.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.240]   Users can text emergency services and contacts
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.520]   over a satellite network where there's no cell signal available.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.120]   We're in the middle of massive fires here in the West.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.600]   Including in Tahoe.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.200]   And of course, that would be hugely valuable.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.760]   It's kind of like those spot watches
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.240]   where you're hiking your way from anything.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.880]   There's a lot of parts of California
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.000]   that if you go up, especially if you're driving up the one,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.440]   that you just don't have any self-service at all.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.040]   Your phone can tell you where you are.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.320]   It just doesn't know where that is.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.080]   And so the thing is that GPS information
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.120]   and being able to send that GPS information back out.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.600]   And we've seen things like this with garments and so on
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.000]   and so forth that you take when you're really in the out
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.800]   and the outer edges of the wilderness
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.440]   where it's constantly being able to update where you're at
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.800]   so that people that you know can find you
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.840]   if you suddenly stop communicating.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.960]   So I think that there's a lot of times
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.520]   when we think about hikers or other folks
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.080]   that have been lost and everyone's looking for them.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.760]   With this kind of service, as long as you keep the battery
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.120]   going, people will know where you're at theoretically.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.600]   So I think GPS information is on the most.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.080]   - Right, exactly.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.520]   It's really, I think Renee, I did see
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.360]   I think one of your videos on this
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.840]   that I really, really liked how succinctly you put it.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.800]   That every phone has a GPS radio in it,
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   but it's easy to receive a satellite signal.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.360]   It is very difficult to transmit a signal back up
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.280]   to a satellite.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.600]   And if you want one of those,
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.480]   you're going to have to be accepted with,
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.320]   "Hey, why do I have this big rubber thumb
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.920]   stuck to the top of my beautiful elegant iPhone Pro?"
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.800]   Well, that's because you wanted a phone
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.520]   that could talk to a satellite even in emergency services.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.240]   So this is why I'm really, really not putting any bets
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.560]   on the table for this one,
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.320]   because the antenna problem is so difficult to solve.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.320]   Even if you choose a very, very narrow set of features
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.960]   for any kind of a satellite service to be providing,
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.880]   that, I mean, you could think of,
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.760]   well, maybe it's there so that if you want to stick this
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.400]   into a sled that provides a better external antenna,
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.520]   then it could actually activate that way
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.640]   and be a very, very inexpensive add-on device.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.880]   But then you would say the people that would actually use
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.160]   this sort of stuff, why not put all the electronics
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.640]   into that sled and just use the iPhone as a UI?
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.280]   Or why not buy a bespoke device that is designed specifically
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.080]   for emergency services like that?
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.600]   So it's very, very hard to predict what this kind
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.280]   of technology could practically be used for
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.560]   without a massive redesign of what we expect
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.400]   an iPhone to look like.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.400]   - Thanks to Scooter X in our chat room.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.040]   Here's a list from REI, the camping store of the different
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.800]   kinds of kind of emergency locators.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.680]   There's PLBs, which are personal locator beacons.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.080]   They're not for texting.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.120]   They just send a signal along with your location saying,
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.240]   I'm in trouble, you can't send text,
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.600]   you can't do anything like that.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.200]   That, by the way, look at the size of these.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.080]   I mean, it clearly doesn't need to be some fancy-dan thing.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.720]   When you get to the satellite messenger,
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.280]   so you see those antennas?
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.840]   - Like a Treos ix-80.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.440]   - Yeah, there be clunky things.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.160]   These allow you two-way texting, same idea.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.960]   So, German's rumor is oddly concrete.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.640]   He says, the feature will be integrated into the messages
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.360]   app as a third protocol alongside SMS and iMessage
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.920]   and appear with gray message bubbles instead of green or blue.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.600]   The second feature will be a tool to report major emergencies
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.880]   such as plane crashes, sinking ships.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.040]   I hope I don't ever have to use this.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.800]   - So you can see the emergency I'm using.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.640]   - Oh, I missed that message.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.480]   It was gray. - It was gray.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.560]   - It was interfaced gray like Alex's walls.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.440]   Can you just make it red?
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.960]   - The texting via satellite tool is code named Stewie
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.800]   inside Apple.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.240]   Again, oddly specific.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.080]   - Yeah.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.440]   - Yes, I've been whipped.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.920]   - We'll restrict messages to a shorter length of texts.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.040]   We'll automatically push through to an emergency contact's phone,
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.080]   even if the do not disturb setting is on one.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.680]   The planned design will let a user send the message
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.040]   by typing emergency SOS where they would usually
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.400]   input a contact name.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.920]   That seems like an awful lot to type in an emergency.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.520]   Now, he also points out.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.840]   - I'm scooter.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.080]   - Yeah, scooter X emergency.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.920]   - Yeah.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.920]   - He also says, and the most important thing is
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.080]   these are things Apple is looking at,
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.280]   but unclear whether they would ship it.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.560]   - I think Ko just conflated band 53,
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.280]   which is something that they could ship today
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.600]   with the satellite messaging,
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.080]   which is something that's gonna take years.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.920]   And they both happen to work with Global Star.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.400]   So it's understandable but not forgivable
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.240]   that we conflate those things.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.560]   - Yeah.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.760]   It is the case that Global Star said
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.160]   it had signed an agreement with an unidentified party
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.400]   to develop a new service.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.160]   So that's why people in the stock market are going over.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.360]   - And they have a press release out
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.280]   saying that Qualcomm is integrating them
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.760]   into the X65 modem for a band 53.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.920]   And so again, it's easy to think they'll put them in X65.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.720]   - And it also, we should also point out
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.680]   that this makes Qualcomm look very, very good at a time
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.680]   when both, when a lot of major manufacturers
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.160]   are very much eyeing developing their own modem chips
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.440]   and not becoming dependent on Qualcomm at all.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:12.280]   So any piece of, any leak that happens to get out of Qualcomm
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.160]   say, oh, well gosh, we hope that people don't find out
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.120]   that we're providing fundamental technology
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.400]   that Apple is thinking about putting it
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.040]   to every single iPhone ever for the next two or three years
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.840]   because they would send our stock price shooting up high,
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.080]   high, and we wouldn't want that to happen, would we?
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.040]   - The most important paragraph, of course,
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.040]   in German's piece says, and though the next iPhone could
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.200]   have the hardware needed for satellite communications,
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.840]   the features are unlikely to be ready before next year
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.480]   said another person, who has not to be identified
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.040]   because the plans aren't yet public.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.520]   The features could also change or be scrapped
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.320]   before they're released.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.280]   - Mark's actually got that, I think he's got that attached
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.440]   to a single keystroke on his computer now.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.440]   - He's like Bloomberg to me.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.200]   Like you can always tell in the article what Mark wrote
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.200]   and what Bloomberg wrote.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.760]   - But it is always the case that what you hear
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.040]   is what Apple's thinking about,
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.920]   but not necessarily what Apple's gonna release.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.240]   - And Apple, and it's also late.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.560]   Like Apple's decided this stuff, like they plan
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.640]   their phones two years out.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.600]   It's like the rumors surfaced like six months later,
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.440]   like echoes of decisions Apple has already made sometimes.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.520]   - Well, they've already put hardware,
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.440]   they often have put hardware in place
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.760]   that the software can't support or even looks at yet.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.240]   They can utilize it later.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.880]   So it can be something like that.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.000]   - Oh, you went for a long time.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.880]   - They didn't use UWB initially.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:31.960]   - Yeah.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.960]   - Right, yeah.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.960]   So Renee, what's your take?
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.520]   Will we see this in two weeks?
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.480]   Will they be talking about it or will there be no,
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.040]   not a word? - I think we'll,
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.200]   I don't think Apple will talk about it
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.800]   because it's internal technology.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.200]   And I think like again, they're gonna use,
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.280]   there was an old Reddit post from like again,
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.800]   a year ago that said Apple's gonna use BAN 53
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.760]   as a aggregation point for the rest of their RF spectrum.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.600]   And that kind of stuff is utterly believable to me,
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.440]   but nobody cares.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.480]   Like most people don't care about how the radio
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.360]   in their phone works.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.520]   It just doesn't work better.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.680]   Yes, great.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.840]   I'm not dropping as many calls.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.120]   So that part of the thing makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.760]   And that can be a whole global start deal
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.520]   on one side of it with Qualcomm.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.600]   And then the rest of it,
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.160]   Apple's been building out these features
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.800]   like from Apple Watch through health to the iPhone,
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.960]   like the gate measurement they're doing now.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.400]   That was Apple Watch exclusive now.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.560]   It's an iPhone feature.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.400]   Apple Watch has great emergency features,
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.840]   but they're balanced to cellular.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.800]   If the iPhone can do that even one better,
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.680]   that makes total sense as a continued growth
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.400]   of Apple's emergency contacting features.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.480]   - So the highfalutin notion that I had that Apple
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.560]   might want to avoid carriers entirely
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.120]   go straight to satellite.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.440]   That's probably not gonna happen.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.280]   - No, no, no.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.680]   - Well, there's a rumor they're making their own satellites too.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.920]   Like that was rumored two years ago.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.440]   They have a whole team working on satellites
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.920]   the way that Elon Musk does and China's satellite does.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.720]   - Hey, if you wanna own the whole stack,
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.000]   you would love to get rid of these carriers who are--
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.800]   - We don't need usable sky, do we?
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   (laughing)
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.280]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.000]   You have issues around latency
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.840]   that are still gonna come up with satellite.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.560]   So it's not, it's good for,
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.280]   some like text is a great example.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.680]   - But for phone calls, not.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.800]   - Phone call, you'll notice it.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.000]   Anybody who communicated with space,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.440]   you have a, it takes a little while to get there.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.160]   Even on low light, even on, even Musk's solution
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.880]   is still higher latency than what we're used to.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.720]   - Right.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.960]   - Yeah, so that's the, that's still gonna be a challenge.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.880]   And you know, so I think that it,
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.480]   I think that Apple, it's just a really sticky,
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.040]   taking care of people's cell connections
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.840]   and all that they'd have to just buy somebody to do that.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.040]   - That'd be a better way to do it.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.640]   - Buy global star.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.960]   Buy star-lens.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.160]   - I mean, they have to buy, I mean like--
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.280]   - No, buy T-Mobile.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.120]   - Buy AT&T.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:41.960]   - Buy T-Mobile.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.800]   - Buy T-Mobile.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.680]   - So that only solves it for one country.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.800]   Like they'd have to buy a carrier and your manager.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.000]   - Oh God, that's right.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.920]   - Oh, what a nightmare.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.000]   - That's why, and in a lot of ways,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.560]   I mean, I use, I probably half the time,
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.640]   for some reason my cell coverage is not very good
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.800]   with anything in my house.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.040]   And you know, it's just always a problem.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.200]   And so I'm using Apple, you know,
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.440]   I just hold down on the audio button,
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.360]   like to call someone,
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.520]   I just hold down and go down to Apple faith.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.240]   I'm audio all the time.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.400]   Like just, I just talk to people all the time.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.760]   'Cause the quality, the other thing is,
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.280]   well your carrier probably has wifi calling too, right?
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.520]   I mean, that would be--
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.520]   - The wifi calling on a carrier is really unstable.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.600]   - Oh really?
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.040]   - Yeah, so it's really hard to,
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.600]   the wifi call-- - Which carrier are you?
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.720]   - AT&T Verizon, both of them have been problematic.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.600]   And so, you know, where they're,
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.600]   it's much more stable to you,
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.880]   if someone has a phone, as an iPhone,
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.560]   it's much more stable to just use FaceTime audio.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.520]   And all you have to do now, they've made it,
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.680]   I feel like Apple is kind of sneaking up on this problem
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.920]   because they made it so easy,
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.080]   'cause you just literally push--
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.600]   - Why not you be internet, yeah.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.600]   - You push down on the call--
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.680]   - It's a solid one out.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.080]   - And it just says mobile or FaceTime audio,
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.840]   and you hit FaceTime audio and you call that person,
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.680]   it's time audio.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.520]   - Do they have to have an iPhone?
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.560]   Can you call FaceTime audio to a phone?
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.600]   No, they have to have an iPhone.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.960]   - Yeah, so you go--
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.840]   - Well, with the browser with iOS 15,
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.680]   you'll be able to answer in a browser on Android or Windows.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.580]   - So see those damn green bubble people.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.080]   - I don't ruin it for all of us.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.760]   - People just don't fall in blocks.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.600]   - Don't smoke.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.120]   - Is there a presentation slide somewhere inside out
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.080]   where they take the hears to the crazy people's page
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.080]   and they say, "If only we could get all of these crazy people
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.120]   to switch to iPhone and just accept that we are the one
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.640]   choice for everybody and not have any choice
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.080]   or any flexibility, these damn crazy people
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.320]   are screwing it up for everybody."
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.400]   - I'll have a review.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.720]   - It made no sense also like--
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.560]   - Go ahead.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.720]   - Steve said they were gonna make it open source
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.280]   and then they started getting sued.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.360]   - Yeah, right.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.120]   - They are still being sued--
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.320]   - Over FaceTime. - Over FaceTime, yeah.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.800]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.960]   I'll have a review tomorrow on Hands-on Technology
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.560]   of the Samsung Flip 3.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.560]   I would love to move to this and a Samsung watch
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.840]   and it's so, so close, but it's that green bubble problem.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.440]   Really, that is actually a show stopper for people.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.200]   - Well, that should be offensive to everybody.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.960]   That if you are choosing what piece of hardware
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.600]   that you're gonna run basic exclusively on,
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.840]   there is a messaging system that Apple refuses
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.160]   to make compatible with a competing platform
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.560]   with internal documents proving that the reason why
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.520]   they are not making an Android version of it
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.800]   is because they don't wanna create a marketing opportunity
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.320]   for less expensive Android phones.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.280]   That should be just so offensive to you bodily
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.760]   that you're gonna say screw you.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.600]   I'll buy three Samsungs on that.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.000]   - We're so used to that, Andy, though,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.160]   that's the tech industry.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.640]   I mean, honestly, that's why people use Windows.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.960]   That's why people use Macs.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.160]   I mean, it's why most of the world is on WhatsApp anyway.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.600]   - Yeah, and really, that's the nature
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.400]   of the tech industry is lock in.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.680]   - I agree, it's offensive.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.920]   Everything that we do is a compromise.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:50.680]   Where we live, the state, it's not like California
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.600]   is the best state in the best state ever.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.880]   It's just the state we live in.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.840]   And we've decided that--
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.760]   - Oh, I disagree.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.840]   It's the best state ever, you and me.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.840]   We live in-- - I actually
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.680]   are new England earlier.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.240]   (laughing)
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.000]   - California is the best state ever because
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:03.840]   it's the state you might have.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.240]   - I bet you order red chowder in a restaurant.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.640]   (laughing)
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.000]   No, I have a gun over to the Manhattan clam chatter side.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.840]   I have to admit, I'm still in the
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.680]   England clam chatter.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.680]   - I need to go.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.760]   - No, it's all about Manhattan.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.960]   - I'm sitting with, oh, Dr., we took
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.040]   a doctor and his 14-year-old daughter out
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.640]   to dinner last night, and she said,
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.440]   "You're not from around here, are you?"
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.720]   (laughing)
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.560]   I said, "What do you mean?"
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.440]   She said, "You have an accent."
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.000]   I said, "I do not have an accent."
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.440]   She said, "You do."
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.680]   And she said, "Where are you from?"
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.520]   I said, "Red Island."
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.880]   She said, "Yeah, I hear it."
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.440]   - So maybe it is, you can take the
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.720]   - They're making a red island.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.560]   - When they say they're--
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.000]   - Oh, Dr. Potter had a roast you.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:39.840]   (laughing)
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.680]   - Yeah, no kidding.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.600]   (laughing)
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.520]   - Yeah, but you know, so all of these things are,
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.280]   you know, the thing is, is that everything we buy
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.600]   is a compromise, and we decide that we don't like--
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.880]   - If you choose your compromises.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.520]   - I have to admit, again, and I'll always be
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.560]   on the other side of it, I want Apple to be able
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.800]   to continue to innovate, so standardization means
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.000]   that they'll slow down.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.720]   You know, like I just want them, and the reason you,
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.440]   you know, part of the reason is that, is the,
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.240]   is the keep people locked in, but the other thing is,
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.040]   is that there'll be a whole bunch of things.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.320]   As soon as you start making it available,
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.680]   like for instance, right now I can text USDC files
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.840]   to people, and they can open them over the blue bubble.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.360]   But if they started standardizing all of this,
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.200]   it would become this thing.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.040]   - Oh, this doesn't work, and this does work.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.440]   And Apple can keep on playing with it.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.640]   - That's why we have you on.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.560]   I think this panel is very balanced,
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.520]   and he's on the opposite side of this spectrum.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.360]   Renee, I don't know.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.280]   - Yeah, freedom.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.200]   Freedom, Andy and I--
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.040]   - No, I'm in the middle.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.040]   - I'm deeply focused on this because--
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.760]   - There's some blue face paint I need to go get.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.080]   You go to the swatch on my face.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.360]   - Like when you look at it from a purely consumer perspective,
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.880]   like fragmentation, competition is great,
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.560]   fragmentation is bad, and those things are always in balance.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.320]   It's like security and convenience.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.440]   Like there's no perfect solution,
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.400]   or we'd all just be doing that.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.320]   Everything is absolutely a trade-off,
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.680]   and you've got a, my problem is that so many people
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.560]   in the media aren't like us, and they're just,
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.960]   they want the sound bite, they want the 10 word answer.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.800]   - That's really true.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.640]   - They don't care at all about the nuance,
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.400]   the subtle key of the damage that some of this stuff causes.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.080]   It's just how do I get famous off
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.760]   being really angry about this?
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.600]   - Yeah, we really--
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.200]   - I love the fact that we can have these conversations.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.520]   - Almost to a fault.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.000]   We really chew on it and try to figure out.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.800]   And I'm sure that's why people listen to us,
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.000]   'cause if you wanted to, you know, people always say,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.520]   oh, you're not sufficiently worshipful of Apple,
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.160]   they don't say it that way, but.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.200]   And I said, well, if you want that,
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.760]   there are plenty of places you can go
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.720]   to get worshipful of Apple coverage.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.280]   What we're trying to do--
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.120]   - Yeah, we're trying to represent the end user
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.840]   in the world of technology.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.960]   And I think, I'll be honest, Alex,
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.240]   your position is completely legit.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.080]   There are definitely benefits to lock in
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.080]   and to the walled garden, there's no question.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.160]   - Oh, and to the--
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.960]   - To the last majority of business.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.320]   - Yeah, like when we say vast majority of 99.99%,
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.400]   we're probably very happy with it.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.680]   And again, the other thing is they bought into it,
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.960]   so that we bought into a lifestyle.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.120]   - Well, let's see, I'd argue with you that.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.000]   I mean, I use it, but I use it kind of unhappy.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.240]   And as I said, if I wanted to try to switch to Android,
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.800]   it's those little lock in things that really get you
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   and it makes it hard.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.640]   And there's no--
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.480]   - There's no-- - There's no
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.160]   - Like, Google has folks really highly, oh, that's a lock in.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.960]   - There's no equivalent Android ecosystem.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.800]   You know, the Windows Android,
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.720]   the Windows Samsung, your phone thing is god awful.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.360]   It's not, it's terrible.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.360]   And so there isn't any really alternative--
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.200]   - It is awful.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.840]   - And the thing is that's why you're saying--
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.000]   - It's not awful because it's all about it.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.840]   - Yeah, like part of what allows Apple to do what it does
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.560]   is that it doesn't have to deal with a bunch of--
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.080]   - Here's my argument against it,
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.240]   'cause I was asked this when I was talking to Philip Elmer
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.800]   to what's Apple investors.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.960]   It's a monoculture.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.560]   And a monoculture is in the long run bad for everybody
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.760]   because it's one way, my way or the highway.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.040]   And it isn't good for overall for innovation
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.400]   and pre-keeping prices low and a bunch of other things.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.200]   - All the good news is, is that it's still less than
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.800]   50% of the world's usage.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.360]   So it is in a monoculture,
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.200]   'cause there's a whole other world out there.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.240]   - But those of you who live in the Apple culture,
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.680]   you are in the monoculture.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.520]   You know, that's the thing.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.120]   You're voluntarily, you are happy in the monoculture, Alex.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.400]   Just as most people are happy eating the same banana,
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.840]   but in the long run.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.760]   - We're going to McDonald's.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.680]   - We're gonna have problems because, yeah,
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.600]   we're going to McDonald's, but you know,
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.400]   we're gonna have problems because of the monoculture.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.880]   - I think, but the thing is that trying to fix a problem
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.320]   before it's a problem, it just creates more problems.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.280]   Like, you know, the thing is, is that it's just gonna be,
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.280]   you know, you're right,
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.120]   we're gonna make sure we have to do the same thing.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.440]   - Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.280]   it's gonna be a problem.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.120]   - Sometimes it's gonna be a problem.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:32.960]   - Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.800]   - And when it's a problem.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.640]   - Yeah.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.480]   - You know, we can talk about it,
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.320]   but for now, for most users,
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.120]   and when I say most users, probably 99.99%,
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.280]   it is, it's great.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.120]   (laughs)
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.400]   It's working great, and we don't need to,
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.720]   we don't need to start tweaking it
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.240]   while it's still working.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.320]   You know, like, you know, and I think that we get into this,
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.880]   I mean, we have just turned into a crazy nanny state
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.720]   where we're like, okay, we're gonna have
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.280]   the government fix everything for us.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.480]   - You just let the government do that.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.760]   - Yeah, I'll argue against that
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.560]   because the government is society,
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.560]   and society needs to express its desires.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.840]   These companies are expressing their, you know,
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.160]   heartfelt wish to make the most amount of money possible
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.520]   for their stakeholders.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.840]   It is responsible of, it is a responsibility of society,
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.840]   and it acts through government to say,
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.400]   "Yeah, fine for your shareholders,
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.960]   "but there's a greater need, there's a greater good."
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.400]   So I completely disagree with you,
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.800]   you've really gone right wing on us,
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.800]   and I completely disagree with you.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.120]   You're wrong.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.560]   We are the government.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.160]   - But the thing is, is that,
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.880]   what we're talking about though,
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.640]   is we're talking about protecting rich companies
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.200]   that wanna break into this market,
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.240]   and make this work, we're not talking about the average user,
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.560]   'cause the average user is benefiting from the way it is.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.000]   You know, and so the thing is,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.880]   is that I think that the users have a right as well,
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.000]   to say, "I don't wanna--"
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:47.840]   - I agree.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:48.680]   - You know, I want it to be--
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.840]   - There are multiple stakeholders.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.600]   But don't, but don't let the government--
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.440]   - I know, but the stakeholder that matters.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.600]   - That's an important stakeholder.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.440]   - No, that's not true.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.520]   - The stakeholder that matters is a part of the spot into it.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.320]   - We as a society matter.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.040]   And we've gone too far in this individualistic thing,
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.640]   and you could see with COVID-19,
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.400]   this whole BS individualistic thing,
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.200]   there is a reason for society
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.200]   who expresses its overarching interests.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.320]   And Apple's gonna, by the way,
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.240]   Apple's gonna face it.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.440]   In fact, our next story, we're gonna take a break,
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.480]   but our next story will be very much about Apple.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.200]   The dominoes are starting to fall,
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.120]   and they're falling first in South Korea.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.120]   Yep, yep.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:21.960]   - But yeah.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.520]   - But first, I'll end this
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.040]   'cause nobody wants to hear a political discussion.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:26.880]   Alex.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.720]   (laughing)
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.800]   - I respect your point of view, absolutely.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.640]   Who fits?
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.840]   - Alex, expect a FaceTime call from me
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.440]   exactly 30 seconds after we gotta go off there.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.200]   (laughing)
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.880]   No, I love you, Alex, and I--
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.960]   - It's been a clean bubble, Andy.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.360]   - I really appreciate that point of view.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.560]   I just wanna make sure that the other point of view is heard.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.360]   - My point of view is not a general,
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.880]   general of how the government should work.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.080]   It's specific that--
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.920]   - To technology.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.560]   - In most things, no, not in all technology.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.760]   But I'm very protective of this one space
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.720]   because it is a huge part of my life.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.560]   - Yeah.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.680]   - And if so, if the government goes in there
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.600]   and tweaks it, and the thing is,
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.200]   is that these people that run our government,
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.040]   they're idiots.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.440]   And so the thing is, is that they have--
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.040]   - Well, you should elect their idiots then.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.800]   You need to elect their idiots.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.880]   - So the thing is, is that--
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.880]   - Yeah.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.200]   - Well, the thing is, is that, so that when it comes
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.440]   to technology, they have no idea what they're talking about.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.560]   And so what's gonna happen is, is we have a bunch,
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.160]   it's like having a, we're gonna have a bunch of cooks
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.960]   go in there that have never actually cooked anything.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.120]   You know, and they're gonna start chopping stuff up
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.760]   and feeding us food that, you know,
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.960]   I was like, well, the cooks that were there were just fine.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.800]   I don't need it.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.320]   And I think, I still think that individually,
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.640]   I mean, as a group of people who bought into something,
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.240]   that we have a right as users to not have them
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.400]   mess it all up.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.440]   You know, like, you know, and it's,
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.040]   and they, you know, we can talk about the esoteric reasons
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.160]   why we're gonna ruin everything for everyone,
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.240]   but that's what we're gonna do.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.080]   You know, like we're gonna--
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.240]   - Yeah, Larry Page wanted that too.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.120]   Larry Page wanted that.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.240]   He went on at a Google I/O and said,
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.120]   you know, we just need a Google Island,
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.880]   because this government interference with us
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.840]   is really getting to be a pain in the butt.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.680]   Just let us do our thing in our little corner of the world.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.320]   You know, I don't know if that's,
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.080]   you live in the world though.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:05.920]   I mean, it's in the world.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.600]   - When Apple has, again, we have a lot of laws
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.880]   out there already, and when we reach,
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.360]   when Apple has a control interest over the market,
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.360]   that's a whole different thing.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.360]   If Apple was at 80% of the market,
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.680]   and they don't have the right to say,
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.640]   you can't break us up or you can't do anything else,
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.040]   when they have less than 50% of the global market,
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.080]   and about 50% of the American market,
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.600]   that's not a controlling interest of it.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.800]   They're not a monopoly, you know, and so--
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.080]   - No, come on.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.520]   (laughing)
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.720]   - They're not a monopoly until--
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.680]   - No, no, no, you don't have that.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.960]   - You're, okay, under the standards we've used
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.120]   for the last, what, 60, 70 years?
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.560]   They're not a monopoly.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.000]   You know, like it's not.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.960]   So, I mean, you know, under those standards.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.360]   So you have to make up some new stuff,
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.240]   and they'll make up new stuff,
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.120]   that'll just break stuff, and they'll just make it,
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:51.960]   it'll be a pain.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.800]   And then, you know, people like me will go on Twitter
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.840]   and remind everyone who to get rid of, you know,
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.480]   like, you know, it's like, here's how you vote people out,
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.880]   because as soon as the problem that the politicians have,
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.400]   that they're coming up, is that iPhone users
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.920]   don't care right now, but if you,
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.560]   if you break it all, they will.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.520]   And then, you can focus a lot of energy
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.640]   on the politicians.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.880]   And so, that's what usually happens,
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.880]   is when things get taken away and things aren't working,
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.720]   then you end up with a lot of people that are angry,
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.480]   especially when there's other people reminding them
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.080]   of why it's broken.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.920]   - Again, so that's-- - So, that's--
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.960]   - So, that takes 45 minutes of impassioned rebuttal as red.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.440]   I just, I won't, again, I will, I will put on,
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.000]   I will put on my shot clock for this,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.920]   just simply saying that, I just think
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.600]   that your thinking is fundamentally flawed.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.480]   - I've been shaking my head all throughout
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.000]   most of what you've been saying.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   We could not be more opposed in our points of view.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.040]   And with our understanding of reality
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:52.440]   and our philosophy on this topic.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.360]   - Sure, thank you.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.920]   - So, and let's take a break.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.720]   Well said, both of you.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.400]   So, we're gonna take a break now.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.240]   Stop.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.240]   (laughing)
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.800]   - Yeah, exactly, that's why I didn't get to detail.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.240]   You could face time after this shot.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.080]   No, I think this is a conversation that's going on
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.120]   all over the country.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.240]   In fact, to some degree all over the world right now.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.440]   And it's not just about Apple,
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.840]   it's about a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.680]   And it's a fundamentally important conversation.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.920]   And we all have strong feelings about it.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.120]   Our show today brought to you by AT&T active armor.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.520]   I have been remiss, I should have mentioned AT&T as a sponsor.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.800]   We love having them as a sponsor.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.600]   And I have to say, I have,
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.160]   you know, I have phones with every carrier.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.800]   I use my AT&T phone primarily
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:41.120]   because I don't wanna get bugged by fraudulent phone calls.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.600]   When you're on your phone these days,
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.120]   it's not just for phone calls,
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.280]   whether it's live streaming content or,
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:51.280]   you know, we do a regular family video call every Thursday.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.400]   Of course, watching your favorite podcast,
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.000]   I know for a lot of you,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.520]   there is no room for fraudulent calls.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.480]   In fact, it got to the point,
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.720]   it got so bad that I would just stop answering the phone.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.480]   Well, thank goodness AT&T has done something about it.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.320]   They make customer security a priority,
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.720]   helping block those pesky calls.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.800]   It's not complicated, it's AT&T active armor,
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.800]   24/7 proactive network security
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.680]   and fraud call blocking to help stop the threats
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.760]   at no extra charge compatible device.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:26.760]   And service required, visit att.com/activearmour
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.720]   for details when we thank AT&T.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.960]   For helping keep Mac break weekly,
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.800]   live and on the air.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.040]   You know who else we think?
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.560]   All of our club twit members,
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.720]   thank you club twit members.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.920]   We're working on some interesting ideas.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.920]   I'm getting a foolishly ordered, it's from Canada,
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.120]   so I blame you Renee.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:49.960]   What?
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.840]   There's a mouse out there that is a open,
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.080]   speaking of open and closed systems, it's an open mouse.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.680]   I think you mean moose, service.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.760]   (laughing)
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.880]   You call it a moose.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.400]   The drivers are open, the board is open, everything is open.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.240]   You can assemble it yourself or you could buy a preassembled.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.400]   And I thought I am gonna buy,
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.600]   'cause a right to repair.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.440]   Is it Duplo?
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.360]   Is it Duplo?
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.360]   It looks like Duplo.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.360]   Or Lego?
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.400]   It's got a funny name like that, actually.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.560]   It's Boogaloo or something, I can't remember the name.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.040]   But I'll find it before the end of the show.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.960]   But I foolishly ordered it unassembled.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.320]   So I think for club twit we're gonna have,
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.680]   I'm gonna take a page from you, Office Hours, Alex,
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:30.880]   'cause I love this idea.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.080]   Alex has really invented a new medium
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.880]   where you have one person kind of hosting,
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:39.360]   but other people watching and talking and kibbutzing
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.200]   as he does it.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.840]   And my soldering skills are so pathetic.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.920]   And there is soldering involved in the assembly of this mouse.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.000]   So I thought it'd be kind of interesting
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.280]   to do this in the club with your help.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.680]   So we'll announce that when that--
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.120]   - It's patent unencumbered soldering,
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:01.120]   but it's patent, it's Libre open source soldering.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.600]   So I thought I'd take a page from Office Hours,
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.000]   we'll play with it in the club twit.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.480]   We're also doing a club twit a little different
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.760]   for our shows from now on.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.440]   And this was pioneered by Micah Sargent
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.000]   and Rosemary Orchard on iOS today.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.920]   They started streaming their show in the video room
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.360]   on Discord.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.400]   And so you can join us in there and watch the video.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.800]   Now you're getting video of the video
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.560]   being watched by the video, which is very confusing.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.120]   But you can watch the video in real time
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.920]   and we can take questions there as well.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.240]   The only reason we didn't do that earlier
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.240]   is because unlike a stage in Discord,
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.720]   the video rooms are limited to 25 people.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.800]   But I think that's, we'll see how that works out.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.040]   If you're interested in club twit,
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.240]   the real benefit a lot of people say
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.720]   is the ad free versions of all of our shows.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.440]   You can get that audio and video.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.720]   You can also get access to this fabulous Discord
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.720]   where there's great chat going on in 24/7
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.480]   on all sorts of topics.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.480]   Well, look, yeah, some reason I'm getting picture in picture.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.320]   That's very interesting.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.160]   (laughs)
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.840]   I don't know what, that's, I guess, a Discord feature.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.960]   That's kind of cool.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.200]   And you also get access to the Twit Plus feed.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   In fact, that's what we'll put the mouse assembly.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.240]   I'm also getting this new framework laptop
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.840]   that's got a right to repair laptop.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.240]   I'm gonna assemble that on the Discord feed.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.160]   And we'll also put that in the Twit Plus feed.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.600]   All of this, seven bucks a month,
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.800]   it helps us dramatically make a,
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.200]   keep this network on the air
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.920]   and make the shows that you like.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.240]   So if you'd like to join, just a little plug
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.520]   for club twit at twit.tv/clubtwit.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:42.360]   Thank you so much to all of our club twit members.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.200]   We really appreciate it.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:49.040]   So the shoe has dropped in South Korea.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.840]   I suspect this is just the beginning.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:56.520]   The National Assembly now has passed the App Store law.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.600]   It is expected the president will sign it
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.000]   because his party was very much in favor of this,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.440]   forcing Google and Apple to allow third party in app payments.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.400]   It doesn't mean additional app stores,
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.280]   but it does mean you don't have to take Apple Pay
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.480]   or Google Pay for payments
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.720]   that you could have a third party payment,
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.280]   which most importantly for the developers means
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.680]   you don't have to pay 30% big.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.520]   That part's not known because Apple,
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.760]   at least Apple has said that they will just send you a bill
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.600]   for the third party.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.240]   Oh, you're kidding.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.800]   No, Tim Cook during his testimony said,
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.080]   well, it's gonna be really complicated
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.480]   to collect our commission
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.960]   if we're not handling the process payments,
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.400]   but we'll figure it out.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.000]   Plupi, that's the name of it, Plupi the Trapper.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.920]   So their position is okay, you can say that,
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.600]   but we're gonna charge you anyway.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.200]   I don't think that's the spirit of the South Korean law.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.040]   We'll see.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.920]   No, not at all, but I don't think executives thought
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.000]   that the commission was tied to the payment processing.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.600]   That was just a convenience you got for you.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.520]   It is, isn't that interesting?
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.960]   If you wanna be in the app store,
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.040]   you still have to pay 30% of your revenue.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.880]   It's just, you know, the state of California does that.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.880]   When you buy online, back when Amazon didn't charge sales tax,
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.880]   the state of California's position was you still owe it.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.840]   So just say it, when you fill out your income tax every year,
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.440]   just tell us how much you bought and give us a slot.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.440]   Well, our form, I don't know about yours,
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.320]   but our form has a slot for illegal income.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.800]   It's like, so you just put it in the car at the time,
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.080]   if you got illegal income,
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.600]   you're still supposed to fill that in.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.000]   (laughing)
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.840]   No, no, it's a gorgeous solution to the problem.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.520]   Saying that if they get you for nothing else,
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.480]   they say, well, you were supposed to report it,
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.240]   you failed to report it, therefore,
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.200]   we can at least put you in jail for two years
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.600]   while we figure out what to put you in jail for for 30 years.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.400]   So, but yeah, but this actually, my understanding is that
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.440]   there's a second component to it
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.200]   that also prohibits Apple and Google
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.200]   from forcing an app developer to use those two app stores
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:59.160]   exclusively and to not list their apps
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.960]   in alternative app stores.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.800]   Wow.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.120]   They can't take too long to approve an app
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.600]   and they can't reject it out of hand either,
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:07.920]   I think is part of it.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.960]   So, the interesting thing, we mentioned this last time,
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.320]   that they passed it, will the White House,
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.880]   which is also kind of on the one hand,
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.480]   trying to get Apple to do something through the FTC,
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:24.480]   now stand up because this is South Korea imposing its trade
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.160]   rules on American companies.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.640]   It's an attack on American companies.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.400]   Well, they stand up for American companies,
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.920]   this is very challenging.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.760]   So far the government--
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.920]   It's gonna bring us all together, Leo.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.440]   (laughing)
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.360]   The government hasn't officially gotten involved,
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.760]   although the trade group that Apple and Google are members
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.520]   of have been pressuring them on the census,
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.960]   well, there has to be a violation of a trade agreement.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.720]   You have to, this is part of your portfolio
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.680]   to attack this, to protect us,
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.680]   against this sort of legislation.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.360]   But I don't believe that the Biden administration
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.280]   has officially taken a point of view on this yet,
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.240]   which is in itself quite telling.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.280]   I mean, the number, the personnel that they have been
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:08.280]   putting into high impact places, like particularly at the FTC,
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.840]   is very, very telling that they are not going to get
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.920]   as much love from, not gonna any love at all
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.920]   from any department in the Biden administration
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.240]   if they can possibly help it.
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:24.240]   I mean, we have a 32 year old, no, 32 year old expert
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:29.920]   at antitrust expert as at basically poking holes
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.960]   in the dominance of tech companies,
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.720]   so severely that Amazon has said that,
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.480]   okay, well, you can't let her prosecute us
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.360]   'cause she was mean to us in the past
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.240]   before she was ahead of the FTC.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.640]   - That by the way, she did not recuse herself,
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.520]   they lost on that regard.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.760]   Cable Sasser, who is at panic,
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.080]   and a very, I think this was a John Grubber,
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.240]   somebody pointed out cable is very much an Apple supporter
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:01.120]   is starting to become very much aggressive developer
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.720]   in this anti-app store thing.
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:08.720]   He refers to a thread from Samantha John about hopscotch,
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.640]   and I don't know if you've all read this thread,
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.840]   but I'll kind of summarize this.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.520]   Hopscotch is an app for schools.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.280]   She's a kind of a loan developer doing this.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:23.400]   We were submitting a bug fix to update hopscotch this weekend.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.880]   We wanted to get it quickly out ahead of the school year
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.480]   'cause schools don't update often after downloading.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.000]   The app was rejected because, quote,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.480]   our promoted in app purchasers had identical titles
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.080]   and descriptions which could be confusing to users.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.760]   She said, that makes sense as a guideline,
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.400]   except it wasn't the case,
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.840]   our titles and descriptions were different.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:47.760]   So she changed the description to be even more different.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.840]   Replied the message, resubmitted the app,
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.440]   a day later the app rejected again.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.240]   At this point, I didn't know what to do.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.040]   I was in a Kafkaesque universe
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.120]   where I had to blindly guess at what could be wrong
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.000]   and randomly changed things
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.520]   until the bureaucrats let me through
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.480]   with the one day to lay luckily at a contact with Apple.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.520]   I mean mailed them for help, carefully explain the issue.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.880]   They told me, submit an appeal.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.960]   So I submitted an appeal, complete with screenshots.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.080]   I had two things on my side.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.280]   The rejection made no sense
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.320]   and the rejection was unrelated to my app update.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.000]   Here's the reply.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.720]   They let us release the bug fix,
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.480]   but told me the rejection was valid
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.920]   and I still need to update the app
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.880]   to comply with the guidelines,
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:30.400]   specifically 2.3.1 of the App Store review guidelines.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:36.320]   Today I got a call from potential spam in San Jose,
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.960]   I ignored it, but it turned out it was actually from Apple.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:45.320]   And basically, it was at Apple,
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.080]   App Store representatives saying,
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.840]   "Are you planning to update to correct the problem?"
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.120]   I told her as nicely as I could.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.960]   I did not know what the problem was.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.440]   Our promoted in app purchases had different titles
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.960]   and descriptions contrary to the complaint from App Review.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.680]   The purpose of the call was for her
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.040]   to tell me what I needed to change.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.200]   She paused for a moment
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.040]   while presumably looking at a case then said,
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.320]   "Oh, I think the automated software must have had a glitch.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.840]   It just got escalated to me,
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.560]   but I saw that your rejection was a mistake.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.720]   I wanted to call and tell you."
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.840]   Oh, really that?
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:17.960]   All of a sudden.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.360]   So this seems a little suspicious.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.920]   Samantha says, "People I met who work at Apple are lovely,
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.120]   but they've been incredibly supportive of hopscotch,
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.760]   but there's something rotten in the system
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.600]   that treats developers this way."
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.520]   Cable Sasser says, "In response,
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.680]   I thought I had experienced the full possible range
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.960]   of feelings regarding Apple and the App Store,
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.400]   but settling a lawsuit promising,
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.480]   oh, by the way, the Apple settled their lawsuit
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.040]   with developers."
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.160]   Promise, and in the settlement Sasser says,
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.040]   "Promising absolutely nothing new as part of the settlement."
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.480]   And spinning that as some kind of big developer win
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.120]   has brought me to, and he's being very judicious here,
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.360]   exciting new mental places.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:01.760]   Yeah, what's it all mean?
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:05.440]   I've heard the story of hopscotch a hundred times
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.720]   in the past three or four years
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.920]   with different app names, different developers.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:13.320]   Apple has a serious, serious problem with these,
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.200]   again, Kafka-esque experiences
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.000]   where all you did was submit a bug fix,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.080]   and suddenly they're saying,
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.040]   "Oh, well, your entire app is completely
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.280]   against our guidelines.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:27.080]   We're not going to tell you exactly what the violation is,
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.000]   but we're not going to allow you to update your app,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   or as has happened with this app,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.840]   if there's a timely release,
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.480]   that part of the, one of the bullet points of that thread
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.040]   is that, look, it's used in education,
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.200]   and they find that they will install,
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.440]   their users will install it at the start of the school year,
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.640]   but may not necessarily update it later on,
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.240]   so it's very, very important to get those.
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.160]   So, and for a lot of people, it is,
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.160]   for a lot of other developers,
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.160]   there's a monetary attachment to that
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.880]   where if they lose this window,
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.960]   they can tell you how much money they're going to lose,
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.200]   and so when it's a problem of,
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.920]   "Oh, gosh, we forgot that we weren't supposed to include
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.040]   that boilerplate text that we were using elsewhere,"
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.080]   right, that was our bad, we should fix that,
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.840]   when they're just simply telling you that,
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:14.640]   "Hey, here is a, unfortunately, Andy,
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.920]   we can't allow you on the campus
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.360]   because unfortunately, as you know,
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:23.040]   you wear bright purple colors all the time
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.560]   instead of wearing a black shirt."
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.160]   Say, "Well, I am wearing a black shirt."
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.560]   Well, that doesn't sound like you're addressing the problem.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.280]   If you're saying you're not going to change your shirt,
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.160]   so why don't have to change my shirt?
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.480]   You're complaining about a problem
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.120]   that doesn't actually exist,
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.080]   and you're locked into the syndrome
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.360]   where you feel as though nobody is listening to you,
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.720]   and nobody cares that your business
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.920]   is being chipped away at by this stupid bureaucracy,
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.760]   which has been causing problems for years
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.400]   without any real attempts at Apple,
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.360]   visible attempt at Apple, to acknowledge it,
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.480]   let alone address it.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:58.040]   So this is absolutely indefensible from Apple
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:01.120]   that they're not prosecuting these problems,
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.680]   they're not addressing these problems,
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:04.840]   or even acknowledging that they're putting a system
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.640]   into place to figure out what this problem is.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.280]   The underscore is, we absolutely don't care,
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.320]   unless you're making,
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.520]   unless you're making us a double digit percentage
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.720]   of our app store revenue, good luck.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.840]   Don't worry, there are a lot of restaurants
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:21.760]   that are hiring right now,
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.040]   if you can't make money as a developer,
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.720]   because of how we're diddling you over like this.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.880]   Samantha John continues to write,
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.440]   "Hopscotch is a small company, I'm the CEO,
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:34.080]   and I write code, and that's how a lot of the best apps work.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.880]   My time is limited and it precious to me,
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.480]   the way that Apple wasted my energy,
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:40.920]   gaslighted me, and sucked my time away,
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.200]   made me furious."
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.160]   They did call her a couple of days ago
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.440]   to apologize and ask for feedback.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.360]   She says, "Who knows if they'll actually implement it,
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.840]   but at least they're listening."
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.560]   Sometimes it pays to tweet, right, and get the...
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.600]   - Okay, I'm gonna need FaceTime videos
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.880]   so you can see what finger I'm holding up Apple.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.040]   What can we schedule this for my feedback?
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.200]   Now, I don't know if I wanna take responsibility for this.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.360]   She says, "I don't know what's worse,
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.520]   an automated system with zero human oversight
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.200]   continually telling me falsely
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.520]   that our app is out of compliance,
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.600]   or some person named Leo,
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.320]   I don't know how I got involved in this,
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:16.080]   continually pressing the low-Earth orbit Leo, not you,
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.480]   continually pressing the Reject button
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.320]   without ever bothering to read my message
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.240]   because the automated system said I was wrong.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.320]   Ms. John, I am so sorry I had nothing to do with this.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.560]   It was to be oddly...
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:29.040]   - I have a bit of a...
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.560]   I have a bit of a unique perspective on this
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:32.720]   because I live in both the Apple and the YouTube world
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.480]   and I've gotten a chance to talk to people inside Apple
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.680]   and inside YouTube because this is the exact problem
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.320]   YouTube faces, that there's always horrible videos
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.600]   that make it onto YouTube
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.160]   and perfectly good channels that are rejected for absolutely
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.000]   no scene. - It's a problem,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.800]   as we talked about last week, a problem of scale, right?
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.280]   You get to so big at some point,
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.560]   you can't do the job you promised to do.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:51.720]   - I think that's the problem is that they don't realize,
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.320]   like, well, I can't say they don't realize,
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.000]   but you have to understand these problems are not solvable
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.080]   and there's gonna be an error rate that is crushing
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.600]   to human beings, it's absolutely crushing to human beings.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.560]   You're gonna let through some of the absolute worst material
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.000]   imaginable and you're gonna hurt some really great people
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.360]   who don't deserve it and just make a response team for that.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.160]   Have a response team that before it gets like
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.440]   in front of Daniel Jalkood or Gable Sasser
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.680]   or like Mac Break Weekly is like scouring Twitter
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.480]   with sentiment analysis and doing all these things,
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.920]   pulling up, oh, App Store reject,
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.560]   and just like, like, their one job is to make sure
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.560]   every developer, have a developer set, not like customer set,
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:29.440]   but developer set that you have up on the slide at WWDC,
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:33.400]   99.99999% of developers, super satisfied
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.920]   with the human part of our experience
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.120]   because we know we make mistakes,
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.880]   but we catch them and we fix them.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.240]   I think that's the part that's missing
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.440]   from all of these automated systems.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.320]   - Yeah, and it is at the scale,
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.960]   it does create a huge problem,
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.400]   but Apple is not too hippies in a garage.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.720]   It is a two trillion dollar company trending
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.600]   towards becoming a three trillion dollar company.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:56.080]   They have the resources to put more human bodies on this
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.520]   to at least mitigate some of this.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.600]   So if they're excused for not doing this
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.520]   is that we don't have the resources, that is a lie.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:08.160]   And if they're not giving any reason for not doing it,
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.640]   then that is admitting that they don't care.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.360]   This is such a, it's not just a practical problem,
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.920]   but it's a PR problem for them.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.960]   And one that they should be absolutely concerned
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.120]   about solving.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.080]   - I mean, it's that statement they made with John
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.280]   over once where they said that he was like,
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.120]   they were saying like, why are you,
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.780]   why are you so frustrated with the platform?
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:25.880]   We don't understand it, Apple.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.880]   Our crash rate is so low now.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.240]   Every tool we have measures that are crash late,
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.120]   rate is the lowest.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.680]   And he's like, it's not crashes.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:34.040]   There are so many frustrations
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.120]   that are not involved in crash.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.360]   Like, yeah, we totally blew it.
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.880]   We thought that crash is equal to XV.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.760]   And this too, like their rate shows that they,
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:45.240]   they have like a 0.00001 false rejection
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.200]   or acceptance rate.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.400]   And they're like, that's terrific.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.360]   That's amazing on the billions of things
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:50.400]   that we look at every day.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.480]   And it's like, but those are people.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.360]   Those are human beings.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.320]   - They are, if you're not measuring the frustration
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.480]   that they have.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.960]   - I think that the thing is I've,
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.800]   you know, I had to submit a lot of things
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.720]   to a lot of different companies.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.880]   And I've primed pretty much anything
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.680]   with more than a hundred employees
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.880]   and oftentimes anything more than about 30
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.360]   have created these problems.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.160]   So the thing is, is that it just keeps getting bigger
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.560]   and it scales almost proportionally,
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:17.840]   sometimes exponentially with the number of people
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.360]   that you're dealing with.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.560]   And I mean, whether it's United Airlines
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.160]   or Google or Facebook or Apple or the government,
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.440]   you know, the DMV, we all have the DMV.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.640]   (laughing)
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.480]   You know, like right, again,
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.320]   there's a lot more people at that.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.960]   I mean, I'd really love to have that.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.040]   And so, you know, and the long, you know,
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.520]   so the thing is, is that any time we,
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:39.320]   you know, and the problem is we can magnify it all with Twitter,
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.160]   which I do often.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.520]   So anyway, so, you know,
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.480]   and so I think that, you know,
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.640]   but I think that it's,
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:50.640]   I think that Apple, I think, you know,
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.920]   does need to get better at this,
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.080]   but I think that we get a little hyperbolic, you know,
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.560]   when we talk to people about
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.960]   how long it's gonna take to get their app in,
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.680]   I'm helping someone right now get an app in,
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.720]   and you know, it's getting blocked
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.200]   because of some weird little thing.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.960]   But it's just like, okay, well, how do we handle that?
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:05.920]   And it's not, it's just like,
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.040]   it's just the mechanism that you work with, you know,
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:10.320]   and we're working through that process.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.400]   And I will admit that I think
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.360]   that what they're blocking is silly,
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.360]   but it's just like, okay, well, what's the game?
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.720]   And how do I play that game and then get my app in there,
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:22.400]   you know, and the thing is, is that we tell,
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.960]   you know, we tell anybody that we're working with,
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:27.440]   we've built a couple of laps in the last little bit of time,
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.200]   and we say, four weeks,
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.160]   like from the time you wanna do an update,
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.560]   give yourself four weeks,
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.160]   and sometimes it's a day and you're like, wow, that's amazing,
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.360]   but don't set a schedule on that.
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.200]   (laughs)
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:39.920]   And think of that as like extra time that you were given
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:40.920]   to get through that, you know,
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.200]   and I think that the thing is,
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.440]   is that it's unrealistic to think that you're gonna send
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.720]   something into a system that you know has a check
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.200]   and balance system and it's gonna be done over the weekend.
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.840]   Like that's just not, like that's not gonna happen.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:56.760]   - What if you're rejected and not told,
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.200]   told why you're rejected and it's wrong,
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.960]   and then not told what to do to fix it,
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.920]   and then said, but you still have to fix it.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.760]   What kind of weird--
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:06.160]   - How come the world's worst robot?
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.080]   - Yeah, what kind of weird system is that?
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.080]   - Regardless of the time involved,
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.600]   the system still doesn't work.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.840]   - The system, actually for a lot of people it is working.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:16.680]   You know, there's a lot of people that--
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.880]   - That's not what we're talking about.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.400]   We don't talk about the people who are being treated well
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.800]   and who are having good experiences.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.640]   The flaws expose themselves and the people
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.560]   who are having a horrible experience.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:26.880]   - But you're being absolute,
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.320]   absolute is everything is broken.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.880]   Everything in the world is broken.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:30.720]   Nothing works.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.560]   - Nothing.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.400]   - Nothing.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.240]   - That doesn't work.
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.080]   - That doesn't work.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:34.920]   - Give me something and I'll point out the--
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:39.800]   - So the fact that United Airlines has a problem
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.480]   with doing customer service at scale
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.920]   means it's okay for Apple to have exactly the same--
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.560]   I accept that this is a veil of tears
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.120]   that mankind is born to struggle
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.160]   just as surely as the sparks fly upward.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:55.200]   But when we see what appears to be a very fixable problem
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.200]   at Apple, I'm not gonna simply say
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.760]   that read your book of Job and good luck.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.960]   I'm gonna say Apple fixed this problem.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:07.960]   - Apple should continue to make progress on the problem
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.840]   but to say that it's all like this is the whole place
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:12.880]   is burning down, it is a--
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:13.720]   - I'm really saying that--
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:15.000]   - It is a developer that's having this problem.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.440]   - I agree but I hear more and more
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:18.200]   when I think cable Sasser's saying
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:21.040]   and I hear more and more developers complaining about this.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:21.880]   - And this sounds a bit--
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.240]   - Marco Arment's complaining about it.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:26.320]   - A lot of big name developers are complaining about this.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:29.040]   - And I have a problem.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.720]   - You know, I had a lot of Mark.
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.200]   (laughs)
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.920]   - So, you know, like the thing is is that it's,
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:35.160]   but again, you know--
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:39.240]   - So the silent majority rules and people who are not happy
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.560]   with the system should just shut up.
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:41.400]   - It should be in progress but--
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:44.120]   - No, no, we should keep on saying we should fix it
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.120]   but to act like it's like the end of the world
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.520]   is a little much.
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.680]   You know, like it is, you know, it is not this,
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.040]   it is something that you're always making progress on.
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:54.640]   Any time you build a system, it is not working.
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.800]   You know, it is always working better
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.760]   than it's not working if it's moving forward.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:00.840]   You know, and that's sometimes it's creeping forward
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:03.160]   and 51% working and 50% not working.
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.360]   And if you're getting into the 70s, 80% working,
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:09.240]   you're doing amazing, much better than almost everything else
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.120]   out there, you know?
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.720]   And so, I mean, any, and I don't know,
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.880]   I mean, everything that I work with is broken.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.320]   You know, like, and I mean, that's all I deal with
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.440]   is broken things, you know?
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.840]   And you're constantly trying to--
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.480]   - Will you use the perception problem at this point?
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.560]   Like when you have people like Cable and Daniel
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.400]   who worked at Apple--
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.320]   - I just think it's very unperely--
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.840]   - It's a very unpexible problem.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.080]   And so the thing is, is that it isn't just
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:32.120]   about throwing more people at it
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.960]   because more people just create more chaos.
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.560]   You have to, you know, scaling people.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.680]   - That's an over-generalization, no.
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.960]   - Oh my gosh, like, have you ever hired a thousand?
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:44.960]   I can just tell you, I hired 20 people in three months
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.280]   and it was chaos, you know?
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.440]   Like, you know, and so the thing is, is that,
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:49.360]   like permanently, you know?
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.160]   And the thing is, is that it is, you know,
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:54.120]   adding a thousand people or 2,000 people or 10,000,
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.920]   whatever it is right now, you know?
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:00.080]   It is not, there is a logistical problem there
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.840]   that we're not taking into account, you know?
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.880]   Like, and so the thing is, is that,
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.720]   is that it just takes time to sort things out
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.520]   and it doesn't need to get better
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.400]   and it needs to get improved, but, you know,
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.560]   I just think that we're getting a little over our skills.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:15.160]   - I haven't hired hundreds of people, no,
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.920]   but I have interviewed people who are on the ground floor
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:21.280]   and responsible for scaling up a 100 seat company
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.960]   into a 10,000 seat company.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:26.200]   And they realize that maybe by hiring the right number
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.720]   of people and putting them in the right places,
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:30.720]   they can actually achieve goals that might have seemed
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.960]   hard with that 100 person team.
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:37.120]   They were not 10,000 people who were bumping into heads,
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.920]   like like a ping pong balls being dropped
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:44.480]   from the top of a gantry or anything like that.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.120]   I'm not saying that, I'm not saying that we should expect
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.840]   perfection, again, imperfection is part of the burden
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:50.960]   of human life.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:54.120]   I'm not saying that they can possibly make everybody happy.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.440]   I'm saying though that we're not gonna judge
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.840]   how well the system works, by how well it works
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:00.480]   for the people who have no complaints.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.880]   They're fine, they're great, wonderful.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.360]   Let's talk to the people who have been describing this
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.160]   as again, a Kafka-esque nightmare,
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:09.600]   which is the phrase that keeps coming up over
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.280]   and over and over again.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.760]   And when you have people who have decades of experience
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:16.480]   as developers, who are the heads of very, very big
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.240]   and successful companies, I would say even important
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:21.920]   companies in the Mac space and in the iOS space,
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.560]   who are saying that this is not just,
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:26.280]   oh gosh, isn't it terrible that this is part of,
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.960]   part of the problems of scale, is that some people
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.280]   are gonna have bad experiences.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:32.560]   When they're telling you that the house is on fire,
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.360]   our job is not to look across the street and say,
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.800]   yeah, but that elementary school in the next town over
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:41.120]   is perfectly fine, so some elementary schools,
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.400]   they're gonna burn.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:46.440]   I think we can agree, there's a problem.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:49.480]   We might not agree on how intractable it is,
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:50.920]   but we can agree there's a problem
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:54.520]   and that Apple should be, and apparently is working on it.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:57:00.640]   I think the question is, does Apple care enough to fix it?
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.920]   Can Apple fix it?
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:06.640]   And maybe most importantly, is Apple gonna suffer
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.480]   because of this?
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:10.640]   Is Apple gonna get the kind of regulation
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.320]   that's happening in South Korea hit hard
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.120]   by the same thing all over the world?
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:19.400]   And I think whether Apple wants to fix it or can fix it,
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:22.080]   they should be aware of the fact that they have a,
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.800]   I agree with you, Renee, they at least have
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:25.760]   a perception problem.
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.200]   - But also like, they're on the same page about the problem.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:30.120]   I think this is something that is bit Apple
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.240]   so often over the last few years,
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.000]   but one is they didn't get ahead of any of this stuff.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.640]   Like they just get ahead of this stuff,
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.720]   like read the wins, see where things are going,
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:40.400]   make preemptive actions, avoid the worst outcomes,
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.160]   that kind of stuff, but we saw this with like
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.800]   the privacy stuff we talked about last week
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.160]   where they say we must understand the technology,
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.000]   but they're misunderstanding our sense,
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.800]   like our feelings about the technology.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.720]   And here, they would, they may argue
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.480]   that the developers are misunderstanding
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.360]   the way in which they're steering the app store,
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.200]   but they're misunderstanding the frustrations.
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.040]   And I think one of the issues also is that people
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.000]   keep talking about the symptoms.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.320]   Like I hate this 30% thing, I hate this,
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.440]   like this other, the in payments thing,
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:08.140]   but those are again, those 10 word answers.
[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:09.640]   What is the solution you want?
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:12.760]   And then how do we engineer towards that solution?
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.880]   And that I think gets totally lost in these discussions,
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.360]   because everyone gets so angry about like the percentage
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:20.120]   or it's like a tax and nobody figures like what would be bad,
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:22.400]   like what would make James Thompson deliriously happy?
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.840]   What would make cable Sasser deliriously happy?
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.000]   Like you can't like a billion dollars, sure,
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   but let's take the silly stuff off the table.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.720]   And then engineer a store that works for all these people
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:32.560]   in 2021.
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:34.200]   - Do you think Apple is paying attention?
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.960]   - They're listening to this and going, we gotta fix it.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.760]   - I'm sure that they're absolutely paying attention,
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:39.840]   they're absolutely working on it.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:41.160]   And it's a really complicated problem.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.400]   - And I understand, yeah, it's fine.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.320]   - It's difficult to find it.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.320]   - And their concerns are very complicated.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.920]   - Have concerns and vice versa.
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:50.200]   - I would just like to thank it.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.440]   - It's easy to tell the quarterback
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.560]   what he should be doing when we're sitting in the stands.
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:56.400]   You know, like it's just like, oh yeah, he could have done that.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.160]   But you know, we're not telling what to do.
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:00.800]   We're saying there's a problem.
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:01.640]   - Oh no. - I don't know.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:02.480]   What do you do?
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.680]   How do you solve this?
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:04.520]   I don't know.
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:05.760]   We've not said what to do,
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:09.200]   but there is clearly a problem in which we're reporting.
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.920]   - True. - Yes.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:14.280]   - Yeah. - You make them feel that easy.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:19.280]   - Well, again, we realize that Apple is a big, big company.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.960]   They have a lot of problems.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:24.360]   And sometimes the reasons why they can't address
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.440]   certain problems are the most mundane of all.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.320]   They just have such a big bureaucracy in place.
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:32.800]   And they don't have enough focus on a certain problem to say,
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.280]   we are going to put all of our attention towards solving this.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.600]   You think about the fact that they are,
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.320]   they decided they figured out all the infrastructure
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:41.840]   that they needed to do to be able to sell
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.720]   a $12,000 solid gold gadget watch
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.920]   in special boutiques that they would have to construct
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:50.400]   custom made in most of their Apple stores.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.720]   They are figuring out how to do self-driving cars,
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.760]   even though they have no announced plans on,
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:58.120]   or even really no data on where they can actually
[00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.680]   be financially successful doing that.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.520]   They are developing, they appear to be developing
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.720]   wearable augmented reality despite the fact
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:08.640]   that there is no evidence that people are going to want
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.520]   to put something practical on their faces
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.200]   and walk around with it, let alone the fact
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.720]   that the guests work about whether or not
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.160]   this is going to be relevant to anybody's needs.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.440]   So we're talking about a company that can,
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.800]   they're talking about a company,
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.920]   we're talking about a company that can do lots
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.880]   and lots of things if they are focused on it
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.960]   and they identify it as something that they want
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.160]   to put all of their efforts on.
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.800]   I'm saying that because this is not a recent problem
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.280]   with the App Store that's just popped up ever since they made
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:37.880]   a change to the App Store two years ago,
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:41.680]   or ever since a certain person left the VP suite
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.120]   or entered the VP suite, this has been going on
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.240]   almost since the beginning.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.840]   They've had so many swings at this that we have to wonder
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.960]   why these problems keep coming up in this sort of intensity
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:56.440]   and that the legend of Apple not caring about developers
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.640]   when there's a problem, that is kind of significant I think.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.200]   >> The, all of the examples you gave are far simpler
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.040]   than dealing with millions of developers
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:05.880]   around the world.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.840]   They're all like far simpler.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.560]   Like is someone who deals with lots of people?
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.400]   Like I'm just--
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.680]   >> They may be simpler, but Apple doesn't seem to be solving them.
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.720]   This is not a new complaint.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.000]   >> It's not a easily solvable problem.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.040]   When you deal with lots and lots of users,
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.120]   you deal with lots and lots of problems.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.080]   And so the thing is,
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.480]   is that lots and lots of developers
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.120]   trying to feed into it.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.520]   We talk about this all the time.
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.720]   Like we, when we develop, for instance, a live app,
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.880]   we tell everyone, you gotta get this all working
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.880]   as soon as you turn it on because there's gonna be
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.000]   a thousand people that are,
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.240]   if you put a hundred thousand people into it
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.280]   and a thousand people can't get in, it's 1%,
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.600]   but it's still a lot of people that are on Twitter.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.080]   You know, and so the thing is, is that--
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.760]   >> I have to agree with you on that.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.760]   >> Twitter has become,
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.240]   I really don't like that.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.080]   (laughing)
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.280]   >> So the thing is, is that--
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.080]   >> I'm saying, I don't really like saying that
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.720]   it's not people who are whining on Twitter.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:53.560]   >> It's more than that.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.400]   >> They're having their lives--
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.240]   >> It's more than that.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.520]   >> Severely disrupted, their businesses severely disrupted.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.200]   And they're turning to Twitter because,
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:02.760]   if Apple were responding in any way, shape, or form
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.160]   in a significant way, they wouldn't have to go to Twitter.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:06.840]   >> I don't like it.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:07.680]   >> Wind down, though.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.400]   >> I go to Twitter all the time because I can't get
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.240]   any other way to do it.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.080]   Like, I just go, okay, well, I'm just gonna go to Twitter
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:12.920]   and I'll get the solve.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.520]   >> It's unfortunate companies incorrectly believe
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.920]   that people pay attention to Twitter.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.720]   I don't think it's true, but it's gonna come to these--
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.560]   >> I don't know if people pay attention to Twitter.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.960]   All I care about it is the Canadians and the radians sits.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:25.120]   So, radians six is the back end.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.120]   That's all that matters.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.320]   You know, so it doesn't matter how many people
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.160]   are actually working on it.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.000]   >> No, that's true.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.240]   If there is a feedback mechanism,
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.040]   is that called radian six sets for developers to feedback?
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.880]   >> I don't know if it's called anymore, it was bought by Salesforce
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.040]   a long time ago, but what it does is when you complain about it,
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:41.480]   it looks at how many followers and it looks at your reach
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.600]   across through the entire network.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.920]   And then it makes a decision on how quickly someone
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.720]   on the other end of a company sees it.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.160]   You know, so when you, you know, it doesn't matter how many
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.120]   people vote on Twitter, you know, but if you have X number
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.960]   of followers and it's not just how many followers you have,
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.680]   it's how many followers they have and how many followers they have.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:04.800]   So it looks across the entire network and it looks at what
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.640]   your potential impolites.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:08.960]   >> Oh, so it's analyzing, but see, that's the wrong way to handle it.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:10.160]   To be honest with you.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.000]   >> We can't let you do that, but you go on Twitter.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.680]   So that's why you got that.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.680]   >> That's why you got that on.
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.640]   >> That makes sense because they're paying attention to that.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.160]   >> Oh, it's.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:17.160]   >> Yeah.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.400]   So if I complain with 500,000 followers,
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.400]   I'm going to get more, oh, yeah, much more response,
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.680]   which is why I'm very rarely complain because I don't want
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.200]   to use that power.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.280]   >> I don't use it very, I think I claim it.
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.080]   >> It's nice once in a while.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:36.240]   >> But honestly, developers should have a way to say to Apple directly,
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:37.200]   fix this.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.000]   Apple should be getting signals somehow besides sales and errors.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.680]   >> The point is, is that I just think that it's easy for us to say,
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.400]   but it's just it is.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.920]   >> I agree. I understand.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.600]   It's hard.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.720]   >> It's complicated.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.200]   >> And the thing is, is that it's just easy to tell people that this is
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.520]   the way that they should do it and they should just fix this.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.800]   >> Well, it seems to me that this automated system is pretty broken.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.000]   >> Address the problem and acknowledge the problem exists.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:05.360]   >> Yeah.
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:08.560]   >> Neither of which seems to be happening at the apples at Apple's end at this point.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:09.880]   >> So from my point of view.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:14.600]   >> And the main thing is, is that the Apple always will, and as a user,
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:18.920]   I prefer that Apple is always looking out for the user first.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:24.440]   And the reason that the app store, the reason that the app store is what it is,
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.280]   and the reason that it's successful, and it's a reason
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.720]   all these developers want to go to the app store instead of the Android store,
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.040]   is because Apple does this.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.440]   It's because Apple makes sure that as a user, when I see an app,
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.120]   I have a fairly good chance that it's going to be a good app when I see it.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:42.320]   That it's not going to be malignant in what it does.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.160]   And the process of cleaning that out for the user,
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:49.280]   you know, is a heart, you know, if you keep on trying to do that,
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.280]   it is it's going to create errors.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:54.680]   So the other side of that is let everything through and then have it be,
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:58.320]   you know, have users have bad experiences and then be less likely to want to just buy an app
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.480]   that they just saw someone use and go, oh, I'm just going to try that without,
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:05.000]   I'm going to pay $3 or $5 or $10 or whatever that number is,
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.120]   because I know that it's probably, you know, I have a better,
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:13.080]   a very, very good chance of it being a solid app because of this.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:16.440]   And so the thing is, is that the commerce that goes into the app store,
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:21.880]   and the reason people buy apps, not just ad, ad work, you know, ad driven, whatever,
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:25.960]   is because Apple makes it a place for the user to be safe to buy.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.720]   But when they do that to, and it's not, and it's not 100% safe either.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.680]   There's 1% of whatever that isn't working.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:38.200]   But when Apple makes it way more likely that you're going to be able to buy something,
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.320]   people buy things more.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:42.760]   They buy things off the cuff, they buy things flippantly,
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.320]   and that is really good for the developers in the long run,
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:48.360]   because people are just going, they're, they're willing to buy their apps really quickly,
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.520]   rather than buying them slowly, you know.
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.920]   And so the thing is, is that that is, and that's good for Apple,
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.520]   it's good for the developers, and, but it will create that process,
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.160]   that SIV is going to create a backhaul.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.720]   You know, and the thing is, is that, you know, it's going to create problems.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.760]   And there's going to be errors because there is errors inherently
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.440]   with any system that includes humans.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:12.520]   Okay, I'm going to, I think though, Apple's going to be facing some headwinds.
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.680]   I'm very curious what they do about Korea.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.160]   I think it's hysterical that they will just send invoices.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:20.600]   (laughter)
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.360]   Apple Arcade is the easiest way for Apple to,
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.720]   yeah, Apple, because it's, yeah,
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:26.680]   it had some really good developers,
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.520]   like there's developer feedback on all of this.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.920]   Some developers think this is great, some developers think this is terrible.
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.600]   Some developers are very pragmatic in going like,
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.600]   "Oh my God, what am I going to do for international taxes?"
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.200]   They used to handle all of that for me.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.200]   So like it is, it's going to be a bunch of trade-offs.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.240]   Some developers, some, some users are going to say like Alex does already,
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:44.200]   "I only want to use Apple's in store stuff, and if you don't use that,
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.240]   I'm going to find a different app."
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.320]   And that's fine, and some developers are going to say,
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:50.440]   "I like that Apple rolls up the taxes and that they give me XYZ,
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.960]   and they're going to use it, and that's fine."
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.200]   And others will make other choices, and we'll see how it,
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.840]   the fragmentation will be annoying, but the competition will be good.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.600]   And you know, my whole thing is,
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.480]   what do you want the app store to be?
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:02.760]   If you're really happy with the way it is,
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.200]   any change is going to annoy you.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:07.240]   If you're really unhappy with it, any change is like maybe better,
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.760]   maybe for the words, you'll have to wait and see.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.720]   If there was an easy answer, we'd have it already.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:11.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:15.560]   Let's see.
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:16.680]   I guess we can move on.
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:25.320]   If you had the no sound issue, I was not aware of this being a big problem,
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:31.400]   but apparently there are a lot of I-12 owners who are suffering from a lack of sound
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:34.680]   due to a component that might fail on the receiver module.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.360]   It's enough that Apple's doing a recall.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.760]   So if you have...
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.600]   No, with a receiver module.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.680]   What do they mean by the receiver module?
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:43.560]   It's the little...
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.520]   I don't know what that is.
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:45.720]   What is the receiver module?
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.160]   The earpiece, I think.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.440]   Yeah, I think that's what they're saying.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.800]   It's up at the top, right?
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:55.240]   12 Mini, 12 Pro Max, not part of this program,
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:59.560]   but there is a service program now for 12 and 12 Pro's,
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:03.000]   and they will fix it for you at no charge.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.840]   Not much to say about that.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:07.880]   I haven't experienced it.
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.040]   I don't know anybody who has, but there you go.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:11.400]   Just want to let you know.
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:13.880]   It's usually like this is like similar to radar.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.240]   Radar is a software system.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.800]   Apple and all big companies have these software system
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:20.040]   where they input all the repair requests,
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.800]   and if it gets big enough and it's costly enough,
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.600]   they issue like a program like this or any call program.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.960]   And if your issue is not bugging you,
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.480]   it just means not enough people reported it.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.280]   So go report it.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:39.640]   Bernstein analysts say Google will be paying $15 billion this year to Apple
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.720]   to remain the default search.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:46.200]   And the next year, it's likely to increase to $20 billion.
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.200]   Yeah, and idea how accurate these are,
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.400]   because they keep doing this every year,
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:51.240]   and people get flabbergasted by the money,
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.760]   but I've never seen any actual reporting.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:55.320]   Well, Apple doesn't tell, and Google doesn't tell, so I guess.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:57.800]   There's no way the estimates are based on patterns.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.080]   Why is Google paying that much?
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:08:59.960]   What else would Apple do?
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.880]   Would they put like being in there?
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:05.320]   Well, it seems like that's a lot of money to pay to be available.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:10.120]   It's really valuable real estate that if Microsoft were to out
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:15.320]   bid Google for that space, that would be such a big jump for being as a search engine,
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.880]   and such a big loss of access to data for Google.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:23.000]   So Apple, Apple's Jane Horvath senior director of Global Privacy says the company
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.520]   defaults to Google because it's the most popular search engine.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.480]   But Google doesn't want to risk that.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:31.320]   They don't want to call that block.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:31.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:37.720]   Bernstein says the numbers come from a detailed analysis of financial documents
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.800]   from both companies.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.800]   Like they're trying to figure out.
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:44.360]   I think it's point, but 15 billion.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.360]   That's a lot of money, 20 billion next year.
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:51.240]   If Google's willing to write that check, it means they're making a lot more money on the deal.
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:55.000]   Well, and we know that we know how much Mozilla gets from Google,
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.360]   and I can't remember what it was, but it's like 113 million, something like that.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.320]   Most of their money, right?
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.920]   It's almost all their revenue.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.240]   So we know Google pays.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.440]   Google AdWords makes so much money.
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.800]   Google's got plenty of money.
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.760]   You guys want to make a phone with like a search box on it?
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:11.160]   We got to get here.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.160]   Whatever it takes, whatever it takes.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.320]   It is so it.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:20.840]   I think the reason it's an interesting number besides the fact that it's just so big
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:26.360]   is that goes into the services bucket when Apple reports as clearly results.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:31.080]   And that shows you that that increase in the services bucket may not be app store,
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.880]   may not be Apple music, and maybe Google.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.440]   Another $5 billion next year.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:43.080]   It's a lot of stuff that's too bad that Google does some of this too in its own reporting,
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:46.120]   where there's just, here's a big bucket where they would write a report.
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:46.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:50.280]   Where we learned so much, if they would break this out into saying, well,
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:56.360]   great, you made lots of money in hardware, but how much of it was like accessory cables,
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:00.680]   and how much of it was this really expensive phone that you released that doesn't seem to be getting.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:05.080]   And before you take a victory lap on how well services are doing, because Apple TV plus
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:09.800]   and app store, it felt a lot of that is just because Google is for some crazy reason.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.320]   Is that more than they make off the pixel?
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.160]   Like are they giving Apple more than they make off the computer?
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:18.520]   Well, Google's, let me just point out, Google's annual profit is 61.9 billion.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:23.000]   So they can give them a 15 billion little vig to keep that number high.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.520]   That seems like a lot of their annual.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.120]   25% of their annual.
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.120]   Yeah, that seems like a lot.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:28.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.560]   Maybe that number is.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:30.440]   It makes sense to me.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:31.160]   Maybe that's not.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:37.240]   Oh, it's still real and it's still substantial how far much it is.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:37.880]   And it's hard.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:42.760]   It's actually hard for me to decide like how I should react to it,
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:47.080]   because on the one hand, I really can't fault Apple for saying, well, number one,
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:52.840]   legitimately having Google search as the default search engine is the best answer for the users.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:53.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.240]   What if Microsoft say, we'll give you 25 billion to put Bing in there?
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.840]   I think Apple might say no.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:04.440]   And also, and if Google is willing to give them X billions of dollars,
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:09.160]   for God's sake, if there's free money, take it, leave the room, sign the contract.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:09.640]   Thank you.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:10.280]   I mean, it does.
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:17.000]   It is, it is, it is at odds with their, we believe that privacy is the most important human right,
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.680]   sanctified by Apple in the entire planet.
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.080]   And this is why we're much better than Google and Facebook.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:23.640]   Okay, fine.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.160]   We kind of have to do that.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:26.440]   But again, you know what?
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:29.000]   They're really paying 15 billion dollars for it.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.080]   They're not paying it to be the default surgeon.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.200]   They're paying it to keep Apple from creating a search engine to compete with Google.
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.440]   It's the Google hard.
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:37.480]   That's number of apples.
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:41.000]   Remember though, remember though, we've talked about this a lot when Apple Maps came out,
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.120]   that Apple was going to slowly disintermediate all the Google apps.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.280]   They didn't want Google on the iPhone and whatever that's, that didn't happen.
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:54.840]   And I'm thinking that that 15 bill is really a lot more about keeping Apple from kicking them off
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.200]   the iPhone entirely.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.560]   Maybe, but building a search engine that competes with Google would be,
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.320]   Microsoft's tried and it's not as good.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.080]   But they've got to put a lot of money into it.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:06.680]   And so it's, the problem, the problem isn't the code.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:08.680]   The problem is the data.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:14.120]   And so the date, you know, you have 20 years of data, you know, and that data is getting better
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:14.920]   and better and better.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:19.240]   I think there was the same argument about Maps and Apple's Maps were kind of crap at first,
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.040]   but they've caught up.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:22.600]   Yeah, but the still not as good.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.360]   You know, and it's with, and it's more of more telling is Siri.
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.720]   So Siri is terrible.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.680]   We're close to the Google home.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:37.000]   And so, and I use Siri all the time, but it's, I use it because if I say, so I changed my,
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.320]   it was on Echo to Ziggy, you can make the keyword Ziggy now.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:45.160]   And every once in a while by accident, I say, hey, Ziggy and Siri goes, what?
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.840]   So I use Siri inadvertently all the time.
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.560]   I mean, I, I think I do do a, sorry by accident, an accidental Siri.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.680]   Also, I'm like, it's like, cause I call your teacher mom when you're in third grade,
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:57.000]   isn't it?
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.040]   It's like, ooh, that's embarrassing cringe in my car.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.880]   Cause I really like car play, by the way.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.120]   It's so good compared to Android auto.
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:09.240]   I know there's some people prefer Android auto, but I think car plays the one I can use both.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:13.960]   And that means the default voice search is Siri.
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:18.040]   The other day, I was late to an appointment and I was desperately trying to use Siri.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.960]   And it constantly, I can't help you right now.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:22.840]   Sorry, no.
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.960]   It's bad.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:32.840]   The thing is, is that Google's understanding of data and understanding of what people want is
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:33.400]   so high.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:37.400]   And Facebook's understanding of people because of the way that they, that is so high.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:37.880]   Just kick it.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:42.280]   But there's not, there's not really any, any way to compete with those two on those things.
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:47.240]   And when you talk to, when you see brands, you know, like, and the kind of multipliers they're
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:51.960]   getting because those things are so efficient that it, it really isn't something that I think
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.600]   there would be, it would just be a distraction for Apple because it would take
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.200]   tens of billions of dollars and they still wouldn't be there.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.120]   I do think, do you think I'm wrong in saying that Apple's goal was at one point to get Google
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:02.840]   off the iPhone?
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:05.000]   No, I doubt it.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.200]   It's, it was so hard.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:12.520]   The difference between maps and searches that maps, you can buy a lot of the data that you need.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.680]   And you can build cars and turn them out to map out the places that you think that most of maps
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.840]   is actually purchased from third parties like Tom Tom.
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:19.320]   Right.
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:25.240]   And Apple is in a really wonderful position to really make the user interface and the user
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:27.400]   experience on maps amazing.
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:31.480]   It is, I really wish that Google maps were as pretty as Apple maps.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.680]   I don't, I'm not sure about the data.
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.760]   I'm not sure about how good it is when I want to find a certain thing and it needs to turn up a
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:42.840]   place, not only, not only an address for where it is, but also knowledge of here is where the
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:47.880]   entrance to this building is. That's the sort of subtle stuff that that's really tough to nail,
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:52.520]   but that's, but you can do it by buying the data and by sending some automated, sending your own cars
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:16:03.640]   out. Search is the one, one problem that is unique to Apple that I love the 80 maybe I could,
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:08.280]   I could pick out, I think, is that they just, you need, you need to be a wartime
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:13.480]   consiglieri to do a search engine that people will actually benefit from because you have to be
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:20.040]   the person that says that we are not holy, we are not sanctimonious about privacy to the extent
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:26.680]   where if so, where we're not going to map out a collection that that hasn't explicitly told us,
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:31.240]   yes, by all means, we'll please index our collection. They're not going to do things like
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:37.080]   track people habits and their preferences to such an extent that if I do a Google search on
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:42.840]   a Tigra that it knows that, well, are you searching for the car? Are you searching for the
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:49.240]   region that's being, that's, that's, that's undergoing genocide at this moment? Are you going
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:53.240]   for the comic book character? Oh, comic book character? Okay, are you going for the DC comics
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:59.080]   character, the Marvel comics character, the Golden Age character? Because it has observed my browsing
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:04.520]   habits for a great meal time, it knows which one that I probably want to get. And he's not looking for
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:10.200]   genocide, he's looking for comic book characters. Yeah, this we know. Yeah.
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:16.440]   And you know, that like maps, maps makes it much easier. Maps, maps is really important if a to
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.960]   integrate with all your other things so that when someone asks something, someone's trying to do
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:24.760]   something, having a good maps tool that you don't have to ask Google, oh, can you add this hook or
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:29.400]   can you do this thing and just have it right. Don't you think that Apple cares about Syrian search that
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:35.480]   they really would love to be competitive? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, they want to be competitive.
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:38.760]   I just, it's just going to take a long time because it took, it took Google a long time. It's going to
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:42.120]   take Apple a long time. There's not, because the problem is again, it's not about writing code.
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:50.200]   It's about accumulating. And as Andy very rightly says, that it is privacy and knowing what you need
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.920]   next are diametrically opposed to each other. And so I understand. So the thing is that that is,
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:58.440]   that that's the challenge that Apple has with that. And but the maps are really important for
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:03.320]   general services. And they're also really important if you're doing AR cars. And so, so all of that
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:08.200]   stuff becomes important, you know, down the road. And not sure search and Syria are less important.
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:13.000]   I think they're pretty important too. And the problem is people will just do what the default is,
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.520]   you know, I mean, the reason being still exists is because Microsoft also owns Windows and Edge.
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:22.840]   Otherwise, nobody be using nobody using a microphone. Most of the average person that buys
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:26.600]   money changes that is a certain change. No, well, they also probably don't change the maps. They
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.800]   probably just use I mean, I know I was talking to someone who was like, oh, you should be using
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:35.320]   these Google Maps. And they were like, they're like Google Google Maps. Like, I have to use Apple
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:40.840]   Maps because it goes to my watch. While I'm driving my watch and I turn off the voice.
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:44.680]   I use Google Maps specifically because I haven't figured out how to turn that off.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:47.880]   And I hate. I hate things. You don't like your watch puzzle while you're driving.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:53.560]   Very upset. Also, I have to say that that we were talking about lock in earlier that, you know,
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:59.640]   I case I case I myself was coming across as somewhat sanctimonious Google Maps for me is one of those
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:06.440]   examples of, I don't know, willful, talking because it's great when I'm like, oh, where's I need to,
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:10.840]   I need to get the I need to get this thing. I have a poster that I want to get framed. Where's a
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:15.240]   good place I can get picture framing done. And then I'll see that Oh, wait a minute. It's what
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:19.400]   are these four stars that are sort of near that that one picture framing place. And it's like,
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:23.480]   Oh, there's this there's this museum that I kind of wanted to go to. And there's this like
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:26.920]   complex store that I wanted to check out. And these are like things that I might have flagged
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:32.840]   anywhere like eight to nine to 10 years ago. When I go to New York City, it's like the entire thing
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:38.840]   is like covered with like with with with yellow stars at this point, because it is like a datum
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:42.360]   of all the places where I needed to go for briefings and meetings. I do that to that.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:47.640]   I can go back to yeah. And so it's fun to say, Oh, oh, that's right. There was that great
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:52.040]   Korean place that's right in your Penn station. And it's open 24 hours. Great. I will get I'll get
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:58.040]   some bim bim bop before I go before I go home. And so yeah, I just let people crack my every
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:05.240]   move in that way. I don't have to pin any. Yeah, it's I think like Rene and I have to have talked
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:11.400]   about this. And it really is like it is the transaction. It is the deal that if you do if you
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:16.280]   enter into this covenant with Google willingly, and you know what you're giving up. And but you
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:19.400]   and you decide that what you're giving up is worth what you think you're getting back.
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:23.560]   That's great. Some a lot of people are going to say I would much rather go with
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:29.240]   services that aren't maybe quite so brilliant at Apple, because I feel as though I'm paying
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:33.800]   much, much, much, much less of things that I really, really, really value
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:41.080]   in the stay and age. So I feel as though my transaction with Google is okay. Also, if I'm going to do
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:45.960]   it, rather than doing small deals with eight different devils, I would like to do one big
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:51.880]   deal with one big devil. Google if I trust Google with my data, I trust they're going to keep it
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:57.080]   secure from other people who might monetize them before they can monetize it. But it also means that
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:03.240]   it'll be the same stuff I'm giving them will be used to power a lot of different services as
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:07.160]   opposed to again having to give it to seven different places to get seven different kinds of
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.720]   different to this point. At this point, I'm happy with it.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:13.320]   About Google Maps though, like they were because Google changed some policy about retention of
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.240]   location data and now a bunch of people this week are super salty about Google Maps because
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:22.840]   they're going to refuse to forget where you are. Google Maps doesn't it's not very complicated
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:27.080]   for me. It's like, well, he's at home a lot. And he said, Whole Foods, Bevmo, the full service
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:33.080]   place and the office and then there's like five places. It was actually very depressing during
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:39.000]   COVID because my Google Maps actually, there's your monthly report, like, okay, that's right.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.800]   There's the time that I walk to a year or so for months.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:46.520]   You don't sell your data for months. Let's take a little bit of a break here.
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:53.560]   Andy Inaka, Renee Ritchie, Alex Lindsay, the Mac Break Weekly team is in the house and on fire.
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:59.800]   I showed today brought to you quite literally by CashFly. CashFly is our content delivery
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:05.560]   network. They've been in the business since 1999. We've been using them for more than a decade.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:11.640]   They've been fantastic. And now they're offering something extra special ultra low latency
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:17.080]   streaming. This is not the web RTC solution that's let you down in the past stream delays.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:22.440]   When I talk about ultra low latency are less than one second, but there are more perks you can
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:28.360]   play anywhere. They have a great HTML5 player with an SDK, which means you can run it anywhere you
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:35.160]   want websites, applications, even mobile devices, any other platform because CashFly has over 50
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:40.760]   points of presence all over the world. They're the fastest CDN for throughput globally.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:43.640]   And with that low latency network, your video streams will be streaming

[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:05.560]   the analysts CounterPoint research grew 27% year over year. The COVID downturn is turned around
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:11.640]   big growth, of course, for Apple, but also for Samsung. Even Garmin recorded its highest
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:17.880]   shipments ever during this most recent quarter. Apple Watch user base Apple doesn't say the numbers,
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:25.560]   but CounterPoint says 100 million Apple watches in use right now. They're number one easily,
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:31.160]   easily. I don't see other smart watches. I see a lot of Fitbits.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:39.480]   Yeah, I see it once in a while. It's Google now. So, and you know, yeah, Fitbits I see almost as
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:46.200]   much as I see Apple watches. So, actually the number one smartwatch platform,
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:52.200]   according to, again, this is nobody, nobody gives these numbers. So, this is CounterPoint's analysis.
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:26:01.400]   28% Apple, 9% Huawei, 7% Samsung, 6% emu. I don't know who they are, 5.8 to Garmin and the rest.
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:10.120]   And all of those are usually, Apple seems to own the space of, I want a fashionable watch that has
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:13.800]   lots and lots of digital features on it. It just doesn't seem to be a competition for it.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:20.440]   When you look at one of those extra sections of the pie, you're looking at Garmin that is doing
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:25.320]   really that kind of owns the space for I'm doing extreme sports where I need accurate GS
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:33.080]   elevation. Yeah, exactly. Fitbit, which is owning the space. I actually, I don't actually need a
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:39.160]   $250 watch. I actually just want something that counts steps and occasionally passes along
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:46.680]   a text message. What Apple has done is, I mean, it might be insurmountable by any competitor.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:50.520]   Certainly, doesn't look as going to happen from Google that doesn't, they don't seem to have
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:58.680]   really like, I just got this Galaxy, smart watch, this Galaxy 4. It's 90, I'm showing it to nobody.
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:06.280]   Sorry, there it is. It's over here. 90% of what Apple Watch will do, and it's round, which I like.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:11.960]   I actually, I think it's pretty good. It's the same thing with the Samsung phones. It's like,
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:22.840]   it's it's a credible alternative, but it is. But my issue with it has always been that I just
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:27.960]   don't like the Samsung ecosystem that they throw you into. Like you can't, you can't get the Siri,
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:32.600]   excuse me, you can't get the Google Assistant on it. You can get big old apps on it, but you have to
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:36.600]   but you have to install them on the thing. You can't set it up without having setting up a whole
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:40.920]   bunch of Samsung accounts. By the way, you can't get you can't have the voice assistant be Google.
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:48.120]   No. Oh, yeah, I didn't realize that. Hey, hey Google. Oh, no, I mean, I mean on the on the Samsung
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:52.840]   watch. Yeah, think I don't know. Oh, I don't know about the watch on the phone, you can. But Bixby
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:28:00.440]   is your friend. I hate freaking Bixby. She was great at an incredible Hulk. He brought a passion and
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:04.920]   emotion to that, to the human side of that monster that none of us had so much promise.
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:12.200]   How often do you use this smart assistant on your watch though? Is that a low low? I used to
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:17.400]   cooking timers. Yeah, yeah, well, not only that, but you when you think about like what I've always
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:24.280]   been he says holding up a bare wrist. I'm very hair suit Wolverine.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:30.440]   All exactly my it's waiters. Of course, I've got the the fur or the foot gloves on. But
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:36.440]   the the I've always been a proponent of the idea that the the wristwatch the wear that kind of
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:40.360]   a wearable. It isn't something you should be spending any amount of time interacting with.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:45.560]   It's it's there for just like traditionally for 100 years is there so that we can raise our
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:49.560]   wrist glance at it and get the one piece of information we need, which historically has just
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:53.880]   been the time and maybe the date. And that should be I think the role of these watches. There's been
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:59.720]   so many times where when I back when I was a daily wearer of the Moto 360 and back when I was
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:04.600]   at every time that I've been testing Apple watches for any length of time, what I use it a lot for
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:09.800]   beyond setting kitchen timers is just simply accessing the voice assistant to simply say, oh,
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:15.480]   I'm taking my I'm taking my walk. I say, Oh, take a note. I should I should look into this topic for
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:19.800]   for next week or whatever. And then just simply gives me confirmation that I can continue going on
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:24.040]   without having stopped. I think it's a really I think it really is a great point of access. It's
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:30.680]   the other reason why I think that every Apple Apple Google everybody could really clean up by
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:36.040]   giving you the airpiece that just does nothing but gives you access to that voice assistant so that
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:41.080]   it can just be your audio that that ghost that follows you around that just simply is helpful to
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:46.280]   you at all times. So you can by the way, now that Samsung is Wear OS, you can get the Google Assistant
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:52.280]   on the watch. You may have to add an application, but it is where you have to install the stuff.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:56.280]   Yeah, I think there's also a problem with Google Fit being like the default fitness app. It still
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:30:01.880]   wants to use one Samsung and maybe maybe it will let you right. So that's that's why Samsung,
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:05.800]   I think they're great. I just don't they're not they're not the people I want to make that deal
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:09.320]   with a double with. I don't necessarily not trust them. It's just that I don't want to give
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:14.600]   a second copy of information to Samsung that I'm already giving to Google. I want Samsung to
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:19.080]   deal with the apps that I'm that I'm using from Google. Right. I will say that I also think that
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:24.520]   Apple Fitness is a pretty pretty amazing way to market a watch because you have to have the
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:29.720]   watch to do Apple Fitness and Apple Fitness is the best video fitness ever made. Like as a video
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:36.360]   producer, like as I look at stuff that I make, it's like really high quality and really well done
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:40.680]   and really thought out and you know at a higher level than I've seen and I've done a lot of video
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:47.880]   fitness and it's it's it's really really well done and and even my even my wife was like,
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:53.080]   which which workout do you do? Which one do you do? I mix it up. I mix it up. I've done I do some
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:57.880]   of the hit stuff. I've done yoga. I've done you know, that's the great great thing about it is
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:02.120]   all the stuff and the different people and different kinds of music and you kind of bounce around and
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:07.880]   it's it's really really well done. And I just do it with my usually with my iPhone or my iPad,
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:12.280]   you know, in the garage. It's the end of the it's the end of the month and I
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:20.920]   I need 45 map points to make it to the bronze level in my face. So I'll be doing that tonight.
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:29.480]   So until and I'll work out until I get those 45 points and then it's terrible, you know,
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:34.680]   but I guess it's good because it encourages you to work out a lot at the end of the month.
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:47.080]   Let's see. Hey, I'm excited about this apple acquired primefonic. Andy and I are primefonic
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:52.920]   subscribers. Yeah, we hope. So then are you excited? Well, yeah, because I may not have to pay a
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:59.080]   separate fee for primefonic. I'm hoping apple cautiously, cautiously pessimistic. No app,
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:08.520]   yeah, optimistic. I'm I too am optimistic because if given that the the big bullet point in the
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:14.200]   press release was that not just oh, we've bought primefonic, but also we promise to we are going to
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:18.520]   be releasing a classical music specific app. We should explain devices. We should explain.
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:25.240]   So primefonic is a very, very, very good streaming classical service, which has high resolution,
[01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:29.320]   great search. It's hard. It turns out it's hard to do a classical service, but they do.
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:34.600]   Yeah, it's it's so many problems. No, you start off with the fact that a lot of the really great
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:39.080]   classical recordings, they're just not part of the catalogs that get put onto streaming. I mean,
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:42.840]   Spotify and Apple music are great. They've got lots of there so many times I've searched for
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:48.120]   something and been a little bit surprised to find it because here is a here is a mezzo-soprano that
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:53.400]   has recorded exactly one album for a very, very small publisher and boom, they've got both of
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:57.800]   them. But there's lots of stuff on publishers that just don't reach the streaming platforms.
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:07.160]   But the biggest thing is that it's just such a specific set of needs to be listening to classical
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:12.120]   music. Instead of artists, you have composer and then you have the artist as a separate field.
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:16.120]   And that's just not the way it is. It's like pop music. Yeah, it's like it's like four or five
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:20.920]   dimensions. When I was reading about this, I was I immediately thought to thought about one of my
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:27.640]   favorite opera albums. And it's like the number I've got on my Plex server. And sometimes I
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:33.000]   wind up playing because I think, oh, I want to hear some Joyce D'Nonato. Sometimes I play because I
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:40.760]   want to listen to an album by this wonderful orchestra that plays only Baroque music and only
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:47.720]   on period instruments. Sometimes I handle is my jam. And the thing is you have to the app that
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:52.680]   helps you find these things has to be has to understand what you're looking for and why you're
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:57.960]   looking for it. Otherwise, you wind up saying, Oh, well, I couldn't find it because it was listed
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:04.280]   under Mozart. Well, I'm not a it's like, I wasn't looking for Mozart. I was looking for this particular,
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:09.080]   not only this particular performer, but this particular performance. It's like sometimes you
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:13.640]   feel like I joked about this on tour the other day. That's sometimes it's not this bad, but
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:18.840]   sometimes when you use on Spotify or Apple music, you feel like you're saying, Hi, do you have any
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:23.880]   opera in your type of search is, Oh, we've got loads of opera. We've we've got Nesun Dorma by the
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:28.840]   three tenors and that little girl who is on America's got girl, he's got talent. Oh, and here is some
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:33.880]   70s soft rock music that our algorithm says that it's very simple for opera. It's much rather
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:39.960]   listened to instead. I mean, so it's a different experience. Yeah, exactly. So this is the bad news
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:45.800]   is, product is going to be taken offline September 7th, which is pissing the hell out of me.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.240]   It will no longer be available for new subscribers. My subscription goes through the end of March,
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:56.520]   unfortunately, Apple music is going to, according to Apple, this is from their press release,
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:02.680]   launch a dedicated classical music app next year, combining primfonics classical user interface
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:07.720]   with added features. Now, it's interesting. They're not just going to roll it into Apple music.
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:13.560]   They're going to have a separate app. I find it fascinating that they didn't just leave it on.
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:17.720]   It pisses the hell out of me. So I'm going to get six months of Apple music for free,
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:22.600]   but I'm already paying for Apple. They're one six buyer when it's sold. A lot of companies
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:25.160]   have it expressly written in that if you sell it, you lose the rights and then they have to
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:30.200]   renegotiate. Oh, so it's a musical rights issue. Yeah, maybe it could be a topic before.
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:37.080]   It's also interesting that it happens at the beginning of September. So, like before,
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:43.000]   like before an event. And so, and but Apple themselves say it won't be till next year before their
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.480]   app is available. Right. We just don't know what's going to happen in September.
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:55.560]   But the other thing is, is that there's a real opportunity in classical to do some interesting
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:36:01.880]   things with spatial audio that you see a little bit of. But, you know, it's absolutely right.
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:07.560]   I think there's something that Apple can do that this original company couldn't do,
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:13.160]   which is they got enough money to really put money into the creation or the publishing of recordings
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:17.880]   that have been just locked away in some some faults. There's a there's a there's another
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:22.840]   soprano that I just heard about that is apparently becoming really, really big in the international
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:29.240]   circuit. And they immediately and this article says, Oh, everyone talks about how wonderful her
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:35.400]   2009 performance in Papaya was for the for the Royal Opera Company, Royal Opera House. And
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:40.120]   like, Oh, that's great. And of course, it was you can go on YouTube, you can find clips of it
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:44.120]   because it was streamed at one point. And of course, they recorded it and they filmed it,
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:48.680]   but it's not commercially available or rather might be on DV I can't remember whether it was on
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:53.720]   DVD or not. But here's something that's been recorded, but it's not necessarily available as an audio
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:59.000]   track that you can stream. Apple might have the ability to approach to cut deals with all these
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.920]   international opera companies and say, look, we, Joyce D'Nonato has a new has a new CD coming out
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:10.200]   in March as part of the promotion of it, we would love if we could get if we could get the Metropolitan
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:18.760]   Opera's recording of her in Agrippina in 2000 2017, excuse me, 2020 as part of our library too.
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:23.880]   Here's a booklet of money, can you make it happen? So it's this is why I did a lot. I did hear from
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:28.520]   a lot of people on Twitter who were like very, very pessimistic. But I had to remind myself and
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:34.680]   them that there is there is definitely a possible alternate future reality in which Apple ruins it.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:40.120]   There's also a possibility in which this service would have been would be running perfectly for
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:44.440]   two years and then go completely out of business because it's an extremely niche sort of product.
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:49.080]   So you have to kind of be optimistic here. Yeah, that's why that's being taken care of.
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:53.240]   I mean, we talk a lot about things Apple should buy. The Prime Phonic was never on my radar
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:58.520]   something Apple should buy. As nobody said, Taylor Swift to just remaster the whole thing.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:05.080]   And I have yet to receive an email from Prime Phonic, although people are saying
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:11.240]   Prime Phonic is offering refunds. I haven't received that email. I think that Apple is also
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:15.800]   offering an extension of Apple Music Subscriptions. If I'm already paying for it. Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:20.200]   So what do I get? I've got Apple one. I'm paying for all that stuff. So I don't know if that's of
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:27.000]   any benefit. I'm going to see if I get a refund. I guess I'm disappointed. I have to say. Yeah.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:33.240]   Oh, we'll have to we'll we'll have to find out. I mean, but it does show exactly how I don't want
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:37.640]   to call a cut through. But the competition between music streaming platforms is that it's one thing
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:42.840]   when Apple's what Apple is so it's just it's so concerned about competition that they did the
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:48.280]   most desperate act the most desperate and heinous act you can contemplate inside the Apple campus,
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:54.440]   which is create an Android version of this Apple product. You know, create this. So they had to
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:39:01.160]   create an Android version of Apple music. And they're also in the position where it's because so many
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:06.600]   of these services have mostly the same catalogs, certainly not 100%, but most of the stuff that
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:11.720]   anybody is ever going to want to find they'll be able to find. You have to differentiate somehow
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:18.360]   and oh my goodness, the way to the the the if you're going to be able to say that we are the best
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:22.520]   music streaming library for classical, you're going to get a whole bunch of people who might have been
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:27.480]   indifferent to any particular selection of a streaming service. These are the people are going to just
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:32.760]   grab jump right on to Apple music immediately. It certainly would have gotten my attention if I
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:37.800]   weren't already a prime product subscriber. Yeah. My understanding is that they did the Apple music
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:42.360]   Android version. The winning argument for that was because family plans would be a really hard
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:46.120]   sell if you had a mixed family. You know, if some family members had Android phones and some had
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:50.920]   iPhones, it would just disqualify you from those. I think that's that was a smart and savvy move.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:55.240]   What I still want to know is how the poor person in Cupertino who's in charge of programming the
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:40:01.480]   Tizen app for TV plus because that must be like there's a few jobs inside Apple where you get
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:07.000]   leered at in the cafeteria. I'm guessing that's probably one of them. You got it. It's like the
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:13.720]   old woman in a great robe banging a gong saying uncle shame clang as the guys at the Tizen
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:21.880]   developers walk into the Apple Apple cafeteria shame clang. They do say that there will be some
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:26.120]   new classical music features in Apple music. So I look forward to seeing those including they're
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:31.320]   going to solve some of these issues by being able to browse and search by composer by repertoire
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:36.920]   detailed display of classical music metadata plus new features and benefits and fun. I had great
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:41.480]   playlists. They had a wonderful podcast too. Yeah, exactly. Curation is a really, really great
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:48.200]   thing. Even I'm all wind down but the one the simplest thing is just simply like there's so
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:54.120]   many times where even on a streaming service I'll be playing like an opera and because they've
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:41:00.360]   screwed up the metadata instead of seeing the so I'll be able to look at my phone and see what track
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:06.040]   I'm playing. It's it thinks that the title of this is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart the abduction from the
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:12.360]   Soraglio Act 1 Scene 3 and so it's already used three times the amount of spaces on the phone for
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:17.000]   truck before it tells me oh by the way this is this is the area that you're actually hoping to look
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:24.360]   for at this point. So yeah it's a it's if you if even trying to make this work on Plex is I've had a
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:29.560]   reread do it two or three times to find a system that works and I would even kind of love it if I
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:34.120]   didn't have to do that on my Plex server and I can just here Apple have some money please solve
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:41.000]   this problem for me. You're smarter than I am. What else anything else before we get to our picks
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:50.760]   of the week? I think we covered everything that I had on my list. There was a really good Mr. Who's
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:55.160]   the boss that Marquez Brownlee video today about the five ways that consumer like
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:42:00.120]   trying to companies are trying to force favorable reviews onto media people. Oh Lord.
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:04.120]   It's really really well done. Oh Lord. It's like we're going to give you this gift and we're going
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:08.600]   to give you a hundred of them to give away to your viewers and they're all special edition
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:12.440]   your version and then they're like but then you feel bad saying here this product is junk but
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:17.320]   we're going to give you a hundred of them or they like dueling barbells where it's like you could
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:21.480]   only show off the hardware. You can't turn it on for your first video but you can show off as much
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:25.880]   of the hardware as you want. You just can't you really can't turn it on for the first video
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:30.440]   and they had a or there's a software update coming that'll fix all of this so like just don't
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:35.720]   imagine like it was it was really well put together. Have you ever also heard about there's a scandal
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:42.520]   brewing on like SSD component providers where they will they will you know that an SSD it's not
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:46.920]   just like one chip with a with an interface to the motherboard there's a controller chip there
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:51.480]   a whole bunch of other sub components so the versions the versions that that they that they
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:56.120]   Samsung and all these other companies release that they send to like these really really tech
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:00.520]   savvy reviewers that because they know they're going to be doing this the most intense technical
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:06.760]   analysis of what they are what the speeds are what the throughputs are so they so once all those
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:11.960]   reviews have been done without changing the product name or the product or changing the price they
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:17.320]   will switch to cheaper controllers and cheaper components so that they run noticeably slower
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:22.040]   to like benchmarkers and it's like it's it's it's almost becoming a virus where how could you
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:27.400]   expect not to get caught though I mean come on so Linus had a really good breakdown on that
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:32.280]   where he went over like they have a cat like sometimes the chips are unavailable anymore like
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:35.480]   there's a big chip shortage and they can't get them but they don't say they can't get them
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:39.880]   they just swap in another part has a smaller cash and when the cash overruns the rights
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:44.760]   be dropped by like half or a quarter or eighth they don't say anything because it's still like
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:47.880]   for like 50 percent of people will never notice but the other ones are going to be really
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:53.720]   cheesed off yeah it really is like when the when the serial company like puts less cereal in your
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:58.840]   in your Cheerios box but the box is still the same size it's like your there's no way you would
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:04.360]   notice that the change had been made unless you are investigating this specifically but don't
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:11.720]   forget that Cheerios are sold by weight not by volume okay true so when the box is only
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:17.240]   but but wait you're so you're paying for the whole in the middle of the cheerio that's how they get
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:25.640]   you these corporate bastards that's why that's why I buy kicks instead like there's no hole i get
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:34.040]   nothing but pure old 100 100 100 percent cereal uh apple has seeded ios 15 beta
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:41.400]   seven so that means we're getting close to ios 15 i'm sorry beta eight eight beta
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:48.840]   eighth beta um that's only a week after the seventh came out so nothing particular to say
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:56.440]   about it anything anything uh an updates on um uh macOS ipadOS rene anything you're seeing and
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:00.760]   your beta testing i downloaded it installed it before the show but i wasn't able to go through
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:05.720]   it before the show but it like if the event is close like we think it is that's usually when
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:11.640]   they announce the gold master yeah and then it comes out one or two day in our worst nightmare
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:15.640]   it's just as as reviewers they say it's coming out tomorrow which they have done on i think one
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:19.880]   or two occasions but usually it's like it'll be out next week a couple days before the new phones
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:23.160]   right uh and then and they also announced the latter because we haven't seen all of it we never
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:27.240]   see all of it there's always like a few features that are that are dependent on the new hardware
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:32.200]   like this year it might be um they're talking about bokeh video like portrait mode video which
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:37.640]   they're calling cinematic which will have the same depth effects applied to it and pro res i think
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:43.640]   it's fortitude to lt for um recording video and there's gonna be a bunch of stuff that's that's
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:47.000]   built in to take part of all that so i'm really looking forward to seeing what that final
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:53.160]   version actually contains watch us beta eight also out today um invite watch begins now
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:59.000]   if if apples gonna have an event on the eighth you'll get an invite right by the a week before
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:04.040]   quickly it's virtual though so yes so like yeah so it invites for virtual events sometimes come
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:09.240]   the day before no give you a week or just so people can make plans yeah like i figured whenever
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:16.360]   jim darimple goes for lunch they'll they'll send out the invite so invite watch begins uh now
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:20.840]   and we'll continue through next week if they're gonna do an event on the eighth we'll probably
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:27.000]   hear about it tomorrow if not yeah odds are gonna be uh week from tomorrow they still even though
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:31.480]   people aren't going to be flying to kupertino for an event they still have to give a lot of people a
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:35.000]   lot of advanced notice so they can prepare their editorial calendar i gotta do my clear the clear
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:41.000]   the decks for all the finger warmups for typing fast all that stuff gotta get ready um gotta
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.800]   gotta get the gotta get my hip boots hip waders clean for all the bs it's gonna be piling up through
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:52.440]   my ethernet well i'm streaming this thing all right let's take a little time out uh to take a breath
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:59.320]   as we get ready our picks of the week are next back break weekly and the nako rene richy
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:09.160]   alex lindsey um i think you want to start with you today and the nako i know i i just i feel like
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:14.200]   you should i'm guessing why i i called an audible since we're talking about like google maps there
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:18.840]   is a there are some people who have created the new england apple cider donut map and they updated
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:24.360]   every like august and it is a marked up map showing all the different like farm stands and different
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:30.520]   places that make their own apple cider donut i have i grew up in rhodile and as you know i have never
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:36.680]   had an apple cider donut is what strange new thing is this or am i gonna have to fall i ease oh my
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:42.040]   i can i find it hard to believe every every time i go to a farmer's market even if it's like the one
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:47.320]   that's in copy square in downtown boston i look for the stand that has little pint bottles of apple
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:53.320]   cider fresh pressed and apple cider donuts that they make it is like the the sweetener that they
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:48:01.000]   use inside the the the kaktania sounds mighty good do not however consider yourself an apple cider
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:07.960]   donut aficionado if you eat the apple cider donut orries the cider donut tur who is a reviewer
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:14.680]   official reviewer on instagram apple cider donut says it tastes like a candle yeah i i have i have
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:19.400]   never had an apple cider donut that i've enjoyed that tasted like a candle not even if it
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:24.840]   but uh look at some of these apple cider donuts i think you're gonna yeah you're gonna see the
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:31.240]   the desire is just see this is the power of google maps where it's like maybe you're not
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:34.840]   saying oh i'm good you know what we're gonna do this weekend honey we're gonna do a tour of apple
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:40.040]   cider donut places it's more like ah damn it i gotta get my license renewed gee i wonder if there's a
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:44.920]   farm stand near the dmv that sells apple oh there is one okay great i know what i'm doing after this
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:51.640]   you apple cider donut stands out there uh wow i don't know how i missed this i'm thinking it
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:56.920]   it did i moved out of new england in 1971 i maybe they this is something relatively new i don't know
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:01.800]   i i again i'll i'll have to mail you some just like you know just like you know just like

[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:12.520]   montreal bagel but you know what i have tried and they go bad before they yeah i don't think i think
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:16.280]   they're just going to get that there i don't think it's worth it i think what i'm gonna have to do is
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:21.960]   fly out to see my mom get an apple say i'm just wondering if near cranston there are oh yeah it

[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:35.160]   get some apple um or maybe i'll go to the apple land orchard llc or perhaps a visit to dame farms
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:43.480]   and orchards in johnston ron island just down the road from my mom okay just something i'm looking
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:47.240]   i'm just checking i'm just checking there might be a good reason to see your mother is an apple cider
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:54.840]   donut and clam cakes and lobster roll and a visit to indian echo and perhaps and white chatta not
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:50:02.920]   that not to rest and leo i i wouldn't want you to eat alone and perhaps uh then a little jot up
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:08.920]   north to get a montreal bagel uh you know and they may even be apple cider stands up there
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:12.840]   who knows we're going north americans can get in but adians can't get out they struggle
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:16.520]   of but we're trying to you know what that's interesting the apple cider bagels pretty much
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:24.600]   stop uh before you get to uh get to mains well it's crowdsource so it's i'm sure it's like the people
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:30.360]   who are uh who are postulating those aren't necessarily yeah they're they're not bold explorers who are
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:35.800]   you know who are who are who are marching through the swamps of the archalia carriday a forest on
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:42.040]   on the other hand if i if i go up the uh the uh the i uh 22 or the i-9 there i can't on my way to
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:47.880]   montreal stop off and get an apple cider bagel and hack it's orchards in south hero vermont so
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:53.720]   donuts but yes oh it's a donut what i say bagel no that would be bad
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:59.560]   do not no i've actually you know if if anything can if anything can restore the unity and friendship
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:04.360]   between our two nations it would probably be the apple cider don't apple cider bagel but i will not
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:09.080]   eat the Yankee candle flavored orchards stop right there okay there it is how do you get this
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:14.920]   you have to go it's it's just a google maps link just a quick link and you you're there he's on
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:23.480]   instagram he's the uh don't cider c i d e r d o n u t e u r cider donut her
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:28.840]   doesn't this make you so happy about what the internet is that there's there's so many people
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:33.960]   that there are they are the person to know about this one thing because this is their favorite
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:38.760]   thing in the world you don't want to talk to anybody else because they got this thing on block
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:43.400]   and now with the internet they can they this this information doesn't die with them it's just
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:47.240]   they get to publish it and now we all get to benefit from he's actually uh camberge
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:53.240]   massachusetts video game developer who has spawned a cider donut renaissance
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:59.960]   so we can thank him and his link by the way on his instagram feed to the map i don't i don't
[01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:04.760]   want to make you feel bad but the the delive that's across the street for me uh there is there is
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:10.120]   there is an amazing donut place like in east Greenwich that opened up just a couple years ago and
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:14.280]   they're just phenomenal and so it's a bit of a stretch for me to drive out there or right
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:19.400]   out there just to get donuts but the deli across the street gets them gets like a like a couple of
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:23.960]   racks of them like on the weekends and so i i know i can tell the changing of the seasons from when
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:30.280]   they go from the blueberry basil donut to the cider donuts that start to so i have to say
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:35.080]   the cider donut tour is apparently flipping off the entomens version of these apple cider bagels
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:40.520]   there you go yeah don't pick those up and let's see what he says about Duncan uh he says i don't
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:46.040]   want to say the religious were describing in detail the dry cold stale donut that i received
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:52.600]   in my local duncan today it sounds like it's not exactly a recommendation but it's you know
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:56.600]   Duncan but people don't understand about duncan donuts is that it it's not designed to be the best
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:01.400]   donut you can possibly get it's reliable it is a provider of those sugars and carbs that you
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:05.480]   decide that you absolutely needed with a good cup of coffee in the morning while you're trying to
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:09.960]   get your commuter real trip like it's a service it's a service here's one from boulton orchards
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:15.560]   boulton effing orchards yes i'm at a loss for words i try to use my words and write a
[01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:20.360]   review but i don't think i can do this one justice the picture depicts like a foam cup with like
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:27.320]   it some sort of like ice cream foam serve things or caramel with with a beautifully crystallined
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:33.960]   sugar coated soft cake cider donut bobbing on the top of the night you've bested me boulton but i'll
[01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:40.920]   be back you'll see all right and i think you win this week's pick of the weeks but let me let's see
[01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:47.320]   we haven't heard from everybody this month maybe let's uh what do you what do you got every name
[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:52.120]   richie we'll go to rene and then Alex so yeah this i thought for sure we'd pick this ready but i
[01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:55.720]   went back and looked and it looks like we we didn't really mention it when it came out maybe we did
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:59.240]   it as a news story but i was i was playing with it again over the weekend just because i was going
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:05.080]   through a few months later what was my ipad really doing and halide for ipad is just it's not
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:08.600]   intuitive because some people make fun of people shooting you know with ipads it looks like old
[01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:12.920]   days of cameras when you throw a sheet over your back and say don't go wait and you take that big
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:17.960]   flash photo but it just goes to show what people like you know Sebastian and Ben and Rebecca can
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:22.360]   really do on that big canvas when you give them that opportunity or for people that is good as
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:28.280]   censored so right i mean but halide is the best camera app for the uh it's just it's so good
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:32.280]   or i was thinking like people like andy who don't have a current iphone but have a current ipad
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:36.520]   right and you know the ability to unlock just everything that apple can do with it's different
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:42.600]   like it's depth the apis and raw apis and uh all of these different things and and just
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:47.560]   having that big canvas to work on yeah i was i was sort of brainstorming with them and we
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:51.480]   got to get Alex Lindsey involved on this too because very soon i want to be able to take a photo or
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:57.720]   take a video and upload it to instagram or tick tock or youtube and have it just auto-conform to the
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:01.800]   aspect ratio vertical or horizontal i don't want to have to think about that when i'm shooting
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:07.080]   just capture a bigger frame use machine learning to center me in it and then post it for me so i
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:12.680]   can i can go to every platform and i think it's it's apps and intelligences like these like the
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:17.880]   thoughtful application of machine learning and computer vision to really good capture mechanics
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:24.760]   that are going to get us there yeah also haloit is just a joy of an app it is is everything that i
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:31.000]   miss about having android as my primary phone the the ability to some for someone who absolutely
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:36.520]   knows a team that absolutely knows what they want to achieve and wants to go beyond what they
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:43.080]   were able to just put onto onto perspectives and achieve a wonderful app that's beautiful but powerful
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:49.480]   you just kind of want to stand up and applaud and i i admit that i kind of look stupid taking
[01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:56.280]   pictures with my i actually have the 12.9 inch ipad pro oh me too i love it but but but yeah exactly
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:56:00.520]   because it isn't great it's such a weird thing because you know you're used to holding up a phone
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:04.600]   or even holding up a digital camera and seeing this little screen that comes across to you as a
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:10.760]   viewfinder but it's like i am seeing on the screen the eight by ten color glossy photograph that i
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:15.800]   will have if i just push this button as opposed to it's not a viewfinder it is no this is the photo
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:19.720]   that you can keep and if you bought a small hd monitor of that quality it'd be two thousand
[01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:24.920]   bucks to stick on your camera exactly i'm telling you i'm i'm sorry i won't i won't hijack this but
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:31.160]   i will i will just say that i have been so pleased by my purchase of the new m1 12.9 inch ipad pro but
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:35.720]   as i thought i i was hoping that part of it part of the joy of it and part of the justification for it
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:41.560]   would be processing and editing photos on it and it has absolutely come through on that and part of
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:47.960]   it is i am looking at i've got in my lap an eight by ten color glossy picture that will respond to
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:54.120]   whatever whatever will i impose upon it and i'm having so much fun going back even to old pictures
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:58.840]   i've taken and reprocessing them other thing it is one hell of a great device yeah it's really it
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:05.480]   is made for that i agree with you a hundred percent Alex Lindsey pick of the week so i use a lot of
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:11.400]   in-ear monitors so i you know i have lots and lots of them i don't i don't like to have over the
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:15.640]   year and so i have in years and i've been using them for years and i've gone i've had i started
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:19.160]   with autos and i've had audio implements which are good they're kind of the broadcast standard
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:23.640]   ear heroes which are kind of security standard you know because they're really you know a low
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:32.120]   profile and those of all been great right now i'm using these are bubble bee these sidekicks
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:39.960]   and they are they're the best so far so these are these number one is if you're looking for a
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:46.200]   low profile you'll if you can see see the video that we're doing it's hair thin like it is because
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:52.040]   it's not a tube anymore it used to be on a lot of the ifb's those the striver is at the other end
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:57.000]   plugged into the the box right and they have to send an sound tube into your ear which makes it
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:02.600]   thick yeah this doesn't do that so this is just this triangle in the bubble bee yeah and goes into
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:07.720]   it it is so comfortable like it it is the most better way to do it i have always wondered why
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:11.720]   they did those air tubes that seemed like i guess they don't want a big driver in here back then
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:17.480]   when they got created when when audio implements was making those you couldn't make something so small
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:23.240]   right the audio implements have been the standard for you know forever you know and and so and then
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:26.600]   auto makes them they're cheaper to make that way too i mean if you remember the audio implements
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:30.840]   it's a hundred twenty nine dollars these these sidekicks i think are like three hundred or oh okay
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:37.560]   and so um so they're not they're not cheap but they the audio quality so i'm ear heroes was the
[01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:41.880]   other one that's in between and it's like a hundred fifty bucks and they're great and i got those i mean
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:49.400]   one a lot of guys is here service so anyway so so the um uh so i i had a conversation with one of
[01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:53.160]   them i walked up to him at an event i was like can i ask you a question he put his hand under his
[01:58:53.160 --> 01:59:01.160]   under his jacket and he goes yeah sure ask take your chances ask i put my hands up and i said no
[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:04.920]   what do you piece do you use and then he goes pulls his hand down he goes oh yeah i just use your
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:14.760]   heroes they're really good so it's so anyway so so anyway um so uh so i they i've used those for
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:18.920]   quite some time and they're good the quality of the sidekicks is just way higher and the and the
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:23.960]   comfort is way higher and even the cable is a little nicer and of course it costs more money but
[01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:28.440]   it's it's if you're looking for something that especially now that a lot of us are spending
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:34.120]   even i spend a lot of time on zoom and you kind of want to have a more natural look and not have
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:36.920]   things over your ears and you need something that's going to be comfortable because i find that with
[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:39.880]   the other ones i'm constantly kind of pulling them out and pushing them in pulling them out pushing
[01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:44.440]   them in uh if these were wireless i could probably leave them in all day you know like i would know
[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:49.240]   light yeah well they're they're light and again the ear heroes even then they're nice but that i
[01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:53.080]   didn't feel like they were like i mean there was a little bit of like oh i'm losing the audio
[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:57.240]   fidelity is very good on these auto fidelity is really high on these and as well as the comfort
[01:59:57.240 --> 02:00:03.080]   the comfort the little the way that they built these little com weird ones yeah yeah super comfortable
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:08.440]   you know and and um just really really easy to easy to leave in there for a long time so i just
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:12.120]   wish i had a little i gotta figure out like a little wireless pack so you're not a fan of the
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:16.680]   molded you know in ear mama i mean that's what i'm wearing is it molded i i think that they're fine
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:20.680]   and these are just lighter weight they're lighter weight they're small they're i wouldn't want to wear
[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:25.480]   these all day yeah and also you can't hear anything because yeah and i do hear a little bit i have the
[02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:30.360]   ones that seal because i don't like to i just like to be what i'm doing but right but there's other bubble
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:36.200]   be inserts that are that are perforated so that you can hear around you as well people who use
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:41.160]   them for security use it that way right right yeah because you you want to hear what's going on
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:45.720]   obviously when somebody comes up to you and asks you questions you want to be a few reach for your
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:52.920]   peace but yeah these are these are these are more for musicians who don't want to get any uh
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:58.760]   additional audio coming in yeah exactly exactly yeah yeah and and i've never i mean i have
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:02.360]   ones that i've molded in and i just never found them as comfortable as i wanted them to be
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:06.280]   yeah oh yeah and they they work well and they do what they're supposed to do well the auto
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:10.840]   fidelity is fantastic because these are from part of the whole show and higher i will say that the
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:15.960]   the any the molded in here is higher than the sidekicks okay but the sidekicks as a low profile
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:21.720]   normal really complex and studio other people can use them it doesn't you know you can share
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:25.080]   you don't have i wouldn't instill where we would still go pretty deep in the
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:30.440]   canal you know i don't think i would show them you can get the spares but you can get spare
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:35.800]   your pieces pop off but there's there but they're they're nice because again it doesn't unless you
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:39.320]   turn or unless you pull something out they you just don't notice the death of their life in that
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:47.160]   is yeah you know super high super low profile yeah yeah love that uh bubble i love the name
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:55.480]   i know i know i know i know i haven't used any of the other ones but um but the
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:02:00.440]   the quality build is very bubblebee industries dot com
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:10.040]   uh did we do Renee's pick yet no yes hallowed oh hell i that's right oh salad so i'm gonna do my pick
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:17.720]   which is the plupi track ball what does that again mean not a not a great name okay no
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:23.000]   and i'm actually wondering how good so i was mentioning that i have decided to make this uh
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:28.680]   open source they make mouses and trackballs i would get a mouse but they don't make ambidextrous
[02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:34.120]   ones they're for righties but the plupi classic track ball unfortunately as you can see it looks
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:41.960]   like it's 3d printed from pla and when i ordered it foolish me uh ordered the kit so i'm gonna have
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:47.080]   to but at least see left-handed availability so i ordered the left-handed kit so i'm gonna have to
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:54.360]   do a little bit of soldering uh and it's expensive but it's open source so you see i'm putting my
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:03:01.880]   money where my diy mouth is uh and i guess because it's open source is completely repairable
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:08.680]   for that reason and you can choose different colors i got the magic eight ball for the uh for
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:16.440]   the for the ball itself but um i guess we're gonna do an event for the for the clump to win
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:24.600]   on me attempting to put this together uh not cheap it's canadian so it costs a little bit extra
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:28.600]   i think it's uh it's under it's a hundred hundred thirty nine to a hundred fifty seven
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:34.600]   canadian dollars um because of the early harvest yes i understand yes that's right they have an
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:39.720]   earlier harvest which changes everything um and then i'm gonna need a recommendation for a good
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:49.400]   soldering iron oh i've totally got one for you what is it i have to find i'll send i'll send the
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:54.200]   information to you but that my i got bought a soldering iron last year that plugs into usb
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:59.480]   but it's like tiny pencil size but and has an OLED display for setting the temperature super
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:05.160]   heats up super quickly really easy to use it's one of my favorite i have one of those like
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:09.320]   soldering stations that i've had for like ten years that's what i need yeah yeah well i
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:13.160]   i stopped using that because like oh well this is also variable temperature and it's a lot more
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:17.240]   fun to use and also like weller is just like the default though i mean isn't there's
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:21.320]   something better than weller out there what you don't know what the brand name of yours is and
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:24.040]   hang on i'm i'm looking i'm looking for it like it's a growth market
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:32.040]   yeah but everybody has weller i mean you know if we disrupt the soldering market
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:39.240]   the doors up you're gonna be able to retire in your name is they're not hugely expensive
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:45.960]   i am yeah i'm willing to pay more for a better soldering iron the wellers yeah the wellers
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:50.280]   i think the ten tens i think are the ones that i usually have the ten ten na digital soldering

[02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:50.200]   completely understand she'll ask you if you're having a stroke yeah
[02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:56.280]   anyways stay tuned my but those are those are words leo but they don't mean anything in the order
[02:05:56.280 --> 02:06:03.160]   which you're sequencing them my fluffi is on the way and i was like leo who's president
[02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:08.920]   reballing the plupi your plupi's coming but then you're gonna have the soddernine and when you have
[02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:14.200]   the soddernine you're gonna have to have one of those uh desk mounted um uh magnifying lamps oh i
[02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:17.880]   need that and yeah you'll see you'll see you'll see you'll see anyone who's desktop extraction fans
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:23.640]   an extraction fan and and you're gonna need a helping hands you know helping hands yeah yeah
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:27.560]   i've seen those yeah yeah yeah those are you know this is just this is just that get basically set
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:31.640]   up for your plupi you know this is like setting up the environment for your plupi you know you're
[02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:35.800]   plupi you might want to bring in a newspaper you know because it might take a while it's
[02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:40.360]   it's it's a it's an open source it's it's open source but it but it doesn't mean that it's free
[02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:46.200]   and and doesn't mean it doesn't require an environment of proper tooling but doesn't that look good
[02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:53.480]   it's gonna look like a racing mouse yeah exactly i love truck balls i wish they hadn't
[02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:57.720]   like mostly gone away because they're just such a cool thing to have in your desk i also also when
[02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:01.320]   you're looking for the next word to write like just just be able to just like flick that ball
[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:05.080]   makes me feel as though you're actually writing
[02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:12.200]   ladies and gentlemen that concludes this thrilling and gripping edition of mac break weekly you'll
[02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:17.880]   find Alex Lindsey at office hours dot global all the details about uh what's going on which
[02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:23.640]   is always interesting at office hours what's coming up um tomorrow we're trying to figure out what
[02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:26.920]   we're gonna do with nab you know like we were gonna cover it but we don't know like we're gonna
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:31.400]   figure out how we talk to vendors about their products you know within the group office hours
[02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:36.360]   is where nab should happen well we we're gonna need some of that you know the funny thing is is
[02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:39.720]   that i think i talked about it last week but we've gotten to the point now where we when we bring a
[02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:45.720]   vendor in we learn so much about their product in one hour because it's not one person interviewing
[02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:51.000]   them it's a hundred or two hundred people asking questions and voting those questions up and and
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:55.960]   you know all of us thinking about that product for a minute and that hour is really okay okay
[02:07:55.960 --> 02:08:05.480]   this is the virtual remotes virtual insanity the house band for office hours i can't even they
[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:12.520]   did this in real time no no no this is later but they are but they are playing remotely with
[02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:20.040]   each other right no well it's it was done over time so okay um but but it's it's really good you
[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:25.720]   should listen it's a house band baby you can find yeah you can find this all you can find this all
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:31.080]   they have their remotes they have their own band this is all the other realers i think
[02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:37.240]   these are really good musicians not like oh we got together yeah really really good stuff and so
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:42.280]   it's um and we're gonna break down to like saturday we're gonna talk about how the song got
[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:47.960]   built in you know because it was it was all recorded remotely so everybody records their own pieces
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:54.520]   it gets all recompiled into pro tools it gets um it's uh anyway yeah so so it's uh that's that's
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:09:00.440]   that was a discussion today about it um but we're gonna do a two-hour discussion later um on it and
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:05.000]   it's it's really amazing you know the the we're talking about gotten to a conversation about
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:11.320]   if you're into this stuff man this is like this is like a gravy baby this is just like mmm now let
[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:16.200]   now we offer after hours we literally when i'm not on twitter something like how i'm working if i
[02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:20.040]   don't have to be talking to somebody i literally just turn it on play the background i'm just listening
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:24.760]   to people problem solving and it's like the ultimate open open so open office but the office
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:30.440]   hours themselves between seven a.m and nine a.m. pacific standard is is really a more focused like
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:33.960]   we just answer questions one after the other whatever questions you have around virtual i would say
[02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:38.200]   we're gonna i really i mentioned this last week i think you've almost invented a new form of media
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:45.880]   where you have a presentation and then people uh in a in a multiple box interacting doing following
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:52.120]   along asking questions is so cool i mean we're gonna try some of that in our uh in our uh club
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:56.760]   twit because it's just the way to affect my plupi my plupi experience will probably be in that format
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:02.760]   what's funny is is that i thought that i thought that the i thought that it would be um hard you know
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:07.480]   we've always told people don't ever have more than four people or five people maybe in a in a
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:13.400]   panel yeah now if we get below 12 it's hard oh this is really hard so many 12 people here
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:16.920]   because we because all we're doing is asking questions and so you have to have the right group
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:21.320]   of people to answer all those questions you know and so you need a lot but figuring out how that
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:25.880]   all make how that all works is not just technology it's the people you know you have to have
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:30.920]   and it's just an amazing group of people that have office hours dot global thank you Alex

[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:57.160]   gonna do one on people are freaking out that tywan semicon doctor raising pricing by 10 to 20
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:01.000]   percent because they underestimated the cost of their new process node is gonna somehow make the
