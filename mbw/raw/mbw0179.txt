[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:22.080]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers all the Apple
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.560]   stuff.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.840]   And here he is, the Apple Guy, back from the Seychelles,
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.560]   which is, I believe, a kind of Apple.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.440]   It is.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.680]   I don't know if they have any Apples there,
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.680]   but they've got lots of coconuts.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.020]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, the Pixel Corp.
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.400]   Pixel Corp.tv for the podcastpickscore.com
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.920]   for the amazing guild of multimedia artists.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.880]   Any specials or anything you want to talk about?
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.160]   Not this week.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.040]   But very soon, we are just finishing up a whole new Pixel
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.240]   membership, and it should be coming out.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.480]   A lot of people are going to be excited about it,
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.080]   but it won't come out for another week or two.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.840]   So soon.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.640]   Coming soon.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.200]   No, but we're going to be doing-- the one thing I will say
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.400]   is that if you're not subscribed to Mac Break video,
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.720]   we're going to be doing heavy--
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.120]   you should because we're going to be doing heavy coverage of--
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.960]   Oh, this is Mac World?
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.600]   This is Mac World.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.480]   So we'll have somewhere between 25 and 50 episodes
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.200]   that we're going to do over the next week.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.000]   You're so crazy.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.520]   Now, you don't release it all at once.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.320]   No, we put it out a couple of day
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.280]   because we need to take care of our bandwidth provider
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.240]   and not crush them.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.400]   Because it gets-- people get kind of excited if we put too
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.880]   many on at one time.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.640]   So yeah, it'll be over about two or three weeks
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.640]   that you'll see all of it.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.160]   Good, good, good, good.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.840]   That's why, by the way, Andy Enocho's not here.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.520]   It's kind of ironic.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.760]   He's in town, but he's not here.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.400]   He's prepping.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.760]   He's going to be-- we're going to have--
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.120]   he's going to be covering-- he's going to be doing some
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.120]   of the stuff.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.320]   Justine Esrich's going to be doing some.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.160]   I'm going to be doing some.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.600]   Fred's going to be doing some.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.640]   Merlin's going to be doing some, right, Merlin?
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.120]   Merlin!
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.080]   Oh, man, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.160]   He's still throwing him right at me.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.520]   Why everybody?
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.040]   This is Merlin.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.960]   That's Mac Break.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.840]   Where the hell did he come from?
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.640]   Coverage from my chair.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.640]   Excited about the iPad?
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.240]   Are you going to do Tiny Town?
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.520]   You know, I should.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.440]   I got to be there anyway.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.400]   I'm going to be--
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.760]   Come do tour.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.760]   There's any other friends at all.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.280]   Come do Tiny Town.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.320]   And I should probably do a thing there.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.800]   Do it.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.160]   Do Tiny Town with us.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.720]   Tiny Town is--
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.280]   People hate it.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.800]   Alex, people hate when I do stuff in Macworld for you guys.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.200]   They hate it.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.720]   It drives them crazy.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.240]   They love it.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.240]   Merlin, you are the most sensitive person I know.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.200]   He is the most--
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.000]   I'm not the most sensitive person you know.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.640]   I got it.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.160]   I got it.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.120]   See what he did there?
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.240]   He is the most beloved figure on the internet today.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.960]   And yet, constantly-- look at it.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.200]   He's always looking over his shoulders.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   See that?
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   He just doesn't realize how beloved he is.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.920]   I love doing it.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.800]   I love the--
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.920]   So nobody's saying, don't let Merlin do Macbreak.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.960]   He's-- nobody's saying that.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.440]   Right?
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.880]   We want him on Tiny Town.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.240]   All right.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.920]   I'll do Tiny Town.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.840]   I'll take Tiny Town.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.520]   All right.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.880]   Tiny Town is that little alleyway at Macworld.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.920]   Although just between you and me,
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.200]   I think it's going to be the whole show at Macworld Expo.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   Of all the little booths, the smaller companies.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.720]   Right?
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.160]   I actually think it would be a good idea
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.640]   to limit the booth size at Macworld.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.040]   I mean, really, because it would make it feel more even.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.040]   Because in the past, it's been this thing that--
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.840]   It's monster booth.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.080]   You can't-- how can you compete with that?
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.160]   And then you feel smaller.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.640]   I think everybody should just have a 10 by 10 booth.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.560]   That's kind of what it's like with--
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.360]   You know what you could do also is you could have everybody vote.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.640]   And you get a booth based on how interesting people think you are.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.840]   So Panic gets File Maker Pro's booth,
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.560]   and maybe File Maker Pro gets independent enterprise--
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.320]   Wouldn't that be--
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.600]   Wouldn't that be justice?
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.240]   And Adobe's off in the corner somewhere.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.640]   No, I guess Adobe's pretty important.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.560]   They're popular.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.680]   Yeah, sure.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.040]   Hate to not have air.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.200]   How would I tweet without air?
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.120]   No, but Photoshop.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.640]   Hey, that's one of the big stories right today.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.040]   This morning, I went to the Apple store as I am
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.120]   wants to do, because I like to buy something
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.800]   right before they introduce anything new.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.960]   Did you buy a MacBook?
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.080]   I came so close, I thought, any day now.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.920]   But then I decided not to-- they closed the store,
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.880]   and I thought, oh, shoot, I missed the opportunity
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.600]   to buy an outdated piece of hardware.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.440]   But then they came back on and--
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.120]   Lucky me, it was Aputure 3.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.600]   But I do think we're due for MacBooks, right?
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.080]   The rumors are getting rich.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.520]   Yes, that the pipe is emptying and preparing for something new.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.280]   Merlin, you want a 10-inch, don't you?
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.760]   Of course, who doesn't?
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.720]   Well, I'm just happy to have anything at all.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.760]   I like my MacBook.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.680]   I got a unibody MacBook, and I like it a lot.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.760]   If I--
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.200]   Isn't a unibody kind of like a unitard?
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.760]   I mean, isn't it?
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.600]   Well, I don't score well.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.160]   I'm not going to lie to you, but I don't know if I'm mine.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.000]   If they make a sexy new iPhone, I would think about that.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.280]   Now, typically, they announce iPhones in March, right?
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.680]   And they ship in June.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.720]   So I think you're safe on the iPhone deal.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.800]   I'd like to give my lady a new computer.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.440]   She's gone a pretty old one.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.760]   So if they-- I'm going to-- this time,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.880]   I think I'd look for the bounce in terms of losers
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.440]   abandoning perfectly good computers because of the future.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.280]   And I would want to scoop up maybe a MacBook Pro or something.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.880]   I'm dying for-- I love that 13.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.320]   I have a 15.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.600]   I have a 13 at the house that I'm slowly moving everything
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.880]   over to.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.400]   I think I'm actually moving to a 13
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.720]   because I can't open this one flights.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.220]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.280]   Of course, remember, you're going
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.400]   to be having a pad in a couple of--
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.320]   Sorry.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.920]   I'm still a high school kid.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.640]   I just can't-- I can't not laugh.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.400]   You will have an iPad soon.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.560]   I often thought I needed an iPad.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.440]   Yeah, I thought so too.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.560]   I'll never forget going to--
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.320]   Yeah, see, I'm really smiling.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.160]   He knows where I'm going.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.920]   House of Prime Rib.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.320]   And it was Ben Durbin, I think.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.400]   Now, this is a place where you go and they have a meat
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.840]   blimp, a zeppelin that comes around and it's got a--
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.640]   It floats.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.920]   It's got the side of a calendar.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.560]   It's a steer-derigable.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.120]   It's a really-- it's a good size.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.760]   And you could-- they introduce you to the guy who's
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.640]   going to slice the meat for you.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.120]   There's a lot of moos.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.680]   And inside is a beautiful, beautiful prime rib.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.120]   Yes.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.360]   And you can have the King Henry cut,
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.160]   although Merlin has taught us that you actually-- what do you
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.320]   get?
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.880]   You get the Prince William cut.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.160]   And then you just take seconds.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.200]   Is this a tip?
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.920]   Should I show the tip?
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.720]   The tip is--
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.040]   For all you come in a Mac world Expo this week?
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.720]   Well, it's good.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.280]   You go there and it's like it's not cheap,
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.520]   but it's like not that expensive for what you get.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.560]   And basically, their menu is four kinds of rib roast,
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.040]   and you pick which size you want,
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.880]   and you get all the size with it.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.040]   Now, I would say you can save a little dough
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.640]   if you want to get the typical-- what's
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.880]   called the house of prime rib cut.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.720]   If you're very hungry, you can get the King Henry the 8th.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.440]   I think most of you just get extra bone.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.320]   And then at the end, they will offer you another slice.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.680]   And you should--
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.160]   Aha.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.400]   That's the key.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.960]   You will get offered more.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.440]   So we're going to make your money back.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.080]   Right.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.200]   Interesting.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.760]   So we're sitting there, and we're
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.480]   all contemplating large cuts of meat.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.480]   Really, the only debate is King Henry,
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.360]   or the 8th of the 4th.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:30.640]   Yes.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.800]   Or Hank Sank, if you really like the middle ground.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.000]   And Ben Durbin orders fish.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.520]   He doesn't eat meat.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.800]   So Merlin says, would you like an iPad with that?
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.480]   Little did we know three years later how prescient he was.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.480]   We're still waiting for the--
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.440]   Can I play a little jingle here?
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.440]   Just one little--
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.440]   [SINGING]
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.240]   Thank you.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.240]   I missed that.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.480]   You need to be back.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.440]   Thank you, Merlin Man.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.120]   He saved us from continuity.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.160]   Back to the MacBook Pro, i5 and i7.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:07.600]   Yes.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.320]   New processors from Intel.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.560]   It seems like it would make sense to put them in there.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.320]   Absolutely.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.800]   And of course, the PC manufacturers
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.800]   are going to be using them.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.880]   And usually Apple has first product place.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.480]   So I think it's absolutely certain that a new MacBook--
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.200]   in fact, I was stunned this morning when it was just
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.120]   aperture 3M.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.920]   No, I think that within the next two weeks, that's my guess.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.640]   By March 1.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.960]   You know what's ironic, though?
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.720]   If they announce it this week, then the whole thing about saying,
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.760]   we don't want to do Macworld because we don't want to have
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.480]   to have this announcement scan.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.160]   They announce aperture and MacBook Pro.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.160]   And they could have iPad.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.280]   They could have waited a week.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.560]   Paul Kance just got to be fuming.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.520]   Got to be fuming.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.080]   And actually go straight to their stated reason why they didn't
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.360]   want to do it, which is--
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.400]   I don't know if this is an actual phrase they use,
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.720]   but we have Macworld every day at hundreds of Apple stores.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.160]   So they're going to get the bounce.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.760]   Apple poor Paul Kance back.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.520]   They're going to benefit from Macworld,
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.160]   even if they're not participating in it.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.600]   Would that be cool if they had a prime rib Zeppelin
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.400]   at the Mac Apple store?
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:11.880]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.680]   You're saying they roll in the dirt, a bowl of beef.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.920]   They're extending their brand, and they're reaching out.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.600]   But it'd have to be white.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.120]   Like white kind of shiny--
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.800]   So it would be metal.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.000]   It'd be like a white there.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.760]   Or well, what about the unibody blend?
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.800]   There wouldn't be any knives.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.320]   It would just cut itself.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.240]   It would just--
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.200]   I'm sorry, Steve doesn't believe in knives.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.080]   Yes, exactly.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.880]   So you'll be using our special--
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.960]   You can tear it off with your hands.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.600]   Right.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.480]   There's one utensil.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.320]   That's all you need.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.200]   That's all anyone should need.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:40.560]   That's right.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.920]   Calcanus says it's going to have solar panels.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.720]   I got a very angry email.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.480]   I've been getting them all for a while saying,
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.560]   every time you have Jason Calcanus on the network,
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.880]   I'm going to withdraw $2 from your donation
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.080]   because of his prank on everybody the day before the iPad.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.840]   But it seemed to me that he was doing a parody
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.760]   of the overheated rumor mill, and it was pretty clear.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.240]   Can you not do parody anymore?
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.480]   Because people will not understand it and get angry.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.320]   I think that the main thing is he just--
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.080]   he took the press down down a path
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.200]   that they didn't quite understand.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.120]   That's what I love.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.320]   That was a part of that part.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:21.920]   See it?
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.760]   I'm going to be silly.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.720]   Because well, this is the latest rumor.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.040]   Well, I'm the last person in the world
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.120]   to tell people they have to be constrained to one role
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.480]   or the other, but he has not typically been a paradist.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.280]   I see.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.560]   So had you said it--
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.200]   had you said it, it would have been obvious.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.360]   Yeah, because I don't care.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.680]   And you would have gone way more over the top, too.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.200]   And I don't know.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.760]   It's at the same time.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.440]   You know what?
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.040]   This is not even worth wasting breath on.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.320]   It's a shame that he did it.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.440]   Since you are a little angry, you're a little irate.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.560]   No, I'm not angry.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.760]   I've just-- I've never met the guy, but I don't want to talk
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.920]   trash, but I think it was a disappointing--
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.920]   I think it was a disappointing thing to do.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.120]   And I think it's--
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.160]   I don't know.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.000]   It's not like I'm some big audience advocate,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.400]   but he's got a lot of people who inexplicably follow
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.000]   what he does.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.960]   And I think it was kind of damaging.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.280]   And don't.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:11.720]   OK.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:11.800]   So--
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.760]   There you go.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.080]   I love parody that don't get me around.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.000]   No, a poison viewpoint.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.200]   But you do make a point.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.280]   You don't do regularity regularly.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.120]   And you don't perhaps had that fine-tuned width
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.320]   that Merlin has where you pretty obviously
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.920]   when Merlin makes a joke.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.880]   You know it's a joke.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.280]   Well, you look at somebody like Kevin.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.800]   Kevin Rose, who I guess may or may not have access
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.600]   to these things, every time Kevin says something,
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.840]   regardless of how likely it is to happen,
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.680]   that becomes a story.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.040]   And I think it's reasonable for somebody
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.720]   who's as interested in public attention
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.400]   as Mr. Calcanus is to be aware that he's
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.000]   going to get a bounce, whether he deserves it or not,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.360]   based on having said something that's
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.480]   up about a hot topic.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.920]   And it's like, almost everybody who pulls an April Fool's
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.560]   joke finds a way of mentioning the date.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.400]   Right.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.440]   Just to kind of let you know the tongue's in cheek.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.480]   You know, it's not--
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.000]   I don't know.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.480]   It's hard.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.240]   This social media stuff is complicated.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.760]   But I think we owe it to people to--
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.040]   Yeah, I think that--
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.280]   OK, in his defense, I will say it is a new medium.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:06.800]   And we don't--
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.600]   I mean, Twitter, it's not--
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.000]   well, you've managed to make Twitter
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.640]   a really great platform for--
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.880]   Yeah, but everybody hates me because of it.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.320]   I'm using it as a jerk platform.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.400]   But it's funny.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.000]   So many-- oh, god, I put that on.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.360]   I'm showing his Twitter.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.000]   You know, I love the baseball mitt--
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.960]   the catcher's mitt photo of the drawing of you is so good.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.480]   Isn't that nice?
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.640]   You can see.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.680]   But it is true.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.400]   But what it really shows more than anything else
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.800]   is I'm changing the topic.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.560]   It's called a segue in the business.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.880]   Is that a couple things.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.760]   First of all, it shows how much it's a lesson
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.640]   and how much people do listen when a quote unquote
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.000]   "pundit" says something.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.480]   That's true.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.320]   There's a lot of weight.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.480]   And if you're going to be a pundit,
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.840]   be a pundit is what you're saying.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.680]   If you're going to be a parrotist, be a parrotist.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:57.040]   And the criticism, whether it's fair or not all the time,
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.640]   the criticism people make of the web and of blogs,
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.480]   and particularly of things like Wikipedia,
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.360]   is that there's not a journalistic standard of fact checking.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.200]   And that's why it frustrates me sometimes,
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.000]   if you're asking, that there's so many people who
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.800]   make a career out of guessing what's going to happen with things
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.240]   without any kind of basis other than listening
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.480]   to other people who are guessing.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.960]   Let us, the pros, do your guessing for you.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.520]   The second it shows you that this is a company who makes things
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.920]   that get people really excited.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.600]   Like, when's the last time you saw that much buzz about a rumor,
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.240]   about an HP ad for that?
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.200]   That's obvious.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:28.700]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.600]   I mean, that's not a slam, but it's just a way
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.720]   of saying that, obviously, there's
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.960]   a lot of brand equity behind the stuff that Apple makes.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.320]   And people have an emotional connection with it
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.880]   that you don't see with that many other kinds of things.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.880]   And that's what's frustrating to people who buy commodity PCs
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.680]   and then don't understand why quote unquote "famboys"
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.680]   like, it's so exciting.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.880]   My friend Adam from Adam Lisigor.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.240]   Like, he just had a great essay about why he thinks
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.440]   it's OK to be excited about the iPad.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.400]   It was very well done.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.440]   I recommend people read it lonely sandwich.com.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   And it's just a really wonderful way of saying, hey, look,
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.880]   you know, this stuff-- you can't tell what this stuff is going
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.680]   to be.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.560]   But if past is prelude, I do tend to trust this company
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.040]   as a place that makes interesting things.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.080]   And this, based on my experience, was like the iPhone,
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.760]   this is going to be something that I think will be a third device.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.760]   You know?
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.760]   I'm with you.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.000]   In fact, I think we're all in agreement.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.600]   I don't think there's a-- no, of course, we're accused
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.680]   of being rabid Apple fanboys because we're doing that.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.480]   I'm not saying I even 100% agree with that.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.520]   I think it's going to be fine.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.360]   I think it's going to be pretty.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.360]   I think it's going to be great.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.680]   But I do respect people to--
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.680]   I just fuck ed you.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.560]   I just fuck ed you.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.120]   OK, I had a comment.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.760]   I forgot I had the Mac turned on there.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:44.400]   I want to talk more about this.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.280]   But we've got to talk about squarespace.com.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:51.280]   Our fine sponsor, the people who do that incredible.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.400]   It's web hosting.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   It's a CMS.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.280]   It's both.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.040]   It's great software for running your website, blog, or photo
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.680]   album or any number of things, but also a great server as well.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.400]   So it does the hosting.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.440]   And it does the software.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.400]   It's what we use for Twiplog and a bunch of other sites
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.400]   that we're putting up right now.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.600]   And it's just I don't want to think about it.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.880]   I don't want to think about installing it.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.960]   I don't want to think about getting HTML
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.800]   code or I just want to be able to put it up.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.280]   And I think about the content.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.240]   And man--
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.240]   I want to use it.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.280]   They want to send me--
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.560]   because I have no ethics if they wanted to send me a freebie.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.040]   I would--
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.040]   Oh, no, we'll set you up.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.480]   They'll be very glad-- we use them for our inside Twiplog.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.640]   We'll be very glad to set you up.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.880]   This would be great for your Tumblelog.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.160]   It'd be great for--
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.080]   no, I know you use Drupal 43 folders.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.320]   That's a very powerful system.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.240]   But think of all the--
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:36.760]   Two-hour--
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.240]   Yeah, all the work that--
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:38.720]   Why is that--
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.520]   Well, you know what?
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.040]   It is, Leo.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.160]   It's really hard to find a good app for posting from an iPhone.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.280]   And the iPhone on this--
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.360]   The iPhone app--
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.360]   It is.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.760]   I mean, you're going to blog more because you can do it
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.640]   right from the iPhone.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.240]   It's incredible.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.880]   Great stats, great templates that you can completely
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.720]   customize with drag and drop.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.880]   You'll never go offline because their virtual server
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.000]   technology guarantees bandwidth all the time.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.080]   I can just go on and on.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.840]   But the best thing to do is try it for yourself.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.960]   You can import your WordPress or your Typepad
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.840]   or your Blogger blog right into it.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.480]   Export to so you're never stuck in.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.960]   Comments in all just go to squarespace.com
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.000]   and use the promo code MACBRAKE.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.080]   Squarespace.com/macbreak to sign up for the free trial.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.800]   And if you use a promo code MACBRAKE
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.840]   when you decide to buy, and it costs as little as $8 a month,
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.920]   you get 10% off.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.720]   squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.760]   We thank them so much for their support of MACBRAKE weekly.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.760]   But now we must get on with the conversation at hand.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.160]   Marlon Mann is with us, as well as Alex Lindsey.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.600]   And he's in town for a Mac world expo.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:47.200]   We'll get him on many, many times on MacBRAKE this week.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.880]   Boy, we are all over the place.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.000]   But I like it.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.760]   I'm not saying anything wrong with it.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.520]   What did you think?
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.800]   As long as we're talking about journalistic faux pas
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.920]   of the little Bruja Ha over at TechCrunch, did you follow that?
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.880]   I did not follow the TechCrunch Bruja.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.840]   Merlin, did you?
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.520]   Daniel Brzolowski, we all know him.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.760]   He's a young guy.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.920]   He's under 18, I think.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.800]   And I wouldn't have mentioned his name, except that he himself
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.840]   has blogged the story.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.440]   Are you talking about-- oh, you're talking
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.920]   about the MacBRAKE incident.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.960]   I thought you were talking about Wiley Coyote,
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.240]   trying to catch the road runner on Google campus.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.040]   That's another one.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.760]   But we'll save that for next week.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:23.960]   Should I?
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.320]   That was very interesting.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.440]   He's a guy who's been-- Daniel has been doing it.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.120]   I went and I thought his name sounded familiar.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.520]   He's been here.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.200]   He started this-- I mean, he's 14.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.840]   And he wanted to come up here.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.440]   And he said, but can my mom drive me?
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.680]   I mean, really, seriously, he was a kid.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.080]   Very enthusiastic.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.440]   He reached out to me a few times, asking me to be on podcast
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.120]   and stuff and do stuff with him.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.160]   He does the Teen Tech conference.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.880]   However, he's a kid.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.000]   He made a mistake.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.640]   I'm tying this into the Calicannis episode.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.640]   Calicannis is an adult.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.360]   But I think a kid were going to give him a little more slack.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.240]   But he did something that would--
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.480]   You should probably tell people precisely what happened.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.520]   It was reprehensible.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.280]   I mean, if an adult had done this,
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.880]   if I had done this, my career would be over.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.320]   He solicited apparently a number of companies
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.960]   saying, I'll give you coverage on TechCrunch,
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.800]   which is simply the most influential tech blog out there
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.320]   right now, certainly for the web and startups.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.000]   I'll give you coverage if you give me a MacBook Air.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.440]   And one of the companies--
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.560]   I mean, did they verify it?
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.080]   Was it really that--
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.080]   Was the quid pro quo?
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.440]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.120]   Did he really say quid pro quo?
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.120]   Was that really what happened?
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.240]   Well, he hasn't said exactly what happened.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:42.680]   TechCrunch, to their credit, because he is a kid, didn't say.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.920]   But what they did do is they pulled every article he
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.360]   ever written for TechCrunch, saying, well,
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.320]   we can't be sure that any of these other articles are clean now.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.160]   Wow.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:51.640]   And--
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.160]   Like a shattered glass, kind of thing.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.480]   Right.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.400]   And nobody's gainsaid, the company who wrote about this,
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.280]   saying, hey, we were just approached by a TechCrunch writer
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.640]   saying, we'll cover you if you give me a notebook.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.360]   So-- and nobody said that didn't happen.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.160]   So I don't know.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.040]   I mean, unless somebody steps forward,
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.640]   Daniel's own post, the last thing he wrote, which
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.440]   is four days ago on his own blog, which is Danielbrew.com,
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.240]   was, the line was crossed.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.520]   In transitive passive voice.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.120]   Mistakes were made.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.240]   And somewhere or another, a line was crossed that never
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:25.800]   should have been.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.600]   At this time, I do not want to go into details.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.960]   But I will publicly say, I'm truly
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.080]   sorry to my family friends.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.960]   TechCrunch, and especially the tech community.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:37.440]   Yeah, if I were him, just a little advice, Daniel,
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.680]   I'd tell the whole story, say exactly what happened.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.280]   Yeah, it would throw yourself on the sword,
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.080]   because you don't want us talking about it without the details.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.800]   And say, I'm a kid.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.960]   It will never happen again.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.360]   And I think people will give him that slack.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.360]   Whereas now, Jason, who didn't commit nearly the same crime,
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:57.680]   is getting pilloried for parody.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:02.760]   Which I guess I feel like I can see how the press would
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.280]   miss the parody.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.200]   Well, it's not their job.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.840]   And they started listing what he said.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.400]   I mean, to me, it seemed like it was very obvious.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.720]   There's three cameras and solar panels
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.680]   kind of gave that away.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.520]   I don't know.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.240]   Well, you know, again, it gets to a deep ratio.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.960]   I don't really have that much of an opinion
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.560]   about what happened with TechCrunch,
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.320]   except in as much as I don't follow TechCrunch closely.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.880]   But my sense is--
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.760]   pardon me-- my sense is that that's
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.120]   something that Michael faces on a pretty regular basis,
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.800]   is concerned about who he decides to cover and why.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.440]   Again, I don't have an opinion about that.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.680]   I do think that's something that he sweats.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.400]   And I think it's something that everybody sweats,
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:43.360]   because even the most prestigious journalist at this point
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.320]   is being questioned.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.080]   Absolutely.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.320]   Any number of levels right now.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.160]   I mean-- I think the credibility in government
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.120]   and journalism--
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:49.600]   Right.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.000]   --has got me out.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.840]   We have to be beyond suspicion.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.880]   We have to be like Caesar's wife.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.040]   And yet, and yet, we've all done things
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.040]   that somebody could make a big thing about.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.640]   I mean, we've all--
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.400]   Well, haven't we?
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.120]   Like, Microsoft brought me--
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.800]   I didn't realize until I was there.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.800]   But Microsoft brought me up for this like,
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.720]   we want to show you our search stuff.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.440]   One of these-- you know, everybody-- a ton of people.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.160]   I saw Michael there.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.720]   I saw Gina there.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.240]   I don't do those, by the way.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.280]   For that very reason, I don't do that.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.080]   I never accept travel from any tech company.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.440]   What about sneak peeks?
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.600]   What about your--
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.000]   So you're an author.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.200]   I don't sign NDAs.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.600]   I don't do embargoes.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.280]   I don't do-- but for this very-- the reason--
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.560]   the exact reason you say Merlin, we have to bend over
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.600]   backwards, I think.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.520]   I get that, and I respect that.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.440]   But here's one problem, in my opinion,
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.560]   is that when you get into stuff like disclosures, which
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.640]   are obviously a good idea.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:47.200]   If you are-- if you're a shareholder for a company
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.520]   that you've got the beat for, there's a continuum here.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.280]   There's things where we could all look at it and go, yeah,
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.080]   that quacks like a duck.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:54.960]   That's what this is.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.720]   Versus, oh, that's fine.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.080]   The continuum was what makes it hard.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.560]   There's all kinds of places in between.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.320]   And the part that I think is challenging
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.120]   is that by itself, a disclosure means very little,
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.280]   because if people don't trust you, disclosing something
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.920]   will never make them trust you.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.480]   All you can really do is lose credibility by not disclosing.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.520]   It's a really-- it's a no-win situation.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.760]   And in a weird way, a lizard-brain way,
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.760]   the more you disclose, and the more
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.840]   you're constantly kind of excusing these things
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.320]   that may or may not matter, in a way,
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.720]   the more suspicious people become of you.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.520]   I think somebody's constantly going, oh, by the way,
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.000]   that meeting I had was not--
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:32.520]   you know what I mean?
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.280]   I don't know where the line is, because the real credibility
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.160]   comes from doing something well over time
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.760]   and having people come to trust that you're giving them
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.400]   this great dough.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.920]   But this is why this discussion is actually very important.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.120]   And this is why, as you said, Merlin,
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.400]   it's a different world we live in,
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.400]   because there are all these new people, new bloggers,
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.240]   who don't have a tradition.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.440]   They don't have an ethics agreement that they've signed.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.760]   Well, I think they don't have the experience, too,
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.760]   to know what.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.920]   Sometimes they think that's whatever what he's doing.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.320]   Well, that's why I think it's good for us to step up and say,
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.040]   hey, it isn't what everybody's doing.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:04.600]   And there is--
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.880]   I never knew-- people have sent me stuff.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.920]   And I never knew that you're supposed
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.480]   to return review copies.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.480]   I have not taken-- I don't think--
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.400]   my deal is this.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.760]   If you want to send me something,
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.800]   and I have no strings as far as even having to open it,
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.480]   let alone send it back or write anything about it,
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.480]   that's fine.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.520]   I think the trouble becomes, if you're somebody like--
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.280]   my sense is somebody like one of the gadget blogs,
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.720]   they generally send stuff back.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.520]   They don't keep it.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.840]   And they have office staff, unlike you.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.320]   Or like Andy gets a review copy of all these.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.720]   And he has a very strict policy of returning all that stuff.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.220]   Right.
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.680]   As do I, although I try not to even accept review units,
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.400]   because even that to me--
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.040]   now, I have a luxurious position,
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.760]   because I can afford to buy them.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.680]   Whereas most freelancers, especially,
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.440]   they're not going to buy everything they have to review.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.680]   And we get stuff all the time that we're--
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.800]   You're in a double position.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.240]   Because you have a business.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.400]   They send stuff to you to test for a variety of things.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.080]   And we have a situation.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.680]   And there's a whole variety of--
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.560]   You can kind of firewall yourself off from that.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.320]   We have stuff coming in all the time.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.760]   I mean, the thing is, especially in the kind of software
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:14.840]   that we look at, it doesn't make sense for us to buy everything
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.000]   we're going to talk about.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.200]   Because it's like $6,000 for a piece of application.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.320]   Yeah, if it's a key light or something.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.720]   But I'm very clear with people.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.840]   I'm interested in looking at--
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.840]   you're interested in looking at your software.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.840]   I'm not promising that I'm going to do anything with it.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.960]   I'm just not--
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.200]   I'm interested in taking a look at it.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.160]   Well, that's what a lot of ethical conversations come down
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.440]   to is, well, but I won't be influenced by it.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.480]   And I think that that's where we get in a little bit
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:49.080]   of trouble because we-- then I mean, I hear this all the time,
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.600]   mostly from press who want to go on those junkets.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.760]   That's a really popular thing to do is go to those--
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.480]   It's huge.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.000]   It's huge.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   So huge.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.320]   I've been invited to Israel, to India, to--
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.840]   I've been invited all over the world.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.000]   I've been invited to Dubai.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.520]   I got invited to Dubai.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.840]   They were going to fly me first class.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.360]   I did too.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.200]   Yep.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.680]   Same one.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.240]   This is out there.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.240]   Now let me ask you this.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.160]   Now I think I know how Alex would answer this, honestly.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.520]   So I'm going to put this out awkwardly.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.120]   You get an NFR for something.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.960]   That's a not for resale.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.280]   That's a review copy of it.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.160]   Yeah, that usually means--
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.480]   I think the technical way--
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.080]   my understanding of an NFR is that you're
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.600]   going to review a piece of software.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.280]   If you get an NFR, do you delete it?
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:29.280]   No.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.400]   Do you like the bit of it?
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.280]   Software-- I think software's a little different.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.440]   Software has such a little value.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.120]   It's just bits.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:37.920]   Final Cut Pro.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.040]   If you got an NFR, Final Cut Pro, would you never use it again
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:41.880]   after you--
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.880]   I have purchased three copies of Final Cut Pro studio.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.360]   You know you see one.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.840]   I would really like to get a free one.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.760]   But you know Alex because I could get a free copy of Final Cut.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.720]   In fact, the most of the reason I don't
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.320]   is because I don't want the entanglement that that involves.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.920]   And I don't want to go through the pain.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.240]   I'd rather buy it.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.120]   Yeah, and for a lot of software that we just buy it.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.280]   And then for other ones, we get--
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.320]   But that's a good point.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.040]   Final Cut is so expensive that that's more than just bits
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:08.960]   at that point.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.840]   And I've got friends who--
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.960]   I have no problem saying this.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.040]   I've got friends with independent software companies.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.040]   Again, I don't review stuff.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:20.080]   But I've got friends who are like, hey, here's
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.120]   serials for all of our apps because we just
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.920]   want you to use them.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.440]   Is that--
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.480]   That's OK, I think.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.920]   I don't think that's a problem.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.920]   No, no, I don't think that's a problem.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.280]   And we distribute--
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:30.920]   I'm also in this.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.760]   I'm kind of in this situation where I also am a software.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.000]   We make software.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.680]   Well, you're in this double--
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.440]   You're in a triple or quadruple.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.720]   You have two other hats.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.120]   But what the thing is is that I'm happy to send stuff out.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.520]   We get reviewers who email us and say,
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.400]   I don't spend a lot of time trying
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.120]   to make them prove that they're going to do it or report back
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:51.640]   to it.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.160]   I just want them to have it in their hands.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.920]   And I figure, well, if they have it in their hands
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.600]   and if they're playing with it, I don't want to send them
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.400]   a time to copy.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.960]   I don't want them to delete it.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.120]   What I want them to do is just let it sit on their computer.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.920]   And if they use it, if they don't, they don't.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.880]   Eventually, they might talk about it.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.560]   And it's not just press people.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.760]   It's people who I think are influencers, so to speak.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.280]   And that can be people at schools.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.640]   They can be people at-- and we do that all the time.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.800]   And I guess from a software perspective, most of them
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.000]   don't ever talk about it.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.560]   And we don't feel like they owe us anything.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.160]   And to your point, Merlin, I guess in that case,
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.320]   it is a gray area.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.880]   And so we all do in that sense.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.720]   I mean, I've done that.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.960]   In fact, to be honest, it hasn't happened in a while.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.380]   But Apple has sent me just unsolicited just
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.600]   iPods have shown up on my desk.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.440]   And I have sometimes returned them.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.960]   But we have a couple here that I've just kept because I don't
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.320]   use them personally, but we use them to test the video
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.080]   to make sure it works.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.280]   We won't want to reach.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.960]   But I should return those.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.480]   I think you're right.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.720]   Well, you actually got to it with a couple of things.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.920]   One of them is when you talk about embargoes.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.360]   Personally, anybody who whatever knows me
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.280]   knows that I'd loathe the whole PR blast thing.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.360]   Because I've never-- I don't think I've ever in my life
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.120]   written anything from a press release.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.480]   Not just because I don't think that's necessarily
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.520]   illegitimate, but I think it's a shame that so much content
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.920]   has to originate in a corporate announcement.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.800]   And I feel beholden.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.800]   I end up owning people and believing people with the
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.640]   impression that I owe them a favor because of what?
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.720]   Access.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.760]   And when you talk about these embargoes, now let's say
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.600]   you're Johnny Blogger.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.760]   And you've got your little tech blog spot account.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.840]   Not that it's not condescending.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.880]   But you've got something you're trying to bootstrap.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.840]   And some company that's well known notices you and goes,
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.040]   hey, what if we send you a laptop to check out or whatever?
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.280]   Are you going to say no?
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:39.760]   Sure.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.960]   I mean, if you're somebody who went to the Columbia
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.200]   journalism school, yes, you will.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.320]   But I don't think that's something that's super clear
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.560]   to a lot of people.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.760]   And to the other point about the NFRs, to your point, Leo,
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.960]   specifically, I think there's new economies of scale in
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.280]   software and the web.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.360]   The people are still sorting out.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.040]   And so yeah, I mean, you call it influences.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:28:59.760]   You call it whatever.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.560]   You get Mac Heist.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.480]   People are losing their shirts in some ways on Mac Heist.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.280]   But they're very happy to get their app in front of
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.400]   thousands and thousands of people.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.040]   So the incremental cost of giving somebody an NFR is next
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.600]   to zero.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.200]   Well, that's definitely how we calculate it.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.280]   I mean, when we're looking at the cost of our software,
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.200]   I mean, there is definitely a cost that people are.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.920]   But I mean, when we talk about marketing, the cheapest
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.600]   marketing in the world is sending someone who is talking
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.760]   about what we do, some software that they can test and
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.280]   figure out.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:32.200]   And that's not something that we consider a heavy cost to
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.560]   our, you know, what we do.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.600]   I have to take a break.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.560]   Speaking of sponsors, sponsors, I have to take a break.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.960]   But by the way, I'll tell you something after this commercial.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.840]   But we're going to be back.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.720]   Merlin Mann is our guest.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.000]   It's so great to have you, Merlin.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.480]   Always thoughtful, interesting conversations.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.120]   I don't know about that.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:50.880]   It's great to be here.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.840]   And funny hats.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.360]   We love having you on.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.880]   Alex Lindsey, there's the funny hack.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.560]   There we go.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.320]   I don't have a funny hat.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.160]   Alex Lindsey, well, hey, I have a whole hat wreckful.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:29:59.440]   Funny.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.560]   You pick one.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.120]   You don't have to wear it.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.440]   And we'll be back with more Mac break weekly in just a
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:04.680]   little bit.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.880]   I do want to finally talk about it.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.440]   How about you three?
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.760]   We started this conversation half an hour, maybe 45 minutes
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:10.920]   ago.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.480]   Hey, look at that.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.800]   He's a Yale University class of '57.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.400]   That's pretty cool.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.280]   50th annual reunion.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.840]   That looks good.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.040]   They make the old men wear hats.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.800]   It's kind of funny.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.840]   I want to mention our friends at Citrix and go to my PC.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.680]   Now this is a commercial, just so you know, just to be
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.200]   full disclaimer.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.360]   This is a paid commercial.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.880]   This is like radio and TV.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.240]   This is free media paid for by advertising.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.280]   And I admit there is some issue with that.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.120]   And I've grappled with that.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.280]   So what we do is we only do one advertisement every half hour.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.240]   We do ads only for things that we used before they asked us
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.960]   to do ads for them.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.280]   See, now you sound cagey.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:52.960]   I know.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.720]   You can't win, can you?
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.000]   Right.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:55.920]   But God, I love go to my PC.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.400]   I was the one that I go to my PC.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.800]   It's as confidential as a--
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.160]   We have to do ads.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:03.840]   I try to do it.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.360]   I know.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.360]   I agree.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.800]   And I think that as long as we say this is an advertisement now,
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.800]   it's OK.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:13.960]   Just so you know, we try to do the donation route.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.600]   And I just didn't--
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.200]   Nice hat.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.760]   Wouldn't have been able to do what we're doing today,
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.360]   if it weren't for our great advertisers.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.800]   So they support us.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.480]   We support you.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.200]   One of the things we ask our advertisers to do--
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.560]   and I think it's great-- is give you free trials for a month.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.640]   Not because you're pressed, not because they want to influence
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.200]   you, but because I believe-- and I think they do too--
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.920]   that the best way to decide if something's right for you
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.200]   is to try it first.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.280]   Go to my PC is remote.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.800]   And the other thing we try to do with the ads
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.720]   is we don't do tricky, tricky ads where we go, you're going to die
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.040]   if you don't have go to my PC on your computer.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.400]   We say the features-- and it's kind of old-fashioned--
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.360]   features and benefits.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.600]   Choose for yourself after you try it.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.800]   I think that is a clean ad.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.840]   That is the kind of ad I like to do.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.400]   And fortunately, we have such good advertisers
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.200]   with so much integrity that they agree.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.200]   Go to my PC is a remote access product.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.480]   From these guy Citrix, they do it for--
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.200]   it enterprise they are the kings of this stuff.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.760]   But what they've done is they've taken their remote access
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:16.000]   and they made it really easy to use, very secure, 128-bit SSL.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.960]   So there's never been an exploit with Go to my PC.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.080]   It's really secure private stuff.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.000]   Very easy to install.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.080]   In fact, if you go there right now, go to my PC.com/Macbreak.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.200]   And we give you that URL, not because you can't go anywhere else
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.440]   on the website, but because then they
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.800]   know that you heard this on Macbreak.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.600]   And try it for free for 30 days.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.480]   I think you'll see why this is what we use.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.000]   It's very fast, very easy to install, take you 30 seconds.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.440]   And important to mention, Mac and Windows.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.040]   And there are a lot of remote access products that are not
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.200]   both.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.920]   You could talk to a PC from a Mac, talk to a Mac from a PC,
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.600]   PC to PC, or Mac to Mac.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.680]   Use any program, work on any file, check email, access network
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.800]   resources, all like that.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.680]   Go to my PC.com/Macbreak.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.160]   I invite you to give them a try.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.160]   We thank them for their support.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.720]   And we give you 30 days of unlimited use free.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.400]   And that's the best way to find out if it's right for you.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.040]   Go to my PC.com/Macbreak.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.000]   Great conversation.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.680]   And I think one will have more on the ethical issues.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.800]   And I don't know if there's really any clear resolve to,
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.360]   but I think it's such an important thing to talk about.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.360]   I do think it's important to say what happened.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:27.480]   So a lot of times, I try to make it clear when I'm talking
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.880]   about a piece of software hardware that if it was sent to us
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:34.040]   as a review copy or as a test piece of device or whatever,
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:39.400]   I'll say this company sent this to us to play with or this
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.960]   company sent us as a test as opposed to--
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.320]   This closure is the minimum.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.080]   This closure is the minimum.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.200]   Can I also-- I'll kiss your butt a little bit, Leo,
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.400]   because this is another side of this
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.240]   that I think is interesting.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.560]   And then we should talk about Macs.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.880]   But the other side of this is interesting
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:34:01.520]   is I think it's interesting how many people use advertising
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.360]   as a deliberate nuisance.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.880]   And so in your case, you're doing--
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.360]   you call it a DJ read, right?
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.360]   You're saying this is something I like and use,
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.040]   and they pay for this, and that's cool.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.240]   You're doing the equivalent in some ways of when TV shows would
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.920]   be sponsored by Ajax or whatever.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.120]   Now, what I think is interesting is people who go like,
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.920]   oh, blah, blah, I've got this website.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.000]   I take all these ads.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.880]   I'm filling every conceivable corner of my site
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.400]   with run-of-network ads.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.120]   And for those of you who don't know run-of-network ads
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.960]   are the very low money earning--
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:36.000]   I don't care where this goes as long as it goes somewhere.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.120]   And then what do they do?
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.400]   Well, if you give me $1 a month, you won't have to see ads.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.800]   OK, so no, that does-- to me, that shows disrespect
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.680]   in two ways, in my opinion.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:48.320]   First of all, it shows disrespect to your users,
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.200]   because it says we're going to give you something
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.200]   that we perceive to be a nuisance in order
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.600]   to get you to give extra money.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.520]   But even in worse, in some ways, it
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.320]   says to your advertisers, we consider
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.120]   you to be a nuisance for hire that we happen to make money
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.120]   from.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.120]   And I think that--
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.120]   Yeah, that's a good--
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:03.640]   I like that.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.280]   I hadn't really thought about that.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.720]   I'll tell you the real reason we don't do--
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.080]   and I get this suggestion all the time.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.600]   People say, oh, please, do an ad-free supported version.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.960]   And I just never have considered that.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.040]   For one reason, I know it doesn't work.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.760]   But for the other reason is we have such a techie audience
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.480]   how long before somebody makes a feed of that ad-free version.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.480]   But--
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.480]   And I don't want to do the whack-a-mole.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.480]   But you're right, Merlin.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:27.280]   I think that's a really even another good thing that kind of--
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.840]   I hadn't really thought of, but you're right.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.720]   It kind of implies that somehow we're using you,
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.960]   if you're not going to give us a buck.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.240]   And I think that when we look at advertisers for our shows--
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.360]   and I think that this happens mostly with the shows that are
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.400]   here--
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.920]   we're working with advertisers that we use.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.680]   We're working with advertisers that we think are useful.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.360]   There have been a lot of advertisers for this week
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.960]   in photography, for a variety of other shows
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.800]   that I've turned down.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.920]   I've just literally just said, we're not going to have those--
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.440]   we don't use their products.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.280]   I'm not interested in that.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.920]   When we talk about Squarespace or we talk about Drobo or Audible,
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.560]   these are all things that we use.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.800]   This is all part of our pipeline.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.760]   And that's something I'm very comfortable having them as
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.160]   advertisers.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.800]   I'm not comfortable.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.400]   We've had a camera manufacturer that wanted to advertise on
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.240]   Twip, and we don't use them.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.800]   That's a little tricky.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.480]   They said, I can't have them on the show.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.840]   They want to spend a lot of money with us.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.040]   And I was like, I can't have them on the show.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.240]   None of us use that panel.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.240]   Because it's big editorial disconnect, too, because people
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.160]   listen to the show know.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.800]   I was like, I was like, I can't go down that path.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.040]   That's right.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.800]   When I first signed up-- last thing on the side--
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.040]   when I first signed up with my old ad company, who was great
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.800]   people, really good to me.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.440]   And really, I think they did some good stuff.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:42.440]   I was like, I want ads for Macs on my site in SpacePans.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.000]   Most skin notebooks.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.480]   And they were like, do you understand how advertising works?
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.520]   And I was like, yeah, people give me money, because I'm a
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:49.360]   blogger.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.840]   And they're like, well, actually, people give you money,
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.520]   because they want people on your site to know about
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.400]   something they don't know about.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.440]   And so a lot of times, people don't advertise.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.960]   I mean, certainly people like the Cokes and Pepsi's and
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.160]   Visas of the world want to build brand presence.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.080]   But I was much more likely--
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.080]   Let's add Google to that.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.880]   If you saw the Google ad on the Super Bowl.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.400]   Sure.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:08.840]   Sure, sure.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.320]   I mean, they're about creating an emotion and a connection
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:15.000]   and kind of escalating the relationship with existing
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.480]   users.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.480]   But a lot of times, reasons people I add are not because
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.800]   the people there already use it, it's because they don't.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.560]   So that becomes a challenge too.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:27.080]   If you say, well, I've never used this, well, we don't care.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.480]   What we care is that we piggyback or whatever you want to
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.000]   call it onto your success with your audience in order to
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.120]   expose them to something that they don't know about.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.640]   So anyway, if you're going to do anything for money as an
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.760]   adult, you're going to have to accept that it's a money thing
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.200]   and it's going to be awkward.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.280]   And you've got to figure out what you're comfortable doing
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.000]   and then do it.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.520]   Because there's always going to be somebody who thinks you're
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.080]   a giant hypocritical jerk.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.760]   And then there's always going to be people who are like, oh,
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.000]   come on, that's nothing.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.320]   So it's really up to you to decide this stuff and then
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.240]   just stand behind it.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.000]   You've got to make a living.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.560]   At some point, it helps.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.840]   Somebody has to-- you've got a kid, I've got a kids.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.600]   I always have kids.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.160]   We've got to make a-- we can't do this.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.880]   We do it for fun.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.560]   And I think sometimes that's one of the things that
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.640]   actually happens is that people say, no, no.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.800]   You can't make money on this because you're clearly
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.080]   having way too much fun.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.240]   You should be doing this for free.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:21.480]   Well, I mean, the thing is that the quality of our coverage
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.040]   increases when we make revenue on it.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.520]   I mean, that's the way I look at it.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.160]   I can't afford to do the kind of coverage that we do for it.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.880]   Whether you're looking at covering Macworld or we're
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.360]   going to be covering PMA, basically
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.160]   the photographic Macworld and NAB over the next couple months.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.280]   I can't commit to flying people down and shooting
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.040]   and editing and all that.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.080]   You spent $6,000 for CES.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.080]   We lost $7,000.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.120]   Yeah, at the heart of it, we would not
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.640]   be able to spend 40 minutes talking about why we accept
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.320]   advertising if we didn't accept advertising.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.160]   Let's be honest.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:49.680]   All right.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.960]   I got to ask you about Aputure 3.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.440]   Has anybody tried the new Aputure 3?
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.360]   I played with it a little bit.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.600]   So Apple closed down the Apple Store this morning, Tuesday,
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.400]   the 9th.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.040]   And everybody got excited because we
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.080]   thought it was new Mac laptops.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.640]   No, but it is Aputure.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.040]   I think we've all agreed earlier.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.440]   Might have gone by so fast that we didn't hear it,
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.760]   that we do think the new Mac laptops are imminent.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.880]   And I'm not going to buy a laptop till they do it.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.520]   And maybe this is one of them games of chicken that Apple's
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.440]   playing with me.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.640]   Like we're not going to announce the new laptops till Leo buys it.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.240]   And I'm not going to buy a new laptop till Apple announces it.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.680]   So we'll see who blinks first, Apple.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.320]   It just depends on how much Leo needs a new laptop.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.960]   I need it.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.800]   But Aputure 3, I have to say, looking at what they've added,
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.720]   which is face recognition, GPS huge.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.440]   By the way, both of these from iPhoto,
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.120]   although I'm told that the facial recognition is
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.760]   more flexible even than the iPhoto.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.360]   And then finally, regional correction, a la Lightroom,
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.520]   that I, a long time Lightroom user,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.200]   am actually now looking at Aputure.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:54.880]   Well, and for me as a long time Aputure user,
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.080]   I just never really-- for some reason, Aputure worked for me.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.680]   I never really got my head around Lightroom in the way.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.760]   And there's no reason for it other than I had Aputure first.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.960]   I got comfortable with it.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.000]   All my photos are in there.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.760]   These are both programs, by the way, that
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.080]   pro photographers, but even serious amateurs
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.200]   use for their workflow.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.400]   They're kind of prosumer.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.200]   Well, pros use them too, believe me.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.360]   But they use it for workflow.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.840]   So you take a bunch of pictures, you bring it in,
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.360]   you import it into Lightroom or Aputure.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.160]   You use it to select the photos and to correct the photos,
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.040]   not Photoshop style correction, but kind of basic correction
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.560]   with curves and white balance.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.200]   And now, both with Lightroom and Aputure,
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.040]   you can do a little bit of Photoshop style retouching.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:33.920]   They have a brush.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.280]   And in the past, people would ask me, which one should I get?
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.000]   And I'd ask, well, what do you want this program to do?
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.200]   If you wanted to manage massive numbers of photos for you
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.680]   quickly and easily, I would normally
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.800]   say Aputure is the way to go.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.480]   And you want to do basic overall corrections.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:52.280]   If you want to have a lot more control over editing the photos,
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.320]   then Lightroom is going to be more what you want.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.200]   I think it has pretty good asset management.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:56.600]   It does.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.880]   I personally think that the asset management
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.960]   within Aputure is better in Lightroom.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.640]   I think that the editing tools in Lightroom
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.120]   are significantly better.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.960]   I haven't tried Aputure since version one.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.320]   It was so slow and buggy, I said, I'm not going to do this again.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.160]   So now I'm ready.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:08.720]   I'm watching it.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.880]   And I think Lightroom for a long time up until this release.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.200]   And I haven't tested it enough to know
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.200]   whether this release is going to be better than Lightroom
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.440]   as far as the editing stuff goes.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.880]   But I do think that this is something
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.960]   that you had to come out.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:27.080]   I've been dying for this to come out because I've been really--
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.680]   I still play around with iPhoto, because I want the facial
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.080]   recognition.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.560]   More importantly, I wanted the GPS.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.600]   Stuff now, one of the cool things about the spatial recognition,
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.560]   you can see how they've refined it a little bit.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.800]   So if I can refine it to events--
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.800]   the reason this is important is if I'm a wedding photographer
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.880]   and I have lots and lots and lots of different events
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.600]   that I've shot, I don't want to try to find
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.720]   the face of this bride across all the photos I've ever taken
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.440]   in Aputure.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.160]   So I can confine that in Aputure to just this event that I'm--
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.600]   That's kind of a nice--
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.400]   And that's the kind of pro feature that you don't need an iPhone
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:03.400]   to do in Aputure.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.200]   So you can have facial recognition in a per project basis
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.160]   as opposed to globally.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.160]   That's great.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:13.360]   And but having the extra stuff that you had in iPhoto,
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.000]   you knew that it had to come in Aputure.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.360]   That was the minimum sync up that it had.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:23.960]   But also, this location, brush-based controls,
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.360]   I think is going to make a huge difference for a life loss.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.440]   I've had it for a long time.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.440]   It's a whole whole version.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.840]   It's catching up in that area.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.800]   And it was the one thing that maybe would keep me from trying
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.440]   Aputure again.
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.800]   So I'm definitely going to try it.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.200]   There's a free download.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:35.840]   And then what is it?
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:36.920]   $2.99?
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.760]   It's $1.99.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.880]   OK, so it's cheaper than Lightroom.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.040]   I believe it's $1.99.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.920]   I think it's $99 upgrade if you already have it.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.560]   And there is a version that you can download and test.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.360]   The other thing that Lightroom is good is it's--
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.160]   no, no, no, no.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.240]   And if you would care about this, but it's cross-platform.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.400]   So if you buy one license, you can run it on a Mac
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.320]   and it doesn't really matter a lot to me.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.720]   Well, nice.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.800]   I had been an iPhoto user for a long time.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.680]   When I started getting just incrementally more serious
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.640]   about photography-- not really serious.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:09.200]   But I bit the bullet and tried that Lightroom 2.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.400]   I'd looked at Lightroom 1 and Aputure.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.160]   And in both instances, it felt like way more
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.320]   chrome than usefulness to me.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.800]   Lightroom 2, for me, was like a revelation.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.640]   I mean, I--
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:24.120]   I mean, iPhoto is really easy to use.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.960]   But the thing that Lightroom does that you kind of,
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:29.160]   I think, teased at is regardless of your level of expertise,
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.160]   it's meant to scale.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.520]   And boy, when you peg your CPUs with that thing,
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.920]   you know about scale.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.800]   It's a hog.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.480]   But what's neat is when you import from a card or from a disk
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.920]   or your phone or whatever, you have the option of, first of all,
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:46.160]   tagging everything, which, you know, tags can be kind of stupid.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.000]   But they're super useful when you're managing giant sets of data.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.160]   So in this instance, I could say, add all these
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.720]   to the following collection.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.880]   Do the-- add the punch filter or add--
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.960]   or all the-- what are those called, not filters,
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.520]   but the presets.
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.200]   So you could have this whole series.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.040]   You know, in Photoshop, it's kind of janky to deal
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.920]   with a large number of photos to do the same thing.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.960]   It's not really meant to do that.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.960]   Lightroom is meant to take it 500 photos
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:16.200]   and automatically white balance all of them according to this.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:16.720]   Really handy.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.880]   Tag them with all of this and then organize them
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.400]   in the following way.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:24.080]   So if you're, of course, a lot of photographers,
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.560]   especially if you're shooting in RAW,
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.640]   you start getting in the habit of deleting photos
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.120]   you don't like the second you take them,
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.680]   which is a giant tip, by the way,
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:35.600]   so you don't fill your computer with 20-megabyte files.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.640]   But then, anyway, that was the thing for me.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.160]   That was such a revelation.
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.920]   And it really does become like a part of your workflow,
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.160]   especially if you're using something
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.960]   like the camera's preference pane,
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.720]   where you can set it to automatically import them
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.080]   straight into the app of your choice.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:51.680]   Do you guys use that?
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.640]   You guys use the camera.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:53.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.640]   And Aputure definitely lets you do a lot of that as well.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.000]   So it is very important to be tagging on the way in.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   I think they're very con on the way in.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:58.800]   At this point, you know.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.320]   It's very important to be tagging your photos
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.640]   as they come in, because that's the time
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.800]   when you have control over it.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:07.120]   Usually, for me, I try to back those cards up almost.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.880]   You know, as the moment that I, you know,
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.240]   I try each event, I end an event, and I back,
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.640]   and I pull the card into Aputure.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.160]   I don't want to have it sitting in my, you know,
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.600]   I don't want multiple events on it in general.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.120]   So usually that's pretty easy.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:19.920]   That's awesome.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.080]   That's got to be a habit for somebody like you.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.880]   That's got to be the habit of a videographer too,
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.320]   because anybody I know who shoots tons of video
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.800]   has to become a cataloger.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.080]   And here's an interesting--
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:30.920]   - Right.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.680]   - About the Sharpie, the Sharpie, everything.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.000]   - Well, here's an interesting thing.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.640]   Some can plan, it's time me in the chat room.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.760]   Aputure 3 now supports video clips.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.600]   Which--
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.440]   - And that I didn't even know about.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.280]   - Huge.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.160]   - Because a lot of us are using video.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.360]   - Given the integration with the iMovie,
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.280]   I'm really envious of the integration with iMovie,
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:49.760]   because I love that the horribly hobbled iMovie,
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.840]   but I love that that's a, or garage band.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.120]   I mean, that's where Apple is getting one thing.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.320]   - I'm thinking I'm going to have to go,
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.040]   go Aputure 3 or L.A.M.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:57.880]   It's--
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.880]   - Yeah, I think it's going to be very strong, okay.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.960]   (imitates explosion)
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.080]   - Now it has a plugin, it's had for a while,
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.040]   a plugin architecture.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.560]   Are people writing the plugins?
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.480]   - We wrote some.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.320]   - Yeah.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.040]   - And it's a good plugin architecture.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:13.480]   - It's a little, there's some roundabout stuff with it
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.560]   that isn't as integrated as we'd like it to be,
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.320]   or at least hasn't been in the previous versions.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.680]   I don't know about this version yet.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:23.160]   So it'll be interesting to see what we can do.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.640]   This is a major upgrade.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.440]   - Yeah, no, it took them a long time to do it.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:30.720]   I mean, they definitely, they really rewrote
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.120]   a lot of big chunks of things
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.120]   to really speed it up as well.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:34.960]   - Yeah.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:35.800]   - It's a lot of new features,
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.960]   but it's also a lot of performance.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.320]   I think if you add to me,
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.120]   'cause I've been using a third party app to add GPS track logs,
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.480]   so the ability to do that,
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.800]   the face recognition, the ability to now handle video.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.400]   - Well, and the big, and the reason the video
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.240]   is so it's light room, doesn't it?
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.800]   - Well, and the important thing with the video
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.960]   is that what you'd end up with a lot of times
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.480]   is that when you were bringing something to Aputure,
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.400]   and say, you know, by the way, you have a bunch of video files,
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.360]   'cause you're shooting video on a,
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.600]   you know, and every still camera,
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:00.960]   you know, you're not gonna be able to,
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:04.000]   two years from now, you will not be able to buy a still camera,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.360]   standard still camera.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.200]   It doesn't shoot video.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.120]   I mean, almost all of them do now.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.760]   And so, when you import it, you just have to have--
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.640]   - This has built in, the ability to manage both of those.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.360]   - HD video support, clip trimming.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.520]   - Right.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.600]   - You have complete audio abilities.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.200]   You could create a JPEG from a frame,
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.480]   detach the audio file.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.840]   - Well, you know what, suddenly,
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.920]   the increased hobbling of iMovie and QuickTime--
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:27.760]   - Understanding.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.760]   - Is trying to seem clearer and clearer.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.400]   - These are pro apps now, right?
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.200]   - Well, yeah, I mean, like, what they did to QuickTime,
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.000]   the QuickTime Player app is just a--
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:34.840]   - Oh, that's a bomb.
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:35.680]   - That's a shame.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.960]   I mean, that was such a great little app for just doing,
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.040]   I got a thing of my daughter.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.240]   I just pulled off my 7D, and I wanna just trim it.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.840]   Well, you know, I've gotta open it in iMovie,
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.280]   which now doesn't support all kinds of different exports
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.160]   that it used to.
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:50.240]   We talked about this.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.080]   - Yeah, it is--
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:52.560]   - I'm talking about something that I like for Lightroom,
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.400]   just while we're at it.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.800]   And it's a little bit of an off topic,
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.400]   but it's really cool.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.240]   Is that okay?
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.080]   Can I plug this in?
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:47:59.920]   - Yeah, go for it.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:00.760]   - I'm not paid for this.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.600]   - I know what you're gonna say, though.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.120]   - The flicker plug-in?
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:03.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:07.920]   These are, these are, he's done a ton of plug-ins.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.760]   I believe that--
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.760]   - It's one of the most ungrouper-friendly--
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.240]   - It's one of the most ungrouper-like,
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:14.000]   it's gotta be one of the most ungrouper-friendly
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.480]   interfaces on my machine.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.360]   It's really--
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.760]   - It's ugly, I admit it.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:18.960]   - It looks like an engineer did it,
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.720]   but this guy, Jeff Riedel, has a really neat plug-in.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.840]   And so, you know, whatever, there's probably a million needs.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.080]   What I like about his is it,
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.600]   again, if you are a person who uses taxonomies,
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.560]   and you say you got pictures of your kid
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.680]   that you only take it a bath,
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.120]   you only want your family to see.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.600]   If you add a food tag to it,
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.840]   you give a given tag to that,
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.080]   the plug-in understands that whenever it has
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.640]   the following tags, give it the following level
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.040]   of privacy or publicity.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.400]   - It is one of those interfaces where you get
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:46.600]   this big, long form.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.080]   - Well, you know what, it's kind of a set it
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.000]   and forget it app.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.960]   - But you don't see that form after you--
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.520]   - He's got plug-ins, by the way, for Facebook.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.440]   Same basic plug-in for Facebook, Flicker, Smugmug.
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.280]   Jeffrey's great.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.000]   Jeffrey wrote the book on regular expressions, which is--
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.920]   - That jacks.info, man, this is the guy.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.440]   - This is the guy on Regis.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.080]   - Hey, Leo, you wanna see the international hand gesture
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:07.920]   for regular expressions?
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.920]   - Yeah, please, yeah.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:13.440]   (laughing)
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:14.520]   You need an S in there.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:15.520]   (laughing)
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.520]   - You should hold it out for you.
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.880]   It's not funny on the radio.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.360]   - Okay, yeah, we'll just have to,
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:21.960]   you have to watch the video if you wanna see it.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.080]   - You did an amazing--
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.240]   - Only people who do a lot of Regis would laugh at that.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.600]   Basically, you did a lot of--
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:32.600]   - S slash, S slash, hand gesture slash everything I just said.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.920]   - You did a lot of back and forward slash.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.320]   By the way, just as a note for the quick time is that,
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.600]   I think QuickTime 7 is still on--
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:40.440]   - It's still there.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.760]   - You can still open it.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.960]   - Well, you have to install it.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.480]   - It does send utilities.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.320]   - I don't know if-- - Yeah, you took out
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.360]   the pro option and they took out a bunch of the--
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:48.680]   - It's very frustrating.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:52.760]   - In fact, I stopped using Safari to download my files
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.800]   because Safari opens the new QuickTime
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.560]   and I can't save to disk.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:58.400]   - Yeah.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.760]   - It's just driving me nuts.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.160]   It was such a bad idea and it's another reason
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.960]   to hate Snow Leopard, which I do.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.000]   I do.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:06.840]   - No, I'm getting better.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.200]   - I have only installed on one machine
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.960]   and I will not restore it on anything else.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.360]   - Don't even get me started.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.880]   - Well, we know you, we know how you,
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.280]   we know what happened to you.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.440]   - Took me until two weeks ago to figure out
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.600]   what was wrong with my Mac.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.880]   - Nobody understands this, Murrell.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:21.720]   - You know what it was?
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:22.560]   You know what it was?
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:25.880]   I had my developer release of that
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:29.400]   that was blocking no log that I could find showed it.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.880]   Maybe I'm just an idiot, but I had a developer release
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.600]   that was blocking the update.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:35.680]   - Oh no.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.200]   Somebody just told me, you can't run Aputure 3
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.480]   on anything but Snow Leopard.
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.320]   Is that true?
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.160]   - Nice.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.000]   - Nice.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   - Oh, you bastards!
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.440]   You did it!
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.720]   - I have to admit the one I'm testing it on
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:49.240]   and it has Snow Leopard and I didn't, didn't occur to me.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:52.200]   - We feel like we've developed an application
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.560]   that people are gonna really enjoy.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.440]   We've looked at how people use this
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:00.080]   and that's why you need a uni-body laptop to you.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.800]   - Some bitches, you did it!
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:05.480]   - Oh God, is that really true women?
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.840]   I have to, I have tech specs, I can't be right.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.680]   Does it require 10.6?
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.240]   - Probably it's probably got some of the cool--
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.720]   - No, no, no, it's a lie.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.960]   It works on 10.58.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:16.480]   It will work on Leopard.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:17.320]   Thank God.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.440]   - Oh, I think it's that if you're running on Snow Leopard,
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.440]   it runs a 64-bit.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.280]   I think that's the--
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.120]   - It is a 64-bit app.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.320]   - A 64-bit app, so it'll just run a lot faster.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.240]   - You guys run in 64-bit?
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.360]   Does it make a big difference?
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.200]   - No.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.320]   - It can't with speed and depending on what you're doing,
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.960]   but the time that we really need 64-bit
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.640]   is dealing with RAM issues.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.920]   - It addresses more of your availability.
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.480]   - Yeah, but we don't have that problem typically
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.320]   with Aputure or Final Cut.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:41.800]   What we really have that was it's 3D apps
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.920]   when we're rendering something really, really big.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.520]   And that's when you really need 64-bit.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.280]   - Or a lot of RAM when you're opening a very, very large
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.680]   file and having lots of layers.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.760]   - It's all about RAM.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.640]   - You know, sometimes you really need the 64-bit.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:55.480]   - Okay, we got--
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.440]   - I flipped it off 'cause my biggest performance game
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:01.360]   was every preference pane I use had to relaunch the app
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:02.200]   every time I go.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.560]   (laughing)
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.400]   - Part of the map.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.240]   - It's too big preference.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.080]   - There's a small one.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:06.920]   - You can see the preference panes has to reload the whole,
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.280]   if I wanna, no, Hazel.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.280]   Oh, sure, let's reload the preference pane.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.200]   (groans)
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.800]   - All right, we're gonna do our picks to the--
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:14.640]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.880]   Shake your fist there, Merlin.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:16.720]   (groans)
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:17.560]   Yada, yoo!
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:22.000]   We're gonna do our picks of the week in just a second,
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.920]   but we wanna do a quickly and audible pick
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.680]   before we do that, audible.
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:26.960]   Another one of our great sponsors,
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:29.160]   one I have used since 2001 before,
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:33.440]   even before the Twit Network has a twinkle in my eye.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:37.040]   A gleam in my little eye.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.960]   I love audio books.
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.240]   I was listening to audio books
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:43.120]   'cause I had this long commute to San Francisco.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.400]   I was five hours a day, some days I would be listening
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.400]   and it saved my life.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.960]   I would have killed somebody.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:48.840]   Probably didn't save my life.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.320]   Just saved me a lot of time in jail.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:54.160]   But when I was using cassettes,
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.320]   and you'd get a box of 20 cassettes
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.760]   and one would break and you go, I can't do that.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.360]   Or, I mean, it was not good for my blood pressure.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.360]   Then along in 2001, along comes audible.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:04.600]   And man, I'm going crazy.
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.840]   I'm saying, look, I have a diamond Rio.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:09.160]   I can download a book in a minute
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.000]   and I can put it on my Rio and take it with me.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:11.840]   And it was just such a,
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.000]   and you keep the book forever.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.560]   You don't have to mail the box back.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.160]   You don't have to,
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:19.200]   audible.com is the place to find audio books.
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:23.360]   Audible.com/MacBreak is the place to go to get a free one.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.640]   You could sign up for the gold account.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.080]   That's a book a month and your first book is free
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:28.400]   and you can cancel it anytime
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.040]   and the book is yours to keep.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.960]   You should check if you have a,
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:34.360]   if you're something else besides an iPhone or an iPod
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.120]   or an Apple device you wanna play it on,
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.400]   you should check the device center.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.600]   It does work with almost everything.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.780]   The Zoom, the Kindle.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.720]   I've just found out it will work with the iPad.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.560]   It's in the iPad specs that it supports
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:46.600]   the Audible formats two, three and four.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:51.600]   Audible.com/MacBreak is the place to go
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:55.920]   to take a look at some of the most amazing stuff
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.760]   in the world.
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:58.280]   I'm still listening to such a great book.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.760]   If you say Spartans.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.600]   No.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.200]   It's called Shop Class's SoulCraft.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.040]   Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.160]   Oh my gosh, it's such a great book.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.560]   Who was it that told us about that?
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.400]   I don't know.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.400]   I think it might have been Andy.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:11.600]   It might have been, I don't know who it was,
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.600]   but I downloaded it and I'm just so,
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.520]   my I am so hooked on it.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.480]   It is just, it's just a very,
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.760]   it's a philosophical view of the need to do things
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.200]   to understand them and the need to work on physical items
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.040]   and how we're kind of moving away from that.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.880]   And how you, you know,
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.200]   you can't really know something
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.120]   unless you're actually working on it.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.160]   You know, and it's from a very,
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.600]   it's from someone who does work in a shop.
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:35.760]   Works on motorcycles engines.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.840]   No, no, no, it's like it's the modern Zen
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.840]   in the art of motorcycle.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.080]   Yeah, you've been talking about being a,
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.400]   you know, the trades and the,
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.280]   and that we've kind of demean them
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.840]   as something that isn't important,
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.840]   but it actually is very important
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.520]   to our thinking process, you know,
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:52.400]   and then someone who grew up tinkering,
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.200]   I keep on going, yeah.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.200]   I'm gonna recommend this.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.320]   It's just really great.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.520]   Book, and you're on a Merlin since you're here
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:02.080]   and I know you will concur that this is a good book to get.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.520]   Merlin's handle on Twitter is hot dogs ladies.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.760]   Oh, no way, is it on there?
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.000]   Oh, you bet. John Kennedy Tool,
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.160]   a Confederacy of Denses,
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.880]   which is the most wonderful Pickersk novel.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:16.120]   It's just amazing.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.360]   And the story behind it is amazing.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:20.440]   This guy wrote this novel and just kind of put it
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:23.080]   in a drawer, couldn't get anybody to publish it,
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.720]   passed away.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:25.680]   No, he took his own life.
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.520]   Took his own life.
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:28.040]   You know, maybe because he was depressed
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.080]   'cause he couldn't get the novel published, I don't know.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:32.800]   But his mother, who really believes in him,
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.960]   pounded the pavement, went from publishing to publisher,
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:37.600]   got it published, won a Pulitzer Prize posthumously,
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.440]   say that three years past.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:39.880]   Went to Walker Piersi and said,
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:42.160]   please read this, I'm at the end of my rope.
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:45.600]   And Walker Piersi totally championed him and got it published.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:49.160]   And it is considered one of the absolute classics.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:50.160]   You'll have surprise.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.040]   Amazing book.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:54.080]   And if you haven't heard it, Barrett Whitener does a,
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.280]   even if you've read it, Barrett Whitener brings it to life.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.720]   This is a good book for an audio book
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:01.160]   'cause there's so many characters and the voices,
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.560]   just it's perfect.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.080]   The Confederacy of Denses, if you haven't read it
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.320]   or even if you have, this could be your first audible book
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:08.160]   and it's absolutely free.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:13.160]   Just go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.680]   I'm telling you, you're gonna love Audible.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:15.680]   I do.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:17.000]   Give it a try.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:17.920]   Time for our picks of the week.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.840]   This show has been really all picks all the time.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.120]   We've talked about a bunch of software,
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.280]   but Myrtle, I'm gonna let you,
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:27.040]   if we haven't used up your picks, go ahead.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:27.880]   - That's the problem.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:28.720]   I got a million.
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.480]   Gosh, I have so many.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.320]   You know what?
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.160]   I was gonna do kicks or quicks or whatever.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.520]   I'm gonna hold off on that.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.880]   Okay, I'm gonna do an iPhone app.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:37.720]   Is that cool?
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.560]   - Yeah.
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.400]   - Okay.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:43.080]   It's an iPhone app called Siri, S-I-R-I.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:46.440]   Dot com and it's free app.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:47.600]   I learned about this.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.280]   Michael Sippy mentioned this
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.160]   and I guess he knows these guys
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.120]   and was saying it's pretty good.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.080]   Siri is at the heart of it.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:59.920]   Gosh, what does your phone do horribly?
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.000]   Voice recognition.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.480]   I said not long ago that if they should rebrand it
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:07.080]   as accidentally phoning somebody you met once in 1994
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:09.280]   because that's what I constantly do.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:09.840]   I go like,
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:13.480]   - Hi, yeah, we haven't talked in a while.
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.280]   - Play album, okay, computer, deluxe edition.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.200]   Diling, Jane Simmons.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.040]   - What?
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.720]   - Stop, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.080]   - So embarrassing.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:25.960]   - Carrotate, scarrotate.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:28.320]   But Siri is an app that,
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:30.320]   I'm not sure what their model's gonna be,
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:32.600]   but it's a voice recognition app
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:37.080]   that has all kinds of baked in on the road,
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:38.600]   on the go functionality.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.080]   You ask it things and it pulls it up
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.200]   and it finds extraordinary things.
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.680]   So you can say things for example,
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:47.640]   you could say who is Leo Laport.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:48.480]   I did this for myself.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.480]   I said who is Merlin Mann
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.200]   and I found my Wikipedia entry like in a couple seconds.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:53.680]   I can say get me a reservation
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.520]   at House of Primary at seven for four people
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:59.440]   and a staggering amount of the time
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:01.920]   it gets all of the voice right and then does it.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.120]   You can say how do I get to Walgreens?
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.320]   And it does a business search
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.600]   based on your closest Walgreens
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.400]   and then shows you a map on how to get there.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.840]   You could say how far am I from the office?
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.520]   And it will use your office information
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:15.400]   that you enter to show you how far away you are.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:16.600]   This is just scratching the surface.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.280]   This morning I said,
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.400]   I said who is TV on the radio?
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.200]   'Cause I heard this TV on the radio song.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.960]   It pulled up their Wikipedia entry
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:28.360]   and then I said remind me to buy Return to Cookie Mountain
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:31.720]   and it emails me a reminder to go do that.
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:33.120]   So really what I would suggest,
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.680]   it's free, get it, I'm just scratching the surface.
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:38.200]   I just want to get you excited to try this.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:40.360]   Other things it does, what's happening?
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:42.920]   What's happening at seven thirty tonight in San Francisco
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:45.000]   and it'll find events that are happening.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.560]   This just as a voice front end to functionality
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.120]   this is gonna curl your pubes
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:51.880]   'cause it is co-free.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:53.400]   - Too late I'm afraid.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:54.640]   - If they, if they, if they, if they,
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:55.480]   - My goodness.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:56.960]   - And it's like there's endless stuff
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.800]   that I just did that Mac thing
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:01.840]   where I started just doing stuff I knew wouldn't worked
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.000]   but it worked.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.680]   - So see I've heard a lot of people say,
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:06.760]   oh it's, but so you have to speak carefully.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:07.600]   I mean it really does work.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.760]   - No you can be me.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:11.200]   You can be some idiot from the Midwest on 80D drugs
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.200]   and it finds everything.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.360]   It's great.
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:14.200]   - You're from the Midwest.
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.720]   I thought you were from Florida.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:18.240]   - I am with, well originally from Midwest.
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.000]   The, I'm with Michael.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.440]   I think Apple needs to seriously look at this.
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:25.080]   If even if they just buy the technology
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.800]   just buy the butts to put in seats.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.120]   Obviously they have a,
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:32.040]   they have a broader set of commands
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:34.360]   than I'm aware of for the iPhone.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:35.680]   And I'm telling you, you just sit there.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.160]   I just talked to it.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.720]   I said, I said, what's the meaning of life?
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:39.920]   And it said 42.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.440]   - No really?
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:43.280]   - No it didn't.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.120]   - No it didn't.
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:44.960]   - No it knew the joke.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:45.800]   - Oh my God.
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:47.040]   Okay I'm downloading it now.
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:47.880]   That's all I needed to do.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:48.720]   - No try it out.
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.800]   And best of all, so one other quick thing about it.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:51.840]   One and a half quick things.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:55.880]   First of all, it's really a good looking app.
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.000]   And it displays all the information
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.240]   as an I am like stream.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.600]   So rather than having screens
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.480]   that you motally move through,
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.800]   there's a river of all the stuff you've looked at
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.240]   and it remembers your history
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.600]   in case you wanna just go.
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:12.200]   And you can choose to type it in rather than say it.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.480]   And then finally, do go through all of the examples.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.600]   It will periodically say, hey,
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.240]   wanna see how this works, go try these out.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.600]   So you can go through and say like,
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.560]   show me how to call for a cab.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.000]   Get me a cab where I am now.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:25.840]   You know what you can do Leo?
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.440]   You can say where am I.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.280]   - That's cool.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.440]   - And it holds, oh no I need that 'cause I'm on that.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.280]   - Where am I?
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.120]   - I don't show you what happened to me.
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:32.960]   - I am.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.800]   - All right.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.280]   - And it's free.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.040]   - It is free as in free.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.800]   - So I resisted downloading it
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.960]   'cause I didn't want my heart broken
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.160]   and 'cause I'm not using the iPhone.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.000]   So I didn't really matter so much.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.320]   But wow, I'm now very tempted.
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.800]   - It feels I could see this being on other devices
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.280]   for sure, but it's got that,
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.680]   you know, the way the Andy and Gruber described
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.760]   using the iPad in that sense of affordance
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.360]   and speed and integration.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.840]   The software being very tightly integrated
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.600]   with what it can do.
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.120]   I just, it was a joy to use.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.480]   I spent 45 minutes yesterday walking around
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.080]   talking into my phone and it was pretty great.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.960]   It's got, oh, a flight.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.120]   What time does the flight from San Francisco arrive?
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.360]   - This is something that was well suited to you Merlin
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.600]   'cause you like kind of figuring out systems
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.320]   that have their own internal logic and grammar
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.320]   and using them well.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.440]   I mean, that's what you do with Quicksilver,
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.360]   what you do with that new one Quicks.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.600]   - Yeah, well, you know what it does?
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.720]   And it's like, I have not jumped on this bandwagon
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.320]   'cause I'm not an iPad, you know, Rah-rah boy.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.080]   But what does the iPad do?
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.800]   As everybody said, especially Andy,
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.440]   it takes in Neven Mergen, all these guys have been saying this,
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.080]   what does this thing do?
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.320]   One layer of abstraction at a time.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:47.320]   It's taking out the area of thinking about affordances.
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.120]   The computer users have completely had to think about
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.200]   in the past.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.680]   Everybody who loves these giant Unix things
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.560]   with a million radio buttons and clicks
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.080]   and manually changing P lists and all that kind of stuff
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.320]   for the quote-unquote control.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.400]   This is the kind of thing that is made for the iPhone.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.560]   For when you're walking around,
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:05.960]   the only thing that would make this better
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.040]   is if I had a jailbroken phone,
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.080]   wow, it looks like they make it for Blackberry too, cool.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:10.920]   - Oh, that's good.
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:11.920]   - If I had a jailbroken phone,
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.160]   I would bind this to a double click on the home button.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.000]   I would use this.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.600]   - I would use this to be a lot of times.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.400]   - So anyway, check it out, Siri.com.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.520]   - I'm not compensated by them.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.440]   I'm not compensated by them.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.520]   I did receive a free copy of their free app.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.520]   (laughing)
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.160]   - We have to disclose that now.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.600]   (laughing)
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:30.440]   I can't wait to try it.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.720]   Alex Lindsey, you're a pick of the week.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.560]   - I have two.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:34.400]   - Yep.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.240]   - One hardware, one software.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.600]   So my software pick of the week is Aputure, actually.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.440]   Aputure III.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.560]   - Yep, that was gonna be mine too.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.400]   So go ahead.
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.440]   - I ruined everything, didn't I?
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:44.160]   - No, 'cause I realized after I picked it that,
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.000]   wait a minute, that's the first thing we're gonna talk about.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.280]   So, I think it's a huge update.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.920]   I think there are so many cool things that they've added to it.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.160]   And I've just, since this morning got to,
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.360]   I was nuggin' through it this morning at the house,
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.200]   gettin' ready for this.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.640]   And I think it's exciting.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.760]   So anyway, so that's my pick for the week as our software.
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.120]   And I got a new set of headphones,
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.320]   'cause I do that every once in a while.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.960]   - You liked the Edomodix before.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:07.800]   - I did.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.240]   - Oh God, I love my Edomodix.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.880]   - I haven't killed the Edomodix yet.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.400]   They're still alive, but I needed one that was gonna be
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.120]   in my Scotty vest and then one that I could carry outside.
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.080]   So the Edomodix had become part of the Scotty vest.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.160]   And so I got these and these are--
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.000]   - It's the extra dirt.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   - You built the headphones into the jacket.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.200]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.040]   I know what you're saying.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.040]   - It's got a channel, it's got a channel.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.920]   - But the thing is, once you put it in--
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.080]   - No, no, no, no, but once you put it in the channel,
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.480]   it's like such a pain to get it in there
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.320]   and a pain to take it out.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.160]   You're not gonna wash the jacket
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.200]   and you don't wanna take the headphones out,
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.720]   so you just build them in, basically.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.440]   Well, I just, there's been times
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:44.440]   that I've been caught without headphones, so it's part of the jacket.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.440]   - I laughed when that arrived, I laughed, I said Leo,
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:50.440]   really, really, Scott Vest, are you serious?
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.000]   I'd never take the thing off now, I had to take it off for this
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.160]   'cause I didn't wanna be that guy.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.320]   I didn't wanna be like James Headfield with the metallic shirt,
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.680]   I didn't wanna wear the twit.
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.560]   I'm such a dork, it's like a giant nerd fanny pack,
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.720]   it's like a fanny pack that keeps you warm.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.240]   And it's amazing.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.160]   - You know, the funniest thing is that I got the
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.080]   tropic version of the Scottie Vest,
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.480]   and it doesn't have as many pockets as the twit one,
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.160]   and I felt like, you know, what am I supposed to do with this?
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.240]   There's barely any pockets, I mean, there's like 15 pockets
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.160]   in the one, but I'm so used to having the full 22
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:21.160]   that I was a little upset 'cause I now am used to having--
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.200]   - Okay, so we gotta run those, so give us your pick
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.800]   that's the shirt-- - This is a sure head first.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:28.600]   - The sure SE115s, these are the ones that work with the iPhone.
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.880]   - Here's-- - So it has built in mic.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.560]   - It has a built in, I don't buy any that don't have
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.360]   the built in mic. - I don't have the
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.680]   - You gotta have that.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.320]   - I put the triple flanges in because that's the only way
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:39.400]   to listen to music, and then what's nice about it
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.600]   is got the little volume up and back and forth,
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:44.200]   and it also, but here's the bummer, is that it,
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.120]   the microphone is just a little further away
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:49.360]   than the edimotics, and so it's not quite as nice.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.880]   The bass is better, the--
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:53.120]   My one complaint about the edimotics that come
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.760]   for the iPhones, bass is not so good, it's a little,
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.760]   it's not as much as I'd like, this is $120, not $150,
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:03.320]   and the bass I think is better than the--
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.480]   - Sure, I'm just trying this. - Sure than it is
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.800]   in the edimotics. - I have two pairs
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.880]   of the edimotics.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.240]   - And they're great, the ones for the iPhones.
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.280]   I'm not talking about the, there's a lot of edimotic versions.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.040]   - They're higher in the edimotics, which I also have,
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.160]   but I keep one at the gym in my locker room.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.720]   - But the one that has the mic for the iPhone,
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.720]   for the edimotics, I find that the bass isn't as good
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.000]   as-- - You gotta really push him in,
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.320]   but yeah, I got the HF5s, these guys.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.080]   - Yeah, yeah. - Should we get the--
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.880]   - Yeah, he's wearing them for his headphones.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.240]   Yeah, he can't hear us now.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.080]   He's such a jerk that I, oh, he's back.
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.720]   (laughing)
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.600]   - I should have kept my edimotics.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.520]   (laughing)
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:38.240]   - You know, they work with the Nexus One, by the way.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.080]   Very well. - Oh, do they?
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.600]   - Yeah. - Yeah, actually, I'm listening
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.040]   to my Zoom on these ones. - I love my Nexus One.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.880]   I know Gruber hates it, but I love my Nexus One.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.160]   That's what I use for a phone.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.240]   Although now that Siri is out, you might have to go back.
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:54.880]   - I might, well, you might have to return to the iPhone lamp.
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.720]   - Maybe when the iPad-- - It's a beautiful world.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.920]   - It's a beautiful world. - No, no, it's much more
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.600]   beautiful over here in the Nexus world.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.880]   - I'm not kidding. - Wow.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.240]   - The OLED screen alone just kicks it.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.840]   - And kicks it, but I have to look at it.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:07.200]   But I gotta warn you, you're gonna want it.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.800]   - You're gonna want it. - Now, if your Jedi mind tricks
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:11.240]   won't work on me. - You're gonna want it.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.440]   - I like my iPhone.
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.560]   - You're gonna want it.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.400]   - Siri, did you have to do anything to the boot.sh?
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.360]   - No, it worked out of the box.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.480]   - It's supposed to keep your eyes.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.000]   - No, it's not anything like that.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.400]   People think it's like some geek phone.
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.240]   It's not a geek phone.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.080]   It works fine.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:29.080]   It's got voice recognition built throughout the thing.
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.920]   So anytime you get a keyboard, you can say it.
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.320]   It does a very good job of that.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.400]   I love that feature. - Can you quit?
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.960]   Can you quit a hung process with just your voice?
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.360]   - No.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.200]   - That'd be handy.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.480]   - And this is actually the argument against multitasking.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.480]   It does multitask.
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.120]   And there are a lot of times when that's great,
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.720]   but I have in the past had, you know,
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.640]   the equivalent of a beach ball
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:50.000]   where the phone is busy downloading a podcast
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.840]   and then won't answer the phone or something like that.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.240]   So you have to be, but you know what?
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.240]   You just don't do that.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.000]   You learn which applications you have.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:57.840]   - It's a beautiful phone.
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.680]   It really is.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.440]   It's just, it was almost a shame for these companies
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.800]   that the iPhone came out because in any other universe,
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:05.000]   any of these phones would have been like the best thing ever.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:05.840]   - Yeah.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.680]   - Yeah.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.080]   It's only crash during call once.
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.720]   (laughing)
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.480]   And it was because of multitasking.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:14.840]   I completely understand why Apple doesn't want to do multitasking,
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:17.280]   especially on a phone platform.
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.120]   All right, well, I'm just gonna,
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:18.960]   because we're running out of time,
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.240]   I wanna, and I know Merlin, you gotta go,
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.400]   and I have to go, because I have to go talk to Adam Savage,
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.000]   we're getting ready for the Mac world.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.120]   - I've got all day.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:26.960]   - Shut up.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.600]   - We got it ready for the Mac World Live event,
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.400]   which is my keynote at Mac World Expo.
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.760]   It's Friday, 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:38.320]   Please come to Mac World and see Adam Savage, Heather Gold.
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.800]   She's gonna do her, the comedy stylings of Heather Gold,
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.400]   the great Roger McGwen founder of the birds,
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.040]   gonna play some folk music for us,
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:48.080]   and Star Trek, Hard Rock Star Trek parody band,
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.720]   Warp 11 with the world famous Kiki stock hammer,
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.680]   as front lady will play for us.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.840]   So it's gonna be a lot of fun that's at Mac World Expo two o'clock,
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.240]   but if you can't make it, please do come.
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:02.160]   But if you can't make it, you can also watch it at live.twit.tv,
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.640]   and it will be our Mac break for next week.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:09.600]   So you'll be able to hear it, or watch it after the fact.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.200]   - So I shouldn't come here next Tuesday.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.960]   - We are not doing a show next Tuesday, no.
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.240]   Unless Apple comes out with no books or something,
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.240]   then we'll do an extra show.
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:20.400]   We may, you know, Apple's gonna do that to me, aren't we?
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:24.440]   - We're gonna, you know, we'll probably do a show next Tuesday.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.280]   - That's how they get you.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:26.120]   - That's, yeah.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:26.960]   (laughing)
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.120]   - Sons of guns.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.360]   - The Krillin Man is at 43folders.com, just the greatest.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:35.280]   We are so glad to get you back in the fold, so to speak.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.520]   - Thank you, it's nice to be folded.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.520]   - Watch out for the staples.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.680]   So that's really good.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.560]   Fives.com, great place.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.400]   - Fives is down, you know, I got here with that,
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.440]   the WordPress thing a while back.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.280]   I gotta bring it back.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.160]   - Oh, crumb bum, I loved that.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.760]   - Yeah, Kung Fu Grip 43 Folders.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.400]   - That's it, Kung Fu Grip is a good place to go.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:51.240]   That's his tumbler.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.240]   - That's fine for what it is.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.880]   But I'll be walking around at Mac World.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.680]   I'll be in the Omni Group booth on Thursday, Friday,
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.640]   and Saturday, like 130.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:02.240]   If you wanna come see me talk about Omni Focus Ninja Tricks.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.520]   - Awesome.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.360]   - And I'll be around.
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:05.800]   So come say hi, please do, if you see me,
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.400]   please do say hi, I look like this.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:10.440]   - Look at me, I'm in Tiny Town.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.280]   Nice hair today.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.120]   - Trying town.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:12.960]   - Very nice hair, Rowan.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.800]   - Thanks, well, wow.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.600]   - He's got his annual haircut, I think.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.040]   It looks fantastic.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:16.880]   - It's unkind.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.040]   (laughing)
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.440]   Alex Lindsey is the head honcho, the capo di capo
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.520]   of the Pixelcorpixelcore.com
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.680]   with a multimedia guild of artists learning
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:27.880]   and working together,
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:29.920]   Pixelcorp.tv for the great podcasts.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.600]   And that's where to go to get the incredible Mac breaks.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.960]   There'll be 30 to 50 of them from Mac World.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:35.800]   - We're gonna cover a lot.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.640]   - I think we're gonna cover all of them.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.840]   All the booths out there.
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:39.680]   - No, we're gonna get,
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.640]   we're gonna get to a lot of the booths.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.840]   This thing's that we find interesting,
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.840]   Justine, and I, and Andy, and Merlin.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:44.680]   - Great, great.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.560]   - There'll be a lot of heavy coverage.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:47.800]   - Can't wait.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.160]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.000]   We'll see you next week.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.600]   Another Mac break is broke.
