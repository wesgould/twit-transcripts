[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.640]   Via Skype that is currently trying to cooperate
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.120]   It's it it aims to try it aims to please but it leaves you give the impression that if you give it another five minutes
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.200]   It'll sell it's doing its best. You're interlaced now for I've never seen Skype do interlacing before it's always an adventure with Skype
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.320]   I'm like a locally produced carpet for the carpet commercial
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.760]   You are you are watching you watching TV watching a surprise and it goes from beautiful like ten a sec
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.040]   D down to like VHS just we have to put a frame around you
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.760]   Because you're not fully now and then contrast that with a man coming to us from Canada
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.160]   Renee Richie if I'm more he's fully anamorphic
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:58.720]   But he has no audio so it works out that way. What's going on? Hello? I have no audio. Oh no you sound good. It was Chad
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.440]   Chad forgot to push your button. I'm you just Skype one instead of Skype - ah
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.120]   Good to see you Renee you - I have a fresh steaming mug of Apple Kool-Aid to help me through the show today
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.920]   Yeah, look that's beautiful
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.440]   That so the Apple Kool-Aid comes in an Apple mug now it does what you get it at the company store it does
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.600]   You you sound like me. I'm a little I don't know why I'm a little horse. I
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.680]   Have the bronchitis. Yeah, I think I do too. How are you feeling Andy? I?
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.840]   Am tip-top shipshave. I've had a glass of vitamin C only four days ago, so I'm
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.480]   Reming healthy you're immunized
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.280]   So it's not the only thing you share is with Wolverine
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.120]   We talked we told you that you were gonna that this was gonna happen last week now it happened Tim Cook
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.760]   Did the Brian Williams interview on rock center on Thursday? He also did Bloomberg business week a few other it
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.020]   They're they're trotting them around. I'm surprised they didn't call us
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.760]   Mr. Cook would like an interview, okay
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.920]   But no, they didn't you know regime change has happened. Yeah, really well
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.560]   I can't I guess Steve Jobs would handle all that and sometimes he would give interviews, but not so publicly
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.080]   This is the first time in a long time an Apple CEO has you know been so available
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.520]   Yeah, especially when like we're not really attached to anything either now in granted
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.600]   I know what he's attached to he's attached to the plunging Apple stock price. Yeah
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.400]   Yeah, yeah, it's isn't it horrible. It's only up to like the highest 600's
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.200]   No, it's 545 right now, but it is up 15 bucks today. So it's it's come back a little bit
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.560]   It's been a little volatile though. They they plunged from
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.280]   Let's see. It looks like the high point this last in the last month was about 590
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.520]   Down to 5 say 25. So it's kind of in the middle right now
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.920]   Why
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.200]   Well, I think the I think the other thing is that this is probably the first time that Tim Cook could have
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.120]   This is the start of the zone in which Tim is now
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.360]   I think really really used to handling this kind of a public sort of public sort of event whereas it's not as though
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.840]   I mean, you don't you don't get to the level he was at two years ago without being a little bit savvy about how to handle media
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.000]   But it's one thing when you are able to handle
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:23.800]   a network news anchor basically talking and walking with you for a for hours at a time and not even betraying the slightest thing
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.800]   I mean, the fun he didn't really say anything of real importance
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.800]   The most valuable stuff is just the usual stuff. Here's the philosophy of the company. Here's what we take seriously
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.040]   It was big big news the fact that it wasn't a wonderful that the day after everybody was dissecting
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.960]   Oh, wait a minute. He mentioned he mentioned TV, but he didn't refer to it as a hobby
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.880]   He referred to it as and I quote an area of intense interest
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.240]   Before that and after that there was you know, no, I'm sorry
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.120]   I know you're in BC
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.000]   But I'm not even gonna hint at the the idea that we're gonna be doing anything in that space anytime in the next 10 years
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.280]   But it's it's it's really is really is a case of him finally being up there the rear the front doorstep
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.040]   And being able to talk about such the yeah, cuz if the goal was to
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.280]   Get you know, reassure investors in this talk price didn't change at all in the few days since then it's still
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.300]   You know hovering around mid 500s down from a peak of 700. I mean
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:22.880]   Drop but how long has the slide been going on? I mean a an interview like this
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.840]   I of course I have no familiarity with what was going on inside of Apple
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:33.840]   But I've heard stories from people who are ranging such interviews with CEOs of that level and usually those discussions
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.120]   It's it really is like a truce agreement between North and South Korea in 1953
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.240]   I mean, it's two people at a teams of people at tables discussing here is what you're gonna talk about here's
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.080]   But you're not gonna talk about the network saying well look if you're not gonna give us anything
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.800]   There's no reason for us to go there. Well, we didn't say that we said that you're gonna
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.560]   You know, we once we watch long shots of our CEO strolling in a view call a campus setting well happy workers go to and fro
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.120]   We give us that okay, we'll give you that it's not the sort it's not the sort of thing where the the stock starts to take a dump
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:07.680]   Yeah, let's let's start calling networks. Yeah, no, you're right. It was also perfect timing
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.760]   I mean Apple PR is nothing if not masters of timing and all Apple's products has shipped for the year
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.120]   So there was no danger of him saying anything that would be close to a launch
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.400]   And it's also far enough ahead of a product cycle that he's not gonna hint at anything big and is their major quarter
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.120]   So the sales won't be you know
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.640]   It they'll have good news when the quarter ends regardless of what he does on this interview
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:33.880]   So let's talk about the Apple TV thing because a lot of people said oh it confirms there's gonna be an Apple TV
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.720]   It didn't seem like it even was close to that. I think it I'll tell you what I think he was talking about
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.440]   I think it a much upgraded Apple TV, you know
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.560]   Pocket puck Apple TV that replaces your cable set top box. He said when I go in the living room and sit down
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.880]   It's like I'm going back 30 years and
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:56.520]   You know we're we're yeah an our area of intense interest. I think it improved Apple TV. I can't see a TV set
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.680]   Me neither, I never really understood that I
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.240]   That doesn't mean that it can't happen. It means that I've yet to see any argument that says it why they would want to do this as an all-in-one
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:13.800]   But again the main takeaway I took away from that is that I think it was part of the story of we like to take things that
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.800]   Don't work well and make them work better
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:21.920]   This is really an interview that could have aired last year and I bet it can air this without much change next year
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.440]   Because it really is just a parry around specifics when talking about the generalities of what makes Apple Apple
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.080]   But yeah, I agree. I still don't see why Apple would want to develop one specific set
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.880]   What do you what do you think about my idea? They make deals with the problem? Of course is is not Apple
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.040]   Or HBO the problem is the cable companies
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:45.040]   And and the networks who are very afraid of this idea of selling stuff all our cart
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.680]   But it's what it's what consumers want consumers want to be able to turn on a box and say I want three and a half
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.960]   Men and then I want to follow it with Game of Thrones
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.200]   And I don't want to worry about anything else and well, you know, you can build me or whatever
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.840]   But I don't want to worry about anything else and the cable companies hate that idea because
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.240]   Well, they make less money because they sell us a lot of stuff. We don't need because they don't sell all our cart
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.920]   Right
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:15.360]   Yeah, it's really interesting and I'm not sure how much of it is a hardware problem and how much is a software problem
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.520]   I mean granted I've had the same scientific Atlanta cable box on my cable car over the last 10
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:26.360]   I've gone from a trio 650 to an iPhone 5 and my cable box has not changed at all
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.080]   But I think it rightly I think an Apple TV box that's maybe not too different
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.080]   Maybe it has to be a little bit more powerful
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.840]   But if Apple can broker content deals where instead of an app store
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.720]   They have a sort of a channel store and you get the Hulu channel
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.080]   Right ABC channel and all those channels it won't be the same as an app store
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:49.720]   But it will give you access to a la carte programming from these people in a way that they still feel comfortable and still feel like they have a
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.720]   modicum of control
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:57.160]   The thing is I mean anyone who's tried to watch comic book men or on AMC
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:03.120]   Every 45 seconds says do you sorry? Sorry Comcast subscribers. We're sorry direct TV
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.480]   He's been running. Yeah, I mean there the cable the cable companies have always been
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.920]   Has always been very very clear that we will if you think if you think you're gonna disrupt our business
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:19.400]   We could disrupt the good good luck sending sending kids on on on bicycles door to door to deliver your programs
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:26.080]   To each these people cuz you ain't gonna be able to get your content on our exactly right. I'm completely comfortable blaming them entirely I
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.960]   Think if you're a content creator, you'd love to sell directly to your customers eliminate the middleman make more money
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.000]   And another thing why is comedy central HD a premium channel?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.440]   So yes, there isn't there's not a lot of goodwill and reserved for the cable companies, but that's what
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.880]   That's just a just a wind it up. I mean, that's that's that's always been the biggest problem with disrupting TV
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:59.640]   Apple can build great hardware Apple can build great software what they can't necessarily do is deliver a package that will be of benefit to HBO to
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:07.360]   To turn classic movies to comedy central to all these different people and also not step on the toes of Comcast and Verizon and all these other companies
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.160]   I mean it's
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:16.040]   Individual shows have a better chance of breaking through that way than actual channels as we've seen with having all these
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:21.040]   Individual show apps for for the Conan Bryan show for for the daily show of the Colbert report
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.560]   But I'm not sure if the majority of people want to get their shows that way
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.200]   I think they they like specific shows, but they like the idea of I've got HBO
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.560]   I'm spending six dollars a month
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.600]   I have access to it and also can search for any show I want through the same interface that lets me to search through every other
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:41.840]   Show I want right so it's it's a complex bunch of bunch of business dealings if any kept if any company can cut through it
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.280]   It's Apple, but it is a serious serious problem
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.320]   If you guys remember that interview with Steve Jobs at the D
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.520]   Conference a few years ago and he spoke exactly about the go-to-market problem where
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.560]   Dealing with AT&T back then singular was hard enough just to launch the iPhone
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:02.160]   But dealing with all the regional fifdoms that are cable companies and have rights to different movies at different times different TV shows
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.520]   control over different areas becomes a go-to-market nightmare and it's absolutely
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:14.680]   Possible that Apple is working on this Apple could have a display they the original Apple TV rumor was when the 27 inch iMac was
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.640]   Introduced so they know how to make panels. They know how to make little boxes
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:22.240]   But they they don't have control of that content and you need to be able to feed that pipe
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.280]   There's a great
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.320]   Blog post from Jean-Louis Gesset on his Monday night
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.800]   I love you know Jean-Louis former Apple president. He created BOS
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.560]   He's a he's kind of the classic guy on the sideline. You know the Monday morning quarterback
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.680]   But he in fact, that's why it's probably called the Monday note
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.000]   But he writes the enduring Apple TV
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.600]   fantasy he quotes Jean Munster who for the third year in a row
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.960]   Says there will be an Apple TV in 2013 quote
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.040]   It will be the biggest thing in consumer electronics since the smart phone says Munster
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:00.160]   Then he says let's take a columnar look at Tim Cook's words and he and he gives you he says
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.720]   I don't believe Apple will make or even wants to make a TV set
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.440]   It just can't be updated fast enough
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:15.080]   So why is Tim Cook talking about Apple TV simplest explanation is he's answering an interview's question, but a
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:19.280]   Cheekier possibility. I like this one is that it's a head fake
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:26.960]   Cook a noted college football fan war Eagle is trying to draw Google off sides to provoke them into yet another
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:34.480]   Embarrassing Google TV moment and maybe even go Microsoft into another web TV done. He says this is amusing, but not likely
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.760]   I agree
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.000]   I don't think that Apple does that kind of thing a more serious interpretation
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.600]   Is that he's indicating he'll continue to invest talent and money until the TV obstacles are finally surmounted in other words
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.440]   Join us and ride the wave that will sweep away the competition
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.080]   That's possible also I
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.720]   Mean they're fighting up an uphill battle obviously as you as you're talking about if they want to own the user experience
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.760]   They have to have when you turn on that television it has to be an Apple interface that greets you
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.200]   That's the battle for input zero being the base experience of the device
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.800]   And again
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.240]   Guy English had a really good post on this a couple years ago where he said you have you can have the panel and control input zero
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.720]   And then you can have the little hockey puck that you can upgrade every year and because it's a panel
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:28.480]   It's gonna last a long time you upgrade the hockey puck and then everyone else is suddenly fighting for the second connection whether it's Xbox or whether it's a cable box
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.400]   right
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:36.100]   Somebody in the chat rooms pointed out the Google is selling off the Motorola set top box part of Motorola. What if Apple bought that?
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:42.160]   Yeah, I don't I don't think they want to be the endpoint for a cable company
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.400]   I think they want to be yes
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:48.640]   I think they want their connection to be an internet connection not a cable connection, but they it's this is a
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:55.000]   I do think it's a situation where it's gonna get a little bit more serious in the next year to because you know
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.960]   Xbox has been a really interesting
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:06.600]   Partner it really interested into the player and then liver room computer right computing right now where I think most people still think of it as a game console
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:12.080]   But the amount of content that it delivers into the living room is just staggering and now that they have
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:20.960]   Their their glass application on their on all Microsoft devices these nice little tablet apps that enhance and enhance the digital content
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.600]   You're actually watching live. That's a really interesting development. I mean it makes me it makes me remember how
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.840]   Remember how iPod seemed like such a really weird name for Apple to put a music player
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:37.040]   When I call the i music or the i play or something like that and it didn't take long before we realized that
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.520]   Oh, it's because they have this brand that is going to be used as a container for all kinds of things
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.520]   Not just music they want to use it as
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.880]   They want to associate with this this pocket entertainment device that could do things other than
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.480]   Just to serve music and now you look at Xbox well
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.600]   It doesn't necessarily say it's a game console inside that name there
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.960]   It is the Xbox it is this box you have in your living room that delivers all kinds of entertainment that is not antenna based
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.440]   That's not cable TV based and if you do have if you do happen to have cable TV in your living room
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.360]   If you're one of those hoity-toity people it will actually enhance that content as well. So
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.480]   Apple has Apple has plenty of time to work this out
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.800]   But if Microsoft keeps making these
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   Make these incremental improvements to what Xbox have been doing
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:25.120]   They've never had that one little leap leap off and fly moment where every suddenly everybody's talking about the Xbox is the future of anything
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.200]   But every year it gets more better
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.400]   It gets better and better cleaner and cleaner and cleaner more and more features
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.280]   And there might be a time in which apple is going to be scrambling to do anything that's even comparable on apple tv
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.560]   I agree actually going back to the beginning to the bill gates era
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.560]   Of xbox
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.080]   Uh, it was you know, and this is i've been watching this for 20 years
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:49.600]   And it was always my opinion that microsoft wanted to be in the set top box business as why they did web tv
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.440]   And then what happened and I think this was pretty well known at the time
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.240]   Is the cable company said you're crazy?
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.520]   Because it's too expensive. We we don't need that much processor. We don't want that much processor
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.520]   We want something we can rent for five bucks a month
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.760]   Uh, as as gase said, there's no incentive for improving the set top box
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:14.640]   So microsoft faced a stone wall and so what they did is an end around they made the xbox and I always consider the xbox
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.280]   Not just about gaming
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:23.520]   But as a as a uh stealth way into the living room for microsoft that ultimately I think they want it to be a set top box
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.000]   And that's pretty clear them. I agree with you, Andy. I think they would have liked to have had that water shed moment
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.360]   But they're content with incremental improvement. That's all apple's going to get. Here's another competitor gase points out
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.600]   That sony
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.080]   Might prove to be a big competitor here now sony's really been the and also ran for the last few years
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:48.240]   But you know they have that 4k tv that they're showing 35 000 bucks or i'm sorry 25 000 bucks, but it is an 80 inch
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.280]   4k television
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.000]   It comes with a server
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:01.520]   Because nobody's putting out 4k content. It actually comes with a box with full resolution movies
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.280]   sony has a movie studio remember with a lot of movies a big movie library
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.880]   He says could this pretend an apple sony alliance the two companies have worked well together in the past
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.000]   A ceo level conversation could easily happen
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.360]   Perhaps the apple tv box could become the server for a 4k tv
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:26.640]   It's an interesting thought certainly you and I and a lot of us would like it
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:31.040]   If the price could get a little bit more affordable apple's historically really patient though
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.160]   I mean like they they weren't the first to cell phones by any stretch of the imagination
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.280]   They weren't the first to tablet
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.440]   They were sort of content to let a lot of people try and see what worked and what didn't work
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.920]   And that seems to be tim cook's line with the apple tv too
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.920]   They're just pulling that thread and seeing
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.040]   Where it goes and with sony, I think that they would still want to be in control of their own experience
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.200]   They don't seem to partner nicely with others unless it's as a value add to their core
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.360]   Problem solution or um, what I say their core disruption
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.480]   The other thing worth mentioning I think is that remember that when the first iphone came out
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.320]   It was missing a lot of stuff, you know, it didn't have 3g
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.480]   Did have apps didn't have cut and paste
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.640]   apple put that on the market because they felt as though the time is now the iron is hot
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.400]   Here is the opportunity right here
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.800]   So long as we deliver the limited features as well as we can possibly as well as we can imagine them
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.000]   This is going to kill this is going to really create a big splash
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.800]   I think that if they thought that the market for a box like this were ripe right now
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.320]   They would have done it by now. Yeah, I think part of it is that they're waiting for
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.560]   That one little queue that one little whiff of sun in the air that says, okay
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.720]   We got we're gonna go with what we have right now because this is the time to start the start the launch process
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.920]   It's really obvious though from the amount of time we've spent on it the amount of editorial that's the jejun must
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.360]   That there is there is from the apple fan base
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.800]   This intense interest in what apple could do with television
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.240]   Which tells me that people are think that they could be improved considerably
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.480]   That's also a little bit of the what's next thing. I mean we got the phone and immediately we wanted the tablet
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.640]   We got the tablet immediately we wrote the television and wall streets the same way apple is
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:08.000]   Preservedly profitable when you look at amazon or microsoft or even google in some ways and yet when you look at analysts
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.720]   They're like oh we're deeply concerned about what apple's next hundred billion dollar business will be
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:20.160]   Uh, it's it's like apple exists in a completely different universe or it was being washed on a different channel than a lot of the other big tech companies
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:27.120]   Well, but there's there is a play devil's advocate kind of intentionally here the the flip side of that argument is that
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.120]   uh
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.680]   Companies don't the apple's competitors don't say don't stay dumb forever
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:39.680]   Where they're not they don't they don't come from out of the blue with this killer product that absolutely changes the world
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.760]   But they will a year later they'll come out with something that's kind of interesting
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.240]   It'll get better and better until you wind up in a situation where you'll have a lot of people saying
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.080]   Yeah, the apple thing is really really hot, but here's this other thing that I actually want this
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.400]   I want I really want a tablet that's blue and apple only offers these in black and white
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.080]   And I really can't tell the difference between these three so I'll buy the blue tablet for $50 less
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:06.000]   I think part of apple's businesses has to be to make sure that they always stay a little a little bit ahead of everybody else
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.760]   And keep finding market spaces that no one else is really doing a good job and uh, so it's it's not
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.800]   Again, it's stupid to think about apple as being in trouble anytime
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.800]   Anytime in the next several years, uh, but you you do know that I think in in five years time
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:28.560]   They have to have a product they have not produced before and we're not talking about the iphone eight instead of the iphone five
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.040]   We're talking about that it was between the iphone and the ipod
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:36.000]   It's gonna happen. It's gonna happen. It's I don't know if it's gonna happen from apple
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.440]   but we're it's it's to me the thing that I take away from all of this is
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.160]   people want something better
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.040]   and and uh
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.960]   And we you know, it's funny how we quick how quickly we absorbed ht tv
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.760]   I think there was a pass on a 3d
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:22:00.560]   Uh, and I think the question is what's next and I think it's pretty clear to me for or even a k
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:07.760]   Is where to go and the k and here's the key the cable companies and the satellite companies do not want
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.880]   To send us a k or 4k content
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.520]   So there's an opportunity I think yeah
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:20.080]   But the there's there is though remember that uh hd was one of the easiest things for people to adopt because you see that big
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.200]   80 pound console that was gonna kill your children if you
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:29.280]   Did put on the right kind of a stand. We're gonna replace it with a device instead of a instead of a 25 inch screen that caught that
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:34.560]   That weighs 50 pounds. Here is a 40 inch screen that weighs about 12 pounds. It's flat
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.960]   It's beautiful. You'll be able to unplug it from whatever you've got the old tv plugged into right now
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:46.080]   Plugged into this thing and many of these channels are going to be like watching a moving photograph as opposed to uh, as opposed to
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.960]   Oh, absolutely standard definition. You didn't really have my body
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.120]   Exactly. You didn't have to ask anybody to change their habits. It was exact
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:23:00.000]   Where you're giving them is exactly what they've got now only better. It's a Jessica rabbit moment where the eyeballs go boing boing
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.520]   Exactly. Look at this. Have you seen this? Have you seen red ray?
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:11.360]   So red is announced red is the company that makes the 4k cameras and they've really red kind of exploded 4k onto the scene
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.760]   They are planning a 4k
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.080]   player
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.920]   That you can buy and you need that because it's not going to fit on blue ray
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:26.960]   Um, now I don't know what the prices will be on this thing. Let's look at the tech specs though. Uh, it's um
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:31.760]   I probably shouldn't look at the tech specs. It's things like how the temperature
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.680]   Uh, it will be we'll have hdmi out so it'll work if you you know, seven one sound
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:43.920]   Uh, but of course you'll want a 4k display. What's interesting is we're getting 4k displays
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:49.600]   People don't realize this but many times the 3 d tv has two the equivalent of two 2k's or a 4k
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.600]   You can actually pre-order now for $1,450
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.600]   Wow according to this and then I have to buy the $25,000
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.520]   Projector now we saw this projector at nab and it was too
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:08.160]   They were showing off 3d and it was 2k in each on right and that's a lot of 3d is that way because uh, so
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:14.720]   In order if you want hd3d you have to do a 4k screen because you have your alternating 2k's
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.960]   um
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:22.720]   Wow, I remember walking around hong kong in the late 1990s seeing plasma tv's that were tiny for 25,000
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.400]   Right, so I mean it drops fast. I think within five years
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.560]   Yeah, and so apple has to be looking at this and say look this is about to
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.480]   Happen
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.480]   How do we play in this space? I wouldn't I would not be surprised to see a 4k
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:41.680]   Apple not television apple tv apple tv 4. Yeah
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.480]   What about it? Do they?
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:51.840]   I know you're right. They don't they don't do bullying edge. I agree. Let red do it first. Well, we'll also uh,
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.840]   They're streaming 720p right now
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.760]   Yeah, they're not even doing 1080 yet, aren't they even though 1080 is you know is a cut that people have tv so why can't you do that?
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:05.920]   Uh, as I mean, I'm excited as excited about 4k as anybody else, but every time I hear about well
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:10.320]   How am I gonna get the content and oftentimes the answer is oh, we we send a guy around
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.800]   You have to be you can't stream it like a mil delivery. It's too big
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.440]   Even we give you a new box replace the old box the new box has new content on it
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:25.280]   Uh, and if I mean how how hard is it for us to stream 1080 as it is off of a of a vimeo?
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:31.840]   So I think that apple that that's probably the third or the fourth thing that's on apples list on stoa what they want to do to revamp television
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.240]   I don't think it's I don't think they're unsatisfied with resolution
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.200]   unsatisfied with the user experience remember remember that in the interview though one of the things that he was talking about wasn't just
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.600]   You know the the definition in the in the content
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.520]   It's it's so hard to find the content that I want there is a unified search
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.280]   There isn't an anticipated way although I will say that yeah my file is box
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.200]   I can do a search in the program guide, but it's but it's crummy and you forget how to use it
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.520]   There's so many features that are in the program guide that exist
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.920]   But there's just so much trouble that you don't even want to bother with it, right?
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.960]   So I think it doesn't do a unified search now and you could easily do that across the current apple tv and they don't
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.200]   Googled TV does yeah
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.480]   uh by the way apple tv is ten a as is uh
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.800]   Xbox and netflix is ten a so there are I mean you can
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.720]   I mean, I'm at the content that you're getting from uh for atune store, right
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:32.880]   That they could buy the planet
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.240]   film
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.880]   And it was the only one there was only one this wasn't that a lot there's a few years ago
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.920]   And we shot these things and you couldn't edit them. You couldn't play it back. Nobody could download them
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.200]   It was crazy. It was the first ten a.p podcast
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:52.240]   And i'm in canada leo. I pay a fortune. I still have a tiny tiny cap on my right
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.080]   I pay 170 bucks a month and I still have it's something in a hundred of gigabytes of caps
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.240]   So these things will have to be solved
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:02.640]   Some now they keep saying the chatroom apple and itunes do stream ten a.p
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.200]   Yeah, i'm looking at the support page right now
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.280]   uh
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.760]   I believe you can check box that it depends on your system requirements when I
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.040]   It's it must be the way that my my system setup when I usually order
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.800]   Uh content. It usually comes to my house as 720p. So yeah
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.360]   I'll have to uh
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.640]   I only I have one 720p and one 10 one the ten one. I mean, sir 1108i 1108 p tv
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.360]   So and my apple tv is hooked up to the lower res one
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.720]   So i'll have to put it on the big one. See what it took forever for the 1080p tv even get 1080p. I know
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:41.360]   It's very interesting. I we're in what what it's clear. We're in a revolutionary space and it's happening fast
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.520]   And I think you also make an excellent point
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:48.000]   Pick what well taken anti that and and rene that apple does not ever want to be on the bleeding edge
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.400]   So, but I mean if you look at what a 1500 bucks for this red ray
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.120]   That's unbelievable
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:01.360]   Well, it's funny today is some analysts projecting how many thousand dollar tv sets apple would sell if they were to sell those television sets
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.480]   Right. Well, even now apple tv is uh
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.280]   500 million dollar business. Yes, it's nothing
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:11.680]   And you know, I mean it's a it's a minor part of apples
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:18.960]   I mean it is you could I don't care about intense interest. It's still a hobby in terms of revenue here. Yeah, it's around it's cigarette money
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.960]   We're gonna take a break. We're talking with rene richy of i'more.com
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.840]   Andy and not go

[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.840]   With hosts we like Andy and not go

[00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:00.800]   No, just kidding. Where is Alex today? You know so funny. I went back to the pixel core
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:06.080]   Yeah a couple of days ago. So where's Alex? I said we don't know he's either in london stock homes zurik
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.520]   We don't know he's like Jason born for video
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:15.360]   You can't track him. We've got an extraction team on it right now. You don't know where he is
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.080]   Anyway
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:25.200]   Every every every four hours. He's on the phone with somebody saying listen carefully. I have some very specific set of skills
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.920]   It's exactly right. If you create a green screen
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:33.040]   His hands right now, but if you have a poorly executed mat
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:37.760]   Oh, yeah, you don't want to mess with with his mats
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:44.640]   Um, you know, I was mentioning before the show. This is a a week where there's a lot of stories
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:49.840]   But they're all little breadcrumbs and we're gonna try to put a loaf of bread together by mushing
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.720]   You might want to moisten this show and mush it together
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.640]   Um
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:34:00.240]   Because there's so much here. I'll just go through a couple so they launched iTunes in what is it 56 new countries including Russia
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.240]   little mistake a little programming error I would say
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.280]   Uh because when they did the iTunes
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:13.040]   Store they used a dummy IP address until they launched because they weren't sure where it was going to be
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.400]   And they thought this is completely safe. We're just going to use x x dot x x dot x x dot x x
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:25.680]   Who'd have known who to thunk that that actually exists in Russia. So when the iTunes store launched in Russia
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.520]   Data points or escort tonight is born
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.000]   We'll slaughter every three escort directory
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.480]   Oh, the show
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.880]   Oh
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:42.560]   Wow arrow skyed so I guess they fixed that
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:49.120]   They're gonna wait for the first quarter results to come out then they'll decide what they're gonna fix it
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:54.720]   It was uh, it was in a section called more films in different languages
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:00.320]   I guess it was a localization issue
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.360]   They fixed it since
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.080]   I've downloaded a few localization issues
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:13.760]   Yeah, I just remember x x that x x that x x so uh codac is best
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.800]   You know what went when belly up or their chapter 11?
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.680]   I guess is that a reorg or they're doing a chapter seven anyway the only real asset codac had
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.840]   not o photo
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.840]   Not their digital cameras their patents
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:31.200]   And apple actually has been looking for a partner to buy them because it's they're worth half a billion
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   They went to microsoft
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   research and motion
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.800]   Uh previous partners they'd bought the nor tell patents. They couldn't get them to go along
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:48.720]   So they've teamed up with I think probably the most unlikely company possible. Well only samson would be less likely google
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.960]   apple and google are buying the codac patents
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.600]   Patent troll makes my enemy my enemy's friend. Yeah
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.200]   Yeah, so that's it. I mean in a way, it's encouraging that while now they're kind of in bed together
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.520]   They're not gonna sue each other as much maybe I don't know
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.840]   It seems well
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:14.240]   I mean, it's it's it's always about business. Right. I don't I don't think that I don't think they'd ever do something incredibly self destructive
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.240]   Such as to let all these basic imaging patents just go to whoever
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:23.200]   Whatever strip mall lawyer wants to want to buy them, you know, if they can it's remember remember
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:28.160]   It's I think if nothing else to learn from the sad example of uh of uh pal macartney
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.920]   where
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:36.560]   She paul macartney yoko ono like we're kind of fat fighting over how much they should pay for the beetles catalog when it became available
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:41.360]   Which allowed michael jaxon scoopin and buy it and do to their incredible regret for the rest of the
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.080]   For the for the for the next 20 years
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:49.840]   Uh, so you can always we can say that apple and google are at least more more mature and more smart
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.840]   Than than to then a beetle and a survivor spouse. So would be
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:59.840]   According to uh somebody interviewed in bloomberg business week apple and google have this is uh
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.360]   Richard erlickman a former vice president of intellectual property at ibm
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.560]   And president of ip offerings a patent brokerage
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:12.480]   He says apple and google learned a lesson from the nortell auction they decided to work together to reduce the cost
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.720]   While meeting business needs so you know half a billions a lot of money
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:24.880]   Um the apple led group pursuing codex patons included microsoft nathan marevolts intellectual advent adventures intellectual ventures
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.680]   Yeah, um google's partners included
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.720]   Uh a patent aggregation company rpx and asian manufacturers of google's android phones
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:37.040]   The two groups separately offered less than half a billion they've now teamed up to offer more
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.240]   Together now this has not been confirmed
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:47.440]   Neither google nor apple or or codac are saying but codac needed to do this they um they actually got
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:52.480]   Exit financing of 830 million dollars, but it was contingent on them finding a buyer for these patents
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.080]   So I think that's good news. It means go to codac and uh
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.880]   Can turn around?
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:03.120]   Um or something they're doing chapter 11. So that's a reorganization
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:09.360]   And better apple and google have them than someone like a lot sis or an intellectual ventures that would just do a bunch of app developers
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.600]   Yeah, you know one by one
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.320]   There's there's another nice little hint from there where
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:20.080]   Uh if apple or google were interested in using these as using these patents as as an offensive weapon
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:24.640]   Then either these companies would have enough money to just simply buy them out right for themselves
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:29.200]   So right this is in a case of apple buying this portfolio so they could put the hurt on google or anybody else
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:34.960]   No, it's defensive or against not apple against google and google against apple but defensive against some third party
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:42.400]   Right, um in court documents codex at the patents are worth billions two to two two two two billion
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.880]   to two and a half billion
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.080]   Um, it's already generated more than three billion in revenue
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.840]   By licensing the patents to sam san lg google
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:55.120]   That's it. They're both gonna go after sam san
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:01.920]   Uh, well, it's in you know, they say the portfolio is worth less because it's been licensed so much
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.840]   But there's revenue in this portfolio. It's not purely defensive. There is revenue in it
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:10.080]   All right
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.080]   See I told you it was breadcrumbs
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:19.520]   Steve jobs patent is entirely invalid. That's the the touch the multi touch patent that was uh
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.240]   patent 949 so heavily
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.920]   Uh part of the sam san law suit
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:31.360]   Um in late uh october the us patent and trademark office
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.720]   Uh began a reexamination proceeding
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:41.200]   In fact, they they concluded that all 20 claims of apple's rubber banding patent are invalid
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.560]   Uh this week they rejected
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:51.760]   All 20 claims of 949 touch screen device method and graphical user interface for determining commands by applying heuristics
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.800]   That's been called the steve jobs
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.800]   patent because his name is not it
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.440]   It's not invalid the way that a lay person would understand invalid
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:04.400]   It just meant that they've they've heard arguments to the arguments that as to why the patent might be invalid
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.280]   And they're going to grant the investigation and apple has to respond now
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:13.200]   So it's it's not like the patent has been exploded in a small safe somewhere in the patent office. Oh shoot
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.000]   I was hoping it had
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:23.200]   Yeah, so but it is but it is bad ish news. I mean, you know, it's this is like when when an inspector is coming over to visit your meat packing plan
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.200]   He's not gonna he's not gonna give you a certificate
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.200]   That lets you to do twice as much meat as possible
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:32.720]   It's the worst that can happen is that you you get shut down the best that can happen is that apple gets to keep going the way they were before
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:36.640]   So they have a right to appeal even all the way up to the supreme court
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.760]   on this
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.520]   So
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.520]   And i'm sure there will be appeal
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:51.680]   Um, what's crazy though is that they were lawyer trade trademark lawyers and patent lawyers arguing about this on twitter and arguing about what the definitions
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:56.160]   Mean and what this action by the trademark office means and it seems like it is not
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.480]   It's not as simple as the web has been making it and nothing usually is but
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:06.400]   Patents in general. I think they get reported in a very dynamic exciting way. Yeah, we don't understand
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:10.320]   Florian mueller and his foss patents, which is kind of my source for all of this
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:15.760]   Um says many patent claims that are rejected at this stage do ultimately survive
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:23.280]   Yeah, um, so this it's a mistake to he says it's also a mistake to underestimate the significance of this first office action
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:28.480]   Also a complete rejection of all claims of a given paten is potentially more devastating. That's what happened
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.880]   Then one affecting only some claims
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.320]   But apple will will obviously appeal this
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:40.400]   And again as the states the patent office is like my company's hashed it out over and over again instead of doing anything themselves
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:49.200]   HTC as we mentioned earlier has reached settlement with apple all things d has
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.640]   At least part of the settlement
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:58.080]   Um, I think the thing we'd like to know is how much HTC is paying look at the
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:02.160]   A little bit was redacted though. Just in case you were wondering
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.800]   uh
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.800]   It looks like our CIA records
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.840]   Uh for those not watching on video
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:13.840]   Uh, it says confidential highly confidential attorney eyes only
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:19.760]   Uh apple document for the settlement with htc and it's entirely blacked out. I could see bullets
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:22.560]   It's entirely
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:27.920]   redacted points are non redacted. No you can we now know that there are 73 bullet points. That's all
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.720]   Pan a footnote
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:37.040]   So really the only thing left to speculate after looking at this document as to what part of that document required them to
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.520]   Increase the left margin all the way
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.920]   Everything because there's two lines are just all the way to the left
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.880]   It's 143 pages
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.280]   Um, and there's quite a bit of ink
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:53.280]   Uh in this in this document, but there's there's some non ink
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.880]   I mean, there's some some actual legible stuff
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:02.400]   I'm scrolling through the pdf now
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:07.280]   What a wonderful open and free democracy we all live in you see things like
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:13.040]   section 1.17 htc android mobile communications devices means
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:17.120]   Black black black black black black black. I think we know what that means, but okay
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:23.520]   Uh, my god. This is maybe maybe it's just that the lawyers are really really really have filthy mouths
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.360]   Those like ricka frick on ricka blackin phone
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:32.880]   St jacks and for the defense
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:38.560]   Do you think that they uh that they use a magic marker to do this or they have some too? They have some software tool
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.720]   It's an app for that
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.680]   I think
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.680]   I think it's old i think it's old school
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:47.760]   Uh, well because there was actually kind of a famous famous leak
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.200]   Great your go or older than light well
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.400]   No, they know they used to they decided to use just like digital technology
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.720]   Just simply just simply like obscure it
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:01.760]   I'm not knowing that if you dig into the pdf you can actually take away that layer again and say back again
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.120]   Oh, yeah
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.080]   I as a matter of fact, I know of some I know of one
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:14.480]   Largeish company that actually still maintains typewriters in their offices because they like having a form of communication where there is no digital
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:18.160]   Trail right any kind whatsoever right the battle for a galactic a typewriter
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.840]   Yes
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:25.280]   so uh more floor floor emular again, uh, red all the non redacted parts
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:33.280]   And among other things he noted that hdc has agreed not to clone apple products seems like a good a good thing
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.560]   And the pinch to zoom gesture has been licensed
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.040]   I don't know if that was one of the invalidated patents
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.360]   That was that was highlighted as a patent. It's easy to get around
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:50.560]   And my stuff is apple doesn't own the entire concept of pinion. No, it's 915. It's the 915 patent
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:54.960]   Exactly. Um, and also I I think I've read the same thing that you have about it
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:02.000]   Where the frustrating thing is that the concept of cloning the iphone is just so vague as far as what we can see in the document
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.240]   That is like help that but you don't have a mechanical keyboard. You're cloning the iphone
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:09.040]   Yes, please
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.520]   At least from I've always loved hc no from the hdc one
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.400]   Next is one on they've always had a much more different. Yeah. Yeah design aesthetic than apple has
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:22.480]   Yeah, even now the droid DNA looks nothing like a phone. It's very distinct
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:27.760]   Like I keep I keep coming back to that one of those documents at surface during the during the samseung apple
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.400]   trial where apple try apple
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:34.160]   Introduce as evidence a proposal that they sent a samseung before they
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.760]   Went the nuclear option with the lawsuit as a way of proving to the court look
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.240]   We tried to get them to license this technology. We didn't try to go
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:46.480]   We waste the court's time immediately and the stockman is is a plan for here's how samseung would pay us licensing fees for its
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.560]   for your handsets and
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.200]   It included several specific examples including the blackjack 2 phone
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:59.680]   Which is really if anything it is like it's a clone from the blackberry as the name might imply it looks nothing like the iphone
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:05.840]   Operates nothing like the iphone and yet apple was saying you owe us $30 per handset on each one of these devices
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:10.000]   Which we will discount to eight dollars for the following eight for the following bunch of reasons
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.600]   And earlier in the document explains that there's a there's sort of a
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.280]   That they saw on
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:23.120]   They they they define I think about way to put it. It's it's almost as if they just they describe
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:29.200]   The the qualities of the iphone like umami where how do you define it?
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:35.520]   It's what I mean when I say umami you'll know when you taste it you know when we you'll know when we sue you for it
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.920]   Well, that's kind of actually exactly right
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.760]   They also have an anti cloning deal with microsoft
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:46.960]   So it's the same languages with the in the microsoft agreement the thing there might be a time bomb in here
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:53.600]   uh for instance if industry standards or the official android specifications
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:59.120]   require hdc to implement functionality apple can't exercise its anti cloning rights
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:03.600]   If it's in the android specs apple would have to sue google directly
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:09.440]   So there might be a little time bomb in here hdc could just go hey, it's and it's official android
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.680]   We got to do it and then apple would have to go after google if any rubens had so yeah
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:20.800]   Yeah, the other fault is that the my understanding of the microsoft agreement is that it's a reciprocal agreement where apple also can't
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.200]   Can't clone microsoft devices
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:29.440]   According to the people who examine this talk more closely than I have there is no such reciprocity with the hdc
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:33.680]   Interest agreement where apple can say oh steal say we have a multi color else. Yeah
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:37.200]   As if we just know johnny I would never do that
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.360]   [laughs]
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.360]   Um
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:46.800]   All right, let's take a break. Let's take a break. We do have mac news. They're they're speculating. They're saying there mustn't be any mac news
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.840]   Yes
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:49.840]   There is iphone 5s news
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.040]   uh, there is
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.040]   made in usa news
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:02.720]   And there is mac news and I will tell you what I ordered I ordered two things one. I think i'm safe on I did order the new iMac the
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.880]   27 inch
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:08.960]   Uh, some people are starting to get it apparently they've gotten the shipping notice if you ordered it the day
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:12.160]   It was available. They say uh, december 15th
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.680]   Uh delivery so some people will be getting that do you have one Andy?
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:21.200]   You have the 21 right i've got the 21 on loan from apple i've got that upstairs
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.560]   So i've been playing for that for about a bit i want the 27 and i just i loaded it up
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.480]   You know i'm top of the line everything
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:32.320]   Yeah, I mean that the 20 we're including the fusion drive because I wanted to I wanted to see how the fusion the three terabyte fusion drive performed
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:38.000]   Yes, yeah, I like I like the 21. I'm just concerned that apple builds things so well
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.880]   I mean i've got the i've got a 2008 iMac in my office that's still ticking along and still working great
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:48.480]   And one of the reasons why i'm still using it is that two or three years later. I decided i was able to max out the ram
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.440]   I was able to add things to it that I didn't think I would I needed or at least
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:55.440]   When my budget was hey, I happen to have x dollars in the back was spent on new iMac
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:02.240]   The the fact the 21 inch is just so absolutely sealed up that you can do just nothing as soon as you take it out of the box
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.320]   It's locked into what it is at that moment
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:08.400]   So that's why I think that if I had if I were buying a new iMac this year
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:11.200]   Even if I didn't you really want a 27 inch screen
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:15.760]   I would probably buying the 27 inch just so that I would have these options as we go in the well and that's
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:20.880]   That's exactly there are a couple of things I had to have one was a visa mount because we it's for my office
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.320]   So it has to go on the ergotron arm so I can slide it in and out during shooting
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:26.960]   uh, I'm sorry I had to
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:31.120]   And then uh, I put 16 gigs of ram. I thought there's no way
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.240]   I'll never ever never need more than that
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.240]   Does the 27 have still have a visa mount options?
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.200]   I was told it does. I'll be disappointed if it does
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:47.200]   I know the 21 is not the 21 does not I know that the 27 inch last the last year's model had it
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.960]   I guess because we have it on an i we have it on an arm now
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:56.800]   21 inches more like a macbook era of a desktop now than uh, it is it's no user serviceable. Yeah, yeah
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:00.400]   um
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:04.480]   I'm just gonna look back at you know the problem is date
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:11.680]   I need to find the the uh, the new generation
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.480]   Well, you do that research for me, Andy would you?
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.160]   I'm looking the other thing that I
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:21.440]   The other thing that I bought that I am worried about this is in a small print of the bounce apple store listing
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.080]   Not compatible with the iMac late 2012
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.640]   Visa is not
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.120]   I'm gonna dung a check again, but that could be the 21 inch
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.840]   No, it says if it's for the 20
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:36.160]   I'm I'm continuing to look I remember that from notes from a conversation
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:40.000]   I had but I'm going to find uh, I'll see if I can find on an actual apple support page
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:46.640]   The other thing I did buy that I'm worried about I decided I finally pulled the trigger on the thunderbolt the 27 inch thunderbolt display
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:52.640]   Uh, we got a couple because we got one for uh, one for lisa for her new macbook retina
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:58.480]   And one for me for my house. I got one too and i'm just know that they're going to do a thin one of those
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:03.680]   But no they've announced everything there's no more announcements till the end of next year
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:09.920]   Right and it'll take them a while to get this enough panels to spare them from the iMac production to make the LEDs
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.320]   Last time it took six to nine months. I think after the
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.840]   The last new iMac came out before the thunderbolt displays came out
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.160]   I'm just gonna be depressed if they release a skinny one
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:22.480]   Or a retinolone or a retinolone. No, they won't I know I'm not worried about that
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:26.960]   Anyway, that's the one I'm worried about. We'll we'll take a break. We'll come back with more and he's gonna do some research
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:30.240]   We'll talk about new iphone and new mac news
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:35.280]   But first a word from square space the great square space
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.280]   uh, I
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.800]   I have to emphasize what you get with square space web hosting that is
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:45.520]   Barn on the best the best web hosting out there and
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:51.840]   The best software and you know by the way, I you know, I don't want to apply that you could run say word press on your square space site
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:56.800]   You can't they're tightly coupled and that's for good reason. It's one of the reasons this the hosting is so good
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.280]   Because they're so tightly coupled
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:05.040]   That you get hosting that's dedicated designed to work with the content management system
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:09.600]   Uh, and I think there's a real advantage to having them host the content management system
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.640]   They keep it up to date. They they you know, you don't have to worry about upgrades
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:18.000]   I'm constantly upgrading my blog, you know, every day there's a new effect today. There's a new word press
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   So what does that mean? I have to go? I have to have to pee it over if I install it thing my break plugins will dirt certainly break
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.680]   You don't have to ever worry about that with square space. It's all there
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:32.080]   The best content and it really is the best content management system for instance
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:36.160]   They've got all so because again they control the ecosystem
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:40.640]   So they have a beautiful designer templates, but every single one of them now
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:45.760]   Is mobile mobile responsive design? So when you upload an image to your square space site
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:51.280]   It automatically gives you seven sizes so that it'll fit on any screen from an iPhone 3
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.680]   All the way up to that 27 inch iMac
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:58.080]   Um, and the site will automatically rearrange itself
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:00.880]   And you don't ever have to worry about that design the best look in site you can
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:04.880]   If you're a photographer looking for a portfolio site if you're an artist a designer
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.440]   I really think square space is what you should look at
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:10.880]   The templates are gorgeous. You have complete control of the design
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:16.800]   If you're an html5 css javascript coder, they have a developer platform for you, but you don't need to be
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:21.440]   To get just great looking stuff that really reflects your style
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:25.520]   Pick any template and then look at all the designs all the sites based in that template
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:28.800]   You'll be amazed at the variety the template is just the starting point
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:33.280]   And if you're creative, I know you want it to be unique you want to express yourself
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.640]   And that's what square space does then you get the great hosting
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:42.000]   You get the integration with all the social networks. You can put google maps on there flicker
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.520]   Facebook twitter it's a complete integration
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:49.520]   Import and look at scroll down a little bit chat because you see that's the peak template
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.920]   But these are all based on that template. They all look different
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:58.000]   They're all unique and that's the point no squares but no two square space sites look alike unless you want them to
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.120]   Really a great system
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:04.720]   Uh, you can import and export so you're never trapped
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:09.920]   Uh, it supports all the apa and blogger type pad wordpress so you can import and export
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.400]   Um and look at the pricing

[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.360]   I'm sound i should start talking like this
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.240]   Let me be in voice there you go
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.640]   I just instinctively trust you more when you talk like me
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:54.160]   I was watching the batman rises uh trailer
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.640]   Yeah, because it's on cable now, right?
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:00.880]   And he he goes up at the end. It's a very interesting voice. Maybe I will say
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:04.400]   I am here to take over the world
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:12.560]   Anyway, I did I did check online my notes my notes from a conversation with somebody in a position to know
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:14.080]   uh told
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:18.000]   Reflect that the 27 inch 2012 iMac is not as visa compliant. Oh crap
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.680]   I'm also looking at the product listening on the apple store page for
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:28.000]   The visa mounted dapper kit and it says in tiny print note not compatible with the iMac late 2012
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.640]   Right compatible with anything up to the 2011 27 inch. Wow, that's a bummer
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:39.920]   Um, maybe i'll cancel it or a mod project leo you can you can broadcast two two words leo duct tape
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:42.320]   They had a man's secret with duct tape
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:45.440]   I have to mark it
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:50.400]   We'll just suspend it from the ceiling and they do make they do make justin beaver duct tape
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:53.200]   So you can have you know
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:58.080]   By the way beatmaster has exactly my one complaint. I like batman rises a lot
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:02.400]   But beatmaster said all he had to do is punch him in the mask
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:10.800]   Was his breathing mask one swift punch to the plastic breathing mask and bane's gone. It wasn't in the script. Oh
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:15.280]   I mean come on. That's a kind of a glaring gaping hole
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:18.800]   You know, they're fighting. I mean they fight like crazy. There's a lot of fist fighting
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.640]   Just one boom right to the that's what I would have done boom. It's like hitting a dog in the nose they go
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:26.320]   And then bane's over
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:28.320]   Just a thought next time batman
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.880]   Next time it's not a car
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:36.880]   I can do that too. It's always great christia. Everybody who does batman
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.840]   Just talks like this
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:42.960]   That way you can't tell it's Bruce
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:46.880]   Oh my god. I've never thought of before batman as harvey fire steam
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:50.000]   I'll be fire steamed. It's not a car
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.560]   dresses in an outrageous costume
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:56.320]   Batman is you like the bat will be
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.960]   Have you see covers buddy
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.960]   You live over
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:05.920]   Make a great penguin though
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.000]   Okay
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.040]   So
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.880]   Somebody this it happens every time
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:13.680]   Somebody punched punched an article
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:19.280]   Uh some blogger said oh no the five s will be available in june actually I think it was an analyst
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:21.440]   yep
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:26.640]   And and this the whole article it says that apple is going to move
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.480]   to a twice a year
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:34.720]   Shipping plan on all of its products
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:38.160]   This is a peter my sec
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:44.400]   Predicting the iphone five has a five s has a new super hd k i think he's just making this stuff up
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.800]   Yep, he's pulling it right out of his butt right
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:50.480]   Super h apple could go ahead
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:56.400]   I mean the ipad four showed us that apple is not afraid anymore or they're not they're willing to surprise us with
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:01.840]   Their product schedules and it's absolutely possible that there might be ios devices coming out in spring
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:09.760]   But this article doesn't seem to have any relationship with with it would be incidental or coincidental if that happened based on this article
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:13.280]   He's a piper jafries jafries analyst and he says
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:21.120]   super hd camera screen a better battery nfc and get ready five colors
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:24.720]   I'm sorry six to eight colors
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:29.840]   That all the colors all the colors nine it was it would be greater than one
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:33.360]   Less than 18 probably not higher than 12
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:39.920]   Maybe six and one of them will be black probably the other one white, but maybe yeah, it's like I mean
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.400]   Renee, I mean you get you get these things all the time too
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:49.040]   It's like usually when someone is has a rumor and they legitimately cannot tell you where that source is from but it's a very good source
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:54.480]   They have a way to at least faint towards i'm not just making this up. This is just
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:59.760]   You know, I was in Washington state celebrating a certain new election result
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.280]   And during a cheetos run we talked about
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:10.320]   What about this Ian mccellan was with me in a full game off the white costume and that's what he pulled out
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:13.360]   This we're not stand
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.480]   the um
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.800]   John scully no less says
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:22.480]   I think they're going through a very apple is going through a very significant change now in terms of product cycles
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:28.160]   Traditionally apple introduces products once a year now it's really introducing products twice a year
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:35.760]   The complexity of that from a supply chain is immense and apple seems to be doing it well. So I think one product introduced one product
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.280]   once
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.120]   Once so I think that people are underestimating just how well apple is run
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.120]   No, they're not
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:50.320]   And just I don't think anybody's underestimating how well apple is run and just how successful the company can be when it gets that twice a year
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:57.600]   Product introduction cycle. Okay, rene you have to vet rumors all the time at i'm more you're the you're the new rumor king
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.160]   ever since uh
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.800]   Was a think secret went away. It's i'm more dot com
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.280]   What do you think?
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.600]   I think that again, I believe I agree 100 percent with Andy that this this does not pass any
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.760]   Any kind of smell test you want to give it
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.560]   I do think that there is a possibility that apple will do more
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:20.640]   iOS devices in the spring because you know, they they've now demonstrated the capacity to iterate when they want to and not necessarily
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.800]   Have to wait for yearly events, but again, it would be coincidental to these stories
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.600]   There's a super HD display is what exactly how does that you have to break this down logically?
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:33.680]   How does that fit with apples existing retina display technology what panels are on the market?
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.800]   How would they fit it in what would happen with apps and this just sounds more like one of those every year at christmas
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.080]   There's going to be a red iphones for the rumors. All right, but wait, there's more
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:47.360]   Horace dead you who is from a simko's traditionally pretty right on
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.720]   He says
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.320]   Uh, it's something i've also speculated is happening
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:58.480]   Scully's comments prompted me to weigh in with the possible evidence first
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:03.680]   All the major projects which apple cells were updated this fall. This is unprecedented
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:08.640]   Not only were product launches scheduled in the spring historically they've been spread throughout the year
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:12.160]   The odds that they happen to coincide by accident are nil
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.680]   In other words, he says the fact that they were able in september in october to update the entire line indicates
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.720]   That's the plan. It wasn't a coincidence
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:27.520]   Um, he says not only that but the move of ipad iphone ipod macbook and iMac to all launch
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.760]   Once a year in fall seems risky because of the gap
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:36.720]   That competitors have to fill for six months until that happens
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.760]   Again, that's not what happened they introduced the macbook airs in the macbook pros in june
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:46.720]   They did the iphone in september they did the ipads and the other macs in october
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:52.400]   And again, it's absolutely possible apple will likely i don't say likely apapados absolutely possible
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.280]   They will introduce more ios devices or iterations
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:00.880]   Uh for the last two years i believe the last use they had the ipad as far as i know ready to go before the holidays
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:08.400]   And they chose to wait until spring and this year they chose not to so it's it's more a strategic thing than than anything else for apple
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:14.800]   He also says that apple that when you do it once a year that your production is bursty with breakneck around the clock crushes
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.720]   Followed by periods of idle time
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:22.640]   That's inefficient lowers morale and hot high which which is more than half apple production
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.400]   Has shifted its locations closer to sources of labor
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.560]   He says
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:33.760]   Uh until this shift on high depending on migrant label different labor difficult to manage moving production
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.560]   So that labor is local means a steadier workforce
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.120]   And it means you also have steadier work to do
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.800]   So it could be them responding to apple's signal. Hey, we're gonna be doing this all year round
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:51.520]   They'll crush it twice a year apple people won't give to sleep for the entire month of april and a month of
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.840]   october
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.720]   Wonder those if if some people wouldn't be happier if apple were
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.480]   A little bit better equipped to to meet demand when it comes there
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:06.400]   Uh, has has there been a significant apple release in the mobile space at least or viphone the ipad where
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.240]   It
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:12.080]   At least for the first couple months, uh, they were able to ship anywhere within the first couple of days
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.560]   It's like you right now
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.560]   Typically you used to use to sing like a week or two delay if you want to order through the apple store
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:24.240]   Uh, or if you you have to you have to sort of haunt the the physical location so wait for a shipment to come in
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.800]   So I think that most people are happier to see apple come up with
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:34.000]   A couple of different releases on a sort of a higher schedule because everybody's contracts are expiring
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:41.760]   At staggered schedules right now, but there's something to be said for the reason the reason why apple's currently getting clobbered by android sales
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.360]   Is partly because there are a jillion factories turning out android handsets
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.600]   So there's only a couple that are doing uh, iphone handsets
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.440]   He points out uh harris that you does that
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:58.880]   This is such a huge change in the way a company is run. It should not be underestimated
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.600]   He said when ford did this
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:04.000]   Uh, they shut production now for six months
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.760]   Um, he's got a really good point about right now apple has a problem is that they can't satisfy demand when their product ships
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:14.880]   And then by the time they get into balance exactly it's so far after the product to ship that people are trying to wait for the next one
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.640]   And that means that they're not selling the most they could at the beginning or at the end and that's something
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.960]   Some consultant came in there and said look you guys if you went to twice a year
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.680]   It it smooths that out
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.160]   And and what daddy who says is look this is
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.080]   This would be such a big shift all employees would be affected
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:39.200]   He says if it is happening it's possible. There's some knowledge of this change dissipating outside the company which would perhaps explain
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:42.480]   Scully's confidence in his claim
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.360]   Do you think it's possible?
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.960]   I I poo-pooed this on the radio show and I hope I would didn't I wasn't wrong
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.640]   Somebody said you know I would think maybe I should wait for the five s in may
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:57.440]   And I said no way it'll be september is it possible there'll be a five s in may
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.240]   Sure
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.480]   possible exactly is it likely
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:05.600]   It's they're used it for one year
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:10.800]   We had this nice thing where there were iPads in spring iPhones in summer and iPod touches in the fall
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:14.960]   And it was nice for apple because they could spread out their their sprints for release
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:18.080]   And it was nice for us because there was something new every quarter
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:22.800]   Except for the holiday quarter where they just sold everything that was new and now putting everything in september
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:26.720]   It was exhausting and it also begs the question. What are they going to do for the first
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:34.640]   Nine months of 2013 and I think almost certainly there will be whether it's a new ipad mini or a new iphone or yes
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:39.840]   There will be something in the spring and but is it going to be a wait for upgrade or it'll be
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.240]   Oh, it's it's basically the same with a few differences
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.480]   You might as well get what you can now if you need it
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.760]   I think unless
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:51.760]   Phone companies change their cycle from the two-year cycle. This is a bad move because people get upset
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:57.840]   If they buy an iphone and six months later, it's obsolete and they're stuck for two years. That's upset iphone hd max
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:02.560]   But well, it's what's going on in the dandroid world, isn't it? Yep
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.360]   I mean, you mentioned the droid but the droid razors, you know, they've updated those in monthly. It seems like
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:14.880]   Oh, but it's a different ecosystem over there, isn't it? Because if you if you look at the the whole
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:19.440]   Pallet of of Android super phones, essentially there's a new phone coming out every five or six weeks
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:26.960]   Uh, and so maybe you're upset that you bought the HTC one be HTC one because the Samsung Galaxy s3 came out two months later
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:31.680]   And I upset you bought the s3 because the note two came out just a couple months after that
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:36.240]   So I mean apple apple users are different breed of cat entirely
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:41.520]   So there might be something to that but I'm sure but uh, I think that we kind of overstate how upset people are
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:44.240]   Uh, they're gonna be locked into two-year contracts no matter what they do
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.240]   They think they're they assume that at some point
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:52.080]   Uh, they're gonna be upset that they they don't get the the they don't get the the iphone with with hoverboard technology built in
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:55.200]   Damn it
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:08:01.120]   Or may or the way that apple works sometimes maybe they'll be saying oh thank god it didn't they got it didn't wait because the new
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:06.640]   They just they just they just obsoleated my old model. That's that was the last model that you can actually hook up to a camera
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:10.080]   Something I was wondering about is you know
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:16.480]   Because the competing phones all have such huge screens now and if you if you imagine if you walk into best buy and every television set
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:19.520]   From 32 inches to 102 inches with the same price
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:23.920]   Which which when would you buy and because of subsidies? That's essentially what's happening with phones
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:29.760]   So people for whom size is the only criteria just so I can get a no two or a galaxy s I can get a no-key
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:36.480]   920 for half the price of an iphone right so I wonder if apple if they do shift to an annual schedule will start to diversify the product line
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:40.400]   I mean they went down an ipad. Maybe they'll they'll go multiple with the iphone finally
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:47.520]   Well, this will be a big shift. This would be such a change if apple does kind of start shipping new stuff every six months
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:50.080]   yeah, wow
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:55.440]   I mean I was kind of pissed off that they did an ipad for only eight months after the ad three came at it
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.880]   We guess we get but that's only because they had a kind of it was an unspoken
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:05.680]   Rule that they broke but it was unspoken and if the new rule is every six months
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.440]   I think people would say well, it's every six months. We know that yeah, that's great. It was so small
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:14.960]   I mean it was lt internationally and it was yeah lt internationally and plus the new and live faster
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.560]   I think well
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:21.840]   Yes, and the speed boost but offset offset that against getting to use a
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:27.600]   Retina ipad for six months that you would not have had had you waited until September, October
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:31.760]   I mean there's no i'm glad I bought the three. I'm not saying that but and for me
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:36.720]   It's not much faster is that what the ipad three could do in the red zone this one can do kind of comfortably in third right?
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.600]   right
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:45.200]   I wish I wish I drove a manual because sometimes there are these car com these car commentaries like oh
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:51.680]   That's is that a good thing? You don't think you don't ever read. I know I know they go informally up from one
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:57.040]   You know that on my car there's a D and then there's a D with a circle around ever red line that yes does that it?
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.520]   Overdrive Andy overdrive
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.840]   I redline my Mustang a lot
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:05.440]   I've learned though. I know exactly when it's gonna redline and so I
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:11.040]   Because you can get to so i'm merging on the freeway in second gear and you can get to 65 and second gear
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:17.120]   But you'll redline right about 60 65 so um, I just smoothly shift
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.040]   That's what the a5 that's what the a6x feels like compared to the a5 is just
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.760]   looking at
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:28.240]   Let's take a break
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.720]   When we come back we're gonna talk about something else
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.040]   iMAX
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.000]   Yes
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.040]   Or max max I should say max max max news
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.280]   macadie mac back
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:45.280]   First let's talk about backing up your macadie mac mac or your pc with the best backup plan out there carbonite
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:51.280]   It's automatic secure affordable online backup for your home your home office

[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.120]   It's uh, it's secure
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:07.360]   Not only encrypted on the way 128 bit ssl, but you can do trust no one encryption if you choose and only you have the key
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.120]   Uh
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.840]   It's as little as 59 dollars a year for a computer
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:17.600]   That's less than five bucks a month and it's cloud storage too. That means when you use carbonite
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.560]   You can look at your files your backed up files

[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:33.120]   They also have android and they can just log right in and there and there so it's cloud storage all that data
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:40.160]   I'm just a big fan of carbon. In fact, I wouldn't uh, I wouldn't take a laptop out of the house without making sure carbonites on it
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.360]   automatic continual off-site backup
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:47.840]   For as little as 59 dollars a year. I want you to try it free for two weeks
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.280]   You do not need a credit card. You just need our offer code mac break
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:55.520]   And uh, if you decide after two weeks and I do want you to try it because it's you know
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:00.720]   You want to make sure you got to understand that you have enough bandwidth and so forth that uses your upstream bandwidth, but it's gentle
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.920]   It pays attention. It only doesn't want your idol and so forth
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:10.400]   But that means if you don't have if you have 128 kilobits up it may not be enough depending on how much data you want to backup
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.240]   So try it for two weeks
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.120]   Get a sense of it if you decide you want to buy use the offer code mac break
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:18.160]   You'll get 14 months for the price of 12
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:20.720]   two free months
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.720]   carbonite.com
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:26.480]   Uh, it's just kind of peace of mind. You just you set it and forget it
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:31.520]   And you just know if disaster happens. I got it. It's it's under control
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:38.560]   Carbonite.com give it a try today mac or pc if you've got friends and on the other computer
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:44.960]   So uh made in the us of a that was the other uh
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.760]   I'm watching bomb
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:54.880]   Water balloon that Tim Cook dropped is that either apple's gonna invest a hundred million dollars to start making some max
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.760]   in the usa
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:03.840]   What's interesting is we're already seeing some max some a the i max the 21 chime x say made in the usa
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:07.360]   Um
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.520]   Thoughts about that
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.760]   Nothing for counter to leo there was no Canadian announcements
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.760]   No, because uh, is there a drum that's interesting, you know, we make a big deal in the us
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.680]   Oh, we want made in the usa
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.120]   Is does that also true in Canada?
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:23.360]   Like you'll look for goods that are made in Canada. We will not buy from mop maple syrup leo
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:28.480]   We will not yeah, I don't blame you. You just can't you just can't nor nor should you no no
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.440]   Well, I mean there there is a problem with like using assembly plants in Canada because
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:38.080]   Uh with so many like lumbering and chainsaw accidents very few of them have all 10 fingers
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.800]   So for i-phone
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.800]   Claws
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.080]   Um
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.080]   I mean it really is
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.240]   Every company says in front of the microphones and in front of the crowd of cheering people that oh
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:56.000]   We believe in the made in the usa logo because we want to bring jobs to this country
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.680]   But you know that in the back room, it's like, you know what we ran the numbers again
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:05.360]   It actually costs us less because it actually costs us less money for this product if we were to assemble it locally
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:11.760]   Well, and a devorek race an interesting point because they said made in usa they didn't say made by us workers
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:15.760]   So for instance, uh one. I mean look it's clear even though
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:23.760]   Uh tim cook kind of denied it. It's clear that the reason apple manif and everybody else manufacturers in china's because the labors cheaper there, right?
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:31.360]   And it's everything's very close together. So it's the the economies of scale make it easier to go from plant to plant just assemble the entire thing there
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.440]   Uh, you'd have to bring all those plans and everything and build the same kind of community you have in
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.080]   San jen for example somewhere in texas or somewhere
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:41.360]   That's one of the rumors is that fox con would actually build this apple plant
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:47.280]   But the others but what devorek said is no no it's not going to get you more jobs because they're going to do it with robots
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:52.240]   Which are which is in fact the only thing cheaper than a chinese worker is our robot
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.680]   Can they make i-phones with robots?
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:02.400]   Well, they are they already do a lot of that stuff. I mean one of the most interesting things about the manufacturing process for the iphone five is that
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:09.600]   The way that they fit the the glass the glass greens to like those those metal tubs or the the cases of them where they have a high speed
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:14.480]   According to this is directly from the the movie the bob man's field movie
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:20.480]   Yeah, exactly where a high speed camera like just takes a look at the photographs hundreds and hundreds of these things at the same time because
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:25.120]   Tallerances are very very tight, but they're a little bit. They're a little bit variation of course there's going to be
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:29.680]   So they figure out that oh well actually this specific case is 0.007
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:34.240]   percent out on this axis, but this specific piece of glass is also 0.007
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:37.360]   Out of out of alignment in the same way make sure these two get together
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:42.720]   So I mean it's mostly rough my understanding is mostly rough assembly at this point that's being done by human hands
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:50.560]   Right and the more they automate that the more that they the more that they can again bring bring factories here without bringing right human assemblers
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.400]   But still that's that's jobs
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.760]   Even if it's just people who have to keep the lights on and the machines running yeah, there's some jobs after the after the robots run amok
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.360]   Right
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:02.800]   Which inevitably will happen as we all know from many movies
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:10.240]   Interesting point the 100 million dollars, which is what they said they they devote to this ease in as much as it might sound in fact
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.600]   um
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.840]   According to philip elmer de witt writing in fortune
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:21.040]   Uh, he he asked dan luria a labor economist at the michigan manufacturing technology center actually bloomberg asked
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:25.680]   And he said that's a hundred million dollar factory. That's about 200 jobs
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:29.520]   And produces about one million units a year not nearly enough
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:33.680]   For the mac books or even them i max
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.480]   only the mac pro
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.880]   And the mac mini self fewer than a million a year
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:43.200]   And of course the mac pro is big heavy expensive to ship
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.800]   Seems philip says, you know, that's what they're going to make they're going to make the mac pro
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:52.320]   We've already said you're making a new mac pro at the end of 2013
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:59.520]   Extra labor costs associated with manufacturing in the us of course could easily be absorbed by a higher ticket item much more easily
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:03.200]   Uh, and mac pros are often build order, aren't they?
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:08.960]   So i think that it's pretty clear that if they're going to make something in the us it'll be a mac pro
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.440]   That's why the delay they have to wait for the factory to be built before they can do the next generation. Yes
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:16.800]   Exactly
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.600]   Okay
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:23.840]   We're all in agreement that's really not interesting. There's no debate
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.800]   There's no flying donuts nothing
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:31.760]   I think that was interesting that was right before that when tim cook said that 80 percent of apples products are now coming
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.880]   Profits are coming from products. They released in the last four months. Wow
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.320]   Um, and you figure out, you know the i'm mac pro isn't one of those things
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:44.560]   Yeah 80 percent. Yeah, the mac pro is going to be the one percent the computer for the one percent
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.080]   You and Alex
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:54.160]   That that that was one of those quotes that maybe kind of arched my eyebrow saying oh, so but we're not talking about like
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:18:01.120]   They haven't they weren't making phones six months ago. They weren't making dislike you did an incremental update to your entire product
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.400]   That is impressive, but yeah, you know, okay fine
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:12.640]   And if you're in australia, don't use apple maps actually, uh, it's safe now. They fixed it, but uh, the actual actual
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.000]   police in uh, mildura
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   Australia were warning people please to you do not use apple maps
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.600]   um
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.560]   A number of people find trying to find the town of mildura
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:32.400]   Became hopelessly lost in the bush and it's it's dead summer in australia
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:36.240]   Temperatures up to 46 degrees Celsius
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:45.120]   One man was stranded for 24 hours last week three more have had to be rescued after following directions on apple's new maps
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:50.560]   Which located mildura among the dusty sunbaked trails of mary sunset national park
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:54.960]   And 30 miles away from the actual location of the town
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:19:02.560]   It's it's I know it's not funny because if that's that's real danger, but I just imagine you know that that monday morning meeting
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:09.760]   Hi, well, I apologize day because one of our software products finally killed a guy thoughts
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:14.320]   You wouldn't you really wouldn't expect that but there you go. That's how
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:20.800]   They started looking into it and they saw that there's there's two milduras one is the one was called mildura
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:26.480]   regional county something or other and google because they employ so many people may do a lot of real world checking said
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.000]   No, no, no, this isn't the right one right?
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.840]   This is the right one but apple just listed both of them and because one sounded more official. I guess that was the one that was given
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:40.320]   Dominance and is often in map applications if they can't find the specific place they just drop a pin in the middle of the area
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:45.120]   Well, in this case, it's bad idea. It's a tragedy of errors. Yeah
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:51.520]   And it's been fixed. Yes apple of course immediately fixed it
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:56.000]   We've had at least yeah one place is yeah one well. That's the problem is what other what else lurks in there
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.040]   We've had at least four documented cases said senior sergeant steven feeling the map puts
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:05.840]   It at least 70 kilometers from where it should be we've got people bogged down in sunset
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.000]   country
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.160]   A friend of mine's house is in the middle of a park and we've both reported it every week since the maps came out and it's still sitting in the middle of that
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.640]   Park, oh, that's that's the problem unless so many dies
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:23.200]   It's hard to fix, you know, so that's so that that's your mandate mac break weekly listeners are you willing to take one for the team?
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:31.200]   Um, and of course there's been a lot of attention paid to this and nobody died we should point out
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.400]   There was one guy stranded in 46 degrees Celsius
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.960]   That nobody died apple maps
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:43.120]   That's also not a good way to start to start the meeting. Yeah, hey good news. Nobody's died yet
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:47.760]   But let's fix that shall we Eddie Eddie sit down on the good news is
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:52.000]   I got good news and I got bad news
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.680]   For a monday morning meeting of the maps team who got two important pieces of news
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.520]   I'm gonna have a special guest mr. Tim cook and be uh bring a box and everything your desk with you to this meeting
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:06.480]   Yeah, it used to be this legendary fixer now. Yeah
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:11.680]   So the problem is there's no water you can get bogged down in the sand
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:14.400]   It's really hot
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.800]   And there's no phone reception by the time you get there
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:22.720]   So you're kind of stuck he got there. Um, this guy got there at 6 p.m
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:25.360]   Realize he was nowhere near mildura
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.600]   But he couldn't continue to drive because of the sand on and around the road
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:34.320]   So he stayed there. He was stuck there 24 hours. He was finally rescued
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:37.360]   jeez louise
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.800]   Yeah
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:41.120]   That's that's super intense. That's not good
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:45.440]   It reminded me of the time of friend of mine was uh, I was visiting a friend of mine in Iowa
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:50.880]   Uh, and they were telling me it was october and they were telling me about oh, I was commenting about how wow
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:54.480]   Just all these like long like lonely highways with like nothing there
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:22:00.800]   And of course they start telling me about how everybody knows like has an uncle or somebody who whose car broke down in like january
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.880]   They didn't find him until march and
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:07.280]   And the story always ends with and the funny thing was when they found him he was right on the top of a hill
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:12.160]   He was no more than about hundred yards away from uh from him all but with the wide-out conditions
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:16.640]   He just never saw him poor thing anyway, so that's why I keep a complete camping kit inside the front
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:21.920]   logs and I should say it's a place for we we do know somebody who did die
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:27.120]   uh because uh of incorrect gps uh directions, uh james kim who was a
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:33.760]   analyst and a lab guy at tech tv took his family, uh followed gps directions
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:38.400]   Um, this was a few years ago five or six years ago and uh went up into the snow
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:43.280]   And um, and they thought it was it looked like a road on the gps. It was not
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:47.040]   Uh, they they got on a fire road that got stuck
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.840]   Um, he went to get help
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:55.200]   Uh and died in the snow his family survived. Thank goodness partly thanks to burning tires. They were there for days
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:23:03.360]   So it isn't something that that is actually very serious. Yeah, and uh, you know, there's a lot of talk that apple should license
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:07.360]   You know no kia maps or license google maps when they're already licensing tom tom maps
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:11.200]   But there was this old art proverb where you have to you can't keep looking at other art
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.080]   You have to look at the real world and again google employs
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:21.040]   Thousands of people to go out and look at the real world and correct these things and make human decisions about which is the correct location and until apple
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:24.400]   Can scale up like that. They're going to be behind. They're going to have these problems
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:28.800]   Yeah, I think that's what the kind of the point google was trying to make and no kia's been making as well as that
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:32.560]   This is not something trivial. You in fact apple just used information
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:37.120]   From uh the australian gazetteer. I mean this was it wasn't like they it wasn't they
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:43.840]   This threw a dart at the map. This was all you know in a gazetteer and they just took it as authoritative
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:48.000]   And had a human looked at it. Uh, maybe they would have known the difference. I don't know
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.800]   I mean there's millions of points in here. Oh, I mean this is it's where you it's hard to get into
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:57.440]   Get started in a business where so many people have already made these mistakes and learn from them
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:58.720]   We know kia
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.360]   They don't when they put a hospital on the map
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:06.080]   They don't just trust that from the source. They send someone out to verify that it's there
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:10.880]   Not only do they do that but while they're there they map out here is where the emergency exit is
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.120]   So that if someone pushes that button on there on the console of their in-card navigation
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.200]   So that's telling me take me to the closest emergency room
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:20.560]   It doesn't take you within a block of it. It says turn left here. There's a one-way street here
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:26.160]   So I get to the emergency room. Yeah, so this I can't even guess it's uh that's just one example of things that
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:30.560]   You have to you can't just license databases. You really need boots on the ground to fine-tune these things
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:33.600]   You know the um moving on
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:37.760]   But obviously that's serious and um and i'm you know I have to think that
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:45.040]   As soon as that story came out tom tom and nav tech and google and everybody went quick check our map of australia
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:49.680]   Yeah, because that's kind of an obscure. It's not like a hospital. That's an obscure thing
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.160]   um
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.520]   So remember that apple stock drop we were talking about?
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:59.440]   I guess uh it kind of inspired a trader
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:02.240]   For roshdale securities
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:04.720]   To uh create a get rich scheme
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.800]   He purchased 1.625 million apple shares
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:15.840]   October 25th the same day that apple was to release it's you may remember this it's last quarterly earnings
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:21.680]   Uh, he thought well they'll release the quarter or quarterly earnings. We know they're going to be good the price will go up
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:26.080]   And i'll dump it my employer will never know whoops stocks fell
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:29.200]   Uh
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:34.720]   He said oh no, uh, I added three zeros. I was supposed to just purchase 1,625
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:38.560]   Um, they suffered financial losses
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.960]   Of five million dollars would have been more
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:44.720]   It was actually about a billion dollars with a loss, but they were able to
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:47.360]   quickly trade back traded out
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:50.160]   um, and of course now he's
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:52.240]   Uh, he's under arrest
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.040]   He is definitely not going to win the when the christmas ham this year at the big office party
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:02.960]   That's sure the it's all allegations. I should you know, he's not he's not been found guilty of wire fraud, but
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000]   ongoing investigation
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.120]   Uh, the fbi says we think this is what happened fascinating
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:15.840]   Uh, it is the biggest apple loss in four years. It's not an insignificant
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:18.480]   Certainly lost
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:24.960]   Uh, how about this all of of of the uh of the revenue that they talk about all the time people making money on the app store
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:27.840]   Half of it goes to just 25 companies
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.320]   Most of that is rove eel
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.320]   Be most of its angry birds
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.560]   Almost all angry birds
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:36.560]   Um, that's a that's a that's a big thing
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:41.920]   Yeah, and that's that's why it kind of lends light to when when when apple and other individuals
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:47.840]   Uh, uh, talk about the advantage of the app store like here's how many apps we have here's how the vibrancy of the market
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:52.880]   It really isn't so much the numbers and isn't even so much the amount of money that's being transacted on there
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.760]   It really is
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:58.880]   Do you have the core hundred or 200 best-selling apps the most popular apps that people would need on every single platform?
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:05.920]   Right if you do not then you can't compete but if you have a smaller app store that just has those 300 people that 300 apps that so many people use
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:09.440]   That's really all you need it. It doesn't make it makes a difference to developers
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.000]   But not too as this as this number really indicates
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.120]   It's great if you're one of those handful of developers that is making hundreds of thousands of dollars off of your app
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.640]   If you're not then you're pretty much trying to develop your own little market
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:27.040]   You're trying to sell your own uh 10 20 30 000 copies of this app to get going and so long as you've got more than 30 000
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.760]   Uh, microsoft windows 8 handsets out there you're in there with a chance at least speaking of microsoft
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:40.320]   We starting to see uh some hints. I think a microsoft actually added a skew. What was it Renee for ipad?
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.480]   office
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:47.440]   Uh, there was rumors a while ago. It's one of the in eastern europe some microsoft executive
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:49.440]   There was a powerpoint. Yeah, yeah
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.520]   And said that they were coming out with the iOS version of it
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:55.200]   But I just saw something this week and let me see if I can find the story because I don't think it's in our rundown
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:01.920]   But there was something something released where they had powerpoint for iOS as well as android by the way
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.200]   um
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:09.840]   And uh and word and anyway, I think it's pretty clear even even microsoft is kind of implying that they're going to have
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:13.440]   Um an office in the next six months
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:19.920]   Next year. Yeah, there's a there's an article on uh all things d that I just came out was just posted like 15 minutes ago
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:24.000]   That kind of ties into uh another story that we were talking about earlier today
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.560]   about uh
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:30.400]   Apple and microsoft reputting heads a little bit about uh signups for the skydrive service
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.960]   There's skydrive updates aren't being allowed because
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.160]   For not for the usual reasons that we
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.960]   Assume which is always you can't you can't sell
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:42.560]   Upgrades to your service through our app without giving us a 30 cut
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:45.840]   Or you have to give us the same people the same deal that you were giving up elsewhere
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:48.480]   They're also banning outside services from
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:54.960]   For the implementing all these features because at some point if there's if something's using skydrive
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:01.120]   And allowing people to use this extended service that they bought elsewhere that that same deal should be available through an in app purchase
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:05.840]   And so therefore you should the apple should be getting their 30 cut off everything. We want our 30
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:10.960]   Well, I mean they were they had a sign up button inside the app and I think that was the big point of contention
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:15.280]   Although, although apple according to microsoft they offered to take it out an apple refuse, which sounds
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.800]   Funny, but I think all that was put in place originally because apples
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:23.840]   Instinct was that if we allow this every apple suddenly become free will be hosting them all for free
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:28.880]   And developers will shift all money making ventures outside the app store and then we'll just be running it on a loss
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.760]   Uh, so they put this in place to kind of guard that 30
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:36.880]   But it they didn't take into account all of these edge cases and a lot of those have come back to bite them now
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:41.680]   Yeah, see and this is sort of it's it sort of fits into office for ios because
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:46.160]   Microsoft has a really nice broad plan for office almost though almost as though it's a
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:49.760]   Totally separate mobile product from anything else. They're doing in phones and tablets
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:54.640]   Where uh, if you subscribe to office 365 you essentially get
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:57.600]   Access to office wherever you are however you're doing it
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.560]   You could actually if you own a copy of uh of office
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:05.920]   For windows you don't even just sit down at pretty much any have an office 365 subscription
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:09.840]   You can pretty much sit at any windows machine any windows submachine anywhere
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:14.880]   Log into your office account and it will stream microsoft office to that brand new computer
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:18.240]   Without you having to do a full download install or anything
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:19.840]   So if
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:24.720]   Microsoft really wants to leverage all of the advantages they put into office in the past a year year and a half
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:29.520]   They're going to have to settle this issue early on because office 365 could be a huge source of revenue
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:34.000]   And they don't not particularly interested in giving apple 30 of everything they ever make on this product
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.240]   And unfortunately, like when he said
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:40.320]   Apples intentions were to prevent people developers from trying to get around the 30
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.280]   percent payment
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:48.560]   But in the in the process they also make it very very difficult for people to offer legitimate services outside of the ecosystem where the
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:53.600]   It seems as though in these cases apples trying to get 30 percent of a sale that they're not entitled to
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:56.640]   So I hope they they I hope they solve this because uh
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:02.400]   Microsoft offices still in in what the Beatles catalog was to the iTunes store
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:07.360]   Uh to the I think the I think micro saw microsoft offices to the app store
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:10.640]   It's that one thing that as soon as we get this
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:16.400]   Uh, that's that's that's the one big hole that's left in this catalog that needs to be filled in
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:19.920]   Yeah, because I mean it's it's it's a huge thing
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:24.560]   I mean, it's it's one of the reasons why I liked surface so much the surface rt tablet the ability to run
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:31.360]   A real version of microsoft office for those large pro large collaborative projects that you can't seem to get away from when you decide to
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:34.960]   You know work with other humans on this planet. Uh, it's such a huge
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:38.960]   Exactly. It's such a cool thing to work with uh, uh, an app like that
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:44.960]   On a nice lightweight 12 hour tablet that if that if and when that comes to uh to the ipad
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:47.680]   That's going to be a huge huge shift forward for everybody
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:52.800]   Here's the here's the this is from mac rumors the image that we leaked out on the microsoft support site since been taken down
[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:55.200]   office mobile for iphone
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.080]   Excel for ipad powerpoint for ipad
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:00.720]   so those uh
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:03.200]   I think that that was just an accidental publish
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:06.000]   And it's been pulled down. So I think it's real
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.520]   I can't wait for all the tech support questions that I was using
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:12.400]   On my iPhone and here this stream and it's
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:14.000]   And said

[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.040]   What do you what do you like these days handy?
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:35.360]   Uh, i'm currently going through I rarely pick novels only because I
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:38.480]   I have I don't have a lot of patience for them for some reason
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:44.800]   Uh, and so I hit the pit upon this really cool mystery series by donald westlank
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:52.960]   It's uh, it's called the hot rock which is the first in a series of novels starring a thief called julty called dorkmunder
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:59.360]   Uh, and if you if you imagine a movie made in 1972 starring robert redford as as the affable
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:04.160]   But but sometimes failure prone dorkmunder. You know that this is a very very cool comic
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:08.480]   Uh jul heist movie. It's not one where people get shot in the face every three pages
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:11.520]   Uh, and and people get and body parts get left by the roadside
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:12.560]   It's where
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:16.720]   Someone get it's where the opening chapter is our hero getting getting out of jail
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:22.560]   And fail and in the process the fact that the fact that somebody's that the fact that uh
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:30.240]   That the warden is giving him a handshake with a very very wet hand means he can't collect the 300
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:34.400]   Dollars he was a he would arrange to collect from her other inmate on his way on his way out the door
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:39.280]   Uh, and so it's it's it's it's funny. It's tense. It's gripping uh great characters
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:46.240]   He seems he assembles the roaks gallery of the usual people he worked with every single one who has a who has a certain idiosyncrasy
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:51.440]   Uh, it's uh, and also also it's a good clever book. It's like you read this
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:56.480]   Often a lot of really good like crime thrillers in the back of your head
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:00.400]   You're thinking if I ever were if I ever were to become a criminal
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:04.720]   I would try to steal cars with medical license place because you can't park them just about anywhere
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:07.360]   Good idea great
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:13.040]   There there's some great pleasure in starting a series on audible because and you know you have many more
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.960]   I think there's there's at least uh, there's 1314 dorkmunder books
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:20.240]   So it's great because it means you're beginning a uh
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:24.480]   A long journey that won't end and you don't want these to end
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:29.120]   That's one of the things that audiobooks are so great. You get engaged involved and you're listening

[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:28.640]   Uh, this is a fun. I love these little photo apps that do one really curious thing
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:32.480]   Uh, but they do it such and it's such an interesting way that uh that it's fun
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:35.120]   This is an app called clone camera for for ios
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:41.280]   And the point of this app is to sort of merge together multiple photos into one shot
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:46.720]   So what you can do is is i've got a setup right here. So for instance, let's i've got the
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:50.240]   You just take like start off with one photo right here click
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:54.240]   And then either holding the camera as steady as possible
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:56.960]   Or at least putting it on a tripod
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:59.520]   You then move your subjects around
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:03.600]   And take another shot. Hopefully again lining things up as well as you can
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.440]   click
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:06.800]   and uh
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:09.200]   Then later then when once you're done you move forward
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:15.280]   And now all you got to do is i move the squirrel from one place to another
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:17.200]   All i have to do is sort of outline
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:19.520]   Here is where mr. Squirrel is
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:26.000]   I'm doing this very very fast. So if this turns out looking really really lousy, you know that this is performance anxiety
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:26.960]   Nothing more
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:30.960]   But once you've said here is here's something that i've moved from one place to another it could be anything
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:35.600]   Uh, it could be human beings whatever and so now that i'm now that i'm done and what it's doing right now is
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:39.360]   Composing those two and the result is hey, look there's two squirrels. I've got
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:44.160]   Yeah, so you can do cool things like just you know, that's actually really cool
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:47.680]   Have your kid like at 40 different places at disney world
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:49.600]   Uh
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.760]   Go go to the bank withdraw like one single bundle of of 20s
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:57.040]   And then like sort of like pile them up amongst your office
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:01.120]   With multiple exposures make people think you actually have 800 000 in cash
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:04.000]   That's how much we how much money you made off of your last app
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.200]   Uh, and then of course you can do effects then you can then save it there, but it's a it's uh
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:13.920]   There there there are two different kinds of of weird camera apps like this that i really really like
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:19.680]   One of them is where it lets you do a photographic effect that makes you really do photography really really well and it's wonderful
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:22.080]   Uh, this is the sort of thing where
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:25.440]   You're you're at the bus stop. You're waiting for the airport shuttle
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:30.000]   You don't know if the thing is coming and so you've wind up playing playing around with this camera app to do this
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.560]   So here here's i'm gonna do i'm gonna take a picture in which
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:38.080]   The entire street is just filled with red sports cars because every time a red card comes by
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:42.960]   i'm going to take a picture and add that to the picture and by the time your your shuttle finally comes forward in this late
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:46.720]   You've got this picture where it's just this fleet of red everywhere
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:53.360]   And you've managed to distract and distract yourself from the anger that i told the car service to pick me up at 3 pm
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.840]   It's now 4 pm and it's dark and cold and scary
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:01.440]   But you don't care because you're happy. You don't care exactly you managed to distract yourself from visions of
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:06.480]   Mayhem only a buck 99. It's a lot of fun for buck 99. I think it sounds great. I'm gonna get it
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:09.520]   That's a great clone camera by pita vision
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:12.960]   And uh rene richy your pick of the week this week
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:19.920]   My pick of the week is uh twitterific five. It was just released last week. It has already been updated once
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:24.080]   It is the original grandaddy of all twitter clients. It was it pre-exists
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:30.160]   It's sorry. It was out before the original app store came out. It's been updated almost every year since then
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:35.040]   Uh the last the last version is just incredibly well designed. It's very slick
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.120]   It's got a black on black theme
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:41.680]   Uh from david lahman and gettian, uh, mejia. It looks beautiful. It's
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:45.680]   One of the fastest apps i've ever used it's star wars
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:48.880]   blast or closing fast when you start using it
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:55.120]   Um, and it just it's absolutely gorgeously done just the way you'd expect from the icon factory. Wow
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:59.520]   That's great. It's we you know it's funny because twitter really doesn't want anybody to do these
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:02.240]   And yet tap bots and
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:06.000]   Icon factory and andrewstone just keep doing great twitter clients
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.560]   Well, they're like even they have a lot of user tokens still in a yeah
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:14.400]   Yeah, so they have two times their user base as of the new twitter api rules
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:19.040]   So they're okay for a little while it seems like twitter is content to slowly strangle them to death
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:20.080]   Yeah
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:25.760]   Kill them outright. Well support them. It's only 299. It's well worth it. That's i i love twitterific
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:30.320]   Uh, is it great free if you already have twitterific or do you have to pay for the upgrade?
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:35.440]   No, it is a new app. It has been totally rebuilt redesigned from the ground up
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:40.880]   It is but it's on sale so you get in effect upgrade pricing whether you owned it before or not do that's a good deal great pick
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:48.560]   I don't have a pick this week, but I will note that there is now a new yahoo mail just came out today a new yahoo mail app for iphone and ipod touch
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:57.120]   Uh that uh, you might want to take a look at there also big upgrades for a number of classic iphone apps instagram has a new filter
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:04.720]   Willow but more importantly a new camera and they've really changed how the camera works if your instagram fan make sure you do your updates
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:10.480]   Uh, well worth it and they yank their uh, their support for twitter console
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:13.360]   And that's the battle going on which we didn't talk about today
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:18.800]   But we'll talk about a lot tomorrow on twig. I'm sure is the the battle between instagram facebook and twitter
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:24.640]   Rages on but if you use an app like tweetbot you still get the instagram embeds right right
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:30.000]   So another reason to use an app for as long as they'll let you and another reason for them to not let you
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.640]   Unfortunately
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:34.320]   I just you know
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:39.360]   Whatever happened to the customer comes first. That's what I want. There was this this thing I was saying on twitter where instagram
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:45.040]   Once eyeballs on their website twitter doesn't want eyeballs on third-party clients and no one seems to really care what the eyeballs want
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.760]   Yeah, the eyeballs are just eyeballs. They're not people
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:50.320]   Sad
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:54.240]   Great imore calm. That's where you should go to find out whatever
