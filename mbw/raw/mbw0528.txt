[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.280]   Samsung's arguments in the Supreme Court versus Apple today.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.280]   And what to expect of an imaginary, maybe possible, maybe real app.

[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.760]   I'm having imaginary conversations with Andy and
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.520]   not Cohen Renee, which he for the last three weeks.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.240]   Now I can have actual conversations.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.840]   There he is, Andy Inako, the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.680]   Thank you for filling in for me.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.600]   Oh, we have a little mouse on your face there.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.920]   Can we just brush that off?
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.920]   Thank you.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.160]   And then, not your fault Andy.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.840]   And then on my right in the pink trunks, it's Renee Richie, I'm sorry,
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.400]   the pink watch band, it's Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.080]   I'm getting your watch band mania, I'm afraid.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.560]   Yeah, you're a, is that your M is?
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.400]   You're muted Renee, I don't know what's going on.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.840]   Is it us or is it him?
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.320]   Hey, let me out.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.320]   Cohen!
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.920]   Are you seeing a meter movement on the pot?
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.520]   There we go.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.000]   Is that better?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.320]   Okay, 12 in my end, I'm probably incredibly bad at this podcasting thing.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.920]   I can't imagine how.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.720]   How many a week do you do now?
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.000]   No, I'm cutting down Leo.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I'm cutting down.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.520]   Well, thank you for not cutting down on us because we had Renee on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.520]   It was great to have you.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.520]   Thank you so much.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.520]   So much fun.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.520]   Emergency.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.560]   When I said, you know, Renee's always working.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.360]   Why don't you give him a ring?
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.360]   And that was true.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.360]   That was true.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.360]   Well, that was a great show.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.360]   I really appreciate it.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.360]   Oh, thank you.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.360]   So yeah, I am.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.720]   Because I got the white watch.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.000]   So I thought, well, that'll work with any watch band.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.360]   My heart rate monitor stopped working this morning.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.040]   But I turned the watch off and on and I fixed it.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.040]   Is that a tip?
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.680]   I saw somebody with the white watch and I saw them on several days.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.600]   I forget where I think it was in New York City.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.520]   And every day they had a different band that matched their plaid shirts.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.240]   Yes, you can do that now.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.240]   Look it.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.240]   See how I've kind of.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.240]   It was an island band.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.200]   So it wasn't so expensive, but they could really match every shirt.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   I've done that.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.760]   I've got the, I mean, I think that that's kind of color coordinated.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.760]   It's fetching.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.680]   And the white is neutral.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.640]   So I'm sorry, Renee.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.440]   And the black Milanan.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.440]   No, no, no.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.920]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.720]   Take the talk, man's fashions and industrializations all daily.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.560]   I know we could.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.240]   I know we could.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.160]   You guys have been talking-- and thank you for filling in for me.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.880]   You guys have been talking a lot, of course, about all of the things that happened while
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.880]   I was gone.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.960]   The release of the iPhone, people got their iPhones.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.720]   I got it the day I left, which is great.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.280]   I was able to take an iPhone 7 Plus with me.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.200]   And I was thrilled because most of my best pictures are not from the Leica Q
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.000]   that I brought as well, the fancy expensive camera.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.280]   But from the phone, that's telling.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.040]   Yeah, it's a scene, man.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.520]   I was at the near Comic Con last week.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.200]   And so I was impressed enough with the quality of the camera
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.920]   that I was kind of using it as my B camera.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.120]   I had my beloved Olympus EM1.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.440]   And it was taking great shots because I had a really good lens
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.760]   and I had a really good flash.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.440]   But there were so many times where you could just get really nice results
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.400]   with just that iPhone.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.840]   Some of the best ones were just that and like a little like $75 LED,
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.240]   the Loom Cube light, just getting some beautiful shots.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.800]   I had to keep reminding people on Instagram, but no, this is unedited.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.120]   No, but I'm not even running the beta, so I don't get the fake bokeh effect.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.120]   So yeah.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.000]   Pretty impressive.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.440]   Yeah, pretty darn impressive, I must say.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.640]   The color and the clarity are really superb.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.600]   And it was very handy.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.040]   I should pull up some pictures to have this soon.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.120]   We shot with a 5D Mark III for everything when I'm more up until the iPhone 7 came out
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.640]   and we haven't used it since.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.520]   It's all been iPhone 7.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.000]   Is it really that much better?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   So the biggest problem we had is that if it was anything but great sunlight,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.920]   we had to go back to a big camera because the iPhone didn't handle low light.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.840]   It does so well in highlight.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.000]   Yeah, of course.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.040]   And this, you still can't go really, really low light, but it gives you,
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.600]   you can shoot through a much larger period of the day than you could before.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.560]   And that's incredibly helpful when you do it for a living.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.880]   I have to make sure that the difference between shooting stuff that's going to be on the web,
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.960]   whether it's a website or for Instagram and stuff where you're going to go into Lightroom
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.840]   and then take a look at it really, really close.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.840]   I did a little bit of testing on Sunday, meaning in the sense where I'm taking pictures
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.840]   with two different phone cameras and my Olympus just that when I get home,
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.200]   I could see really with the difference between all the three of them.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.440]   And it really does fall, I wouldn't say it doesn't fall apart,
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.800]   but you can definitely see the difference on your on your Mac screen
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.200]   that you could not see on the screen of the phone or screen of the camera.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.200]   If you pixel peep, in other words, if you go, you really, here's an example,
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.680]   though of where the zoom is handy.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.600]   So here, this is Notre Dame low light, a picture of a wood carving.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.240]   That's the regular 28 millimeters lens.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.000]   And then that's without any movement of on my part, the 56 millimeter, the zoom lens.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.280]   And it's really nice to have that, by the way, a horrific scene.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.760]   This is the slaughter of the innocence.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.880]   But the difference is very handy.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.760]   Now, of course, it's still a camera phone.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.040]   It's still a camera phone.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.680]   I'm not saying that.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.760]   But I also noticed that my Leica required considerably more attention after the fact,
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.960]   right?
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.960]   And I have to go in there, white balance.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.920]   And the stuff comes out of the iPhone.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.400]   If you're posting-- let's put it this way.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.960]   If you're posting a Facebooker, Instagram, it's fine, right?
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.200]   It's as good as you need it to be.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.200]   Again, it's so-- it's like Renee said.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.360]   In bright sunlight, there are very few high-level smartphone cameras
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.920]   that don't do an excellent job.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.280]   I do think the iPhone 7 does a much better job-- excuse me-- a better job.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.520]   It's not a much better job than most of them.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.200]   It's when, even when it's overcast.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.160]   Like, it was rainy on Sunday morning.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160]   And so I'm walking around New York taking pictures.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.760]   And that's even at that level, when you try to look at it as,
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.400]   is this something that 15 years from now, I'm
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.120]   going to be making a print of this and hanging it on the wall
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.400]   and putting it above my sofa?
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.840]   That's the level at which you see the difference between a phone camera
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.960]   and a quote, "real camera," even a cheap real camera.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.600]   But for most-- for a lot of people, that's not going to be really important.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.840]   And of course, this is the phone that you'll have with you all the time.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.360]   Here's an example of the HDR.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.200]   Again, this is in a very dimly lit church, but it's able to really pick up--
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.080]   Let's us get shots that we couldn't get with previous generation hardware,
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.240]   which to me is a huge difference.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.840]   Yes, I was pleased.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.200]   That is probably the only massive difference
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.080]   between the iPhone 6s plus and the iPhone 7 plus.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.160]   Well, the headphone jack, that's a negative difference.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.400]   Hands up, come to you, or, because if you drop it in water, it's a good--
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.560]   It's waterproof.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.840]   It's faster, though, again, I point out nobody really has complained
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.520]   about the success being slow.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.760]   The portrait mode, when you use the-- the portrait mode can peg the A10 processor,
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.760]   which is impressive, because it's doing the custom disk blur live,
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.760]   so you can see it while you're taking the photo.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.120]   Right.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.600]   And I just want to stop for a second and say,
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.240]   that little animation, when it moves between 1x and 2x,
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.440]   or when it does the depth of field effect,
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.600]   they did a really good job of that,
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.560]   because you're cutting between two different lenses,
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.600]   and you're picking the best lighting for the viewfinder,
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.400]   and you have to give people an approximation of what they're seeing.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.640]   Oh, it just soon, doesn't it? Yeah.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.080]   Yeah, it goes kind of like a bloop, I guess, not a--
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.080]   I never noticed that.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.080]   It's a little bit of an acceleration in it.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.080]   Wow, that's pretty cool.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.720]   Now, portrait mode is not out in general to the general public.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.720]   It's still the beta for 10.2.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.720]   Yes.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.720]   What is that?
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.720]   That's supposed to be this month, right?
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.720]   Yeah, 10.1 is supposed to come out at 10.1 this month.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.720]   OK.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.720]   So we should be looking for that.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.720]   And I-- at least--
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   Maybe the coincide with the AirPods, that would be a good guess.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.880]   Oh, good guess.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.000]   And when will we see the AirPods?
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Late October.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.200]   You're liking those.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.560]   Yes, they're fantastic.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.280]   So this time in the next 10 to 20 days--
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.000]   --before Halloween.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.920]   You don't notice how much of difference not having the cord
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.200]   pulling at your ear is until you're out walking all the time
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.520]   and shooting all the time and just even doing anything.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.480]   They stay in where the corded ones always pull down.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.800]   Yeah, I mean, really, I have to say,
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:56.160]   I bought four more headphone adapters just so I would have them.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.880]   But I do miss having a headphone jack.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.040]   So I guess this is Apple really pushing us
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.800]   to a wireless future.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.680]   And in my time, people cancel a difference
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.000]   when I'm on them and when I'm on the phone.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.400]   And they sometimes get wrong.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.680]   I'm on the phone and they're like,
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.960]   could you please get off the headset?
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.640]   Oh.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.480]   That's interesting.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.720]   The noise canceling is--
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.360]   the beamforming and the noise canceling is really well done.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.880]   I'm not being my Halloween costume.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.240]   I might be an AirPod for Halloween.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.560]   You should be a disgruntled phone owner who is still upset
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.800]   about the lack of headphone jack.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.160]   Am I really holding on?
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.200]   Is it just holding on?
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.880]   Is it just holding on to the past to say,
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.280]   I wish I had a headphone jack?
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.000]   No, I mean, there are going to be annoyances
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.240]   that you're going to have to--
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.520]   On the plane, for instance.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.000]   I wanted to listen on a 10-hour flight.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.560]   And I didn't want to kill my battery.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.920]   I wanted to arrive with some battery.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.160]   So I didn't-- and I didn't have that as an option
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.400]   because I couldn't charge and listen as an example.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.240]   Right?
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:54.040]   I keep comparing it to like when Gary Burgoff left the cast
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:54.960]   to mash.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   It's not a good thing.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.960]   It's not a bad thing.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.480]   It's a change that happened.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.880]   There are things you're going to miss.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.040]   There are new things that you're going to take advantage of.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.920]   Are you saying the headphone jack is radar o'Reilly?
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.920]   Yes.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.440]   I'm waiting--
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.440]   I'm waiting.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.040]   I'm waiting.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.280]   See, the thing is though--
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.200]   I am talking about like a 30-year-old--
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.040]   I'm saying the AirPods are clinger.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.200]   I've done one thing at a time.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.280]   I did very, very well.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.080]   And then I move on.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.920]   Apple is Charles Emerson, Winchester III.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.480]   Yes.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.840]   Wow.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.160]   Anybody who wasn't a mash fan is completely--
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:24.680]   Exactly.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.640]   That's a 35-year-old cultural reference.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.280]   Thanks, guys.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.160]   I find I'm joking more and more of those, Andy.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.080]   Just welcome to the club.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.160]   By the way, your costume at Comic Con was awesome.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.840]   We talked about that on Saturday on the new screen savers.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.840]   There you go.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.600]   As I predicted, fewer than two people recognized it.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.280]   That is to say, zero people recognized it.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.000]   I was dressed as Bill Cunningham, a fashion photographer
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.680]   of the New York Times.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.080]   But I was pleasing myself.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.200]   And that was pretty much the thing.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.880]   The sad thing was I actually had a second costume ready for the second day.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.400]   But instead of spending four days of the con, because of work,
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.520]   I wound up spending just two days of the con.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.040]   And on Sunday, I'm like, I really don't have mental bandwidth and time
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.120]   to do a second costume.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.400]   So oh, well, I'll save it for another surprise.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.880]   Was the blue jacket the key?
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.000]   Was that how we should have recognized the--
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.440]   You should have--
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.720]   Basically, there's the blue French dustman's jacket
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.520]   is the signature part of it.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.480]   Although I did watch--
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.360]   Where did you get that, by the way?
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.840]   I wanted to get a real one.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.880]   But now they're actual kind of fashion items.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:36.280]   You can't get them for less than $50 or $60 or $70 on eBay.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.360]   So I actually just went to a uniform shop.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:45.760]   And you can find the sort of coat that a bus person would wear at a restaurant.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.200]   And they're available in 18 colors.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.480]   And OK, get the blue one.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:54.360]   And the sad thing is, it's actually of all the coats or blazers
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.240]   I've ever bought.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.240]   It's the one that fits me the best ever.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.400]   The sleeves are bright.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.480]   The buttons are bright.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.280]   The colors are bright.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.440]   I almost want to take it to my tail and say, could you
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.960]   so aligning into this and some--
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.080]   Had an inside pocket?
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.240]   Wow.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.640]   So I just realized that, hey, when I go to Comic-Con,
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.960]   I am also walking around asking strangers whose clothes I like
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.680]   if I could take their picture.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.960]   So there you go.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.920]   It works.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.040]   It's the French workwear revolution, apparently,
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.680]   according to the Financial Times.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.240]   Everybody's wearing them.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.400]   I don't know if this is--
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.600]   Love them, you tail.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.480]   This is for our field as we've ever gotten.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.840]   And I know you, again, I'm just-- because I haven't had a chance
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.160]   to talk about the iPhone 7, I'm just bringing it up.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.520]   And I actually wore the Apple Watch the whole trip.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.440]   I didn't get my series too till I got home.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.000]   But I feel-- as I've said before, traveling.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.920]   It's very handy to have the watch for a variety of reasons.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.080]   And I've been wearing it as an exercise watch since I got back.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.000]   And it's good.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.920]   It's nice.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.600]   You get a new watch.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.160]   You just want to do it.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   You just want to fill those rings.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:04.720]   Look at you.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.880]   You are just showing off now.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.680]   No, but you can't.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.960]   Because of the new sharing feature,
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.920]   I am not intrinsically motivated.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.440]   If it's left to me, I'd be like, I could sit here and write
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.800]   and watch TV and just not have to do anything.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.880]   Or I could-- no, I'm not going for it.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.040]   But now I see like I see Serenity or I see another one
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.440]   of my friends pop up, work out complete, close the--
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.400]   and like, no, no, I will not let them win.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.720]   And then I have to go out there and do it.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.360]   And it's proved hugely motivational for me.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.280]   So how do you share it?
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.720]   I have to do that.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.040]   Yes, so you go to the activities app,
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.480]   and then there's a button for sharing.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.880]   Oh, I'm going to share my activities.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.440]   But this is why I was so angry that the heart rate monitor
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.400]   stopped working today because I didn't get credit.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:39.960]   Yes.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.360]   For my half hour on the treadmill,
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.400]   my half hour on the rowing machine, zero credit.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.320]   It says you still have more work to do.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.120]   See, my worst thing-- I've had that happen.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.440]   And it's OK because I'll work out again.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.240]   But when you don't get your stand points,
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.320]   there is no way to add-- you could futz with, I guess,
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.560]   the times, but it's very hard to add time to the day.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.840]   I don't want to stand.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.520]   I want the ring, though.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.840]   Yeah, I do want that ring.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.160]   And if it's 11 o'clock and it's two hours,
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.600]   like you physically can't do it.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.680]   It's like there's no point even trying life anymore.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.120]   Oh, your rings are so much better than mine.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.960]   I have to really get to work on my rings.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.200]   We'll motivate each other, Leo.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.560]   All right, I'm going to share my rings with you
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.760]   because that's depressing.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.200]   That's good.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.240]   So sharing, it's a terrible icon.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.560]   It looks like something 70s.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.040]   But what's great is that they give you canned responses.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.880]   So if I see yours coming in, I could say,
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.880]   wait a go, Leo, or Shazam, or awesome.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.360]   Wow.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.600]   How do you trash talk to you?
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.320]   Is that all you got, lame?
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.000]   Move faster.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.120]   So, oh, OK.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.880]   It's suggested, Megan and you.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.480]   Apparently--
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.240]   all right, nice.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.560]   So I'm going to share it with you and Megan.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.120]   I don't know why Alex Lindsey's on here.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.600]   I don't think he has an Apple watch.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.360]   So it's just looking at people--
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.360]   is it looking at people who have Apple watches?
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.240]   It's people who have activated an Apple watch
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.160]   with an Apple ID that you have in your contacts.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.440]   Well, I'm going to share it with you and Megan.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.920]   Apparently, I don't have serenity.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.360]   It's a technical touch.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.600]   That's cool.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.200]   So now people-- now I'll know that you're beating the hell out
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:07.720]   of me.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.000]   I don't know if you want to turn it.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.280]   I just completed a two-hour roller derby workout.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.720]   And you just want to give up.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.760]   That's so good.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.600]   I'm reviewing the new Fitbit version 2.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.840]   And so on Saturday-- I'm not kidding.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.360]   I was on the streets of New York from 2.30 in the morning
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.040]   until 9 o'clock at night.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.840]   And so I had to make sure that I got back to my room well
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.120]   before midnight so I could take for the review
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.280]   as many screenshots as possible as, OK, you did 31,000 steps.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.800]   You walked 13.2 miles.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.640]   You climbed 22 flights upstairs.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.400]   Because I want that to be the representation
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.320]   of what my activity is generally like.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.880]   It does.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.520]   Let's take a break.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.000]   And when we come back, something more serious, less
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:52.680]   frivolous.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.120]   We're going to talk about the Supreme Court.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.400]   Apple had its day in court today.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.960]   In front of the Supreme Court, we'll talk about questions.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.920]   I talked about that yesterday.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.000]   I mean, Samsung released everything
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.360]   that happened yesterday already.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.840]   And we can also talk about Samsung.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.360]   This is the shot in Freud moment.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.800]   But it looks like Samsung is now, according to the Wall
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.640]   Street Journal, discontinuing the Note 7.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.040]   There before the grace of God goes any manufacturer.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.160]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:19.840]   But let's talk about it.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:19.840]   Hold on.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.200]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   Coming up.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.400]   But first, let me talk about my tracker.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.280]   Here's another thing I was very glad to have
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.080]   as I'm traveling around.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.800]   My tracker, there's things you don't want to lose,
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.000]   like your keys or your passport.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.520]   And having the separation alerts,
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.480]   I have my passport and a special passport wallet
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.840]   that's big enough to put this.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.800]   And it's not very big.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.600]   This is a tracker bravo in.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.840]   It's about the size of a quarter, a little bit thicker,
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.560]   a lot lighter, though, because it's anodized aluminum.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.400]   And of course, you can also get stuff engraved on it,
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.480]   or this is the printing, the silk screen on it.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.000]   It's really, really--
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.280]   actually, I don't know what it is.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:02.000]   They say it's ultraviolet, somehow ultraviolet printed on here.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.200]   So it doesn't rub off or scratch off.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   But this is awesome.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.680]   So this is a Bluetooth tracker.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.880]   There's not a GPS in here.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.240]   The GPS is in your phone.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.000]   You pair it to your phone.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.560]   And your phone can track up to 10 trackers at once.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.360]   That means you could have trackers everywhere.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.880]   Your remote controls, you can have it on your kitty cat.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.440]   It's small enough you could put it in a collar,
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.400]   and they have a little waterproof thing
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.160]   that they can attach it to.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.280]   Or you can put it around it.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.440]   So it's really actually perfect for that.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.720]   And then here's the beauty part.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.440]   And there's settings for all of this.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.400]   You have-- there's two customizable two-way separation
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.200]   alerts.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.120]   So if you leave your phone behind, your tracker beeps,
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.120]   if you leave your tracker behind,
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.640]   whatever it's attached to, keys, passport, your phone beeps.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.440]   And then-- so that's within the Bluetooth range
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.360]   of around 100 feet.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.560]   But then they also have this.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.880]   And this was brilliant.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.720]   And I asked them, did you guys think of this ahead of time?
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.400]   And they said, yeah, this was kind of the long-term plan.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.600]   But it only works when you sell a lot of them.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.520]   And now they've sold 1,000,000 and 1/2 of them
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.080]   to the Crowd GPS network.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.720]   So whenever your-- so your tracker's out there.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.800]   Your keys are lost.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.640]   Your passport's left behind at the train station.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.960]   But anybody who's running the tracker software,
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.760]   when they walk by your keys or your passport,
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.360]   it makes a note of that and sends you an alert.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.000]   And they just turned on notifications.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.960]   So it'll actually notify.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.560]   Your keys were just seeing your passport
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.480]   was just seeing it right here.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.440]   So you'll get an update, a GPS update.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.120]   And look at all the-- this map is updated all the time.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.560]   Look at all the trackers all over the country.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.480]   All over the-- I could testify to it
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.160]   all over the world.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.240]   They also have something new called the tracker Atlas
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.640]   that works with your tracker Bravo
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.840]   or other third-party Bluetooth trackers
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.480]   to pinpoint your item on a customizable floor plan of your house.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.400]   You just ask the tracker Atlas where your item is.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.040]   And that doesn't just say it's at home.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.240]   It says it's under the couch, dude.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.120]   It's hidden.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.280]   It fell behind the sofa.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.360]   Now, one other thing I want to mention about this--
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.800]   there are other Bluetooth trackers.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.440]   But this one, which is awesome, has an exchangeable battery.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.440]   And it's very easy.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.320]   The battery depends on how you use it.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.440]   It will last up to a year.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.640]   If you have all the separation alerts turned on
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.320]   and you use it a lot, you press this button
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.320]   to say where's your phone and all that.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.960]   Maybe four or five months.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.520]   But the batteries are just those little coin-sized batteries
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.360]   you get at the drugstore.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.680]   And it's trivially easy to replace it.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.480]   So actually, proactively every three months,
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.760]   I just replaced my tracker battery
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.240]   because I always want to keep track of where my keys are,
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.440]   my passport, and all of that.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.920]   This is the tracker.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.280]   We're going to get you 30% off your entire--
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.680]   order if you go to the tracker.com
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.360]   and use the promo code MACBRAKE.

[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.360]   The hardest thing to do is to find the website.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.520]   Your belongings, you'll know where they are with their website.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.160]   It's a little spell a little different.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.800]   T-H-E-T-R-A-C-K-R.com.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.640]   And don't forget that promo book MACBRAKE for 30% off.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.640]   And that includes the printing, the engraving.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.040]   And as many trackers as you need.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.320]   I love this is nicest MACBRAKE weekly.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.600]   I can't use it yet because we're still--
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.160]   when we use it in the ads, we might show it.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.120]   But someday I'll have that to tracker.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.320]   Get yours today, the tracker.com.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.080]   And we thank you so much for making the act
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:16.960]   break weekly possible.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.640]   Andy and Naco, Renee, Richie, which she want to talk--
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.440]   let's talk about Samsung because--
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.520]   - We're Samsung.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.240]   - We could talk about Android 7.1 developer preview
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.040]   with circular icons, but OK, Samsung.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.040]   I feel for him.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.680]   And I have to say, I think the competition is healthy for Apple.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.520]   So I regret that this is happening.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.640]   I also thought the Note 7 was a really great phone.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.160]   I turned mine in, of course, at the beginning of the recall.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.440]   I debated it, but after about the 60th phone burned up,
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.840]   I thought, yeah, it's not.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.120]   And because I was going to get on a plane and a boat,
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.840]   I wasn't about to carry it with me.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.840]   But now we've seen 6 in the US alone,
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.720]   6 incidents of the fixed phone, the replaced phone
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.240]   catching on fire.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.480]   And at least in two of those incidents that I know about,
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.480]   the phone was in somebody's pocket or on somebody's bed.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.040]   It wasn't being charged.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.840]   And that's really scary.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.320]   If a phone just spontaneously combusts, what's going on?
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:23.240]   And is Samsung really being as forthright as they need to be?
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.200]   - There's-- who knows?
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.960]   This is as bad as it gets.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.320]   And it's not just-- it's not just-- it's
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.200]   gone beyond the question of can they fix these phones.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.120]   It's that now how much work are they
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.960]   going to have to do to convince airlines to allow
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.880]   these devices on the plane?
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.200]   The last time we've seen this, of course,
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.560]   is when people had those hoverboards,
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.920]   where an entire industry got shut down by basically saying
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.200]   every single form of public transport
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.880]   saying that you are not allowed to even have these onboard
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.800]   because we feel they're so dangerous.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.080]   At that point, the brand is completely impossible to reclaim.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.440]   And the fact that even replacement batteries
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.040]   weren't eliminating the problem, that's it.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.040]   - I want to say, though, that it's not clear
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.080]   that they were replacement batteries.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.760]   They were replacement phones.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.840]   And there's some speculation because they turned them around
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.640]   in a week that they were not, in fact, replacing the batteries
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.520]   but changing the firmware because those who had the replacement
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.160]   say, yeah, the battery life is terrible.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.120]   So that they were messing with software to turn it around fast.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.480]   That's pure speculation.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.880]   I don't know.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.240]   - Right now, remember that Samsung went from a voluntary
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.360]   recall to a government recall, which
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.480]   puts a lot more obligation on them,
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.480]   which means that they actually probably-- excuse me--
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.320]   they actually had to come up with a plan to address it
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.920]   that had to be talked about with the government.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.360]   So I would be very surprised if all they did
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.400]   was pull out the fuse from the stick of dynamite
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.480]   that was inside the phone and say that this was a fixed thing.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.520]   I don't know if the government would have approved that.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.760]   So it's clearly they thought that it was a problem
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.760]   with a certain line of batteries from a certain factory
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.640]   or maybe even just a certain limited production run.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.160]   It's probably now that they have a problem
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.520]   with the charging circuits themselves.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.640]   Because lithium batteries, you have to treat them extremely
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.520]   patiently.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.840]   If you treat them within the range they're supposed to be charged
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.840]   at and discharged at, they're perfectly fine.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.040]   Once you hook them up to something that is--
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.400]   once you basically bruise them, there's almost a time bomb
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.760]   effect going on there.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.160]   - So what-- you'd want to be very clear
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.000]   that anybody who's listening-- I doubt there are many,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.600]   but anybody who's listening who has a note 7,
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.360]   what Samsung is saying today, turn it off.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.200]   Don't turn it on again.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.280]   And we're going to send you a fireproof box.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.920]   Jesus.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.280]   Fireproof box with thermal insulation.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.560]   - Oh, yeah, and it's a problem for them now.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.560]   - And you're going to--
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.440]   so they're refunding everybody.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.080]   What Samsung is doing right is they're backing this.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:04.920]   They're standing behind it.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.480]   They're refunding everybody.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:11.120]   They're not-- they didn't dilly-dally about discontinuing it.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.360]   But at the same time, I don't think they've
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.920]   been as forthread as I would like them to be.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.480]   Maybe they have with the CPSC about what exactly is wrong.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.680]   And maybe they didn't know.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.440]   Because if six new replacement phones burst into flames,
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.520]   too, maybe they were wrong about what was wrong.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.720]   - It could be the battery connector.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.720]   It could be just so many little things.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.240]   And yeah, I mean, you think about that these are not
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.280]   going to be hand-carried back to Samsung.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.760]   They're going to be put on board planes.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.680]   And so I bet that that's what the carrier and that's
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.480]   what the shipper brings to Samsung.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.400]   And it's also worth noting that there
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.720]   have been no reported problems with the Galaxy 7.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.240]   So whatever shared DNA there is between these two phones,
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.000]   and there is a lot, it doesn't mean
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.280]   that their entire engineering pipeline is screwed up.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.840]   It means that there is something they change with this phone.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.080]   Or again, something they did with this production run
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:00.800]   that was bad.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:05.280]   But once again, there's a point at which you can reclaim the brand
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.840]   and there's a point at which-- no, it's just really just
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:08.480]   screwed up.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.960]   - According to--
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.480]   - XDA developers, the box that Samsung is sending consumers
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:19.080]   for return comes with gloves, too, besides insulation.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.240]   And it's specific labeled that it's
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.680]   for damage-defective lithium-ion batteries and, quote,
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.120]   it's forbidden to transport by aircraft.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.480]   So they're not even putting these on planes.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.200]   They have to ship them by ground.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:33.680]   You're right.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.560]   OK, so I'm sorry.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.640]   I just wanted the consumer alert to get out there.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.000]   Now, but you're right, Andy.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:39.680]   The real issue is--
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   - You don't think it's a collector's item.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.600]   You're a maniac.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.880]   Just send it back.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.080]   - I hesitated.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.760]   And now I'm glad I got rid of it.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.800]   I took the money and I bought an iPhone 7 with it.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.720]   I suspect more than a few people have done that.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.400]   Google quickly getting the pixel out
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.800]   at a surprisingly similar price point saying, hmm.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.720]   But how damaging is not just to the Note 7 brand?
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.160]   Because that's dead.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.160]   To the Galaxy S7 brand, the Note 8 brand, the Galaxy S8
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.560]   brand, and the Samsung brand.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.000]   Is it really over?
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.600]   - See, two years ago, I would have said
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.680]   that this was really, really hard.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.920]   I mean, again, famously, Tylenol and Bub and Beyond
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.480]   to reclaim their reputation following their incident.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.880]   But we live in such a strange time now, Leo, where previously--
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.520]   and I don't want to bring politics into it, but I will.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.760]   Previously, you had one incident with a politician.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.880]   In their career, their run for office, whatever, it was done.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.120]   And today, you have things that certainly
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.680]   majority of people find objectionable on a daily basis.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.600]   And you're fine.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.840]   And we see that in brands, too.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.760]   There are things that would have killed a brand.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.680]   Just absolutely killed it five years ago.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.640]   And we see today on Android Central, people are like,
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.760]   I'm thinking about keeping mine.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.960]   I'm going to buy another one immediately.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.680]   I can't get a new one fast enough.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.240]   And I don't know where the cultural shift happened,
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:50.120]   but we're much less intolerant of brand or personality
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.320]   failure than we used to be.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.840]   - But also, the Note 7 was unique amongst phones.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.960]   I mean, it's not merely another--
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.760]   and also RAM.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.440]   I mean, it has stylus.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.000]   The unique design is beautiful.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.840]   It's a large screen and a small body.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.600]   There were lots to--
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.200]   - Lots of things.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:07.720]   - Lots of things.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.720]   - People really--
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.480]   - But I bet if you did a poll--
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.280]   I want to see this.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.360]   And I hope Android Central does this.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.040]   But did a poll saying, would you buy a Galaxy Note 8
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.240]   if they released it next month?
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.720]   I believe I'd be shocked by the amount of people that said yes.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.520]   - I'd be-- if we extend that to the next version of the Note,
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:28.120]   then it's the people will buy the next iteration of--
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.160]   let's just call it the next large-sized Samsung Premium
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.160]   smartphone.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.560]   I would even wonder if they're going to continue with the Note
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.760]   brand because it's been so damaged.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.600]   But the thing is, I think this is akin
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.400]   to what if Apple unfathomably and unthinkably
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.400]   had a similar problem with the 6+ or the 7+.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.400]   It's not that people would never buy another iPhone.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.280]   They would look for signs that whatever it was that
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.880]   was causing this huge problem with this device,
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.360]   they have fixed it and addressed it.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.960]   And this shares no DNA with that previous model.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.400]   And the reason for that is because people aren't buying
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.400]   Galaxy Note 7s because it's a crappy phone
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.720]   or it's the one they're forced to buy,
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.640]   or it's the only one that runs the software,
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.320]   it's because it's an elite product on the same--
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.040]   it gives the same level of satisfaction to its users
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.320]   as the iPhone 7+ does, right?
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.760]   The iPhone 6+ does.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:23.080]   So it's going to take a lot for the world's leading
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.960]   manufacturer of smartphones, which
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.480]   is what Samsung is, to have an ongoing problem
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.880]   selling smartphones because they make good phones.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.160]   It's just this one kind of explodes.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:34.800]   - And it doesn't--
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.560]   - It doesn't lead into it.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.320]   Fireproof.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.320]   - Does it extend to other smartphones?
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.320]   Should we--
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.040]   - Again, these types of batteries, again, if they go bad,
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.360]   if you ding them a little bit, I've built some stuff
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.440]   and I have dropped a lithium battery
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.200]   and decided that I am not going to use that battery again
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.400]   because I don't have the wherewithal to make sure
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.720]   that nothing has happened to that battery.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.120]   As a matter of fact, I got someone linked to me.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:08.000]   I'm going to give you an example of how bad sometimes
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.080]   fear about this can be.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.440]   Someone linked to me's story from China
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:18.400]   that a iPhone 7 user claims that his battery in his iPhone
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.640]   exploded and caused burns and caused scarring.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:27.160]   It's possible that, again, it was dropped in damage.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.080]   It's possible this was a total fraud.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.440]   It's possible that he bought a knockoff that
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.400]   doesn't have Apple components in it.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.200]   And it's possible that it's a legit phone that was charged
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.680]   with an a faulty charger that damaged the battery.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.920]   So this is-- I think we're going to see a lot of people,
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.280]   maybe some writers who are not that great,
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.280]   trying to amplify the attention of this
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.480]   by trying to claim that now Apple has a problem.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.880]   Now these other manufacturers have a problem.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.560]   Again, anything that has a battery of that kind,
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.400]   and it is, again, if it's maltreated, could have a problem.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.280]   But it's not something-- it's a problem that's very, very well
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.240]   accepted, it's very, very well understood,
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.440]   and it's very, very easily avoided.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.120]   There's a level of catastrophic failure
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.400]   that occurs to every battery, every lithium ion battery,
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.120]   and every product.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.640]   But it is usually a very small handful of devices
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.240]   that have been subject to some sort of external stressor.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.440]   The level of catastrophic failure in the Samsung Galaxy Note
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.160]   7 was what led to the recall.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:26.040]   So here's the from Samsung.com updated consumer guidance
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.440]   for the Galaxy Note 7.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:36.960]   You need to do-- exchange your phone with another device.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.200]   But more importantly, actually, here's one.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.800]   This one is maybe better, and thanks to the chatroom.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.520]   This is from the UK.
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:48.040]   This is a little bit more dramatic updated today.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.400]   This is in an accent, which is amazing.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.760]   Yeah, to all of our Galaxy Note 7 customers,
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:53.840]   we're truly sorry.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.640]   We have not met the high standard that you expect from Samsung.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.400]   We thank you for your patience during this time.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.240]   And apologize for the inconvenience we have caused.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.560]   We would like to reassure you and all our Samsung customers
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.640]   that the Galaxy Note 7 is the only device affected.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.200]   But Samsung has lost billions on this.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.240]   In fact, one analyst, according to the Wall Street Journal
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.960]   in Korea, says that the three month--
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.040]   the quarter, one quarter cost of this
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.600]   could reach $2.8 billion.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.640]   And that doesn't factor in the cost--
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.640]   that doesn't factor in the cost of the relaunch.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.640]   Because when they come up with their next large screen phone,
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.960]   they're the budget for just convincing people
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.240]   that we have completely addressed this problem,
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.680]   and just the budget for making it attractive, maybe even
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.360]   financially, for people to have some faith.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.320]   And also the budget for--
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.720]   if you have, at any point, held a basketball, a baseball,
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.520]   or a football in your hands, we are
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.120]   going to give you a free--
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.760]   or a microphone in your hands, we
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.360]   are going to give you a free Galaxy Note 8
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.400]   because we need to send that first family on the playable
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.440]   raft into the ocean to prove that the start is really dead.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.520]   And only when they come back safely are other people
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.680]   going to be coming and going back into the water.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.200]   I mean, at this point, I would take a note.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.160]   And I would figure, oh, man, this is probably
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.520]   going to be the safest phone ever.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.160]   Particularly for $90.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.920]   That's going to be a good value.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.720]   I mean, some people, as soon as there's a problem
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.640]   with the airline industry, they will not get on a plane.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.440]   And other people are like, it's the safest time to fly.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.080]   That's really a personal decision.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.240]   And you can get a Galaxy S7 if you love Samsung.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.400]   You can get a Galaxy Note 5 if you love the Note.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.040]   You can get a Pixel.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:28.920]   You can get an iPhone.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.240]   Just get something else.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.680]   Right now, just get something else.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.920]   So there's a Schadenfreude segment for the week.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.280]   And I hope you enjoyed it.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.920]   Actually, Samsung and Apple are in court.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.080]   They're in the Supreme Court today.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.520]   This is over the design patents.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.240]   So there were two separate Samsung
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.920]   actions against Samsung by Apple.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:59.480]   One was over violating patents like Slide to Unlock,
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.320]   actual patented technologies.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.680]   And the other was over the design patents.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.600]   That is effectively saying Samsung copied Apple
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.120]   to trick consumers into buying Samsung phones
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.400]   because they would think they were iPhones.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:18.680]   And this is in today's questioning.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.480]   They did-- of course, they have a one hour arguments
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.960]   before the Supreme Court justices then go think about it.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.640]   And sometime later, probably in the spring rule,
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.760]   Justice Anthony Kennedy said several times,
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:34.240]   according to CNET's Shara Tiptkin, if I were the juror,
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.440]   I simply would not know what to do.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.760]   The justices used the analogy of a Volkswagen beetle
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.080]   in their questioning to understand
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.440]   the positions of Apple, Samsung, and the Justice Department.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:46.000]   Just some justices pointed out the Beatles design
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.600]   was what makes that car different from all others.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.360]   But Samuel Alito remarked that some of the people
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.240]   don't care what a car looks like.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.920]   Instead, they're looking for good gas mileage
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.440]   or other features.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:02.280]   Sounds like the justices are as confused as those jurors.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.680]   She writes, actually, this is--
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:10.600]   "Apple argues that Samsung win would weaken the protections
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.800]   afforded to new creations.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.280]   Notably, the devices in question
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.800]   haven't been on the market in years."
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   Quote, "The justices--" this is from Apple's pleading.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.960]   "The justices certainly seem to be thinking about establishing
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.400]   a new legal standard for Section 289
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.280]   if the patent act should be applied."
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:28.800]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.000]   This is Steve Chang, an intellectual property law attorney
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.800]   who was at the hearing.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.120]   I'm sorry, I apologize.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.960]   The justices seem to be thinking about establishing
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.360]   a new legal standard for 289 and asked a lot of questions
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.560]   dealing with details like jury instructions
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.680]   and the kind of evidence that would be needed.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.640]   So they're focusing more on how a jury is supposed to judge
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.640]   a design patent.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.120]   Good question.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:57.520]   Well, it's a question we even asked during the original trial.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.480]   How do you take-- I guess it was a 10-person jury,
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:06.800]   but how do you take 10 people off the street and say, OK,
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.480]   help us with this patent law thing.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.600]   And the separate issue is you can copy something
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.960]   that can still not be illegal.
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.000]   It's not just a case of whether it looks alike or not.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.560]   It's whether that looking alike is illegal.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.640]   It could be functional.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.840]   But if it's designed for confusion,
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:21.800]   that's a different thing.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.600]   Intent is a big part of the law.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:30.080]   Well, in her arguments, Kathleen Sullivan for Samsung
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.520]   said, "It makes no sense to give a patent holder
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:35.080]   the entire profits from a device for infringing
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.360]   narrow design patents."
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.240]   Can't disagree with her.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.400]   She had 25 minutes, but she was interrupted two minutes
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:47.160]   into her remarks by Justice Kennedy with the jury question.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.360]   So it sounds like the justices are kind of changing
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.400]   the focus of this.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.360]   I'm not an expert on this.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.560]   We'll have to watch this week in law on Friday
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.600]   and see what they say about it.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.840]   The weird thing, though, is that there was--
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.480]   I think it was--
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.040]   if we had a statement from Samsung
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.520]   about the court deliberations today,
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.160]   but they wrote it yesterday.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.800]   That was all over Twitter.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.640]   And they weren't sure how that was going to actually--
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.200]   how the judges would actually feel about that.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.480]   Yeah, probably not great.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.680]   Samsung proposed jurors consider two factors
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:22.320]   with determining what a relevant article of manufacture is.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.880]   What does the design patent claim and what
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.280]   is the product which has been applied?
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.800]   I'm scanning through this.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.200]   I don't know if this is--
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.120]   these are such legal fine points at this point.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:35.560]   It sounds like the Supreme Court-- and this
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.400]   is not unusual-- wants to narrow the case down
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:45.640]   from something big about patents to something a little bit more.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.080]   Because there's so many--
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:47.800]   unless sweeping.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.120]   There are just so many fine points here.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.800]   I don't think that-- if you look at the original Samsung
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.600]   Galaxy phones, I don't think there could be any doubt
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.680]   that they were--
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.120]   I don't know if I won't speak as they were intentionally
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.320]   trying to confuse because I can't see into the human--
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.880]   so that's also the human mind.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.800]   But it was clearly-- if there was a design element
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.160]   from the iPhone that could replicate,
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.840]   they did replicate it.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.880]   On the other hand, when you look at some of the details
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.080]   in the suit, you're talking about rounded corners
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.000]   and a home button at the bottom.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.440]   And you want to counter that by saying,
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.840]   are you saying that an object that is designed to be slid
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.280]   in and out of a pocket should have razor sharp corners?
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.440]   Or is there a rounded corner simply natural?
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.120]   And then you also have to bring up--
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:32.440]   let me give you the panoply of 10 different devices
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.520]   from 10 years before the iPhone that also
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.120]   had a clicky button at the front and center
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.400]   below the screen.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.120]   And it would be like Miracle on 34th Street.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.200]   So I have other examples, Your Honor.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.520]   OK, just put them on the desk.
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.240]   And then you have porters coming in with bushels
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:52.720]   and bushels of phones and digital scales and trios and PDAs.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.680]   So you want to have an ability so that people who
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:01.160]   are trying to steal the look and feel of a device that's not
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.920]   a simple design thing.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.920]   And you want also someone to say, no, you're not allowed
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.160]   to have a device with one button at the front.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.360]   Like, OK, whatever.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.040]   If you think that's brilliant, if you think that's
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.320]   protectable, good luck surviving a fight against a bear
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.440]   because I don't think he'll take that argument either.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.560]   This is-- I'll tell you how unusual this is.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.480]   The first time the Supreme Court has heard a design case
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.720]   since the 1800s.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.280]   So they don't like to weigh in on this.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.600]   And apparently, they're not really weighing in on the patents.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.680]   They consider that decided.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.720]   They're weighing in on the award.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:37.920]   And so it's that $400 million that Samsung had to pay.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:42.240]   Samsung's trying to reduce that and says,
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.080]   such a big award, stifles innovation.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.840]   And that is a good point, too.
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.720]   The size of that award implies that the only reason why people
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.000]   were buying Samsung phones were because they
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.800]   thought that the rounded corners and the slides to unlock
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.800]   made them think it was an iPhone as opposed to people
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.520]   thinking that, well, I would like to have an iPhone.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.520]   Unfortunately, I don't want to switch from AT&T
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.240]   or it's not available in my country or it's not
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.480]   available in my carrier.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.360]   However, here's a phone that has a lot of what I like
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.840]   about the iPhone, so I'm going to buy it instead.
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.480]   What I've been trying to figure out since I started reading
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.560]   about this was that how much of that
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.880]   is allowed for, let's say, a punitive sort of thing.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.520]   Like if you violate someone's copyright, you don't get any win.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.200]   You don't get back 100%.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:30.560]   You get back 300% of what you lost as a discouragement
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.440]   for people to do that again.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:36.840]   So this is very much a read and listen issue for me
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:41.120]   as opposed to a, well, in 1953, with the introduction
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.280]   of the PopTart, there was a challenge against the host
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.960]   as company, I don't know.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.520]   - This is only one of the two patent losses.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.800]   The other one was also in court last week.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:55.680]   The US Court of Appeals reinstated the $120 million award
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:00.520]   to Apple over slide, the three patents were slide to unlock
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.640]   auto correct. - It's in order for Apple
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.840]   to stop using it.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.200]   - And yeah, right.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.880]   We no longer have it, do we?
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.120]   - Auto correct, we still have.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.880]   And oddly enough, Apple apparently had patented the method
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.200]   to detect a phone number in a text or an email
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.640]   so that it could be clicked to make the phone call.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.760]   - Data detectors patent?
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.800]   - Data detectors, yeah.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.920]   The bulk of the award, $98.7 million,
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.880]   was for the data detection patent.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.000]   In any event, the Federal Circuit has reinstated the award
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.320]   after a panel of judges ruled it was wrong
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.720]   to throw out the verdict in February.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:44.440]   So I wonder if this one, I'll go to the Supreme Court as well.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:48.000]   Sometimes you feel sorry for the Supreme Court.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.080]   - And was it cheaper to, is it cheaper just to pay the verdict
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.560]   that it would have been to actually build it yourself
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.760]   and in which case, just do it.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.120]   - Right, 120 million sounds like nothing
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.240]   when you get married to 400 million, right?
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.000]   The original damages for this,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:07.160]   because carol, yeah, this is then the look and feel one
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.720]   is the other one, all right.
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:13.360]   So, but the total could be over half a billion dollars.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.160]   Money Samsung needs right now.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.800]   - Yes, I think many cranes will immediately
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.000]   litigate this issue.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:19.840]   (laughing)
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:20.840]   - Wow.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.280]   - That's basically how much money they make off
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.320]   of their least best selling fridge, so they're okay.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.600]   Now the fridges aren't doing too well either this week.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.840]   - The porn fridge is doing great.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:35.560]   - Yeah, the exploding washing machine is not doing well,
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.400]   but the porn fridge is--
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.920]   - Samsung's not done copying, by the way.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.000]   Did you see this cylindrical PC they announced?
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:40.840]   - The Mac Pro.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.160]   - Oh, come on.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.400]   (laughing)
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.920]   - I mean, it could have been anything.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.960]   It's just, that's the thing with Samsung is this,
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.320]   it's always like a 90% sure they copied it,
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.080]   but it's just weird enough that you're like,
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:55.240]   oh, it's not that close.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.560]   - Here's one thing I would,
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.280]   this is one Mac I would not copy.
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.240]   - I know, but it could be like, it's just like,
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.080]   convenience.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:08.080]   - Apple came out with a floor standing tower PC
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.680]   long after Windows machines were currently.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.960]   Apple came out with the Mac Mini long after
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.000]   there were like hot plate sized Macs.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.320]   Again, there's a point of which you can say
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.000]   there's definitely copying happening,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:21.920]   and there's a point that say,
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.800]   we came up with round, we invented round.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.800]   - No, but this is like a body for your round.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.640]   - It's got a hard one.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.760]   - It's got a Herman Carden speaker on the top.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.360]   - It's hot tub on the roof.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.320]   - Yeah, but it's using the Vortecs fan.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.240]   - And it's got the same design in the front.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.560]   - The front panel looks similar.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.400]   - You can do that, you can do anything with that.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.560]   It could have been a square, it could have been,
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.640]   it could have been anything.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.240]   Like, this is why, like I'd be so,
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.880]   and again, I'm not opposed to copying.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.440]   Apple copies a lot of stuff too.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.360]   I just, as someone who grew up as a designer,
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.400]   it just, it depresses me,
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.840]   'cause I know there's these people who would do
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.240]   this fantastic job of making an amazing thing,
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.800]   but it's like, make it look like that,
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.120]   and then you just want to sit there and hit your head.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.200]   - Well, and frankly, a cylinder is not
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.280]   a very efficient design for a PC.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.320]   - Make it look like a cheese grater, I'd buy one.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:06.520]   - I know, I want more cheese grater than ever.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.560]   Here, well, let's take a break, but when we come back,
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.160]   I want to talk about what Apple might announce
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:14.560]   in one more thing, one more event in October,
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.840]   and when that might be what you know about that,
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.520]   'cause I'm waiting, I want a new laptop.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.560]   I do, I want a new laptop.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.480]   - Wait, there's more.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.200]   - But wait, there's more.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.440]   First, though, a word from Texture.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.960]   Now, I can give you a very hearty endorsement for Texture,
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.240]   'cause it was a lifesaver on the plane at the airport.
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.640]   There's always a few hours extra in the airport,
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.600]   I don't know why, but it just is.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.640]   And normally what I do is go to the airport,
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.680]   news, stand and stock up on magazines,
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.360]   I didn't have to, 'cause Lisa and I both
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.320]   brought Texture on our iPads, and man,
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.640]   I love it, textures like Netflix, but for magazines.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.280]   Over 200 of the world's best magazines.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.720]   Nothing, not the, you know, you might hear it and say,
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.720]   oh yeah, it's probably a boy's life and hot tub today.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.200]   No, no, it's all the big magazines.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.640]   In fact, I was reading the Atlantic articles
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:04.560]   about the election, Rolling Stone.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.960]   Then I would come on a calm down,
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.640]   so I'd look at photo essays and National Geographic,
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.280]   the New Yorkers there, sports illustrated,
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:15.440]   there's Vogue, Cosmo, yeah, I was reading
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.200]   a little Gossip in People, it's all there.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.480]   And the really fun thing about Texture is,
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.640]   before I left, if I wrap Texture,
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:23.960]   say these are the favorites,
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.840]   auto download these, they're on the iPad.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.880]   So both planes, both ways, I thought everybody
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.920]   was gonna have wifi in the future.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.800]   Neither plane had wifi, it didn't matter to me,
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.400]   'cause I had literally like 20 magazines I could read.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.480]   Unlimited access to 200, and there, by the way,
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.400]   it's the full magazines, and some magazine,
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.120]   it's interesting, 'cause I guess the magazine
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.080]   gets to control how it's done, and some of the magazines
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.400]   are just so cool, the Atlantic is really great
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:53.400]   to read online, really, they have additional features
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.280]   like video that you can't put in print.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.600]   Every page of every magazine is there.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.840]   The current newsstand edition's back issues too.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.480]   They auto download, which is really fun.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.400]   It's also easy to find stuff, if you're not sure,
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.240]   well, what should I read?
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:10.080]   They've got an editorial team that puts out top stories,
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.320]   the new and noteworthy section,
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.840]   and that's updated every day.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:18.040]   They also have curated categories, and I love this.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.040]   We only needed one texture subscription,
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.720]   because you could put it up to five devices per account,
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.320]   so I shared Lisa's account.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.680]   We both had our own magazines, our own favorites,
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.160]   on our own iPads.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.400]   Sign up for texture right now, you'll gain insider access
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.360]   to all the content from the world's most in demand,
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.720]   publications like National GEO, and even stuff that,
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.360]   I really like this, that I'm not gonna buy,
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.160]   I'm not gonna subscribe to Billboard, or ad age,
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.720]   I've mentioned this before, but because of my business,
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.320]   I like seeing the Hot 100 on Billboard, stuff like that.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.440]   See what's keep up with what's going on in the industry.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.440]   So it's kinda cool you get that too.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:57.320]   I love it, you will too, and we've got a free trial,
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.760]   so you don't have to pay anything to find out.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.000]   Texture, T-E-X-T-U-R-E, like text, plus your texture.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.040]   That helped, didn't it?
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:09.200]   No, no, T-E-X-T-U-R-E, forget what I just said.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.120]   Texture.com/twood, and you'll get instant access,
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.800]   for free right now.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.760]   It doesn't have to be for travel any time, the beach,
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.800]   wherever.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.440]   It's nice to have those magazines in such a compact form.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.640]   You're a phone too, and not just iOS, Android as well,
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:27.440]   but you can put them on your phone, and on up to five devices,
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:31.040]   and on your iPad, and on your Android device.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.880]   We thank Texture so much for their support.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:41.880]   So it's, Renee, we're definitely having an October of Apple event, right?
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.120]   No, it's saying definitely.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.480]   Until the invitations go out, because if it's kind of an event,
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.200]   we suspect where we'd be at Apple's Town Hall,
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.320]   and it'd be a smaller meeting, they can move that around
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.600]   or change their minds up until pretty late in the process.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.760]   Obviously, up until those invitations go out.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.400]   But I think if the new MacBook is what we, the MacBook Pro,
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.920]   is what we suspect it would be, it would hugely benefit
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.240]   from some explanation on stage, from Phil Schiller,
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.000]   going up there and saying why these new features exist,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.080]   what makes them compelling, and how MacBook Pro owners will benefit from them.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:13.560]   So if that's the case, then we're rapidly approaching Black Friday sales in the US,
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.240]   and it's got to happen before then.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:22.320]   So Microsoft has sent out invitations to an October 26th event.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:26.480]   And Gruber, in Daring Fireball, says,
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:29.040]   that's one day before Apple's event to announce the new MacBooks.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:35.080]   Wait a minute, what if Apple moved its earnings from the 27th to the 25th
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.360]   to make room for an event?
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.800]   So he's basing this on Apple.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.880]   What was the earnings announcement?
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.720]   When was it going to be?
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.920]   I believe it was the 27th that got moved to the 25th.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.960]   And it got moved to the 25th.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:50.320]   They've moved earnings calls before to make room for other things,
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.880]   like if they had to go to Washington to testify or to do one of several other things.
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.840]   On the other hand, they did say due to a scheduling conflict.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.040]   Yes.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.040]   I mean, it could be Tim Cook at a dentist appointment.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.440]   I mean, I'm not saying it.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.120]   No, and it could be, I mean, they could traditionally,
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.480]   they don't hold their events on Thursdays.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.240]   They typically hold them on a Tuesday, like the WWDCs on Monday.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.160]   But typically a Tuesday or Wednesday event.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.600]   So they could have had it on a Tuesday and then the earnings call.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.480]   Unless they wanted to get the earnings out of the way.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:15.200]   All this is so criminology.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.840]   I know, but that's all we got, baby.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.640]   We got to.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.520]   Unless they wanted to get the earnings call out of the way before having an event
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.160]   and having an event the first week in November was too late for them.
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:26.520]   Why, it's so late.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.400]   Geez, I want it to be soon.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.520]   But I guess it's only six-- it's worse.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.240]   It's only 16 days away.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.080]   And what will they announce?
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.040]   New iPads?
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:40.800]   No, I think the iPads are on the spring refresh cycle.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:44.320]   Obviously, both iPads, the 12.9 inch and the 9.7 inch,
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.560]   could do with the Apple A10 upgrade.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:50.440]   The 9.7 inch doesn't have the fast USB 3 bus of the larger one.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:54.000]   The larger one doesn't have the P3 display of the smaller one
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.320]   and the two tone color match.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.720]   So there's all sorts of things that they could do to improve those.
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:02.760]   And rumor has it, there'll be a 9.7 inch and maybe a 10.1 inch as well or instead of.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.320]   A non-pro?
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.440]   So there's a lot of community with iPad.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:05.600]   Non-pro or pro?
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:06.800]   No, I think pro is the--
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.800]   Everything's pro now.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.120]   --is the pencil that would be difficult to have.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.880]   I would not like an iPad mini with a pencil.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.600]   I would love an iPad mini with a pencil.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:18.840]   I love the 9.7 Mac Pro, iPad Pro.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.320]   Love it.
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.480]   That's what I took with me on my trip.
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.520]   It's small enough that it's easy to pack.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.480]   And it really does convert.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.360]   Like you have the keyboard out.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.480]   It feels like a tiny, minute, both of you keyboard off.
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.480]   It feels like an iPad.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:30.640]   It does a really good job of that.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.040]   During my trip to New York, I, of course,
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.440]   had my 12.9 inch iPad Pro.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.840]   But I also had my iPad mini, which just like Renee says,
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.720]   I treat like a netbook because I don't necessarily--
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.920]   when I'm walking around all day long in the city,
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.520]   I don't necessarily want to have a 13 inch screen,
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.000]   but I don't necessarily need one.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.040]   I just have the ability to do about 800 to 1,200 words
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.040]   with a writing or dump some photos from my camera.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.800]   And so it's interesting to think about the difference
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.240]   between buying a $1,500 MacBook Air
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.520]   and to solve the same sort of problems
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:05.080]   buying a 13 inch iPad per 1,000 bucks and a $500 iPad mini,
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:08.000]   you might actually get more use out of having two iPads
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.240]   than one Mac.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:15.000]   My-- oddly enough, my iMac died while I was gone.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.200]   It was just a 2012, not a 5K.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.520]   It was the last non 5K.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:25.080]   And then it turned out there was a recall of the--
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.360]   on the Fusion drives, a three terabyte drive.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.800]   And I think-- and mine is that serial number.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.040]   So we're bringing it back to Apple.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.680]   I guess I'm going to get a new hard drive.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.120]   That's weird.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.400]   But anyway, it just kind of stopped working.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:40.680]   And it's a Fusion drive.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.280]   And it looks like the SSD is fine.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.880]   But the spinning disk, that's how a Fusion drive works, is not.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.160]   I mean, there have been recalls for Macs over the years,
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.960]   for everything, for graphics, cars, for batteries,
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.000]   for hard drive batteries.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.440]   It's a failure rate is too high.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.280]   Initially I thought, oh, let's buy a new iMac.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.880]   But then everybody said, what are you crazy?
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.280]   There's going to be it.
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.920]   So is-- I felt like the iMacs had been updated.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.520]   Are we due for a new iMac too?
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:03.320]   They updated.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.480]   They went to 5K two years ago in October.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:08.200]   They went to the P3 display last year in October.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.920]   So if they follow that path and they'll be in UIMAC,
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:14.600]   probably on Intel Skylake, it's unclear what the 21.5
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.720]   inch will be because Intel didn't
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.080]   make the preview of the Broadwell chip for that.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:19.960]   So Apple had to stay with the Haswell chip.
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.800]   And they haven't made Skyl chips for it either.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.720]   So I don't know what the future of that device is.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.480]   Apple's going to have to do something different with it.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.080]   But the 27 inch iMac would probably
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.520]   get a spec bump at this point.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:32.600]   So it's probably due.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.160]   It don't buy a Mac until you don't get your Apple's
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:35.960]   having an event or not.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.960]   I think the only thing you could buy at this point
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:41.160]   is an iPhone or an Apple Watch.
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:45.120]   Everything else you should wait and see.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.400]   And then of course, the one that we really need badly,
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:52.400]   the one that really is the most dated is the MacBook, right?
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.000]   MacBook Pro.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   MacBook Pro.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.760]   Yeah, MacBook's been updated.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.800]   Yeah, and MacBook Air has gotten, I don't know,
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.400]   a passive aggressive update.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:01.400]   It's, I guess, maybe a good way of framing it.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.000]   What's a passive aggressive update?
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   It's not updated in a way that tells you
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.440]   that there's a future for the product.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.800]   It's not getting a retinative display.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.400]   It's not getting a lot of things.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.600]   But it's going to be a bad--
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.400]   But don't expect another one.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.960]   We're holding you at this price point
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.360]   because we can't get the MacBook down to $900 yet.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:21.800]   But I wouldn't get too comfy in that chair.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.680]   Passive aggressive update, I like it.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.280]   I like it.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:30.080]   So best guess would be that the Air is kind of not
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.080]   long for this world, that the MacBook is
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.920]   going to be the new thin and light.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:35.440]   The Air replaced the original MacBook,
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.720]   now the MacBook is replacing the Air.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.560]   It's the circle of life.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.400]   Yes, the circle of life.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:43.760]   We do desperately need new MacBooks.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.160]   Type C connector or MagSafe?
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.680]   What are the Vegas odds at this point?
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.040]   For-- yes, yeah.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.560]   My head tells me that they're going to go to USB-C
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:53.800]   because that's where the future is.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:57.360]   But I still like the fact that that MagSafe cord pops off
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.600]   because I do that all the time.
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:00.600]   I pull it, I push it, I trip over it.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.640]   And it doesn't fly halfway across my room the way
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:05.200]   that an iOS device or a MacBook would.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.320]   So I hope they can do both.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.160]   How about we get a Type C MagSafe?
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.200]   Just a little connect with you.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:14.120]   Or just keep the MagSafe and just put Type C on there
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.040]   for the Thunderbolt.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:19.920]   USB-C just adds so many features above everything else.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.840]   Because-- and not only just for adding data,
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.600]   but also this is now a MacBook that can be powered
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.080]   by a USB power brick.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.520]   So you have so many options for how
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.280]   to get electrons into the thing.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:38.440]   And the other thing is that the design of a MacBook nothing
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:41.760]   is different from the design of the MacBooks that were--
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.000]   that premiered with the MagSafe connectors.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.960]   If you were to pull a MacBook off of your lap
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:49.640]   and were to fall to the ground, there's
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:52.200]   nothing that mechanical in there that can break.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:54.000]   It's built with a lot of the same techniques
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.480]   they use to build iPads.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.640]   And I've dropped my iPad.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.880]   I don't know how many times just off of it
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.440]   from a standing height onto the floor.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.840]   And I don't even worry about it.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:04.840]   I'm sorry I did it, but I'm not saying, OK,
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.880]   I'm not expecting to see a broken screen.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:09.160]   So it's possible that the reasons why the MagSafe was
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:11.920]   a good idea are not as applicable today as they were before.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.480]   So I'm hoping they go for USB-C.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:17.520]   Hopefully they can invent this thing called a second USB-C.
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:18.280]   I don't know if they can--
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.200]   I'll go give you so many.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.520]   I'll think you'll have people be complaining about how many USB--
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.720]   why did the Apple give me so many?
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:23.840]   I don't know what to do with them.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.920]   I have too many USB-C ports.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.080]   Well, think that there's a fan in there.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.200]   That's the ventilation ports.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:31.800]   Oh, no, there's just 19 studded on both sides of them.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:34.360]   USB-C ports for everybody.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:38.480]   I also wonder if-- well, we're not
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.160]   going to see a Mac Pro up a wrong way.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:41.760]   It needs it.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.800]   I mean, again, you can argue about whether or not--
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.640]   so a lot of the Macs are totally bound by Intel at this point.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.360]   In some cases, AMD.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:52.640]   And you can argue that there were reasons not to go--
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:54.160]   I forget which version they're on--
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.280]   Haswell version or whatever.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.640]   Because they're on Xeon processors, the Mac Pros.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.280]   And you could argue that maybe the Broadwell wasn't good.
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.560]   And they were waiting for Skylake.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.840]   But they said it was a massive OpenCL machine.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.640]   And they used these two big graphics cards.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.160]   And as far as I know, those graphics cards were never updated.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.520]   And I'm not Apple.
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.040]   I can't speak for Apple's engineering team.
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:15.600]   But it seems to me as a customer,
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:17.120]   if you're going to sell me an appliance,
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.720]   it's up to you to--
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.240]   you're saying this is an appliance.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.200]   You're taking responsibility for updating it.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.040]   And you're going to put two fabulous graphics
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.400]   cards on there every year, if not every six months for me.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.840]   And they haven't done that in like three years.
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:29.720]   So this means hard for me.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.400]   This laptop's from 2012.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:35.680]   I want to get a new MacBook Pro.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.600]   They'll be 13 and 15, same form factor, roughly,
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:42.120]   except for the Type-C connectors.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:45.440]   They'll probably have the iterative design improvements
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.600]   that might come to know when it's--
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:47.560]   So you know what?
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:51.280]   There's nothing wrong with this aluminum unibody
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:51.760]   constraint.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.200]   I like it.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:56.120]   We've got to the point where even with the Mac Pro,
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:58.480]   I have a three-year-old Mac Pro that I use every day.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:59.040]   And it's fine.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.800]   A lot of people have a two-year-old or last year's Mac Pro.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.520]   And the difference when you go to Broadwell
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:06.040]   or you go to Skylake is not that big.
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.000]   Some people will tell you optimistically
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   that they will get double-digit percentage increases.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.800]   But realistically, you won't.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.360]   Mostly, it's a power efficiency thing.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.800]   So it's better for battery.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.560]   But even professionals are not going to get a huge boost from it.
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.640]   So it's really an emotional thing that we've gotten used
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:21.120]   to having these updates every year.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:22.880]   And because those chips exist, we should have them.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:24.520]   We're paying absolute top dollar.
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.200]   Apple's not discounting computers
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.040]   just because they're a year or three years old.
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.120]   They're charging the same prices.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.920]   We should absolutely have the latest components.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:32.120]   But I don't think it's safe to assume
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.120]   that they're going to be miraculous increases.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:34.840]   No.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.840]   And as I use these computers, they
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:39.120]   don't feel that dated, that old, really.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.760]   It's just that I've had them for a while.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.360]   And what I don't want to do-- and I
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:46.200]   think this is probably universal-- is buy a brand new computer
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:49.120]   that is a three-year-old platform or a two-year-old platform.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.000]   And then anyone has just come out right after.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.040]   So yeah, there's this--
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.080]   hesitancy, I think.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:59.440]   I mean, when you get a new Intel CPU on a mobile device,
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:02.120]   you can almost expect to have akin to new features.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:05.320]   You can almost expect to get an hour of battery life for free,
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.200]   if not more than that.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.400]   On a desktop, you do want a better GPU
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:13.800]   because so much of what the Mac does, whatever Apple operating
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.760]   system does, is powered by GPU.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.440]   If you drag a window in the Finder,
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:20.640]   if you drag an icon from one window to another in the Finder,
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:24.960]   you are basically maxing out any CPU of any game system that
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.080]   was made six years ago with all the transitions it's doing.
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:29.200]   So there's things you'll notice.
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:33.680]   But what I used to say 12 years ago or 15 years ago
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.360]   about performance is still true.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.400]   Your computer spends 90% of the time
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:41.080]   blinking the cursor while you do nothing.
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:42.600]   Saying, what are you doing?
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:43.200]   Type something.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:43.640]   Do something.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:44.960]   I can do this all day.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.440]   What are you doing?
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.960]   I can see you're holding it like it does.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:49.160]   Actually, if Mac were more of a gaming platform,
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.920]   there'd be, I think, a lot more pressure to update it.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:52.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:54.600]   I mean, even if you look at VR,
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:56.440]   I don't think Georgia had any PCs
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.960]   until she got the Vive and the Oculus.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:00.360]   And now she has to because you literally can't--
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:01.160]   and yes, that's niche.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:02.160]   That's not mainstream.
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:03.320]   But it's quasi-embarrassing.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:06.080]   I can't run VR off of the Mac that I want to have in my house.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:08.960]   Apple doesn't really seem to care much about VR.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:12.880]   Oh, and the official thing is that Apple doesn't get gaming.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:13.720]   They don't get this.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.320]   They have a lot of hardcore gamers
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.520]   at the very highest level of Apple.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.720]   It's just they realize that the money's in the casual gaming
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.920]   and that the amount of effort and cost it would take
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.800]   to continually support high-end gaming is not
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:24.200]   where they're going to make the most money.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:26.240]   And gamers want to customize.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:29.440]   They want to put their own GPUs in.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.840]   They want to update the GPUs.
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:32.160]   They just want to do things at Apple.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:33.800]   Doesn't nitro fins on the back.
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.840]   It doesn't really fit Apple's aesthetic.
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:41.040]   Well, also, there's a lot more to VR than just gaming.
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.280]   But I think that's right now.
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.880]   It's at kind of a smart watch level right now
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:48.120]   where the consumers have not yet said, here is what we're
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:51.960]   willing to pay for to get as far as VR is concerned.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:55.080]   And the second problem is that to get the sort of GWIS
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:58.920]   wow VR platforming, it's not the sort of thing
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:02.560]   where you just build a new computer and release some APIs.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:05.320]   Now we're talking about building custom hardware
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.880]   that is optimized just for VR or just has even just the ability
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.600]   of how do we put light into the user's eyeballs
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.040]   has to be new and different.
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.320]   And then even the computer that drives it
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.480]   has to be kind of at top of the line.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.920]   And I don't think Apple wants to commit
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.920]   to making a bespoke Mac that's optimized towards driving
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.840]   a VR platform before they know what the hell a VR platform really
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:26.680]   is for.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.280]   Will Kay in the chat room is asking,
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.760]   what about updating the airports?
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.200]   Those are way overdue.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:36.720]   And Google just announced kind of mesh style,
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:42.200]   Euro style, multi module Wi-Fi solution.
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.200]   Will Apple do that maybe this month?
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.760]   I don't think they would do that until they find a way
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.120]   to integrate it into a larger system.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.480]   Like if they were to-- I don't think they would--
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.920]   I don't think they have any interest whatsoever.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.920]   They don't want to do a me too product.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.800]   Well, no, not that.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.200]   I don't think there's an up getting
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.760]   updating the airport extreme just
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.320]   to give it better radios just to give it different ports
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.920]   and add a USB-C port to it.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.640]   I think that they'd be interested in doing it to add mesh
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:14.680]   and also so that now the home app has a much better understanding
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.520]   of who's where in the house and what's going on
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.080]   at different places of the house so that they can create--
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:27.280]   it's not that they develop products to just create a demo.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.600]   But I think that in part of their mind
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.760]   is like if we have five minutes or 10 minutes during a keynote
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.640]   to really wow people as to why this is such a great thing,
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.960]   what would we show off?
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.960]   And that's the sort of thing that they want to do.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.680]   So I think that they would do it.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.200]   They're going to do it once they can have a whole house mesh
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.680]   network that knows that you have got four people in the family,
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.920]   that two of them are upstairs.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.840]   One is in the kitchen, one is in the living room
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.960]   so that when you do a H.LOMO command,
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:55.040]   they know exactly who's executing that command.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.480]   And when they ask for an airplace dream,
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:01.000]   they know exactly where to execute it.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.720]   So that's I think what we're going to see in updated networking.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.880]   Yeah, also Apple's traditionally done like major products
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:06.920]   and then supporting products.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.240]   And the airport extremes are always there to help.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.400]   We have to go back a few years when
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.720]   Apple was-- did those demonstrations.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.280]   Like I think Phil Schiller jumped off the stage
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:16.840]   to show that it really was wireless.
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:20.320]   And wireless routers just weren't that common back then.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.080]   And when the latest airport extreme came out,
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.320]   Apple was moving to 802.11ac.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.040]   And now we have tons of routers that do that.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.440]   But I think there was a feeling that in order
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.360]   to move these technologies forward,
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.360]   they had to be part of the end-to-end solution for those.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:35.720]   Do we put routers in the same category as cinema displays,
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.920]   a category that Apple is dialing out of?
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.600]   Well, dialing out of is hard to--
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.720]   because I forget who said them.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.680]   Some does it really well as Apple totally ignore something
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.840]   until they don't.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.920]   And it's very feasible that when we get the new MacBooks,
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.880]   we'll get a 5K P3 panel to go with them
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.880]   because that's when that product makes sense
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.240]   or when a new iMac Pro comes out.
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.280]   And it might just be that Apple has an 802.11ac router.
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:00.200]   There's no real new standard coming out
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.760]   that they have to advance it for.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.880]   But something that downloads all your updates,
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.600]   the way that the automatic feature on macOS does, or on iOS
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.080]   does, has them ready for you and starts cashing things
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.080]   and doing a bunch of smart stuff on the back end.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.840]   And one day, maybe it works as your home kit hub
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.040]   and does all these other things.
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.040]   That might be a product that Apple feels they need to make
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.720]   in order to move that industry forward.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.640]   And then it's much more likely we'll get an update.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:23.160]   Maybe they're waiting until next year when APFS comes out,
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.080]   the new Apple file system.
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:29.200]   And tie it-- I mean, time machine is so nasty.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:32.160]   It'd be nice to tie some sort of snapshot
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:38.320]   and capability into a new router, maybe the router,
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.240]   acknowledging that most home networks now
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:43.880]   have multiple Macs on it, multiple Apple devices.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:46.840]   Not that, but multiple iCloud accounts attached to it.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.400]   They could do a lot of cool stuff.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.640]   I think another thing that's sort of universal
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.080]   about the way that Apple purchased products is that,
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.000]   as big as they are and as unique as they are,
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.280]   I think they also acknowledge that there are a lot of really
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.080]   great Wi-Fi access points out there.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.760]   They don't have to come out with one
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.600]   just because HASOS is doing some great stuff.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.000]   Well, that's why I was thinking it was kind of like
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   the cinematist play where they're just kind of basically
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.840]   saying, yeah, you don't need to buy it from us.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.360]   There's a time where to show off how great the Mac Pro is
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.080]   at video editing.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.880]   My god, look, we got multiple 4K editing.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.560]   We can do a Pro-level color correction.
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.640]   There's no screen that really lets you show off how good it is.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.440]   So there-- and because they thought that, OK, we can actually
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.400]   make money off of this, now we'll make a screen.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:35.000]   But now that you can-- Dell can sell you a fantastic screen
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.680]   as good as the cinematist play practically for half
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.880]   or less than half the price.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.600]   I don't think that they're mad about that.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.880]   I think if they think, oh, thank god, it was--
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.720]   we have one less product to think about now.
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:50.320]   We can put more design into the new button on the new watch.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.320]   Yeah, I'm not against that.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.840]   I don't-- I think that that's--
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:56.720]   on the other hand, as you point out, Renee, a 5K second monitor
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.640]   for a Mac book Pro might be an interesting product.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:04.320]   But might be is kind of the operative price.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.800]   There is a new technology in Wi-Fi, though,
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:09.920]   even though it's not labeled with a letter, it's mesh.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.320]   And that's really where the action's happening right now.
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.400]   Well, that's question, too, because a lot of people
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.080]   have mesh networks with Sonos and don't even
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.600]   think that it's a mesh network because it's not
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.280]   used for their everyday Wi-Fi.
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.600]   But it's a very early and a very robust one.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.560]   And if you start making-- well, we have this mesh network.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.840]   And the advantage to that, if you're not familiar with it,
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.200]   is instead of having to do this IT-level work bridging
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.480]   your networks, you can just put these little boxes around
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:33.920]   and they'll take care of giving you great coverage everywhere.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.840]   But then the question is, do we just make a box?
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.000]   Do we put a speaker on it?
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.760]   How good a speaker does it have to be?
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.200]   Well, what price does that make the speaker?
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.320]   Well, what other-- well, OK, we can't make the speaker for that.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.800]   And what are the utility-- all of these
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.080]   are very big product questions.
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.240]   And Apple is a company.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.920]   There are some companies, and I love them.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.200]   I just put things out and then let the market help
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:50.720]   them decide.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.560]   And maybe Apple watches an example of that.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.800]   But Apple tends to think these things through sometimes
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.320]   for a frustratingly long time and then release something
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.160]   that they think is a holistic offering.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.680]   Boy, wouldn't somebody in the chat
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:05.440]   room saying, wouldn't it be great if Apple bought Sonos?
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:05.880]   There's a--
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.000]   There's the play finally.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.040]   Those two products-- Apple-- those two companies
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.040]   seem to mesh in a way that you need.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:12.520]   It's supposed to be.
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.240]   And Sonos needs Siri.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.600]   You know, Sonos needs that--
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.100]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:19.800]   Yeah, but here's just play in the Apple store starting last week.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:20.760]   Oh, interesting.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:26.200]   And after all, Google's got the Google Home, Amazon Echo.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.120]   You feel like Apple should have a play--
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.360]   given that it has Siri, should have a player--
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.200]   a play in that.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.880]   I think some of the most brilliant devices
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:38.240]   that any large and ambitious company can come up with
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.680]   is our devices that encourage the person
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.640]   to want to buy more of them and put more of them inside
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.120]   and around the house.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.600]   Because those are the more places where someone can have
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.240]   your company's valuable services available,
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.960]   the more they're going to use those services.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:58.920]   And that's why I think that particularly the new Google
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.400]   mesh network is so cool is because you can spend $129
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:05.880]   for one essentially Wi-Fi base station, which is about the--
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.280]   OK, it's about the going rate for a decent one, maybe twice
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.920]   as much as a practical one.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.520]   But what I love about mesh networks
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.520]   is that you just-- every time you feel as though, OK, look,
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:18.560]   I've had it with only getting two bars of signal coverage
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.360]   in the playroom.
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:24.320]   I'll just buy $129, which is, again, as far as these things go,
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.440]   it's not that expensive.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.720]   Put it in the room, plug it in.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:27.600]   No configuration.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.720]   It's just better.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.040]   And then after two or three years,
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.920]   they become like LED light bulbs.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.640]   You never had a plan to change every single bulb in the house
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.640]   with an LED light bulb.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:39.920]   But gradually, by simply buying one of these little $20 bulbs
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.560]   every time it occurred to you, that would be a good thing
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:44.200]   to have, now you have a system that's so much better,
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.240]   and it didn't really hurt you in the pocketbook to get it done.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.440]   So once you have a system-- something like that--
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.040]   and Sonos is a brilliant opportunity for after the do
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:54.680]   that, where every time someone says, of course,
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:58.560]   you put a Sonos in the good one in the living room,
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.080]   because that's where you listen to music.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.800]   And then you put one--
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.880]   a little Sonos in the kitchen, because listen to music there.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.520]   And then you decide you want a good one in the bedroom.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.800]   And then maybe in two years you decide,
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.080]   it would be really nice to be able to just transfer.
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.760]   When I listen to a podcast or show,
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.400]   I can just go into the bathroom and shower and shave
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.840]   and listen to it there.
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.720]   But then once you have this--
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.720]   Google-- excuse me-- once you have a HomeKit applicable
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.000]   base station that people don't know,
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.880]   they've been putting these HomeKit things throughout their house.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.880]   Now when Siri can find them in the house
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:33.600]   and know that the owner of Apple ID, X, X, X, X, X,
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:36.520]   is now in the garage, I can send--
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.840]   I know that there is an alert that this person needs to hear.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.720]   I will make sure that only this speaker in the garage
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.000]   plays this alert.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.240]   That's when you start to get people who are saying,
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:47.440]   I'm glad I spent money on these devices.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.400]   I'm going to spend more money on these devices.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:51.800]   And more importantly, that is--
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:55.960]   I have now voluntarily put on another set of handcuffs
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.480]   tethering me to this platform, because this platform makes
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:00.360]   me really, really happy.
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:02.200]   This is where Google wants to be, right?
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:07.560]   It's where Amazon could be if they had a broader ecosystem.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.400]   A friend of mine went all in on HomeKit,
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.760]   and I got a chance to check out his place.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.200]   And he had the HomeKit fan.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.680]   And he said, movie time in the light,
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.400]   the blinds went down, and the lights changed, colors,
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.560]   and the TV came on.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.480]   And it really doesn't make you think you're living in Tony
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.000]   Stark's house.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.400]   I'm so disappointed that he's--
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.920]   I think the activation word for that should be,
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:30.120]   we've got movie sign.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:30.800]   By the way--
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.200]   I'm my best friend.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.280]   The other reason this is a good thing for Apple
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:37.120]   is I think that people are concerned about privacy
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.600]   and the internet of things, concerns people about security.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.000]   And these are two categories where Apple really
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.440]   seems to have the upper hand and can assert, no,
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.680]   we're the privacy and security company.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.960]   And so would you rather have an Apple Siri device in your house
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.600]   than an Amazon Echo or a Google Home?
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.000]   There were a series of articles.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.240]   I forget the publication now.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:58.960]   They just slammed Apple month after month for making developers
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:01.720]   have to waste all this time putting secure Wi-Fi chips
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.120]   and end-end encryption in their internet of things, devices,
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.800]   and how dare they do that.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.520]   And now I'm looking back and I don't have anything that's
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.160]   not end-end secure in my house.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.720]   That is a big problem.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.520]   As a matter of fact, I play a lot with Raspberry Pi devices.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:20.240]   And after being reminded last week by a news story,
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.880]   I had to go through all 5, 6, 7 of them
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:25.840]   and make sure it ships with an default password,
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.960]   default user pi, default password, Raspberry.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:32.080]   And on the ones that I actually use for stuff,
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.200]   I changed the passwords.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.000]   But sometimes I'm just playing with something.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.520]   It reminded me that this thing that I don't think of as
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.640]   an internet-able device that has a computer
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.760]   and could be super-retaining support a botnet
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:44.720]   should probably have a change, too, to its defaults.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.320]   Well, you saw that the UK--
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.720]   Kingdom, they banned cabinet officials
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:51.440]   from wearing their Apple watches.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.160]   In meetings, they'd ban cell phones some time before,
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.200]   as potential espionage devices.
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.960]   But this has a microphone.
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.200]   This has--
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.400]   It's a compliment.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.720]   They're treating it like a real computer.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.440]   And how come I watch?
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.760]   It's only getting 20 minutes worth of battery life.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.520]   Are you in politics or civil?
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.040]   OK.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.440]   Why is my watch speaking Russian?
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.280]   Oh, sorry.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.280]   OK.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:18.640]   Please, to my-- please, to my block microphone, please.
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:23.520]   Yeah, I think that it's clear that this is a category,
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.480]   but the two categories, security and privacy,
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:29.000]   that Apple has a real opportunity to double down on.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.400]   And awareness, public awareness, is so high of this now.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:37.000]   But there is a butter zone there, though.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   The thing-- I've spent as much time in Android
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.240]   as I do in iOS.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:44.200]   And I appreciate the added security on an iOS device.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.960]   However, it's the Google services that are consistently
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.760]   giving me more viable results and more viable insights.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.800]   Because Google's willing to gather up all your information
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.480]   and adjust it.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.640]   And I agree with you.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.680]   I'm willing to do that.
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.480]   But I think that, increasingly, we're
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.960]   going to see consumers reluctant to do that.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.840]   Well, again, it depends.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.720]   The first time that I was showing-- when Google now first
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.360]   got-- was first released.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:13.080]   And the first time that people-- friends of mine
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.880]   were seeing how I swiped to the left.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.960]   And here is everything I've got going on today.
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.880]   Here's everything I've been reading on the web
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.440]   that's probably interesting to me.
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.800]   Here are only the sports scores that I'm following.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.960]   Here are only the TV shows on tonight
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:28.560]   that I would likely want to watch.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.960]   And here's the calendar stuff.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:33.240]   And it's collating all this stuff inside one place.
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:36.040]   And also making very accurate guesses as to what's
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:39.000]   going to be important to me and what would just be a nuisance.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.560]   That would, once-- I think most responsible users
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.040]   would ask the question, how secure is this,
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.040]   and where does this information go?
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.280]   And if they like the answer to what they get,
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:53.560]   which is that yes, Google is collecting lots of data.
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:58.680]   However, because A, they do think privacy is important.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:02.320]   And B, they're also jealous of this incredibly
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.520]   valuable dossier they have on you.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.240]   And they're not going to let anybody else have access to it.
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.160]   A lot of people might decide that I would much rather
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.560]   have these slight to their perception, slightly weaker
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:16.600]   personal privacy if it leads to a much better and much more
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.120]   useful product.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:21.040]   Security, however, should be a non-starter.
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.360]   Every company has to prove that there is no way
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.600]   that someone could intercept this stuff.
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.040]   There is no way that someone could get in on our servers
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.920]   and harvest our data and then use it.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.120]   As long as you trust the person that you're giving the data
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.280]   to your golden.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:36.320]   But if you don't trust the person to protect that data,
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.400]   you may as well just be tacking it to the wall of a subway
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.400]   and letting anybody take a look at it.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:44.480]   Like, say Yahoo.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.920]   Holy cow.
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:47.640]   Let's take a break.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.200]   We haven't talked about the dash thing.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:50.880]   I know this is all you've been working on, Renee,
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:51.840]   for the last couple of days.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.320]   It ruined your Thanksgiving.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.640]   I hope you're not having suffering from dash PTSD,
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.360]   but we do want to talk about it and see what's going on.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.400]   The latest on that story.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.440]   It's the developer in the App Store.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:04.720]   I feel bad from-- nothing's on me.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:05.240]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.880]   Well, right.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:10.680]   And I've heard others say the same thing.
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.480]   I heard Jim Dallerimple yesterday on TNT say basically
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:15.880]   the same thing.
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.800]   This is a challenging story, but we'll cover it in just a second.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.800]   And you also, I see, sent me a link to a smoking Samsung
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.880]   phone caught on video.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:31.360]   There are reasons why you might want to have security
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.880]   in your house.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.440]   All enough caught by a nest cam.
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:37.920]   Is it playing?
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:38.640]   It's not playing like--
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.040]   It's going to walk in stage, right?
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:42.040]   Playback doesn't begin shortly.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.880]   Try restarting your device.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.920]   I've never seen this on YouTube.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.600]   No, either.
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:53.160]   Maybe it's time for me to update my Mac.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.920]   Time to put Sierra on it.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.200]   We'll be back in just a second.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.520]   But first, let's speak of Internet of Things.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.800]   Let's talk about my current favorite Internet of Thing
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:02.400]   device.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.160]   And by the way, highly secure.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:07.480]   Because when the Ring Video Doorbell was designed
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.600]   by very smart people, they built in a capability
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.840]   for automatic updates.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.120]   And this is everybody agrees.
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.600]   The most single most important feature of an Internet of Things
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.960]   device is the ability to update it.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:22.200]   And in this case, the Ring Video Doorbell updates automatically
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:25.000]   whenever there's a patch needed and they do it for you.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.760]   And there's a lot to be said for that.
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.320]   You're going to love the Ring Video Doorbell.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:28.680]   What is it?
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:31.840]   Well, it's a doorbell that replaces your existing doorbell
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:32.840]   in your house.
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.120]   It could be wired or unwired.
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.800]   The original Ring has a big battery.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:37.880]   And I'll let you my own battery.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.360]   And it allows you to go for a year.
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:43.120]   So you could put this on any door, your bedroom door,
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:44.040]   if you want.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.200]   When people push the doorbell, it rings the chime--
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.800]   now I put it on our wired door at home.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.800]   So it was easy, peasy.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:51.840]   And I'm no handyman.
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:54.000]   But I just unscrewed the doorbell.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.400]   It had two screws.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.880]   It was kind of falling off anyway.
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:58.920]   Two wires coming out of the door jam.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:15:59.960]   The Ring kit is great.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:02.160]   It gives you everything you need to mount the Ring
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:05.680]   in a much more nicer manner than my original doorbell
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:06.160]   was mounted.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:09.160]   He's even got a face plate with terminal screw downs
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:09.800]   and stuff like that.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.720]   It comes with a level--
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.880]   a drill bit if you needed.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:14.360]   I didn't need it.
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:16.160]   The appropriate screwdriver and bits.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:18.600]   It even comes with the USB charging cable
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.600]   if you get the original Ring so you can charge it once a year
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.960]   and it's got the right screws and all that stuff.
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:25.000]   They really do a nice job.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.760]   I didn't actually need most of that stuff.
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.000]   It was very easy to install.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.840]   Then you pair it to your Wi-Fi.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.040]   And the reason you do that is that's when the magic happens.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.720]   Because this Ring video doorbell has an HD camera in it,
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.120]   a microphone in it, and a speaker.
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:41.000]   And now when anybody rings my doorbell,
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.680]   it rings the doorbell in the house just as it always did.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:47.680]   But it also rings my phone, my Mac.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.280]   There's a Mac app for it, my tablet.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.480]   And I can answer the door.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.440]   I can say hello.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:55.600]   Who's there?
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.520]   I can see them.
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:58.720]   I could talk to them.
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:03.680]   I could pretend I'm home, which is very handy for home security.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.040]   Chases that burglar away for sure.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.840]   It also is helpful if you're getting package delivery.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.200]   You can say, yeah, yeah, I'm in the bathtub.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:12.640]   Can you just put it on the doorstep?
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.360]   I'll be right there.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.680]   I'll sign for it tomorrow, whatever it is.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:16.280]   I love this.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.360]   Russell RIT guy has a Ring video doorbell at his office.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:23.600]   He's a contract IT guy, so he's always out and about.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.880]   So when the UPS guy or the FedEx guy
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:28.960]   comes with a router or hardware he needs, he can see them.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.640]   He can say hello to them, no matter where he is on the job.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.680]   And then say, hey, here's the code to put it inside the door.
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:35.600]   And they do that.
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.120]   It's so great.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.120]   You can also keep an eye on things out front
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.480]   because it's got motion detection.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.960]   It's so cool.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:47.120]   They also now have the Ring Pro, which is 1080p instead of 720p.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:50.240]   It doesn't have the battery because this would be good for anybody
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.360]   who doesn't-- has a wired doorbell.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.320]   And they've added additional features.
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:58.520]   They took the Ring and they turned it into a stick up cam.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.080]   Everything minus the button to go ding dong.
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:04.080]   So it's got the camera, the speaker, the microphone.
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:06.880]   You can use it to keep an eye on other parts of your property
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.720]   and hear and speak to people in your backyard.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.600]   Hey, kids, get out of my yard.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.960]   And it's so much fun.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.000]   Plus, you can get a solar panel so you don't even
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.800]   need to have power for it.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.840]   The solar panel will keep it charged.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.800]   They put together kits, a variety of kits.
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.320]   They call them the Ring of Security kits.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.120]   All of them included doorbell, the solar security sign.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.360]   Let people know-- this is a great-- this sign is great.
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.200]   It lights up at night.
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.560]   And it gets its power from the sun.
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:34.200]   So you don't have to plug it in.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:34.960]   It lights up at night.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.840]   Let's people know you're protected.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:39.480]   The kits can include, if you want one, a stick up cam,
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.600]   the solar panel, or the chime, which
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:44.240]   is a little device you plug into the wall that will ring.
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.400]   So if you don't hear your doorbell in the workshop
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:49.160]   or in the kitchen or whatever, you could put a chime there
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.920]   and you can hear it better.
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.120]   It's just-- this is just awesome.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:52.960]   So take a look.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:57.840]   Go to Ring.com/Macbreak and look at all of the security,
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.720]   the Ring of Security kits.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.160]   And pick the one you want.
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:05.840]   And we're going to get you up to $150 off of them.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:12.200]   When you go to Ring, ring.com/macbreak.
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.920]   Ring.com.
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:15.160]   What are you laughing at?
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:15.880]   Ring.
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.560]   No, no.
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.600]   I was-- it was a very, very timely thing,
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.800]   because I don't have a social anxiety disorder.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.760]   But this morning, as I was getting off of stuff done,
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:31.640]   there was a strange man in a van who I didn't recognize
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:34.720]   that didn't have any delivery logos on it coming up.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:35.960]   And so I was able to use--
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.320]   I don't have the ring.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.440]   When I finished the review, I had to send it back.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.680]   But I do have a camera pointing at the driveway
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:46.520]   so that, do I feel like I have enough social strength
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.120]   to have a conversation with a total stranger about something
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:50.960]   I don't know what it's going to be about?
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.240]   Or do I want to just keep looking at the screen
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:55.240]   to see if he goes away?
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:56.320]   I would choose the latter.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:57.160]   That's what I would do.
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.320]   I just sit there, watch.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:01.040]   But with the ring, you can actually--
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.200]   Hey, hey, you.
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.280]   Get out of here.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.360]   It's awesome.
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:05.360]   I love it.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:05.760]   Ring--
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.040]   I'm not you.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.440]   Yes, you.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.400]   Yeah, right.
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:10.760]   Ring.
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:15.040]   If you're not carrying an edible arrangements, go away.
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.080]   Hey, you with the pizza.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:16.440]   I don't know.
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:17.280]   Go to the neighbor.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.280]   Come right here.
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.160]   Come right here.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:22.280]   Ring.com/MacBreak.
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:24.120]   And you get up to $150 off of it.
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.200]   They're ringing of security.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:26.720]   Kids.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.000]   Now, let's talk before we get to the picks.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.080]   Our last story.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.520]   I saved it for last because I know poor Renee just shakes
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:34.880]   whatever I mentioned it.
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:36.960]   So first of all, I'm not familiar with Dash,
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.160]   but developers know it, right?
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:39.600]   It's a developer tool.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.880]   Yeah, it's a tool that provides offline documentation
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:43.320]   and snippet management.
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.040]   OK.
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.440]   And it was iOS or--
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.640]   There's an iOS and a Mac app.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.320]   It's the iOS app that got pulled from the store
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.840]   in the associated account suspended.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:52.680]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:55.520]   So the Mac app store still has Dash.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:57.080]   I believe so, but he advised everybody
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.320]   when he put up his initial blog post,
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.520]   who's migrate their license to the non-app store version
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.360]   as quickly as possible.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.120]   Who is he?
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:03.920]   I forget.
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.840]   And I'm going to butcher his name if I try to pronounce it.
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.160]   But he's a Romanian developer.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:08.280]   OK.
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:12.400]   Apple has apparently not only banned the app, at least
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.640]   in the iOS store, but killed his account.
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:20.040]   Apple says because of review fraud--
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:20.840]   Yes.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:24.240]   --he has responded saying what?
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:27.200]   So initially, all that happened was he put up a blog post
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:28.720]   saying that Apple removed his account.
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.240]   He was told that it was for fraud.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:32.680]   He never committed any fraud, and there is no appeal
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:33.840]   to this process.
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.360]   And that sort of got the community buzzing,
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.240]   because first of all, developers are already
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:40.320]   super anxious about the app store, and it being a black box.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:41.880]   And there's no such thing as no appeal,
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:44.000]   because any company where you can email Timmy or respond
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.080]   to on his iPad, there's multiple layers of appeal.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:47.600]   But--
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.120]   No official appeal process.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.680]   Yeah, there's no-- it's not a court.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:52.120]   There's no process in place.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:54.480]   Well, it's a private business, of course not.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:55.840]   Yeah.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:59.160]   So at that point, there was just a lot-- nobody really knew
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.640]   what was happening.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:03.360]   And then Apple finally put out a statement yesterday.
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:06.280]   And we were one of the outlets that got the statement.
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:08.080]   And they said that-- well, because people
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:10.240]   were very confused, because Dash is a beloved application,
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.240]   and they couldn't see anything that was remotely
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:13.360]   like fraud with it.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.840]   But Apple said that during a course of a lengthy investigation,
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.600]   I believe it was at least a couple of years,
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.000]   they'd seen multiple instances of review fraud,
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   both reviews, positive reviews for that developer's apps,
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.080]   and negative reviews for competing apps,
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.360]   and that those apps were spread across two accounts,
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:31.120]   involving 25 apps, and close to 1,000 negative reviews.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.680]   And that Apple believed the accounts were linked,
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:35.400]   because they used the same credit card,
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.120]   they used the same bank account,
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.960]   they had the same devices logged in for development testing,
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.480]   and they used the same bundle ID for the apps.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.200]   And we should point out, independently from Apple,
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.600]   if you go to like App Shoppers or software.com,
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.840]   they list Dash alongside a bunch of these apps
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:51.240]   that supposedly committed the fraud under one list
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.360]   is coming from the same place.
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:54.800]   So there's obviously some sort of completion
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.280]   between these apps.
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.680]   And the developer then put out another statement
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:01.840]   saying that he was absolutely not responsible for this.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:04.440]   It was an account he started for a family member.
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.480]   He had no responsibility for it,
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:08.800]   that he was trying to discuss this with Apple.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:11.120]   He was going to do a blog post on their behalf,
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.160]   and then all of a sudden he felt that they just
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.880]   completely threw him under the bus.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.360]   And so he put out this statement,
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.520]   and he released a copy of an audio recording
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.640]   that was between him and a member of Apple's
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.520]   worldwide developer relations team,
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:25.160]   where they were basically discussing this blog post.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.000]   The really interesting thing here
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.480]   is just how different these two accounts are.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:32.120]   And to be clear, the developer has made absolute statements
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.640]   about this, and people love this developer and his apps.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:37.440]   And there's a tendency, he's an underdog, absolutely.
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.880]   Developers always deserve the benefit of the doubt.
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:43.040]   Apple has put out a statement, and that usually requires
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.440]   a senior vice president sign off,
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.840]   and that means they have triple quadruple octuple
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:49.320]   checked everything before they do this.
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.000]   So you have these two very different statements.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.440]   And where they disagree is that Apple believes
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:56.080]   that there was fraud committed by these two accounts.
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.360]   He says he has nothing to do with them.
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:58.480]   They believe they are linked.
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:01.040]   He doesn't believe he has any responsibility with it.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.640]   He said Apple wanted a blog post.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:07.120]   It sounds like Apple says he wanted to do a blog post.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.240]   One way of reading it is that Apple's trying to get him
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.040]   to sort of cover their ass and say
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.760]   that they didn't make any mistakes.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:15.040]   Another read is that Apple's trying to bend over backwards
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.520]   and is willing to do almost anything,
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.120]   but the developer sort of save face
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:21.120]   and get out of this situation.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.600]   And then something happened between that phone call
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:26.960]   and yesterday that made Apple feel that there was absolutely
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:29.840]   no way forward, and they had to make a public statement.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:32.160]   And the interesting part is apparently these cases happen
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.200]   all the time, and almost always the developer goes,
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:35.360]   "Ah, shucks, I won't do it again."
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.680]   And they just keep on going because Apple will air
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:39.200]   on the side of caution.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:41.560]   So, and also if there are cases of fraud
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:43.000]   and he said there's no responsibility,
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.160]   Apple's typical response would be your bank account,
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:47.680]   your credit card, you're absolutely responsible for this.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.600]   So there's just so much muddying of this issue
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.400]   that it's hard to see who's right and wrong.
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:56.560]   And of course Twitter varies back and forth between both,
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.000]   but it's possible everybody just committed
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:58.840]   a lot of mistakes here.
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:01.960]   And we ended up in a really bad situation.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:04.480]   >> Apple is absolutely right to attempt to preserve
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.200]   the integrity of the review process.
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.040]   That's critical.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.520]   You've got to be able to trust reviews.
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:11.120]   And if fraudulent reviews are posted,
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:15.400]   then they have every right, and even I think an obligation,
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:18.720]   to cancel the account.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:22.000]   And even maybe go so far as to pull the app from the app store.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.320]   The problem is you can sell an app
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.840]   for a Macintosh for yourself.
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:29.560]   But there's no way to get an app on iOS
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:30.760]   without Apple's approval.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:32.120]   They're a gatekeeper.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.880]   >> You can do a web app,
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.680]   but those are incredibly limited compared to an app store.
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:36.520]   >> Yeah.
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:39.520]   This is really a case of he said, she said,
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.280]   I don't know, you know.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:44.360]   >> It's just that there's so many different,
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:47.520]   it's easy to know who side you're on.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.480]   When I first saw the blog post,
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:51.960]   oh I know who side I'm on.
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.360]   And then you hear a few more details,
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.160]   okay now I know who side I'm on.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.400]   And then you hear the response to that.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:59.200]   It's clearly that this is not so much he said,
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.480]   he said the other, whatever,
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.200]   two different people said different things.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:07.080]   It's more like what information did one side have,
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.040]   that the other person did not have,
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.280]   that caused them to do something
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:13.080]   that seems rational given what they had.
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:16.160]   It seems, the only things that I thought were kind of
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:20.720]   maybe not a great idea from Apple's side is to say,
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:22.440]   this decision, we are announcing it,
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:23.600]   and it is irrevocable.
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.320]   Like well, no, it is not irrevocable.
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:27.520]   You own the store, you can do whatever you want,
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.240]   you can change your mind.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.640]   So it was clear, yeah, exactly.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:34.000]   And so it's clear there was a lot going on here.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.200]   And I think that a lot of the problems with the story
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.600]   were just that the velocity of the information
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.680]   that was coming out and the need to,
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:41.800]   once you have new information,
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.000]   if you are a news outlet,
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.560]   you have to sort of report on it.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:47.680]   So it's, I think it's more of an ongoing sign
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.880]   that people are concerned about, excuse me,
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.560]   developers are concerned about the App Store
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.400]   because again, it is the only marketplace.
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:58.080]   You cannot cheese off the person who controls the keys,
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:01.160]   the only marketplace where you're selling the one product
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:03.240]   that you're making a lot of money on.
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:05.200]   So if there's anything that seems odd,
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.360]   it makes a lot of those other developers
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.000]   pay really close attention to see,
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.240]   is this going to affect me or is this something
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:15.080]   where a developer clearly didn't read,
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.360]   didn't read information that was available
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.360]   to everybody at the same time?
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:21.520]   - Yeah, so the reason there were 470 comments
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:25.720]   on this on Hacker News and partly is because of course,
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:27.560]   there's a lot of developers apparently who used Dash,
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:28.760]   so it's a popular app,
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:32.640]   but more that there has been this pent up dissatisfaction
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.600]   in the developer community about Apple's high-handed
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.040]   running of the App Store in general.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.440]   I mean, that's been an undercurrent for years
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:42.400]   and we've even talked about it.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.920]   And so I think there are a lot of people
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:46.480]   who probably jumped to the conclusion,
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:48.080]   oh, Apple's at it again,
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:52.320]   until Apple was forced to reveal more.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:56.280]   And then I'm like you Andy, I don't know who to believe.
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.800]   So I think--
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.560]   - There are some improvements happening,
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.120]   like Phil Schiller is now uniquely in charge
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.800]   of the App Store in previous years.
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.600]   It would be unclear whether this was his job
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:06.640]   or Eddie's job, but it might have taken a lot longer.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.360]   Like we saw an email from Phil Schiller
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.840]   that 9 to 5 Mac published.
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:11.680]   And also apparently there's a VP of App Store now,
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:14.360]   which might help further lubricate these sorts of things.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:18.000]   So structurally it seems like this is making huge progress.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.240]   I tunes fraud though, it's like beyond the App Store.
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.560]   That's an organization that's existed since iTunes existed.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.200]   And they're apparently really good at their job
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:25.640]   and they don't get a lot of false positives.
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:27.920]   And we don't see headlines about this almost ever
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:29.560]   because most of the time the person,
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.720]   like the sort of easy answer to this is,
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.960]   oh, you know, darn, my cousin using that account,
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.480]   I'll make sure she knocks it off.
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:36.320]   Sorry about that.
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:37.520]   And they're like, no problem, keep going.
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:38.440]   And it all gets settled.
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.920]   But he was adamant that he did not do anything wrong.
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:42.880]   And at the same time someone, apparently at Apple,
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:44.920]   is adamant that they didn't make any mistakes.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.520]   And when you have those sorts of attitudes,
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:49.000]   right, inevitably, when everyone wants to say face,
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.800]   you just don't save a situation.
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:55.120]   - And there's no reason to ask for government
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:59.360]   to step in with regulation or it would be nice
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:03.360]   if there were some quasi-judicial process
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:07.800]   that Apple would offer for this kind of a situation, right?
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:10.440]   Maybe an independent judge,
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:14.440]   or a adjudicator to, is there a adjudication process?
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:15.280]   Any kind of process?
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.120]   - No.
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:18.320]   - There's an internal process and it does get escalated.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.680]   And the final process is a senior group of people at Apple.
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.560]   And that's sort of like last year when we had the,
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.000]   where's it the two years ago with the widget thing,
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.800]   that gets escalated to a group of people.
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.280]   And eventually, you know, it hits now,
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.640]   it hits Phil Schiller's desk.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.720]   - It's not, I have to say, it's not good for Apple,
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:32.960]   only because they have in the past appeared
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:35.960]   very kind of capricious in what they'll approve
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:38.360]   and then disapprove and the peak out cases,
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:40.360]   the widget peak out case is a good example.
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:41.640]   And so this just adds to that.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:43.720]   I think Apple needs to at this point say,
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:45.800]   all right, we're gonna have an adjudication process
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:48.560]   and we'll have an independent adjudicator that,
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.240]   and we can present, both sides of the case
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.320]   can be presented, something like that.
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:55.720]   It would, that's as much important to the integrity
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:57.520]   of the Apple's App Store process,
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:01.560]   I think as making sure the reviews are accurate, yes?
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:04.840]   - Well, we're not talking about putting someone in jail
[01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:07.120]   or not forgetting someone, not in jail.
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:09.760]   I'm saying that it's not as important as that.
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:12.000]   And the level of transaction,
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.640]   the amount of transactions that Apple has to approve
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:17.640]   and disprove on the App Store are huge.
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:19.520]   I think that what would make me happy is to know
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:22.040]   that if someone gets hit by the ban hammer,
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:25.280]   there is a documented process for saying,
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:27.360]   no, this is wrong, I want to talk,
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.640]   not through a third party, not through lawyers,
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:32.240]   but basically, you can't, if you ban me,
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:36.560]   and I say, I want to talk to you face a person, a person,
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.560]   you ask me questions, I ask you questions,
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:40.360]   and we figure out what happened.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:41.800]   As long as someone has the right to do,
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:45.040]   that's so that after the robots say
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:47.000]   that this developer screwed up,
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.280]   after the humans who overlooks the,
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.040]   oversee the work of the robots have said
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:52.160]   this person is screwed up,
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.560]   there is a way for that person to say,
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:56.440]   and either A, no, I didn't screw up, you've got it wrong,
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:59.680]   or B, I didn't realize that this thing that I was doing
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:01.360]   that seemed natural was wrong.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.600]   Is there a way that I can assure you
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:06.560]   that my intentions were not those of evil?
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:08.440]   - Yeah, I mean, a smaller company wouldn't be a big deal,
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:12.480]   but this is the sole and only way to put an application
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:15.560]   on the most popular smartphone in the United States,
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.160]   maybe the world.
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:20.800]   It has to rise to a higher standard at some point
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.480]   than just, hey, it's a business,
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.680]   it's our business, we could do whatever we want.
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:28.600]   I call Google on the carpet for the same reasons.
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:31.720]   Once you become that powerful and that important,
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:34.280]   then you have to rise to a higher standard, I think.
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:36.000]   - I mean, there's two ways of looking at a one,
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.200]   sorry, go ahead.
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.120]   - I'll say quickly then.
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.080]   From my point of view, the more important thing is
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:44.240]   that I know many developers for whom their livelihood
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:46.440]   is one app or two apps.
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:48.680]   It's not that they have 18 different interests
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:51.520]   and nine different things are each graphing
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:54.000]   against their income, it's that they have a really beloved,
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000]   well-made, well-supported, well-documented product.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.320]   And if someone just simply pulls the plug
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:02.640]   and that revenue stream, they suddenly have nothing.
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:06.720]   So I don't think that it's less of a case of obligations
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:10.360]   on Apple's part as there needs to be at least an outward sign
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:12.840]   that we appreciate that it's not as though
[01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:14.760]   we're taking away somebody's FART app
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:17.840]   and the 18 cents every quarter that we were sending to them
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.960]   for the sales of that FART app for some time
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:23.120]   is a productivity app that a lot of our users count on
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.840]   and that it will have huge repercussions.
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:29.200]   At that level, you really do have to have a conversation
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:30.760]   in which a human talks to another human
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:34.720]   and ask questions and it gets responses for that to happen.
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:37.320]   - Yeah, and there's just a couple of quick things.
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:38.680]   One is I spoke to a lot of people,
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:40.000]   as many people as I could about this
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.760]   and not a single person I spoke to did not sound,
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:44.120]   whether it was other developers or Apple,
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:45.560]   did not sound personally devastated.
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.400]   Like this is the last thing they want to have happen.
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.640]   They don't want any developer to ever feel disenfranchised
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:51.720]   and if they could, that's the part that makes it so hard
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:53.320]   is that if you take both of them at face value
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.960]   and I believe we can, nobody wanted this to happen.
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:58.080]   Everybody wanted a good resolution to this
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:32:59.600]   and a lot of people are deeply hurt
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:02.040]   that there wasn't a good resolution to this.
[01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:03.640]   But this is also not a unique situation.
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:05.480]   I mean, there have been accounts of things happening
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.480]   at the Google Play Store, celebrities and models
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:08.920]   have had their Instagram accounts deleted,
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.320]   Facebook has removed things.
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:11.760]   This is a problem with the digital age now
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.280]   where we have this virtual real estate
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:15.920]   and absolutely no real control over the platforms
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:17.560]   that we're using for all our businesses.
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:20.200]   And they are in some cases up to not just the whim
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:22.160]   of the platform but the wind of the people
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.960]   and sometimes very people with really special egos
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:27.760]   involved in key parts of those platforms
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:30.760]   who can make a spot decision and decide they not like you
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:31.960]   or decide something is wrong
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:33.920]   when three other people in their branch would not decide
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:35.480]   what's wrong and there goes your account
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.640]   where there goes your app.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.680]   And I think that's a larger problem that we have to solve
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:41.000]   as we become an increasingly digital economy.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.160]   - All right, well, I'm sure I don't think
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.240]   we've heard the end of this one,
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:49.440]   but I don't know if they'll ever will be a resolution to it
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.520]   but we'll keep you posted.
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:54.200]   Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is the time
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:57.600]   at the end of the show where we pick our favorite things
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:01.080]   and let's start with Andy Inako's pick of the week.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:02.360]   - I'm wearing the pick of the week.
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:07.360]   It's the Epic 2 Bluetooth Airphones by JLab Audio.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:11.560]   Since I'm reviewing the iPhone 7,
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:15.480]   I decided to spend a month not ever using plug-in headphones
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:16.800]   of any kind. - Wow.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:17.800]   - And so I've had these first,
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:20.920]   so I decided to buy my first pair of Bluetooth headphones
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:23.160]   in about a year and a half, two years
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:24.760]   so that I see what I've been missing
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.720]   by using the wired stuff.
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:30.160]   And I pick these because it has the features that I want.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.160]   They're actually, they're technically workout.
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:34.520]   They're sport earbuds.
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:39.000]   So I promise you that I don't wear the well-playing volleyball
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.960]   in a bikini or-- - Why the hell not?
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:44.040]   That's what I want to know.
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:46.720]   - Well, because I'll send you a privately pictured
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:47.920]   of my self-wearing spandex
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:49.440]   and that'll answer everything.
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.520]   But what I did want is I wanted something
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:54.640]   that would replicate the way that I personally use earbuds.
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:59.160]   I don't have the big blue, the big cans
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.840]   that you wear on the subway that has the shell over your ears.
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:04.200]   These are things that I roll up and I stick in my pocket
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:06.400]   or stick in a little pouch that I will have with me.
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:08.760]   And I just listen to them like when I'm traveling
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:12.040]   and when I'm on the buses and trains and stuff like that.
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:14.120]   So it's small and it's compact.
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:15.560]   Actually, I should take them off at this point.
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:17.960]   So if you want to say nasty things to me, by all means,
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:18.920]   'cause I will not be able to hear you
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:20.600]   'cause I'm using this for show audio.
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:21.840]   So it's really, really tiny.
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:24.040]   It's really, really compact.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:25.720]   It has, I have a big head,
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:28.040]   so it has a feature that I really, really need,
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:30.480]   which is the ability to, it has a long cord
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:32.560]   that connects the two items of them
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.840]   and you can adjust them so that when you,
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:38.240]   they'll stay put, but traditionally when I have the kinds
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.400]   that are kind of molded in, I can't lean forward
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:43.640]   without pulling the earbuds out of my thing.
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:46.360]   It has integrated, of course, volume and pause
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:49.640]   so that you can do, hey, hey, Shlomo
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:52.880]   and whatever Google is doing, but that's stuff too.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:56.640]   It has, the other feature that really attracted me to it
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:59.560]   was the fact that it has a 12 hour battery life,
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:02.000]   which is as long as I can, really,
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.040]   that's about as long as it gets.
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:06.880]   The bomber that I had with previous Bluetooth headphones
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:09.080]   is that when I want to, I'm not gonna be,
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:11.160]   I can't be diligent about plugging them in
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.600]   every single night.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:16.600]   I have to have some break away from the charging cable
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:19.880]   and I find that I almost never, I'm caught,
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:21.520]   I've never been caught on a wares
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:25.160]   because it's, when you plug them in and turn them on,
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.080]   it will announce what the battery level is
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:28.160]   and of course it's Bluetooth 4,
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.680]   so you can see right in the menu bar of your mobile
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.760]   or your desktop device where the battery level is,
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:34.360]   charges up really, really quickly.
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:37.800]   It comes with eight different styles and sizes
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:41.760]   of the silicone earbuds, so you're gonna have an awful fit
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:44.960]   for the first day or two, but that's your excuse
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:46.720]   for rotating through these different sets
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:49.160]   before you find the kind that you really, really like.
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:50.840]   I find they're quite comfortable.
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:53.240]   I find that they're very, very wearable.
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:56.080]   The only thing that I can really complain about them
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:59.040]   is that I'm using, I'm sorry for that,
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:02.280]   I won't hold this close to the cameras,
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:04.360]   you can't really see all the earwax and stuff.
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:09.280]   I have to use this kind because the other kind
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:10.640]   are a little bit more comfortable.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:11.480]   The slanged kind.
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:14.760]   But they're only suitable for like pop music.
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:19.040]   I listen to a lot of pop music and podcasts.
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:22.120]   I like to listen to a lot of classical and opera
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:25.280]   and I find that I can only really get like the full range.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:27.560]   I only really get that bass if I've got the kind
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:31.000]   that can really just put it right into my ears.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.520]   So they sound very, very good.
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:36.840]   I, as good as the $12 Amazon basics headphones
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.680]   that I used to wear.
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:41.760]   But I think that my personal limit with these
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.000]   is about two hours.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.680]   I haven't looked into having custom molds made
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:49.560]   or I've been thinking about taking some of the better
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.480]   silicone plugs from other headphones I used to use.
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:55.240]   Wired headphones to see if I can adapt them.
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:57.240]   But they're perfectly, they're perfectly comfortable
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:00.120]   for a couple hours if I want to wear them longer.
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.320]   They're easy to carry around.
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:03.640]   But the other thing that was important to me is that
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:06.080]   they do come with a case.
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.520]   So that, again, it has the same.
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:11.560]   I can still just stick them in a pocket usability.
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:12.760]   But the other thing that was important
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:16.120]   is that I just don't have $200 to spend
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:19.840]   on a pair of $12 Amazon basics headphones.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.640]   And these are 99 bucks and 99 cents.
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:24.520]   Let's run it up to 100 bucks.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:29.000]   And so that's, to me, that's, as both a consumer,
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.040]   that's as much money as I want to spend for a device
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:35.240]   that I know is not as simple as copper wiring
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:38.960]   that goes to little sound enducers in molded plastic.
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:42.280]   But I still don't want to spend $200 for the noise cancellation.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:45.400]   I don't want to spend $200 for not having a wire that goes
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.240]   between one ear and the other.
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:49.520]   But I'm-- so after two weeks of wearing them,
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:51.800]   I've actually done a couple other shows
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:54.120]   on Twitter with these on.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:56.320]   I'm willing to say-- I'm willing to recommend them.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:59.560]   These are really good 99 bucks headphones.
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:02.600]   Before I write about Bluetooth headphones in general,
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:08.080]   I do want to buy a pair of really crappy $23 no name Amazon.
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:09.200]   I don't mean Amazon brand.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:11.840]   I mean that-- I have a name brand you've never
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:13.920]   heard before that gets delivered from Hong Kong
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:15.800]   to see where the difference is.
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:18.720]   I will-- oh, by the way, I should point something out.
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:20.720]   I did hesitate a little bit before buying them
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:26.120]   because it's one of those famous Amazon product reviews
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:28.640]   where it gets three stars, three and a half stars.
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:30.240]   And it's because everybody uses them
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:33.480]   as either giving it a five star review or a one star review.
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:37.640]   And most of the one star reviews are because they broke.
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:40.120]   They say, oh, they only last-- they only last about three
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:41.600]   weeks, and then they broke.
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.160]   Or they keep cutting out on the audio.
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:46.560]   There are two things to say about that, just to factor in
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.240]   if you're about to order them on Amazon, and that gives you pause.
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:55.520]   These are IPX5 rated, which means that they are waterproof--
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:59.800]   they're waterproof up to actual, like, gentle water jets.
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:01.840]   So they should be OK in the rain.
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:03.640]   They should be OK in sweat.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.760]   However, there is, like, of course, a charging port--
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.480]   a micro USB charging port here.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:10.720]   And if you don't, click that all the way in.
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.240]   It is no longer waterproof.
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.480]   So I think that the people who have had them die
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:18.240]   are people who didn't have that seated properly,
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:20.960]   and then they sweat it into them or got rained on.
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:23.320]   I should also point out that, again, I'm not wearing these
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:24.520]   as exercise headphones.
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.520]   I'm wearing these as just regular earphones.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.960]   So I haven't had any problems with that.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:31.080]   The second problem is things cutting out.
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:36.560]   I have had-- that was kind of an interesting experience.
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:38.920]   I carry my phone in my pocket--
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.640]   either chest pocket or a pants pocket.
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:43.840]   And of course, it has to pass through--
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:45.520]   the signal has to pass through a lot of meat
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:47.400]   to get through to these things.
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:52.400]   On my Nexus 5x phone, which is a mid-quality phone,
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:53.840]   maybe every two or three minutes,
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:58.160]   there'll be a little click of disconnected for a little bit,
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:40:59.640]   but I found it again.
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:03.120]   So I can't say there is no signal problems.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.920]   But that's only when I'm outside and walking,
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:06.800]   when I'm actually just using it around the house,
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:09.120]   or whether I'm, again, on the trainer
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:10.520]   or the subway, I'm not having a problem.
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:13.160]   I find that using it with the iPhone 7,
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:15.920]   however, I'm having no problems whatsoever.
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:20.800]   So I think that disconnects can be largely a problem of,
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:22.900]   you will find out exactly how good the Bluetooth
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:24.760]   radios on your device are.
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:27.920]   Because with my iPad, with this, I'm not having a problem.
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.080]   And the last thing to say about it
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:30.440]   is that you can connect it to--
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.360]   I think-- I'm looking at the table here.
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:33.440]   It's not on the table.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:35.720]   I think up to--
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.880]   you can connect-- you can pair it
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:40.360]   with multiple devices at the same time.
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.200]   So right now, this is paired to my Mac.
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:44.120]   It's paired to my iPad.
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:47.200]   It's paired to the Apple's Loner phone.
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:49.120]   It's paired to my Nexus 5X.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.480]   And so I can switch between them without having to repair.
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:53.400]   All I have to do is-- the only thing that's annoying
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:56.000]   is that sometimes I have to--
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.680]   like when I was getting ready for the show,
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:00.600]   it didn't automatically-- it automatically
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:04.760]   repairs to whatever device you connected to last with it
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:06.840]   if that device is still in range.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:09.520]   The fact that this phone was still within range
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:11.800]   meant that I couldn't just go to my Mac
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:13.200]   and then just simply say connected to this.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:15.600]   I had to disconnect from this first.
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:18.440]   But if this were upstairs or someplace else,
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:19.240]   it wouldn't care.
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:20.680]   The range is pretty good, by the way.
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:21.760]   I can walk the hack.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:25.080]   I have even have a wall between my office here
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:28.440]   and being in the kitchen and still be listening to what's
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:29.640]   going on.
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:31.880]   I will say that that's the one thing I really, really like
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:35.080]   about-- I will say that I've been missing out on.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:37.080]   I've been missing out on the ability, when there's
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:40.800]   a two or three minute ad read during a show,
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:44.360]   to be able to walk away, go refill my water bottle,
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:47.360]   go check the mail, and hear where the commercial is.
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:50.040]   And when I hear Leo's upload-- and so that's why we thank
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:51.080]   our open--
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:52.080]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.680]   You fooled me every time.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:56.080]   No, that's not-- isn't it nice being on the wired?
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:58.600]   I just-- I have a-- first of all, the AirPods
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:00.680]   are due any minute now, right?
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:02.440]   So those are going to be another competitor,
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:03.840]   I think, in that category.
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:08.720]   And aren't-- are we expecting a bunch of W1 headphones-based
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:11.320]   headphones from Beats and others?
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:12.840]   One is that the Solo is already out.
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:15.600]   It's the X and the other ones that are, I think, still due.
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:18.120]   So this is certainly-- I mean, at that price
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:21.760]   to a reasonable alternative, at least in the interim.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.640]   But ultimately, if you're going to go Bluetooth,
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:26.440]   you're probably going to want to go W1, I would think.
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:29.640]   That's the new chip in the iPhone 7.
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:32.680]   Yeah, it depends on-- but I also--
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:36.720]   I also have to say that I'm not very vain.
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:38.960]   Again, get a load of what my body looks like
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:40.720]   and how I'm dressed.
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:45.680]   I'm more comfortable with this sort of interface
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:48.680]   going on to the world than--
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:51.000]   I know, that little dribble, that icicle dribble.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.120]   Yeah, I know.
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:53.000]   And it's not even the dribble.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:56.200]   It's that I kind of want to-- as soon as I get my loaner
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.920]   pair to try out, I think that I will only feel good about it
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:02.560]   if I then 3D print a bunch of hoops and crosses.
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:03.840]   So things I can connect to it so it
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:05.800]   looks like I'm wearing an actual earring.
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:06.800]   Just a dress it up a little bit.
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:07.800]   It's just a galactic and actual Andy.
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:09.240]   You just got to own it.
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:09.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:10.240]   Yeah.
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:11.840]   I mean, I've had such bad experiences
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:14.080]   with wireless headphones, Bluetooth headphones,
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:17.120]   dropping out and losing pairing and stuff that I'm--
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:18.120]   I've just been dreading this.
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:20.360]   But I think this is ultimately the way to go.
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:22.800]   But computers comes in the headphones.
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:26.800]   I'm glad that there are options for people.
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:30.080]   For me, to buy at $160 is too much for me
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:33.240]   to spend on a pair of headphones like that.
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:35.480]   It's also because I use so many different devices.
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:38.480]   The W chip isn't going to be as big and improved
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:40.320]   for other people.
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:44.400]   And I'm just glad that there are alternatives.
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.640]   I wouldn't say that this is-- oh my god.
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:49.200]   The scales have fallen from my eyes.
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:51.080]   My soul is stronger for the tears I have shed.
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:54.680]   I can't believe I turned my-- I rebuke the false devil,
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:56.920]   the false god of wired headphones.
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:00.240]   When my 30 days of experiment are over,
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:02.520]   I'm going to be using wired headphones
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:05.200]   when I'm going to enjoy using wired headphones.
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:08.640]   I think that I will still be very, very happy that on my Android
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:12.320]   phone, if I ever forget these, leave these at home
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:13.720]   because there's a charger attached,
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:16.240]   I will be happy that I still have a pair of $10 crappy wired
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:18.840]   headphones in my bag because there's a pair in every bag
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:19.840]   that I have.
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:21.800]   But I'm glad that there's been a lot of--
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:23.800]   if you have not checked out Bluetooth headphones
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:26.880]   since the last time you bought a set of Bluetooth headphones
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:29.480]   and were deeply, deeply profoundly disappointed,
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:32.400]   you will find that Bluetooth 4.0 and modern design
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:34.920]   and modern battery life will make things
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:36.680]   a lot better than the last experience you had.
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:38.680]   Good to know.
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:40.400]   Renee, Richie, your pick.
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:42.920]   So I have-- I know this has been picked many, many times,
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.360]   but there's a reason to pick it again today.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:46.880]   And that's omnigraphful by the omnigroup.
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:49.840]   So in September, they announced this new model.
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:51.800]   They said that traditionally on Mac apps,
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:54.640]   when you sell them separately, when you sell them off the Mac
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:56.040]   App Store, you can do all these great things.
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:58.800]   Like give people upgrade discounts, free copies,
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:00.200]   if they just bought it.
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:02.400]   You could have different tiers of pricing,
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:04.200]   but you couldn't do this on the Mac App Store.
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:06.640]   And then the omnigroup being the omnigroup--
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:09.160]   imagine Ken Case or somebody said, where Tim Wood said,
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:10.560]   why can't we?
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:12.400]   And they sort of bucked the conventional wisdom
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:14.960]   in a way that omnigraphful is so good at doing it.
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:15.880]   And they did it.
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:19.400]   So now, I believe it's rolling out today, omnigraphful 7.
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:20.960]   I couldn't get the link working in my App Store.
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.600]   It might be on the US App Store already.
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:25.120]   Omnigraphful 7, when you open it,
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:26.560]   it gives you this dialog box.
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:28.400]   And you can choose to dismiss it.
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:30.120]   And then you can read it in read-only mode
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:31.760]   and have an omnigraphful reader.
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.400]   If all you want to do is use omnigraphful
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:36.080]   to distribute documents in your company.
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:37.960]   But you can choose to do an upgrade purchase.
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:39.520]   You can choose to unlock it if you just
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:40.960]   bought the previous version.
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:42.880]   You can choose different tiers of having it.
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:43.800]   And it's a one-time price.
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:45.040]   There's no subscriptions.
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:48.080]   But darn it, they've managed to figure out
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:49.600]   how to make the Mac App Store work
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:52.760]   like a traditional Mac software purchasing model.
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:54.040]   And I think it's terrific.
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:55.280]   I mean, the Mac App Store obviously
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:57.200]   has a cavalcade of issues that we
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:58.920]   could spend three more shows talking about.
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:00.920]   But this has been one of the longstanding ones.
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:03.600]   It was a lack of flexibility for developers.
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.320]   And I love that Omnigroup--
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:07.640]   a lot of developers have famously quit the Mac App Store
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:09.320]   and for very, very good reasons.
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:12.720]   But the Omnigroup is like, they're going to figure it out.
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:14.760]   And I think that's just an amazing philosophy
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:17.440]   and an amazing accomplishment for them as a company.
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:19.920]   So if you haven't used Omnigraphful yet,
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:22.760]   it's a way for you to make all these very quick, very easy,
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:23.600]   very intuitive.
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:25.000]   I mean, you could spend a lot of time
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.520]   to make absolutely beautiful documents.
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:29.000]   But to take what's in your head and get it
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.120]   into a usable form for other people,
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:33.240]   it is absolutely peerless.
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:35.000]   And now you can get it on the Mac App Store
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.400]   in the way that you've been buying it for years off the Mac
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:38.240]   App Store.
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:39.960]   And a lot of people really like getting it there,
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:41.440]   because when you install a new Mac
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:43.840]   and you can just hit the Mac App Store and download all your apps,
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:45.320]   it's way easier than remembering and going
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:48.240]   to a bunch of websites and finding a bunch of license codes.
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:49.960]   So a lot of people still just want
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:51.320]   to be able to get it from the Mac App Store.
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:53.760]   And again, they just made it work.
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:54.720]   So kudos.
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:56.480]   And thank you to the Omnigroup.
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:56.600]   Good.
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:58.320]   Maybe others will do this too.
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.160]   But I hope so.
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:00.600]   It means a fantastic experience.
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:03.240]   Nice.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:05.200]   I have an anti-recommendation.
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:07.320]   In the past, I've recommended something from Seagate called
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:11.080]   Live-- L-Y-V-E. It was hardware and software
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:14.200]   that allowed you to automatically backup all your photos
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:17.320]   from all your devices, not just your phones.
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:20.400]   And it's not iOS specific, but iOS and Android.
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:24.400]   And your computers, Mac and PC, and collate them
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:25.880]   into a single device.
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:31.720]   It had a kind of a metadata-sinking capability.
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:32.640]   Seagate offered it.
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:35.800]   And in fact, if you had an external drive from Seagate,
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:37.360]   in many cases, it was live compatible.
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:39.880]   You could use that hardware with the live software.
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:44.280]   They're shutting the service down at the end of the year.
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:46.680]   And so in a way, this is also a cautionary tale,
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:49.360]   because when you use a service like this-- now,
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:52.800]   Live doesn't back up your photos to their servers.
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:55.120]   So I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:58.600]   if you bought, as I did, a live device.
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:48:59.800]   Is it still going to work?
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:02.280]   I think it's not going to work, even though the hardware is
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:04.240]   still there.
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:09.000]   It needs the service to connect and copy the data over.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.440]   So they're offering six months free of Amazon storage
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:16.040]   and stuff as a bridge.
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:17.840]   But it's really disappointing.
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:20.920]   And I think that it just shows you
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:24.840]   when you rely on a service of some kind
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:30.080]   that you should be aware of the fact that it only works
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:31.360]   as long as that service continues.
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:33.200]   I thought Seagate was a big enough company
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:34.720]   to keep something like this around forever.
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:37.080]   It sold a lot of hard drives for them, I imagine.
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:40.560]   Anyway, I apologize for recommending a service that is now
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:42.240]   going away.
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:43.960]   And if you did take my recommendation
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:46.520]   and buy a live device or use the live service,
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:48.400]   you should start looking for an alternative,
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:51.200]   because Live is dead.
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:53.080]   Or about to, anyway.
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:56.440]   But we will be back.
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:58.560]   So thank you, everybody.
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:49:59.480]   It's great to see you.
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:01.280]   Renee Richie is at imore.com.
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:02.800]   He does lots of podcasts.
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.040]   There writes a lot there.
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:08.760]   He's just a nonstop go-getting guy at the--
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:09.120]   what is it?
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:10.120]   Mobile-- what are you?
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:10.800]   Mobile Nations.
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:12.720]   Mobile Nations editorial director?
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:14.440]   Yes, sir.
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:15.760]   He's the guy.
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:17.200]   And it's always great to thank you.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:17.760]   One of the people.
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:18.560]   Thank you so much.
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:19.760]   Yeah, you have great people.
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:20.600]   I'm more wonderful.
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:22.360]   But there are other mobile nation products.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:25.000]   And we have Florence Ion now on Android Central.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:25.960]   That's right.
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:27.400]   Congratulations.
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:28.600]   That's phenomenal.
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:29.360]   Great score.
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:33.040]   I'm not hiring any more people, so you can steal them.
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:33.480]   That's it.
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:34.960]   It's over.
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:36.480]   It's great synergy, Leo.
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:37.400]   No, it's--
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:39.240]   That's exactly how I think of it.
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:43.160]   She is, of course, a regular on our Android show.
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:46.440]   So Leo, are you suggesting that imore is the Samsung
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:48.680]   of textbooks?
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:51.360]   I don't know.
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:52.160]   No, I'm thrilled.
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:54.000]   I was-- you know what it is?
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.680]   When you see great talented journalists
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:58.880]   and you see them succeed, what better--
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:50:59.520]   that's wonderful.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.400]   I love seeing that.
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:01.880]   I do, I do.
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:03.560]   And also, I love seeing you Andy and I
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:07.160]   go each and every week at about 11 AM Tuesday.
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:10.120]   It's great to see you at 2 PM your time, East Coast time.
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:11.360]   So glad to have you back, Leo.
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:12.280]   1,200 to see you.
[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:14.240]   Thanks for filling in for me, too.
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:15.280]   Oh, it's always fun.
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:17.000]   Renee and I had a lot of fun hosting the show.
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:17.680]   That's nice.
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:19.520]   Yeah, I'll have to watch it.
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:20.520]   Also, thanks.
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:22.760]   Did you not do iOS today as well?
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:23.640]   I think you did.
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:24.160]   Yes.
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:24.160]   Yes.
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:25.080]   Thank you for doing that.
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:26.080]   That was good for the time.
[01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:26.880]   That's another show.
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:29.280]   I wish I could do more often because it's nice to talk
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:33.840]   about iOS for like 45--
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:35.200]   nice to talk about that all at once,
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:36.480]   without having to talk about lawsuits,
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:37.680]   without having to talk about actual other news.
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:38.680]   No, it's really fun.
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:39.160]   I agree.
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:40.160]   I really love that show.
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:41.600]   And Megan's great to Megamurray.
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:42.400]   Oh, Megan.
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:46.120]   And any five minutes I can spend talking with Megan
[01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:47.520]   is worth another 10 minutes in my life.
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:49.640]   I feel very lucky, yeah.
[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:51.320]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:52.960]   As I mentioned, we do this show every Tuesday.
[01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:54.920]   I hope you'll stop by and watch us live.
[01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:56.000]   1800 UTC.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.360]   If you can't, though, don't worry on demand audio and video
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:00.520]   is available, as with all our shows.
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:05.000]   You can start at our website, twit.tv/mbw for Macbreak Weekly.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.160]   All the old episodes are there as well as every new episode.
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:10.480]   But you can also see from there you
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:13.200]   can subscribe on iTunes.
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:14.520]   We're on Google Music.
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:18.640]   We're on Stitcher and Slacker everywhere you can get podcasts.
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:20.960]   And do subscribe because you don't want to miss an episode.
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:23.160]   We had a wonderful studio audience.
[01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:24.640]   It was nice to have you.
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:26.080]   If you'd like to join us in the studio,
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:28.080]   all you have to do is email tickets at twit.tv.
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:30.320]   We'll make sure we have a seat out for you
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:32.680]   and a show for you to watch.
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:33.640]   Thanks for being here.
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:34.480]   We'll see you next time.
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:37.360]   Now, and now I'm afraid to say it is time to get back to work
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:39.400]   because break time is over.
[01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:40.400]   Bye-bye.
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:43.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:46.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:49.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:51.880]   (mellow music)
