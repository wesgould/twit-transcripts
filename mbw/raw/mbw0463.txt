[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.160]   The dangers of running a public beta.

[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.000]   I am not Leo Laport.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.920]   I'm Jason Snell from sixcolors.com and the incomparable.com
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.160]   filling in for Leo in this endless rotation
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.800]   of Mac Break Weekly Host, which I think actually it's not
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.120]   endless.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.960]   It will come to an end very soon and Leo will be back.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.920]   I joined by three excellent guests for this week's edition
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.000]   of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.280]   To my right, in person it is Alex Lindsey from the Pixel
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.680]   Core.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.920]   Hey Alex, how's it going?
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.840]   It's going very well.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.920]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.320]   My pleasure.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.000]   Should I faint during my hosting stint here?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.800]   I expect you to revive me and/or take over.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.160]   I'm ready.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.800]   I'll mostly just take over and kind of kick your feet to the side.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.320]   That's right.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.640]   Give me a swift kick.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.400]   All right, fair enough.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.640]   From the great nation of Canada and the great website
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.200]   of imore.com, it is your friend Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.280]   Hi Renee.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.080]   Hey Jason.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.440]   It's great to be here with you again.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.680]   Are you going to be a well-behaved guest?
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.880]   I'm going to be incredibly polite.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.280]   I will apologize for everything, including my apologies.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.120]   So basic Canadian, Ben.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.720]   Absolutely.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.240]   All right.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.400]   I appreciate that.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.960]   And not from Canada, but rather from somewhere
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.040]   in mysterious wiles of New England,
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.480]   from the Chicago Sun Times and many other places.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.640]   It's Mr. Andy Anakko.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.000]   Hi Andy.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.200]   Most of the Boston Bruins that I followed as a kid
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.120]   with the exception of Bobby or were Canadians.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.920]   Well, that's true.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.920]   I don't know if that counts for something.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.360]   Boston is practically Canada, I think.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.160]   Or I may have failed geography.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.840]   When we need parking, we'll take that.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.520]   Sure.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.560]   Sure.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.920]   Well, so big week on All Things Apple.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.200]   And fortunately, this is the show where
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.000]   we get to talk about it.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.600]   I wanted to start with various public betas.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.600]   Or as I understand they call it in England, betas.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.920]   iOS 9 public beta is the first time
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.160]   that we've had a public beta of a major iOS update.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.400]   Because the public beta program for iOS
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.520]   only started earlier this year.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.840]   I have to ask all of you, are you running iOS 9 on devices
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.560]   that you actually care about?
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.040]   Because that seems really scary to me.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.120]   Renee, are you using iOS 9 every day now?
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.240]   I'm blessed and cursed to have all the old devices lying around.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.800]   So if there is an emergency, I can just charge an old device.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.240]   But I have iOS 9 on my iPhone 6 Plus, my iPad Air 2,
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.920]   and on an iPhone 6, because I want to see the public beta
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.640]   was different than the developer beta.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.080]   Do you have an emergency phone that you can back up to in case of--
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.400]   An iPhone 5 Plus, I have that running 8.4.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.600]   Wow, bold move.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.000]   Bold move.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.240]   So Andy, what about you?
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.960]   Do you have this on anything that you care about?
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.640]   Or do you have it sequestered away somewhere?
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.920]   I know.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.640]   Every time it goes to do beta, I always
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.120]   feel like that's seen in the movie 2010, where Dr. Chandra is
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.600]   talking to like Sal, saying I was Sal.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.160]   If we're going to understand what happened to Hal,
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.000]   I'm going to need to shut you down now.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.160]   Do you understand what's going to happen?
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.280]   Will I dream?
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.320]   Of course you will, Sal.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.760]   All intelligent creatures dream.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.400]   You would never do that to a phone.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.200]   Put beta software on a phone without explaining
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.240]   you might never wake up from this.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.920]   So no, I don't have it on my--
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.840]   my phone is now like my primary device.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.200]   So no, I do have it on an iPad Air that I don't own.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.760]   I do not have it on the iPad that I do own.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.120]   But I've been finding it pretty stable.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.040]   But for putting it on a phone where
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.880]   if you have a car with more than 90,000 miles on it,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.320]   you want to make sure that phone is always working wherever
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.320]   you might wind up.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.480]   And for that reason, though, I would never put a beta.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.400]   You also never know what the next beta is going to do.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.720]   Maybe three is great, but then four is going to have a problem.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.320]   So it's always a risky proposition.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.240]   Yeah, or what apps are going to break with it.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.440]   And being without Evernote, when I'm in New York for a meeting,
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.960]   is about as bad as being without--
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.520]   I would much rather be without actual phone service
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.920]   than without Evernote on a day like that.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.640]   What about you, Alex?
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.120]   Are you--
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.200]   I just follow Renee's like this.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.560]   Are you sporting the beta?
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.520]   You just read what Renee writes.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.040]   Yeah, I just stay safe.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.680]   I have to admit, I usually upgrade my OS when the next one--
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.240]   I'm always like one whole OS behind on most things.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.320]   But most of my computers and stuff.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.680]   With my phones, I actually wait, usually a couple weeks
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.720]   to see if the--
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.200]   after when it actually goes public release, not beta.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.320]   But I usually wait a couple weeks for it to kind of--
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.760]   I have little iPod touches and some old iPads
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.680]   that I'll throw it on, but I won't touch anything.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.520]   That's in beta, yeah.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.520]   I mean, we talk about this all the time, that iOS,
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.480]   betas are scary.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.840]   And as Renee said, sometimes it's every other beta that gets you.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.440]   And then you get lulled into this false sense of security.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.240]   Like, oh, it's great.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.200]   I'll update to the next one.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.960]   Oh, no, everything's ruined.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.960]   But when it's a Mac beta, I feel like you have workarounds
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.240]   and it's easier to recover.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.720]   But an iOS beta is scary.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.960]   It can be hard to restore back to a previous version.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.720]   And you rely on your phone in some ways
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.440]   that you don't rely on other devices.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.240]   So now that this is the first time that the general public has
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.200]   been able to just sort of freely get a beta, I keep saying
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   you should really think twice before you do it.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.480]   Because especially on your main phone--
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.600]   I think twice more.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.720]   I think I have enough trouble.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.240]   I have enough trouble with the release version on my phone.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.360]   I don't need to have a beta.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.440]   It's even worse.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.320]   I will say that the iPhone-- one thing that Steve Jobs really
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.320]   was focused on in the beginning was that the one thing it had
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.480]   to do was be good at making phone calls and do those things.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.160]   And that's no longer really I don't think an issue.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.600]   Because we-- I have times when the phone just hangs up on the call.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.520]   It hangs with the call kind of half in, half out.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.280]   I have things where you can't-- you see it ringing.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.240]   You can't answer it.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.160]   You have all kinds of little things.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.920]   And so I think that's enough instability for me.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.160]   I'm just shocked that you use your phone as a phone.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.560]   I know.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.680]   Occasionally.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.880]   Usually the first words when I pick up the phone
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.960]   are why are you calling me.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.840]   There's this thing called Slack.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.400]   Use it.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.280]   Renee, you--
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.680]   Renee, for me, it's not only that.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.720]   But it's also-- I lost Wi-Fi on my MacBook that
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.760]   wasn't running a beta last week.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.440]   And we all have problems with our Macs
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.600]   and all of our devices.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.920]   For me, I'd much rather not have to worry about, OK,
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.000]   of the nine things this could be, could this now
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.360]   be number 10 or number 11?
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.840]   Because I'm running a beta.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.880]   It's just like the conceptual difference
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.040]   between something I'm counting on to work all the time.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.160]   And something where if this works up, no problem,
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.040]   I'll just move from the desk to the sofa.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.640]   I can understand it if the objective in running the beta
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.000]   is to fix a problem you have.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.200]   I heard from a lot of people who upgraded their Macs from 10.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.400]   10.3 to the beta of 10.10.4 because it fixed a bunch of DNS
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.760]   related stuff.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.640]   But for something like iOS 9, what you're really doing--
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.720]   you're doing it because you want to see what the future is
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.040]   like.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.520]   And you're going to take this huge risk that your apps are
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.960]   going to start breaking because the app developers can't even
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.280]   submit apps that are tied to iOS 9 to the app store.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.120]   Or even beta test them in test flight now.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.200]   So what do we get out of running a beta that would make us
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.080]   take a risk like that?
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.680]   On the iPad Air 2, just the ability to have side by side apps,
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.000]   even if they're only limited to just ones that Apple
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.960]   furnish, that's amazing.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.760]   I'm taking my not mine iPad out a lot more than my actually
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.480]   mine iPad just for the ability to have my inbox here
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.680]   or have a Safari pane over here while I'm actually
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.360]   writing something.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.040]   I'm using Notes as my word processor
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.480]   because it's a working word processor that accepts
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.040]   and works with a split screen.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.200]   If you've been sad that you keep using a notebook when you
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.160]   really think that your iPad could be about 90% of what you need,
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.600]   I would even-- yeah, that would tempt me to say that if I'm
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.000]   going to be going to Comic Con, let's say, for three or four
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.600]   days, I would say I'm willing to risk losing Wi-Fi or something
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.640]   not happening because this was so much what I've been begging
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.320]   for as a productivity thing for iPads.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.320]   It's a great thing.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.160]   We should point out, too, that Apple has gone because this
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.040]   is the first iOS beta.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.320]   Apple's gone to panes to make it easier.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.680]   You don't have to do the developer install process.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.520]   You download a certificate and that enables you to download iOS
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:48.720]   9.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.760]   And Apple's pretty clear on that page
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.520]   to tell you to make an iTunes backup and then archive
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.480]   that backup because you won't be able to restore later
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.160]   if you want to back out of it from your iOS 9 beta.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.640]   You'll need that iOS 9 backup.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.920]   You'll need that iOS 8.x backup.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.920]   So I think they understand that it's
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.080]   a very different audience than the traditional Mac audience
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.160]   who might do betas.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.600]   And they are putting these things in place
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.520]   which will not perfect, at least sort of less than the blows
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.000]   considerably.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.360]   Renee, you wrote a really nice first look of iOS 9 on iMore.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.520]   And I'm just wondering--
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.520]   I know Andy just mentioned the kind of amazing side-by-side
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.000]   iPad feature, which I bought an iPad Air 2 just to test it out
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.120]   because it was so great.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.960]   Are there other features that should--
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.080]   I feel like we're doing something evil here in tempting
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.000]   people to install a public beta.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.520]   What?
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.520]   Don't install, don't install.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.800]   Oh my god, the new features are so awesome.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.280]   But instead of installing a public beta friends,
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.440]   Renee, perhaps you could tell people what they will be not
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.680]   getting until the fall.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.760]   Well, Andy mentioned the side-by-side apps
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.840]   are absolutely killer on the iPad.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.480]   Only the iPad Air 2 gets them a last
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.600]   because it's the only one with an 8x processor and 2 gigabytes
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.320]   of RAM.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.160]   And apps have to share the resources.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.360]   Apps are used to having all the resources to themselves.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.320]   And some apps really take advantage of that.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.880]   So it's going to be a while until apps are sort of constraining
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.720]   themselves down to sharing resources.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.560]   But that's iPad Air 2 only.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.800]   The sidebar apps, the slide over, is iPad Air 2
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   and the latest two iPad minis.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.040]   So that's more encompassing.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.960]   And the picture in picture is the same thing.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.680]   So not everyone gets them, but it is an absolutely killer
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.480]   feature.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.520]   But there's a lot of other small things in there.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.640]   The keyboard will work as a trackpad on the iPad.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.800]   It's worked on the iPhone as well.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.320]   And some beta currently doesn't work.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.360]   So we'll have to see if that carries over.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.960]   But small things like that make it much easier
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.880]   to move around the insertion point.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.520]   And then you'll have just a bevy of things that sort of smooth
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.280]   out the experience.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:40.880]   There are things--
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.960]   Siri is a lot smarter.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.560]   And Spotlight now is consistent with Siri.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.600]   It's not exactly the same.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   You can't put commands into Spotlight yet.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.440]   But it's been replaced by something called Search.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.040]   And it can give you sports results and movie results
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.200]   and all sorts of other things.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.800]   So if it's not socially appropriate to start talking
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.280]   to your phone, you can start typing into your phone
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.640]   and still get results.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.040]   And it'll start to be a little bit predictive, not the way
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.680]   that Google now is predictive.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.640]   But it'll take a bunch of internet sources,
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.280]   bring them down to your phone, and try to preemptively give you
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.000]   some assistance, like what apps you're going to use,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.160]   what people you want to talk to, when you have to leave for a
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:13.680]   meeting.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.920]   So just generally throughout the OS, I think they've salted
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.520]   in a lot of small conveniences.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.760]   I really like on--
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.840]   I use my iPad in landscape mode a lot.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.520]   And when you swipe down for Notification Center,
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.240]   you now get a split screen.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.520]   Like it's a two column view, which I think is a really--
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.840]   it's a pretty cool feature.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.160]   So I'm liking that.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.720]   I'll tell you, Renee, using the trackpad style, two fingers
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.920]   down on the iPad keyboard, that takes some getting used to.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.440]   I feel like I'm not yet competent in using the cursor
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.160]   on my iPad.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.320]   I can't even believe I said that.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.640]   It was natural for me.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.960]   On the iPhone, I found-- on iPhone 6 Plus, I found just--
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.440]   I did it by accident because Apple never announced it for
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.640]   the iPhone, and it kind of worked in a couple of betas.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.520]   So I just did it.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.960]   But I think the bigger takeaway for me is that Apple is
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.400]   starting to let the iPad be the iPad.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.680]   It let it a little bit before, like with gesture navigation.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.720]   But now they're really sort of allowing it to have, like you
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.280]   said, split screen notification.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.840]   They're letting it have the extra toolbars in the predictive
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.600]   text area on top of the keyboard.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.120]   They're letting it do things that fit in the context of an
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.640]   iPad but are no longer constrained by iPhone usage.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.640]   And I think that will really help make the device better.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.760]   Alex, you--
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.280]   you ever going to use an iPad for work on anything?
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.400]   I definitely use iPads.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:29.760]   OK.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.280]   So I have one.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.400]   I will admit that I know I'm in the wrong show to say this,
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.760]   but I use a Windows--
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.880]   the Surface 3 probably more.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.000]   This podcast is over.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.720]   So I got a little frustrated by not being able to draw and
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.200]   not be able to do all the other things I needed to do when
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.360]   I was having a tablet.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.800]   But we use the iPad a lot for display information and
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.560]   some basically.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.280]   We run a lot of our switchers with it.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.760]   So I mean, I think that for me, I kind of like the fact that
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.520]   I'm not split-screening, but I'm looking forward to
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:04.960]   playing with it.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.680]   I think I like the focus.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.200]   On the other hand, my Mac usually has 40 windows open from
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.640]   eight different apps at the same time, and I'm constantly
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.880]   getting it right now.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.800]   I'm trying to be focused.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   That is one of the things I like about using the iPad is
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.360]   that the focus that you get when you are just in one app.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.000]   Although--
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.920]   Moving files from one app to the other is still frustrating.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.920]   Having two apps side by side can--
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.720]   I mean, does that add another dimension?
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.080]   To be able to kind of see what's going on in one and work
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.720]   on another.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.680]   And I also hear from a lot of people who like to work.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.800]   People I know who like to work with a movie playing in the
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.120]   background or something like that.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.880]   And you can actually do that now on the iPad.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.480]   You can just play a video and have it even be kind of off
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.360]   the side of the screen while you're working.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.040]   And that's going to be good.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.240]   You're just trying to plow through the 200 messages in
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.240]   your inbox that came in while you were in the air.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.040]   That's not something that you can't do while watching an
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.120]   hour's worth of Bob's burgers.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.120]   No.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.320]   And it's cool because you can actually have a video app in
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:03.800]   one side.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.000]   You can have Safari showing YouTube on the other side.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.520]   And you can have some random picture and picture video up.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.920]   And they won't all play at the same time.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.720]   But as you hit the play button on one, the other ones will
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.400]   stop.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.760]   So you can basically get--
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.600]   Andy can have Bob's burgers, and the latest episode of Flash,
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.800]   and maybe an amazing race all at high availability.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.720]   And it's time you want some.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.040]   And those are the kind of things we'd like to be able to do.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.360]   Some of the stuff we do with our Mac, we analyze a lot of
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.000]   video, live video usually.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.600]   And being able to see it, you're watching it in one
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.280]   application, and then actually using something like Soundflower
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.360]   or whatever, pushing it to other applications to monitor
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.920]   all the information, and so on and so forth.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.320]   And so being able to do that on an iPad would be useful.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.280]   Because it's way stupid to do it with a Mac mini, which is
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:44.720]   what we're doing now.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.040]   Oh, don't get me started on audio and on iOS.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.080]   Because that's actually one of the things that my dream is
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.240]   always to be able to take an iPad with me on a trip, and not
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:54.880]   my laptop.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.120]   But I've never been able to really do it because I do
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:57.760]   podcasts.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.480]   And you can't have sort of two apps.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.120]   You can't have Skype going on an iPad, and also recording
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.440]   your audio locally.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.680]   Because really only one app can have access to the audio.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.840]   This is a nerdy thing.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.000]   But it's one of those areas where I always come back to
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.520]   the Mac, because the Mac's just more advanced on that stuff.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.360]   And what I'm kind of--
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.160]   I mean, to get nerdy just for one more second.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.800]   With the iPad, I mean, one of the things that is frustrating
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.680]   is there's no interfaces.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.000]   I mean, there are some.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.280]   There are a handful of interfaces for audio going in.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.040]   But you should be able to put all kinds of things in there.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.320]   It should be a little breakout.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.760]   And the closest you get to it is the Mac-E, whatever that is,
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.160]   that 16 channel or now 32 channel where you can put your
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:37.840]   iPad in.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.920]   I don't need that much.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.760]   I just need a little breakout that pops into a lightning.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.440]   On the end, that lets me put a bunch of different pieces
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.080]   of audio in, and so on and so forth.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.000]   And I feel like that--
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.720]   and partially, I've been rooting for the USB-C to get
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.040]   added to the iPhone and iPad, because I feel like the lightning
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:03.720]   registered BS is slowing down a lot of what could happen with
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.000]   this.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.600]   If it was just an open connector, we'd end up with a lot more
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.560]   toys.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.360]   I like toys.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.440]   But I do think that the multitasking points away toward
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.800]   an iPad that is going to have more functionality and is
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.160]   going to support some of the stuff that we don't have now.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.440]   Because once you can see two apps at once, you start to
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.000]   ask yourself those questions.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.200]   What could I do with this?
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.600]   It's like back in the days with OS 7.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.560]   Remember, it was like suddenly we went from the multitasking.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.680]   We could do two things at one time.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.200]   It was amazing.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.560]   Imagine it blew our minds.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.880]   It's such a nice shift, not just for the iPad, but I think
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.560]   for the entire Apple product line.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.720]   Because one of the Achilles heels of Apple has always been
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:46.520]   that the entrance fee for laptops is minimum $900.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.640]   If you want to actually get a laptop that does good things,
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.840]   minimum, you can't spend one dime less than $900.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.440]   And you could always say that, oh, well, they have budget
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.000]   computers in the form of the iPads.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.920]   But as long as you really like to redefine what the term
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.200]   computer means to you.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.360]   But with just these simple extra features, not only what
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.720]   we're talking about with split screen, but the added support
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.080]   for Bluetooth hardware keyboards and giving it practically
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.720]   parity with the virtual keyboard, that means that now you can
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.120]   walk in with $500 or $600 in your pocket and walk out with
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.240]   something that conceivably could be something you would buy
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.240]   instead of a very, very good $500 or $600 Windows Notebook.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.640]   It's a really great thing to see.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:33.360]   And I think that for me, I could probably survive on my iPad
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.600]   most days, because a lot of my is just answering questions.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.480]   But it's just the email.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.480]   I think that the iPad and the iPhone
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.400]   were both designed for about someone who doesn't get more
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.080]   than 100 emails a day.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.080]   I get about 450 actionable items a day.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.360]   And it's just not like you can't find him half the time.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.680]   And so I need my regular computer just
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.640]   to be able to manage it.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.000]   And I find that I just wish I'm quite happy to give mail 10
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.320]   gigs of my iPad to keep all my mail local.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.440]   I don't want to be limited to 500 or 1,000 of the last
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.360]   messages or whatever it is.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.480]   There's some kind of limit there that is too low.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.040]   Hey, Renee, one of the things that I know that a lot of people
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.600]   have been talking about is how now that there's
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.240]   a public beta of iOS, there have been a lot of ugly app
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.200]   reviews posted in the App Store.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.680]   This is one of the downsides of this.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.600]   Have you noticed this?
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.280]   Federico Vitticio wrote a nice piece of Mac stories about it.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.480]   And I think you guys have covered it at iMore, this idea
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:40.400]   that people are writing bad reviews of apps
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.360]   because they don't work in the iOS 9 public beta,
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.760]   as ridiculous as that is.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.080]   We do this post once a year whenever the beta starts to--
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.760]   usually when the beta comes out, it's often when more people
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.920]   start using the beta--
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.360]   that you have to remember that if you download a beta,
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.600]   you are saying I am a higher class--
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.280]   not a higher class, but I am a different class of user.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.320]   I am someone who is accepting the responsibility
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.560]   of running beta software.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.320]   And there is an exchange going on there previously.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.040]   You couldn't even get AppleCare anymore if you put a beta
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.160]   on your phone.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.760]   Now with the public beta, you still can.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.640]   But it's something to be aware of if your phone
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.080]   acts weird, it's because you put a beta on it.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.720]   And there are certain things that you shouldn't do.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.520]   Like bugs.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.360]   Bugs, this is-- they are supposed to be bugs.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:22.840]   It's a beta.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.680]   There's a whole system.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.280]   There's a feedback app for you to report bugs.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.880]   And especially when it comes to compatibility with other apps.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.320]   Like you said, developers are not even
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.880]   allowed to update their apps to iOS 9 binary compatibility
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.720]   until the gold master comes out, which is almost always
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.280]   the same day as the next iPhone event, which is usually
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.040]   September.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.400]   So they can try to work around stuff.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.120]   But there's a lot of stuff they just will not be able to fix.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.840]   And we've seen examples.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   Luke from Adobe Post, an example of someone giving his app
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.960]   a one star review because it didn't work well in iOS 9.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.560]   And I don't think people understand how deeply those sorts
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.800]   of reviews affect developers.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.320]   It literally hurts their ability to feed their families.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.120]   And it's because you wanted to put on a beta.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.880]   And you did it knowingly.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.640]   And the app has compatibility problems
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.120]   who no fault of the developers.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.480]   And they get highly impacted from it.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.640]   So we almost every year put up a post just reminding people
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.800]   to please obey Wheaton's law and not to be jerks about things
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.600]   when they're running a beta.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.920]   Yeah, there's a-- I think as reviewers and Andy and I go back
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.040]   a long way longer than we'd like to admit
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.160]   about how long we've been reviewing products.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.920]   There was always this idea that when
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.280]   you're looking at beta software, you're
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.480]   looking at it with the understanding
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.080]   that it probably doesn't work right
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.360]   and that you need to leave a lot of your judgments by the door.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.240]   You may pick them up later and walk through the door
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.880]   when it's declared final.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.960]   But when something's a beta, especially an operating system,
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.240]   you've got to change your frame of mind.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.080]   You cannot be the righteous indignation user who
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.560]   is furious that this app crashes because you're
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.720]   using beta software.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.840]   You've got to let it go.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:54.960]   I hope Apple would block it.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.640]   I hope in the future Apple just blocks reviews
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.520]   on devices running beta software.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.120]   So if you put on the beta, you no longer
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.960]   have the ability to review.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.880]   Yeah, that'd be very smart.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.760]   I mean, when the beta's dropped last week,
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.760]   I did the usual-- just like right before the 4th of July,
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.720]   your local fire department releases a video
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.040]   to the local news of many kids having their heads blown off
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.680]   by explosives by fireworks.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.640]   Our version of that is tweeting, look, remember,
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.920]   it's beta software.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.320]   Do not expect it to work.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.000]   It's a nice thing to take a look at.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.680]   It's a very security, but don't put it on primary devices.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.040]   And immediately you start getting old.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.800]   The beta's been very, very solid,
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.520]   or even the better version of that, which is, I think
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.360]   that a sufficiently knowledgeable user would have no difficulty
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.000]   in running the beta software.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.040]   And you have to say, well, if you are sufficiently
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.480]   knowledgeable and confident to come back and challenge me
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.480]   with my assertion that you should not install beta software,
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.560]   bio means go ahead.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.560]   But a lot of people are getting the impression, particularly
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.400]   now that all you have to do is go to a web page,
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.400]   a beautifully presented web page on Apple site,
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.160]   fill in your email address.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.120]   You get an email back.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.000]   And then you click one link that does nothing but install
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.960]   a provision that allows you to simply tap a button and update.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.040]   It seems like such a consumer level experience getting these
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.960]   betas that people think that, oh, I just
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.640]   get to get it a little-- I'm a special person who
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.920]   gets to get it a little bit early.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.960]   No, you're helping to test this out
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.560]   so that other people can get a more reliable product
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.960]   in several months' time.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.320]   And that's the only thing that we really have to combat.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.640]   The perception that a beta is almost the same as actual release
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.120]   software.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.680]   And the good news is that it really
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:32.280]   is an opportunity to help developers in Apple where
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.360]   when you find a bug, figure out, make it repeatable,
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.360]   and then report it.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.560]   Apple is listening, and the feedback assistant
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.240]   is in every version of their beta software.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.360]   And they are paying attention.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.960]   The reason they make it easy to get into the betas,
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.480]   because they do want a large enough number that they can--
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.240]   it's impossible for Apple to test all the contingencies
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.240]   internally or with a developer group,
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.080]   because the developers are pretty homogenous.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.520]   They're developers.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.800]   And so they want to make it easy.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.640]   But the downside of that is exactly what Andy described,
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.080]   which is then it's so easy that you start to think,
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.120]   oh, this is just a preview of what's to come and not
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.720]   what it really is, which is something that's partially broken
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.040]   and needs your help.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.560]   And if you download and install the beta with that in mind
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.840]   and knowing what you're getting into,
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.600]   I think it's fine and good.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.520]   And the tip is, when sending feedback,
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.320]   it is not it just doesn't work.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.400]   Like, this doesn't work.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.760]   And you know, like, it's broken.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.480]   It doesn't work.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.000]   It crashed.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.160]   It crashed when I was doing it.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.680]   What you do is you back up and you do it two or three times
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.560]   until you can get to-- if you click this--
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.760]   I'm in this app.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.000]   I have this version.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.400]   I click this, click this, click this, and then it crashes.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.360]   And things get fixed like that.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.000]   When you can set an engineer, like, click, click,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.280]   click, and it breaks.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.080]   That it's repeatable.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.080]   You've done it a couple times.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.720]   You know that it works.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.480]   You know, it's kind of fun.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.680]   It's also important to remember that if you report--
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.440]   like, report stuff early, because right now,
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.760]   Apple engineers can fix lower priority bugs.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.080]   If you start reporting things near the beginning of September,
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.280]   they're only going to fix showstoppers.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.560]   Report the stuff like Alex said.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.280]   Give them steps.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.480]   The wizard is really easy to use.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.160]   And also, even if you think it's so obvious,
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.640]   someone else has reported it, they might think the same thing.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.480]   And consider it almost like an upvote.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.480]   So if someone else has reported it and you report it
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.240]   and maybe 10,000 other people, the sheer mass of that
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.400]   will be helpful to someone who wants to get engineering
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.640]   resources assigned to it.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.640]   They'll say, you know, 10,000 people reported this.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.720]   We really have to fix it.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.480]   So it's in everyone's best interest
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.280]   that you complain loudly and often.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.760]   I would even go so far as to me.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.000]   Renee has a great idea of saying,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.760]   if you're running on beta software, you're not allowed to report.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.000]   You're not allowed to rate things in the app store.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.600]   I would even go so far as to say that you should have to turn
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.040]   two keys at two panels that are 10 feet away
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.760]   before you can log a one star review.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.600]   Because there is nothing that has less credibility to me
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.440]   than a one star review.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.080]   That is because it's literally the lowest rating
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:49.960]   you can possibly give.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.920]   And the way that I always process that,
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.400]   because I've gotten only a handful of runs, one star
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.440]   review is on my books on Amazon.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.480]   And I always have the same response.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.280]   I said, let's say the person's name is Dave.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.560]   And I said, well, Dave, so you're saying that if the book--
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.120]   if Amazon delivered my book to you and you open it up
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.560]   and every single page was blank except for me extending
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.320]   my middle finger at you and saying screw you, Dave,
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.520]   you would have given it the exact same one star review
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.480]   because you could not possibly have given it a worse review.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.520]   And at that point, Dave usually says, well, OK,
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.280]   I guess it was like a two and a half or three star.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.920]   It just didn't like you didn't cover this thing.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.040]   It's usually the result of someone who's just angry
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.720]   and wants to note, I am angry with this
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.520]   and I want people to hear how angry I am.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.920]   And that's the only way to do it.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.120]   Well, we have much more to talk about about beta software
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.480]   because the Mac public beta came out this week for El Capitanis.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.120]   Well, I am your beta host, Jason Snell.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.840]   Fortunately, we have a fully tested and compliant host,
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.960]   Lea Laport, who's going to tell you
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.440]   about one of our sponsors right now.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.560]   Jason, if you don't mind, I'd like to interrupt.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.360]   They brought in me, the pro from Dover,
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.240]   to do this commercial here.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.360]   And that's because I know all about brain tree payments.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.240]   And I love brain tree payments.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.760]   I had the pleasure of speaking to their CTO a while back
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:09.520]   and it was awesome because I love companies
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.240]   that support developers in making better apps.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.840]   Support not just developers, but their customers too.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.280]   And brain tree payments is a perfect example
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.680]   of an app that makes everybody happy.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.760]   You want to add payments to your mobile app or your website.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:27.880]   You got to check out braintreepayments.com/macbreak.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.120]   Do what Uber did and Lyft.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.000]   Yeah, I mean, that's a perfect example.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.640]   Those companies have figured it out.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.040]   So it's a seamless, friction-free transaction.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.440]   And who helped them do it?
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.280]   Brain tree, Airbnb, Hotel Tonight, Living Social,
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.320]   Munchry, GitHub started with brain tree
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.520]   at the very beginning taking payments.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.560]   They do so, they continue to do so.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.400]   And it's so great.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.960]   They've got great support.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.440]   It's easy to integrate just a few lines of code.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.920]   They work with every platform.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.200]   It's a full-stack solution.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.160]   So you're going to add payments of every kind
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.960]   with just a simple bit of code.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:12.120]   I'm talking PayPal, credit cards, Apple Pay, even Bitcoin.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.080]   Braintreepayments.com/macbreak.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.840]   Customer service is great.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.320]   So if you have any trouble at all, in fact,
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.360]   if you go there right now, you can try their sandbox
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.800]   and see what your app would look like using brain trees.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.840]   They also solve that big issue for anybody
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.440]   who's got a mobile shopping cart abandonment.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.680]   People, it's about 70% of your customers give up
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.680]   at the shopping cart.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.640]   You, they're this close, but they're a little nervous
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.200]   about security or they don't understand how it works.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.360]   And they abandon it.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.120]   This will fix it.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.480]   So secure.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.120]   It's easy to use.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.600]   Their one touch SDK makes it so transparent for your users.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.880]   I'm not going on on.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.720]   The best thing to do is go to braintreepayments.com/macbreak.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.520]   Check it out.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.720]   And by the way, as a little bit of an incentive,
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.160]   they're going to give you your first $50,000 in transactions fee
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.880]   free.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.280]   Braintreepayments.com/macbreak.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.360]   If you've been doing the research, the due diligence,
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.560]   you've been looking around, you can stop.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.640]   You found the one.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.080]   Braintreepayments.com/macbreak.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.480]   Trust me, you're going to love it.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.800]   Now back we go to the Macbreak team and Jason Snell, Jason.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.680]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.120]   Boy, that is how the pros do it.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.200]   I appreciate it.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.640]   We'll be back soon.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.240]   Let's move on to more beta talk, because this is all beta
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.920]   all the time here, because we got the public beta of LCAP
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.840]   at Tan last week as well.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.200]   And developers got a third developer release.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.000]   I think they're basically the same.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.120]   I wrote a first look about this.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.160]   But so did Renee.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.120]   I guess we're LCAP at Tan experts.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.520]   Would you call yourself that at this point, Renee?
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.280]   No, no, I mean we're first lookers, maybe.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:53.680]   Yes, OK.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.160]   Just lookers.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:54.680]   I don't know.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.560]   Fair enough.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:55.920]   Fair enough.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.600]   So LCAP at Tan, one of the things about it
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.920]   is that I don't know.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.960]   I feel safer running a beta on the Mac.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.640]   Does that make sense?
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.240]   Like there were workarounds and developers
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.560]   can post betas on their websites and that are that six bugs.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.600]   And maybe it's just that I've been doing it for longer.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.720]   But I'm a little less frightened about running a beta
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.280]   release of Mac OS X than I am of iOS.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.320]   How about you?
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.840]   I've realized that humans make absolutely no sense to me,
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.720]   because, for example, I am more
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.560]   reticent to put a beta on my watch.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.320]   And the watch compared to my phone is not that important.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.440]   If my watch stopped working, I would still have my phone.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.360]   It would be 2014 again.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.480]   But I would be fine.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.080]   But because the watch is so close to me--
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.440]   and I don't know.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.800]   I just feel much more trepidation towards putting
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.000]   the beta on my watch.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.840]   And by the same token, the Mac is
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.800]   how I make my living.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.000]   And I still feel less worried about, like you said,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.960]   putting the beta on my Mac than I feel about putting it
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.040]   on my phone, which literally could require me to call 911
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.040]   to save my or someone else's life.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.560]   So it makes absolutely no sense.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.160]   But I think you're 100% right.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.360]   I think we're used to restoring broken Macs.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:02.240]   And I think we're used to working around problems on the Mac.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.320]   And maybe we have a laptop and a desktop.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.080]   So there's an emergency Mac we could use.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.960]   And that's different than working your iPhone, where you're
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.520]   just gone and you're doomed.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.760]   And I don't know.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.520]   El Capitan, though, in general.
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.120]   I mean, I know we talked about it before.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.000]   It's been talked about on Macbreak weekly before.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.080]   But since people actually have a chance to get this for
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.400]   themselves now, what are they getting themselves into?
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.240]   Is there anything that stands out for you, Renee?
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.800]   It's similar to iOS 9, where one of the biggest features is
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.680]   just that they're putting a lot of time and effort into
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.760]   polishing it up.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.080]   So you've got, again, a spotlight that does a lot more
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.360]   assistive sort of things.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.200]   There's still no Siri on OS 10.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.600]   But Spotlight does a lot more.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.320]   The Notes app, like it has in iOS 9, has been substantially
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:44.680]   improved.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.720]   So now you can embed all sorts of content into it.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.320]   It's a bunch of little things that taken together, including
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.320]   security privacy, just makes for a much better experience.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.560]   There's no moon shots here.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.760]   There's no radical redesign.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.040]   There's no functional leap like there was with extensibility
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.080]   and continuity.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.240]   It's just making everything better and smarter.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.440]   And I think we sort of collectively needed that this year.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.280]   And Notes is not exactly the coolest.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.360]   It's never going to win an award for coolest app on iOS or Mac.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.160]   But people use it.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.360]   It's there.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.400]   And it exists.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.080]   And why not?
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.080]   I feel like Apple knows that people use it.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.640]   And even though it's not cool, they said, we should
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.800]   probably make this better.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.840]   Because everybody's using it, even though it's just kind
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.400]   of generic Notes app.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.800]   So I like seeing that.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.200]   It's great.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.960]   I mean, they said more than 50% of people use Notes, and
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.280]   they wanted to make it a better app.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.840]   I use it admittedly as a way to quickly sync stuff, like
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.720]   just as a syncable clipboard between my devices.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.480]   And now you can put so many more data types.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.000]   You can put iWork documents, map locations.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.320]   All sorts of things can just be thrown in there.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.760]   Pictures, you can do sketches on iOS that also show up on OS 10.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.240]   It's great.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.160]   And on the screen right now, they're showing--
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.680]   it's not just a US release.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.200]   There's a new Chinese and Japanese systems as well, a
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.600]   new Chinese font.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   You can do side by side Chinese characters.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.160]   There's a predictive engine for Japanese text entry.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.680]   There's a lot of really cool stuff here.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.000]   But it's all sort of focused on making using the Mac better.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.600]   Andy, do you have experience with El Capitan?
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.400]   Have you taken that plunge yet?
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.960]   Yeah, I have it on an iMac across the way from the
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.160]   office here.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:14.600]   I like it.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.080]   I think that for me, the biggest feature really is
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.240]   Spotlight, which is for me has always been a feature that
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.440]   always worked well, but it was so obvious that it could
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.560]   work better.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.920]   And now it's got a lot more intelligence behind the
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.320]   searches.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.720]   I mean, the ability to say a schedule appointment with her
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.080]   at the place where we went that time.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.280]   And it knows that, OK, by her, he probably means this person
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.520]   by the place, all that sort of stuff.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.800]   The ability to do natural language and say, open the last
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.920]   document, the last word document that I touched or the
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.200]   word document I was working on last Tuesday.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.600]   It's like Renee said, there's a lot of stuff that's little
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.440]   touches like window management that you would do with a $5
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.960]   or $10 add-on is now.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.440]   It's easier to navigate as long as you devote some
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.600]   mind space into remapping how you work with windows.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.000]   Oddly enough, one of the things I
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.120]   like the most about it is one of the things I like the most
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.960]   about the OS 9 update, which is, again, it's really weird,
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.720]   but the San Francisco thought.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.760]   The fact that they've swapped out, I don't know whether it's
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.120]   a better font per se.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.320]   I'm not a font expert.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.880]   But the fact that they've swapped out this font that's
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:24.280]   become so familiar to my eyes after so many years and just
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.240]   made this more interesting little font, but it's not so
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.360]   interesting that it gets in the way of my understanding
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.440]   what I'm seeing and what I'm doing.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:36.920]   It's a lot like when you've got a brown house and now you've
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:37.840]   just painted it red.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.360]   It's the same house, but there's something about every time
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.480]   you pull into the driveway.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.320]   It looks newer.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.160]   It looks fresher.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.040]   It makes you a little bit happier when you see it.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.960]   So it's not going to change the way that I use my Mac, but
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:51.880]   it's an improvement.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.600]   Notes is also a big blockbuster.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.240]   It's almost a brand new app.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.880]   The only difficulty with it is that I have the same problem
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.880]   with it that I've always had with it is that it's an Apple
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.640]   only party.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.520]   And once you get into the habit of a good notes manager, like
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.480]   Evernote, and you're just in the habit of, oh, I need that
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.920]   URL, I need that address, I need that phone number, I need
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.080]   that document.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.960]   And when you get locked into this one system, now it becomes,
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.080]   oh, my God, it's going to be such a problem if I want to
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.840]   switch to a different phone at some point, or if I want to
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.040]   switch to a different tablet or a different notebook.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:27.560]   And as good as the update to notes is, I can't think of a
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.920]   single notes app that would be so good that I would risk being
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.200]   locked into one platform and order to keep on using it.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.560]   It's just way too important an app for me.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.160]   Yeah, I think notes is--
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.600]   its strength is that it's the default.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.040]   And that's why so many people use it.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.840]   And once you're somebody who's got an Android phone in the
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.800]   mix, or you're starting to think about using Evernote, you've
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:50.760]   probably left the Venn diagram of the notes app behind at that
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:50.960]   point.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.680]   But so many people use it just because it's there.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:57.520]   And I wanted to add that up until El Capitan, notes synced
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.760]   through an iMap mailbox in your email account, which also
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.520]   meant if you had a device that didn't have email installed on
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.840]   it, you couldn't sync notes because it would just refuse to
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.680]   open.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.080]   And now it uses iCloud.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.360]   It will still use the old method, but most of the new
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.000]   features are built into notes that are on iCloud.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.640]   And it's good.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.720]   I don't know why it took this long.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.560]   And it's kind of a clever hack, I suppose, that they were
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.280]   hiding all your notes in your email account.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.440]   But it was also wrong.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.480]   And I'm glad that that is over now.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.560]   Alex, you using El Capitan anywhere?
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.320]   I think 1086 is awesome.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.320]   That's what I thought.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.160]   How's that color Apple will go with Apple?
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.480]   Man, you're looking for you.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.160]   He doesn't even have Helvetica, no, as the system font.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.840]   We're going to think of 2015 as the year of Helvetica, no,
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.400]   but it's gone now in San Francisco.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.120]   No, I'm currently on this, but I still think 1086 was the
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.960]   last stable release.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.480]   So I'm just going to say--
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.600]   10.10.4 is actually pretty good.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.080]   I'm not going to say 10.4.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.200]   But it's good.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.960]   We deal with a lot of really--
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.200]   it's not just Apple.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.240]   It is all the hardware manufacturers that tie into all
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.400]   our computers.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.320]   And the last one that everything worked was 1086.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.240]   And then after that, it just things break all the time.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.600]   I know people who deal with complicated hardware.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.800]   And I certainly knew this when I was in the print magazine
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.160]   publishing industry, we had to deal with this.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.240]   And it's with audio and video.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.240]   It's the same thing.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.880]   You get excited about a new release of an operating system
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.560]   in 2015, because you know that'll be what you're using in 2018.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.600]   Exactly.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.640]   And it's just the wheel of time that you're just watching
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.240]   everything you're like on a Tivo or something.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.880]   You just tape delayed a few years.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.000]   We have apps that are randomly crashing.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.240]   And I was like, what operating system?
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   Oh, it's got 10.10 on it.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.560]   So let's try one of the 1086.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.360]   Because we have a couple of machines that aren't allowed
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.040]   to be updated.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.480]   And I put those on, and then they work perfectly.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.480]   There's a nice thread in the Mac rumors, forums, that is
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.720]   the community there, collecting a list of things that don't
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.880]   work right on El Capitan and some developer betas that have
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.800]   been released to address it.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.800]   So I definitely looked at that.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.320]   It said, there are problems with logic.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.240]   And I thought, well, I can't update then, because I rely on
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:03.440]   that.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.920]   And in Macworld, in our podcast studio, we were running
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.720]   Snow Leopard.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.520]   I think it still is running Snow Leopard.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.600]   They may have just upgraded in the last nine months.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.520]   But because Lion broke a lot of audio stuff.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.160]   And so we just kept it on Snow Leopard.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.600]   And that is weird.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.360]   But it happens.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:24.480]   In fact, two utilities that I use all the time, SuperDuber
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.520]   and default folder, they both announced that they don't
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.880]   work with El Capitan because of this new security system, which
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.560]   is a great security system, a rootless access.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:37.360]   It prevents a lot of problems where hackers are able to get
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.880]   access to your Mac and do things to it because they have
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.480]   root permissions because you're an administrator.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.080]   Your user is set to administrative powers.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.040]   And that's been reduced in El Capitan, which is great
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.920]   unless your utility relies on those powers.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.160]   And SuperDuber did that.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.640]   And default folder did that.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:57.640]   And Dave Nanyan wrote a nice blog post on the SuperDuber
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.440]   blog about how they're working around it and finding ways
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.520]   to create a backup in El Capitan.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.560]   And John Godo did the same thing on the default folder
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.920]   website about how they were going to have to essentially
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.680]   rewrite the app.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:13.440]   But in the end, it would be all worth it because they could
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.440]   do some things that they didn't do before.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.480]   But it's all prompted by the fact that their apps just
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.120]   don't work.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.600]   And the security model in El Capitan, it's not a bug that's
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.960]   causing them to break.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.440]   It's breaking because the OS is changing.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.320]   It's like sandboxing part two.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.320]   There's actually a new blog post from Dave this morning
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.520]   saying that turns out Apple fixed the problem with copying
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.160]   the com.apple.rootless attribute in the public beta.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.480]   So with the release of our beta 2, which is downloadable
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.960]   below, we've included the ability to copy with that
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.000]   preserved and thus system protection is maintained in the
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:40.680]   copy as well.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.040]   Plus, there's no need to erase when restoring.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:43.200]   Right.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.560]   So it's their first beta.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.280]   You could restore to the beta, but that security
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.080]   feature would be switched off at that point.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.840]   And now it'll stay on.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.600]   Right.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.000]   So it just shows you how fluid the flow of beta is and how
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:55.920]   it's--
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.720]   you're sort of in for a bit of a whitewater ride until the
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.560]   release candidate.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.160]   The release one is actually put up.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:01.760]   And it can be fun.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.440]   But you need to know when you're getting in that raft that
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.040]   you are going to get some whitewater.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.400]   You will see some rocks.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.440]   You wear it first.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.880]   And read the liability waiver.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.160]   Every row will get wet.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.880]   So you just got to be careful about that.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:13.960]   I'm excited.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:20.160]   El Capitan also brings us version 1.1 of the photos app,
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.360]   which is great.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.760]   And I'm excited because they seem to have listened.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.080]   This is one of those examples where you get that next
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.280]   version and is it stuff that people want or is it stuff
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.240]   that nobody wants, but they're giving us anyway.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:36.800]   And photos 1.1, it's the stuff that everybody was asking
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.320]   for.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.800]   Renee--
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.760]   well, here's a little on the screen we've got my piece
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.120]   about it.
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.000]   I mean, it's got geolocation.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.920]   It's got sorting.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.760]   It's got editing, batch editing of data.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.480]   It's got photos extensions for editing.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:51.680]   It's just--
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.760]   All that stuff enabled yet.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.520]   Because when I did mine, it was beta 1.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.280]   And all that stuff was theoretically there.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.840]   But you couldn't actually edit the fields yet.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.080]   So in the public beta, you can batch edit titles.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.720]   You can batch edit locations.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.120]   And individually edit titles in locations, of course.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.880]   You can sort.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.960]   Apple says you're going to be able to sort by date, title,
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.120]   and other things.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.840]   In the current beta, you can sort by date,
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.240]   forward or backward, and by title.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.240]   And there are no other things at this point.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.760]   And there are no photo extensions yet, photo editing
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.480]   extensions so far as I can tell.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.400]   Well, developers have to write those and submit them
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.880]   as LCAPi10 apps, which they can't do yet.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.680]   So we have to wait on October for that.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.180]   Yeah.
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.120]   And my understanding is it's using the same extension system
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.000]   more or less as the one that's in iOS, which is cool,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.480]   because they should be able to use those extensions
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.320]   in both places.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:37.840]   But it's not--
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.520]   The only really cool thing is I think for OS 10,
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.800]   they're going to be allowed to write actual headless apps.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.640]   In iOS, you still have to have an appy app,
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.160]   and then the extensions come with it.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.520]   And you kind of get in a little bit of trouble
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.760]   if your app does nothing besides the extensions.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.880]   But in OS 10, they clearly say you can have an app with filters,
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.760]   for example, and just a downloadable filters extension,
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.440]   which is cool for people who don't want
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.280]   to have to worry about a useless app just cluttering up
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:58.920]   their system.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:02.600]   Do you know if extensions can only come from the app store,
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.080]   or can they come from third parties?
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.920]   Do they have to be provided by the app store?
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.240]   That's actually a really interesting question,
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:13.080]   because I figured you could hack the process.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.040]   I don't know if that would get you very far.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.680]   I'm sure the app store is going to be the best way
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:21.080]   to get it, because it's designed to deliver apps that way.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.760]   There's a lot of really smart hackers out there, Jason.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.280]   Scary.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.600]   I know there are a lot of people that think,
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.800]   I have to admit that if an app is under $50,
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.360]   unless it does something magical-- and I mean magical,
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.280]   like unicorn--
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.240]   I won't buy it if it's not on the Mac app store.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.840]   I don't want to manage it.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.880]   Just as a note, I won't even touch it,
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.680]   because I deal with this.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.600]   I update my computer, and what's great is that I just go--
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.960]   I get a new operating system, and I just reinstall everything,
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.480]   and I don't have to think about it.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.480]   And it's just not worth sorting.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.040]   I mean, if it's magical, there's a couple magical apps
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.240]   that I have that I bought and put on,
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.800]   because they do something that you can't do inside the sandbox.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.600]   But otherwise, when people have goofy little apps,
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.560]   that there's 10 of them in the app store.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.200]   Even if there's a better-- it really has to be a lot better
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.080]   for me to go, I'm going to manage that install again,
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:11.760]   somewhere else.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.640]   Yeah, and the ones that tend to be broken during a beta
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.440]   are the ones that are doing something weird and magical,
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.720]   like super duper and default folders to examples.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.440]   They're doing it outside of the constraints
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.120]   of the operating system, and apples made a change,
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.200]   and now they have to--
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.560]   And super duper is actually one of those magical apps, though.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.360]   So I think a lot of them, a lot of people
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.280]   are trying to work around that, and I just don't--
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.920]   I think it's also just a trust issue for me now.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:39.280]   I just don't want to have something in my system.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.920]   Renee, you were going to say?
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.760]   Yeah, I was just going to make a crack about Core Audio
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.520]   and Foundation.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.040]   It seems to break every page.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   Speaking of things--
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:47.960]   Go ahead.
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.560]   I was going to say the only thing that I'm still missing
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.480]   from photos is open an external editor,
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.200]   but I'm getting to the point where I haven't done it
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.480]   in so long now that I'm missing it less and less.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.760]   Yeah, you kind of get over thinking that way,
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.000]   that you're going to process it elsewhere.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   If you're in photos, you're going to be in all the way.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.320]   I wanted to mention, like Snow Leopard and Mountain Lion,
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.480]   this is El Capitan, for those who don't know,
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.640]   who aren't native Californians, Northern Californians,
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.120]   like I am, is a rock feature.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:17.120]   It's a giant granite wall in Yosemite National Park.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.400]   So this is like Snow Leopard and Mountain Lion.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:23.000]   This is sort of the subversion of a previous version
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   of the operating system.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.760]   It's intended to be a lot of focus on speed and stability
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.600]   with some new features, but not necessarily
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.920]   the cascade of new features we saw last year.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.240]   And one of the places where we're seeing that is Metal,
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.360]   which is the new technology, graphics technology
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.680]   that they rolled out in iOS eight last year
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.280]   that's coming in El Capitan.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.760]   And the thing that really encourages me about Metal
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.720]   is that, in the tech industry, they have this term dogfooding,
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.160]   which is that you use it yourself.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.280]   You eat your own dogfood is what the metaphor is,
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.480]   which is not the tastiest metaphor, I'll admit.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.480]   But that's the idea.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.440]   And some key OS 10 technologies use Metal.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:04.280]   Core animation and core graphics in El Capitan use Metal.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.480]   And that's good because it means the Metal's
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:09.280]   going to be solid because Apple relies on it.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.000]   And they can walk down the hallway to the Metal Guys
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.680]   and say, why doesn't this work?
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.520]   And that's good.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.800]   But it's also good because any app that
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.320]   uses these key foundational frameworks,
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.840]   like core animation and core graphics,
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:26.120]   will just get the speed boost that Metal provides when people
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.120]   go to El Capitan.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.080]   So that's how I think Apple can make some of these speed
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.320]   claims that are pretty dramatic.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.200]   They've got varying 50% here, four times as fast here,
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.520]   two times as fast here.
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:36.960]   But--
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.520]   The draw calls, Jason, all the draw calls.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.280]   But it's very exciting to see that.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.400]   They've got lots of little graphics on their website
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.680]   showing those 4X and 2X kind of things.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.200]   So I'm encouraged by that too, the Metal stuff.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.240]   The really important thing for me here is exactly what you said
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.040]   is the dogfooding.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.280]   And we can look back at the short history of iOS as an example.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.840]   When you have things like Game Center,
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.240]   and Apple has no products using it,
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.160]   and then more and brick comes out with Letterpress
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.440]   and just knocks it on its butt out of the gate.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.560]   Or iCloud data syncing originally.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.600]   Apple, I think, trailers app was the only thing that used it.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.200]   And developers had nothing but problems.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.640]   And then since last year, maybe the year before,
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.480]   Apple started building on their own technologies.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.040]   Like CloudKit and PhotoKit is what
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.320]   powers all the new photo and cloud stuff.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.800]   And like you said, Metals Web Powers, Core Graphics,
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.360]   and Core Animation.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.000]   And when the company is deeply invested,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.040]   and when you have their own engineers filing radars
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:27.200]   against it, and like I said, walking down the hallway
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.000]   and yelling, you get better products for everybody.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.360]   And I hope this is not just coincidental,
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:35.480]   but is it absolutely a sign of how they're going to be rolling out
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:39.160]   these really core, really important products going forward.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.680]   Yeah, I've heard from some game developers,
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.560]   two who are very excited.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.520]   One, because they develop games on the Mac,
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:48.640]   and it's going to be Metal and all of these additions
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.640]   to El Capitan are going to make their lives better.
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.720]   It's going to make it faster to do their development,
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.320]   to wait for things to run on the Mac.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.440]   But also since Metal is underlying iOS,
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.880]   it means that some stuff--
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.840]   it's going to be a lot easier to take a game on iOS
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.680]   and bring it to the Mac.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:05.840]   And although Mac gaming is not a particularly huge market,
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.560]   one way to have a better selection of games on the Mac
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.360]   is to leverage the strength of games on iOS.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.840]   So I think that's a good story too.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.280]   And I think there's a lot of glue apps.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.720]   So the big apps take a long time to kind of absorb
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.040]   a lot of those things, big visual effects apps.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.280]   But I think that there's lots of little apps that we use
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.520]   that I think are going to be much easier to write,
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.520]   and much more powerful.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.280]   And Adobe has said that they're going to talk about big apps,
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.120]   the creative cloud apps, and move them all to Metal.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.040]   And we'll see those benefits at some point.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.920]   But they'll be short-term benefits
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.240]   just from everybody inheriting the new stuff
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.720]   in core animation and core graphics.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.640]   And it's also an interesting peek into how Apple's
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.440]   trying to get better performance out of all their hardware,
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.560]   that they don't have control over the CPUs on all their Mac stuff,
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.800]   at least not yet.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.440]   And so the ability to simply say,
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.720]   if we can create a new infrastructure or a new system
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.160]   that will make everything faster just by virtue
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.840]   of the fact that you're coding more efficiently
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.400]   or you're using this resource that we're giving you.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.520]   That's really primed to give you the most direct access
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.400]   to the screen.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.640]   That's a way so that they don't get caught wishing
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.160]   that they could ship faster Macs,
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.960]   but Intel is now a generation behind,
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.680]   and they're not shipping on time.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.000]   And it also opens the door towards, if we can speculate,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.440]   the idea of Apple one day shipping an ARM-based MacBook.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.320]   These are all things that, it's like preparing
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.160]   an indie race car.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.400]   It's not that you do this one thing that makes the car
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.120]   50% faster, you find a half a percent here,
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.000]   you find 1.1% there before you know it,
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.600]   you're adding up to some real, real mileage.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.560]   - Well, and I think that one of the things that,
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:36.200]   for most hardware, and this is not just Mac hardware,
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.440]   PC hardware, but microwave, it's all kinds of other things,
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:43.600]   surfacing the what it can do to the user
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.480]   and making it actually usable,
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.560]   creates incredible benefits in value
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.440]   without a lot of expense.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:53.480]   So finding ways to make that a lot easier is a big deal.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.360]   - The way Apple explain metal to me is that OpenGL
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:01.360]   is based on what, it's not an idea of what processors were,
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.240]   it's what processors were, graphics processors were,
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.920]   15, 20 years ago.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.800]   And every, and graphics processors have come a long way,
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.640]   they're insanely powerful, and that growth has happened
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.000]   insanely quickly.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.520]   And the problem is that, at least as it's explained to me,
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.040]   and I'm not a chip expert, but what
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.080]   Apple's take on this is that with metal,
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.480]   they were able to base the model on what those chips
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.800]   are like today and how they work today.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:31.800]   And because of that, they've lost a lot of the overhead
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:36.800]   of translating OpenGL for modern processors is thrown out.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.560]   And instead, you just are closer to the metal,
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:43.120]   hence the name, but that's something that as a platform owner,
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.160]   Apple gets to do that.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.880]   And that's the strength, it is non-standard,
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:47.840]   it's an Apple only thing.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.960]   And I think the wedge that they're using is iOS
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.280]   because iOS people want to be on it,
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.680]   and they're going to adopt metal.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:57.160]   But it's also a cool idea to think that Apple gets to look
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.200]   at something like OpenGL and say, yeah, it's nice and all,
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.200]   but we think we could do something that has better results
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.400]   based on what we know about graphics technology today.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.960]   And so that's what we see.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.760]   So it's a cool story.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:13.120]   And I can't verify it, I am not a chip engineer
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.520]   or a graphics programmer.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.600]   - There's a couple cool things there too,
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.800]   is that they didn't just use OpenGL with the new version
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.480]   this year, they got OpenGL in there as well,
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.840]   so that's the general computing stuff,
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:24.360]   so that non-games that still require intense processing
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.080]   benefit, not quite for free, but the same way you mentioned,
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.520]   it just built in there.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.200]   And some people really upset, they're saying,
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.120]   there's open source technology like Vulkan
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:33.800]   and things like that, they can do this.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.320]   But I think we've seen with OpenGL that you sort of get
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.440]   lowest common denominator stuff that way as well.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:41.160]   It's not specifically tuned for any experience.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.760]   And because there's so many game engines now like Epic,
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.840]   Unreal or all these different engines,
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.200]   they can do the heavy lifting of sort of intermediating
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.200]   that and presenting an environment to developers.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.600]   And they can toss out Vulkan, they can toss out DirectX,
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.320]   they can toss out Metal and it is work for them.
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.720]   But for the game developers, it just means that they get
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.280]   best of breed on every platform.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.360]   And as people who are used to gaming on the Mac,
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.880]   we've seen the results of cross-compilers
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:08.360]   and things like Cider and companies that just try
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.600]   to port the stuff over.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.880]   And if this encourages people to make better,
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.760]   more native games, then I think it's a huge win,
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:17.480]   even if it is proprietary, at the very lowest levels
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.440]   of the platform.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.800]   OpenCL is something that is hilarious.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.920]   It's really that somebody realized there was so much
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:26.120]   processing power in the graphics processors
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.760]   and you don't always need to process graphics stuff.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:31.600]   So what if we hijacked all that power and just use it
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.240]   for other sorts of calculations?
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.600]   It's crazy and that is in Metal.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.560]   So yeah, that's good stuff.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.840]   We should probably take another break because I hear
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.440]   the spirit of Leo Laport beckoning me,
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.720]   but there's much more to talk about on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.120]   After this, Leo, where are you?
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:47.960]   - Thank you, Jason.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.360]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:52.440]   I don't have to tell you much about Squarespace.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.520]   They've been with us since almost the beginning.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.600]   I feel like we're kind of linked together,
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:57.440]   arm and arm.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.640]   We love Squarespace.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.240]   It makes it easy for anyone to create
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.240]   a beautiful professional looking site,
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.420]   whether it's a personal website or if you're doing e-commerce,
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.480]   maybe you're a band or a restaurant.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.720]   They have templates.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:14.360]   The musical templates are incredible for bands.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:18.080]   They let you sell merch, CDs, digital downloads.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:23.080]   They let you put your concert schedule up so easy.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:26.840]   You get your fan club president to do it, right?
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:27.920]   I want you to check it out.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.920]   It's easy to go to squarespace.com
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.040]   and click the Get Started button.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.360]   No credit card needed.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.600]   You've got two weeks.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.200]   You can play with the templates.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.280]   You can examine how the commerce works.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.720]   By the way, every single template comes with commerce.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.760]   Every single plan comes with commerce.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.200]   They're all mobile responsive,
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.680]   so that means they look great on any size screen.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.520]   We found out on our website
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.920]   that more than half of our visitors
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.880]   were coming in on a mobile and tablet.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.680]   You've got to make sure your site looks great
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:53.920]   on all size screens.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:57.240]   Squarespace does that with no effort on your part.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.960]   I love Squarespace.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.240]   By the way, it's the best hosting too.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.160]   It just never goes down.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.780]   Best hosting, best software.
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:08.440]   e-commerce in every site.
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:11.120]   If you sign up for the business or commerce plan,
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.240]   you're gonna get $100 in AdWords credit.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.640]   That's nice.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.840]   And we're gonna get you 10% off on any plan
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.800]   when you use the offer code Macbreak.
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.200]   But before you do any of that,
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:26.120]   get started, just try it out squarespace.com.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.160]   And when you decide to buy,
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:29.880]   use the offer code Macbreak to get 10% off
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.400]   and let 'em know you saw it on Macbreak weekly.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.200]   Thank you, Squarespace.
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.680]   Squarespace, build it beautiful.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:40.600]   Now back we go to Jason Snell and the Macbreak team.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.080]   Beautifully done, Leo.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:46.200]   Before we, well, we're gonna move away from Beta's now.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.960]   We're gonna go into final candidate,
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:50.440]   perhaps Golden Master, perhaps even get released.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.440]   I wanted to talk about something
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.080]   that came out of Beta in the last week.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.800]   That's Office 2016 for Mac.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.400]   Microsoft announced late last week
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.680]   that Office 2016 for Mac is out.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.320]   The previous version was Office 2011.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.080]   So yes, this is a five year wait for Mac users
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.120]   who are using Office.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.080]   Waiting for Beta, oh wait, no.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.360]   Yeah, yeah, or maybe not waiting on.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:15.360]   Well, if you're somebody who is a Mac user in an office
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:18.200]   that is completely dominated by Microsoft Office,
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.080]   you've been using Office 2011 and that's not fun.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.880]   So 2016 is out.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.360]   It's pretty good, I have to say.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:28.760]   It looks very much like the iOS versions
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.120]   and like the Windows versions.
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.880]   There are some options that you can make it look
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:34.960]   a little more Mac-like and a little less Mac-like.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:38.120]   You know, I've been trying it out and I have to say,
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:39.600]   I do think they did a very good job,
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:44.240]   but it is funny how my view of Microsoft Office has changed.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.200]   I used to work in an office where I had to use it
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.320]   and now I don't.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:50.560]   And so I think of it now as it's nice that it's there,
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.320]   but I realize that for some people,
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:55.520]   this is, you know, it's what they rely on every day
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.120]   and it's a big deal that it's here.
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.560]   It's just, it used to be sort of like the air we breathed
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:02.160]   and now it's more just kind of an optional thing.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.760]   Andy Renee, Alex, any thoughts about the coming
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.960]   of a new version of Office for the Mac?
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:07.800]   - I'd probably ask it.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.720]   It's certainly important, Office will never not be important
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.320]   for any platform that wants to be taken seriously
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:15.560]   because it really, I keep coming back to the phrase
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:18.800]   that this is, Office is the grease for the gears of business,
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.400]   all the world wide.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.600]   So I think that everyone has the same attitude
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:24.440]   as you do, Jason.
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:27.200]   It's like the company car that you get issued,
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:30.680]   that nobody loves driving the fleet quality,
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:34.000]   like Toyota Corolla, but it's a good car, it's reliable,
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.720]   they know how to work it, they know that there's not,
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:38.080]   they know how to get the radio stations working
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.040]   and if you've trained up on Office,
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.960]   you are now trained up on every piece of software
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.520]   you ever need to know, no matter what job you ever take.
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:47.040]   So that's why it's important that the Mac version of Office
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.800]   have parity with whatever's shipping on Windows
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.400]   and the Windows 10 environment is gonna be
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.960]   pretty big in itself.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:59.080]   - For us, I mean, I don't have any in the Office
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:55:59.920]   in the Office anymore.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:02.800]   We pretty much use Google Docs and then Pages.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.880]   Pages for the stuff that we want to look pretty
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:06.640]   and then Google Office for pretty much everything.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.680]   I mean, Google Docs for pretty much everything else
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.320]   just because we need to collaborate.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.400]   You know, we don't, you know, so,
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.520]   and I'm sure that it does it, it's just that
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:15.680]   they do it well enough.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:19.640]   The only thing we occasionally use is PowerPoint
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.000]   because someone has a PowerPoint they want to play
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.840]   and so we have to, you know, bring in that into keynote.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.800]   Sometimes it's laborious.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.400]   - Renee, you an Office user at all?
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.400]   - No, so I'm more like the rest of mobile nations uses
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.680]   Google Docs, which means that our Windows site writes
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.920]   and word and pastes it in and I write and BB edit
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.560]   and paste it in.
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.480]   And, you know, if I have to, I'll use Google Sheets
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.360]   'cause it's really, you can't really paste stuff
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.720]   too comfortably into those things.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:49.160]   I used to use Word, I worked in Enterprise for years.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:51.000]   I used Office, I used Office on the Mac,
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.560]   I used Office inside of Parallels or a VMware
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:56.160]   when it felt like it was lagging too much
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:59.840]   to do a proper job or proper compatibility.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.960]   And I am so happy I don't have to do it to that anymore.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.240]   I know, like Andy said, it does feel like it'll always be here.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.760]   I choose to have like the Marcos Syracuse of you
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:09.600]   where on an infinite timescale,
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.800]   maybe we'll have better solutions.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:15.480]   The thing with me with Office is that it has too many masters,
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.200]   like Word, for example, it's not InDesign,
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.920]   but it's not text edit.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:21.600]   And that causes a lot of tension within the app.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:25.640]   PowerPoint and Excel are more focused,
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:29.640]   but I'm happy I no longer have to run them on my Mac.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.280]   I think, you know, the ability to be free
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.880]   from those things is highly liberating.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.400]   - And I think that Word, there's sometimes when I miss Word,
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:40.160]   I think that unless I don't do heavy numbers,
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.720]   like big, big spreadsheets,
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:45.240]   and so because of that, I think numbers is a thousand times
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:48.240]   better than Excel or Google sheets or whatever,
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:50.360]   just because it's so flexible and I can do so many things
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:51.920]   with it that we get used to doing that.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.240]   And it's hard to go back.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.760]   And keynote, of course, is in the presentation world
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:56.560]   is kind of the standard.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.160]   I mean, everyone just converts everything to keynote.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.120]   The client gives them PowerPoint
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:02.560]   and they figure out how to cobble it in a keynote
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:05.040]   and then they give them a little switcher in there,
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.840]   you know, a little pickle and done.
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:08.520]   - I think what we've learned here is that we're all
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:10.480]   very fortunate because we're not people who are forced
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.560]   to use Office, but I know there are so many people out there
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.160]   who they got to use Office.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.680]   And as a Mac user, you have to explain,
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:19.040]   well, I'm using 2011, it doesn't have any features
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.120]   and it doesn't work that way.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:22.480]   And it doesn't run any of those things you're sending me.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.840]   And I don't know what you're trying to get me to do.
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.080]   And that's the nice thing about this
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:28.680]   is it feels like a full peer.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.360]   - I would say it's the first time in a long time
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.800]   that Office for Mac has felt like it's actually playing
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.720]   the same game as Office for Windows.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.960]   And Microsoft is committed to quarterly updates
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:40.360]   that will not just be bug fixes, but include new features
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.480]   going forward because they're in this Office 365 model now.
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.400]   Now, you will be able to buy a standalone version
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:48.200]   of Office this fall in September, I think Microsoft said,
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:51.440]   but if you've got a subscription to Office 365,
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:54.440]   you can get it now and there will be updates.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.000]   So, you know, I like Excel.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   Excel is good, I use numbers for making charts,
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.320]   but I use Excel or Google Sheets,
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.000]   but if I need to crunch a lot of numbers,
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.160]   I will often go and Excel.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.400]   I like it a lot, I just have stopped writing your tables.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:09.880]   - Yeah, I do, the only times I voluntarily use Word
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.680]   are when I need to format something, a document
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:14.320]   that's really, really tightly formatted
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:17.080]   and be absolutely assured that when I send it to somebody,
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.400]   they'll be able to make edits and send it back
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:20.560]   with those edits in tech.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:23.840]   I mean, there should be like a,
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:28.240]   like a sinking wizard that just simply understands it.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:30.400]   Okay, so what did you write this in, Scrivener?
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.880]   Don't worry, click this button.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.160]   I will turn it into a properly formatted Word document
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.080]   'cause no, I can't think of many people
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.680]   who actually edit in Word.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:39.800]   But the historically funny thing though,
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:42.160]   is that as you said, you get it with,
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.400]   as part of your Office 365 subscription
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.840]   and there are many Windows,
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:51.280]   Windows 8.1 based tablets that cost like less than $100
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:54.120]   that come with a free year of Office 365
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:56.560]   that you can then apply to any two mobile,
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.800]   any two, it comes with like a free,
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.280]   it includes a license for mobile
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.920]   and a license for desktop.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.720]   So you can like go to micro center,
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:06.920]   spend $70 on a win book TW 700.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.240]   It comes with like the card that here's your registration
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.240]   for Office 365, forget about the win book
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.360]   and you apply one license to your iPad
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.720]   and one license to your MacBook
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.360]   and it's good for an entire year.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.640]   So get this free, like not really good,
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:24.000]   but great for free Kindle reader or movie player
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.400]   when you buy your Office 365 subscription
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.640]   through micro center.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:31.880]   - I will say that PowerPoint is a lot better on the Mac now.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.440]   That was the app in my mind that had the greatest gap
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:39.120]   between the iWork apps and Microsoft Office was,
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.400]   keynote is so good, you could argue,
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.880]   I would argue actually is the best of the iWork apps
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:47.080]   and PowerPoint was the worst of the Office apps
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.720]   in my estimation and PowerPoint 2016 for Mac
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.280]   is a lot better so much so that you could open it
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.880]   and say, hey, it feels a little bit like keynote,
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.320]   it's not keynote but it's not awful
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.520]   like PowerPoint 2011 was 'cause I use that.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.000]   That was when my bosses would send me
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.880]   these PowerPoint presentations and they'd say, Jason,
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.360]   you need to put in your slides
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.920]   and I would look at it and think,
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.480]   okay, this isn't keynote, this isn't keynote.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.480]   And keynote trained me so much
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:14.200]   that I was completely baffled by PowerPoint.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.720]   And so it's good.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.040]   - And sometimes I think it's the aesthetic,
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.680]   is the people who use keynote versus people who use,
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.640]   'cause there's this thing about like,
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.200]   let's not put a whole novel on one page,
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.720]   that occurs on PowerPoint documents more often.
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.760]   I think in keynote you just think about it,
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.480]   I don't know, I think it's, you watch a lot of,
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.720]   if you're using keynote, you're using,
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.360]   you're watching a lot of Apple presentations
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.520]   and you get used to, okay, we're not gonna beat people
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:40.000]   into the ground with text on there.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.680]   - You never get inspired by PowerPoint.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.280]   Like I still remember a time when I was doing
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.960]   my final edits, I was in Philadelphia, I think,
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.200]   to give a keynote presentation.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.720]   And I was like, my final revision of my slide deck.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.800]   And then it suddenly occurred,
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:58.440]   I hit upon two slides where I had like a sort of an underscore
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.480]   separating the title from like a bullet point sort of thing.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.480]   And I'd accidentally misformatted one of them
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:08.120]   so that the bar was in one place with one slide
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.880]   and then another place and another slide.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.920]   And unfortunately I'd used like a magic move transition,
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.440]   but it said, oh, well, you have a line here.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.720]   What if we just like animate this moving down between slides?
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.240]   And then there I am now losing like another 90 minutes
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.280]   of sleep because that's a cool effect.
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.680]   What if that line is on every single slide,
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.520]   but it keeps moving like up and down,
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.360]   like to accent different points?
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.720]   And if I were doing PowerPoint,
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:33.040]   A, the slide deck would not have been quite so visually
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.800]   interesting and I would have gotten another 90 minutes
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.720]   of sleep the night before my keynote.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.520]   - I think this would be the last keynote thing,
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:43.160]   but I did a spec for one of our clients.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.120]   I was gonna do the whole and all the animations in that motion
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.080]   mostly I was gonna do all this stuff and the stuff
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.080]   lying around it, but I just did this real quick
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.720]   two and a half minutes in keynote
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.800]   and had things animated and rolling around
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.000]   and doing all the little things in keynote.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.640]   And I wanted to show him what I was going to do in motion.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.480]   And so I showed it to him and he said,
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.320]   well, this is great.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.240]   And then can you just send us the video?
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.720]   And I was like, there's more.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.200]   And he's like, no, no, no, we don't need any more.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.640]   That's quite okay.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.920]   You know, so it was, you know, I was amazed at how much,
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:11.280]   how close you could get to, you know,
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.960]   to a final video, you know, with a silly presentation machine.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.480]   - We should shift gears.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.320]   I am looking in a Wall Street Journal report
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.920]   that says Apple recorded 92% of the total operating income
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.400]   from the world's eight top smartphone makers
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.640]   in the first quarter up from 65% a year earlier.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:34.320]   Now, there are estimates and of shipping units
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.600]   and there is market share and there's profit share.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.400]   And I sometimes think we all get a little too caught up in it,
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:42.120]   but it is still kind of mind-boggling to think
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.600]   that according to this report,
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.880]   92% of the profits being made by smartphone makers
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.040]   are being scooped up by Apple.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.440]   It's like a made up number.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.480]   - According to their analytics,
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.120]   I'm never sure how well people specify exactly
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.440]   what the analytics are based on.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.720]   So it's always, it always behooves you to click through
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.880]   and see what company and what methodologies they use
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.760]   and how well accepted they are.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:04.040]   But I think there's a couple of things to pull from this.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.360]   One is like you said, they're sell through and sell in
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.200]   and channel stuffing and all these different things
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.080]   that measure sort of quantity of uses sold,
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.960]   I'm sorry, devices sold and market share
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.360]   and profit share is really different.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.440]   It's how much money that they're making
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.480]   and Apple's proven again with the Mac
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.560]   that they can have a very small market share
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.400]   and make huge amounts of profit compared to the industry.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.440]   And this is the same, Android has by far
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.000]   the biggest market share, but Apple is crushing,
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.720]   there's no other word for it, it's crushing the profit share.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.040]   And what's interesting is about a year or so ago,
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.920]   Apple had 65% of profit in the mobile industry.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.080]   And that's because Apple has 0% share
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.200]   in over four inch sized phones.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:44.000]   They didn't make any and Samsung had the Galaxy series,
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   the Galaxy S series, the Galaxy Note series,
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.400]   all bigger than four inches.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.160]   And that's where Samsung, who was really
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.000]   the only other profitable company,
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.320]   was getting their money from.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.680]   So the minute Apple started making bigger phones,
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.480]   they were gonna take some part of that share,
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:00.160]   whether it was 1%, 5%, 100%, that was up for debate.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:03.000]   And now we're seeing that it's actually quite a lot of that.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.800]   And it sort of goes to the sort of the crux
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.680]   of the Apple, Samsung, dilemma.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.280]   And that Samsung has always been really good
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.080]   at making money when Apple didn't do something.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.840]   Like when Apple wasn't on Verizon,
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.400]   Samsung became the not iPhone that you could get on Verizon.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.280]   And then Apple eventually went to Verizon
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.600]   and that balanced out.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.760]   And Apple ended up for a while
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:22.000]   selling most of the phones on Verizon.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.280]   And now we saw that some people really wanted,
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.720]   they really wanted a bigger screen phone
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.160]   and they just couldn't get one from Apple.
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.720]   So they got a not iPhone from Samsung
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.000]   on some other platform.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.040]   And now they can get a bigger screen iPhone
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.160]   and they're choosing to do that.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.960]   And that's incredibly good news for Apple.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.000]   It sort of speaks to the trends
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.680]   and where people wanna get their phones.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:43.000]   And there's a lot of really good points to be made
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.160]   about Apple not serving the lower end budget market,
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.040]   absolutely.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.800]   But just in terms of share
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:50.680]   of the premium smartphone sector in general,
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.640]   it's really hard for me to see where competitors go from now.
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:57.320]   And I desperately want like all the HTCs and Motorola's
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.160]   to make a lot of money
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.160]   'cause I want a ton of different options.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:03.000]   But I think the strategy of being not iPhone is gone now.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.920]   You just can't make that your business.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.800]   And I hope that sort of generates interest
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.920]   in these companies to make something truly different
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.760]   and try to make people want their phone
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.920]   rather than not using it as an alternative
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.920]   until Apple enters a market.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.560]   - Well, Renee and I talked about this on
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.600]   this week in Tech on Sunday night.
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.840]   And every time this sort of topic comes up,
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:21.920]   I mean, you're right, Jason.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:24.720]   It's like, it's a high number and it's a really good number,
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:29.160]   but it's a lot, it's an inside baseball sort of thing.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.160]   And a lot of people who are just like,
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.600]   rah, rah, rah, Apple supporters like to point to it
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.080]   as a reason why Apple's running their business
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.040]   so much better than everybody else.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.440]   And there are a lot of good arguments behind it.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.160]   It's always necessary to point out though
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.080]   that Apple is not,
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.480]   Apple is really, really interested
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:50.480]   in always pursuing markets
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:53.040]   where there are gonna be high, high, high, high margins.
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:57.240]   That's why they're making a $10,000 solid gold gadget watch,
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.640]   but they're not making a phone
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.200]   that people in Pakistan and India can afford.
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.560]   They're not making a notebook
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:06.680]   that anybody who has less than $900 can come in and buy.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:10.120]   So it's, they're also, you also look at,
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.960]   we're not talking about the laptop,
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.400]   the Mac OS business, but it's part of that same larger point
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.640]   where Apple makes a huge amount of profits in laptops,
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:22.360]   but they also have a segment of the market
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.240]   that's only twice the percentage
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.520]   of the Windows phone segment of the phone market.
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.520]   Meanwhile, other companies have to be able
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.600]   to serve the needs of people who, again,
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.240]   don't have $900 or $650 to spend on a phone.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:37.680]   I'm not capable of really analyzing
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.560]   where the new money comes from,
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:42.640]   whether Samsung and HTC are in the business
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.520]   of making not phones.
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:49.040]   I would say, however, that they do very, very well
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.800]   at selling things to people who want them.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.680]   The fact that Android, for instance,
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:56.440]   is so much larger market than the iPhone
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.440]   indicates that they're people who are admiring
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.840]   iPhones from a distance, but they simply can't afford to own one.
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.600]   So I would, again, it's a good number.
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:08.280]   The good takeaway for actual users is that
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.520]   with all this money coming in, it allows Apple
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.280]   to do a lot of research to fully develop products
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.480]   that they never even leak to the newspapers
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.240]   if they're so out there.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.880]   But let's also point out that Apple
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:24.120]   has never demonstrated an ability to create a single phone
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.720]   or a single computer that could, again,
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.880]   be the gears of the world, be the grease of the world.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.120]   They're very good at figuring out,
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.120]   here's where the money is.
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.560]   We're going to sell things to people
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:34.440]   who have lots of money.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:36.000]   So there's an upside, there's a downside.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.160]   - And I think that one of the challenges
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.800]   for some of the Android makers is that one of the things
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.280]   that they've seen in China and a couple of,
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:42.640]   and I don't know where the article is,
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.760]   but they were talking about the fact
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.760]   that a lot of people, as their income goes up,
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.280]   they're not sticking with the same operating system
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.120]   that they had.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.440]   They have Android phones when they get started
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.840]   and they just go buy iPhones.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.440]   That's kind of like part of their graduation from,
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.800]   and it is a bit of a status symbol in a lot of these countries.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.440]   And so I think that you would think
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.880]   that those Android manufacturers
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.160]   would be benefiting from early users using theirs first,
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.320]   but sometimes that shift is something
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:10.960]   that a lot of them are kind of moving on
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.960]   from that operating system.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.480]   And so that's going to be a real challenge
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:16.080]   as it continues to expand.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.680]   - It's funny, you get used to hearing
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.280]   Mabel put in context of market share,
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.720]   and then there's this profit share number,
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:23.720]   which is very different.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:26.400]   It says, yeah, I mean, I don't think it is the final answer,
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.320]   and I think some people will make it out to be that,
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:31.920]   but I think it's very interesting that this is the case,
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:35.160]   that Apple, it shows you what Apple's targeting here,
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:37.440]   which is the most profitable segments of the market,
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.600]   and it does very well in those segments.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.560]   And the flip side is that there are other companies
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.840]   that are shipping a whole lot of phones,
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:46.240]   but their margins are a lot tighter,
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:48.040]   and that means they're not making as much profit.
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:51.320]   It's good news for Apple and for people who like Apple,
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.280]   but I think it also is just descriptive
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.480]   of how Apple runs its business right now,
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.840]   versus how some other competitors
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.840]   are running their business.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.200]   - And it's not entirely an Apple thing,
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.600]   and it's happened throughout history.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.840]   Like if you look, some companies,
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.320]   if you have something that is unique,
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.040]   like Apple's differentiator is iOS,
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.760]   but if you're one of eight Android vendors
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.280]   who are making Android phones,
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.320]   sometimes you choose to differentiate based on price,
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.240]   and then you lower prices,
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.520]   and we saw this in netbooks and in PCs for years,
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.880]   and you start to compete on price,
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.720]   and there's no loyalty to brand based on price.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.240]   Your loyalty is to the price point.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.120]   So some people will buy Apple because it's Apple,
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.040]   but if you're always,
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.480]   if you're trying to get the people who will be buying
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.560]   based on lowest price,
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.520]   if your competitor slashes their prices further,
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.000]   people will just go and buy that,
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.200]   and it's not sustainable.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.600]   Like all the people who dumped VHS equipment,
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.400]   now you hardly see them anymore.
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:38.000]   They've become brands that are rebaught and resold by Walmart,
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.160]   and the same thing happened with a lot of computer companies,
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.560]   and with phone companies,
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.840]   I understand why they want to make cheap phones.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.640]   I think there is a noble reason to make it,
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.680]   but some of them also just want market share
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:50.040]   and cut prices to non-sustainable levels,
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.720]   and then you see businesses where,
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.200]   like Nokia and HTC,
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.400]   I want these to be hugely successful companies,
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.840]   and I hope they find ways of being that,
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.320]   but just being the budget company,
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.280]   I think also has a lot of drawbacks.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.360]   Yeah, and it shouldn't be inferred that
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.280]   HTC or Samsung or any of the other companies
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.400]   are doing things, so they have this altruistic sense of,
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:13.760]   we are going to make sure that the potato farmer
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:14.880]   in a country in Africa,
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:18.200]   in a little bit, in a poor village inside an African country,
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.280]   can make sure that he has access to the internet and phones.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:24.120]   They are trying to build a business that they can succeed at.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:27.560]   It's not always a drive toward the bottom.
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.600]   Sometimes there's a drive towards
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:33.800]   not trying to make the $79 Windows tablet,
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.240]   but saying, "Well, what if we were to make a computer for $600?"
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:41.080]   There are superb Windows laptops, they sell for $600.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.520]   There are phones that sell for $299 and you own it,
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.240]   and if you were to look at the specs, benchmark it,
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:48.520]   look at how good the camera works,
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.520]   look at the features of it, look at the build quality,
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:52.960]   look at how it's styled, you would not guess,
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:56.440]   this is a $299 and you own it phone,
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:59.400]   you would think that it is not necessarily an iPhone 6,
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.680]   but something that is at least up there,
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:04.920]   if you put like a $20 fancy leather back on it,
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.400]   maybe you would look like an iPhone 6.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.520]   So I'm glad that their companies are pursuing
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:12.200]   all kinds of different price points
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:13.880]   and all kinds of different designs,
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.920]   and also making the point that you don't necessarily need
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.440]   a $700 phone, whether it's an iPhone 6,
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:24.200]   or a Samsung Galaxy S6, which is also again a luxury brand phone.
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:26.680]   What I love about the diversity is that showing people
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:31.000]   that maybe it's okay to have a $1,500 budget for computers
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.160]   that you can spread out across three medium price devices,
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.600]   like a medium price tablet, a medium price notebook,
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.720]   and even an Internet of Things device,
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.640]   instead of having to roll the dice on one thing
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:45.640]   that we're so much of the feature set is the chamfer angle
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.640]   on the aluminum on the edge of the screen.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.400]   And I think that one of the things that would change this
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:52.200]   completely is if Android had a much more,
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.640]   a much less fragmented market,
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.480]   because it doesn't give it the same strength that it would have.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.440]   If there was a unified, if everyone upgraded to Lollipop,
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.840]   if 80% upgraded to Lollipop or whatever,
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:07.480]   you would have a much greater force in the industry,
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.000]   but because it is so fragmented,
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.200]   I think that because of the various cell phone manufacturers
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:14.200]   don't want to upgrade or don't want to provide certain things,
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.800]   or don't want to go down certain paths.
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:20.200]   I think that it does, Android loses a lot of the advantages
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.920]   that it would have as a share leader,
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:24.200]   because it's not really a share leader,
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.320]   because all those operating systems
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.480]   are tiny little percentages that are split among,
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.080]   I don't know how many at this point.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.800]   Well, this is an interesting conversation,
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.360]   although if you just tuned in, it is an Android weekly,
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:35.480]   it is Mac Break Weekly.
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:37.240]   We're going to move on and talk about something
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.280]   from across the pond.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.200]   Gor Blimey, that's not an English accent.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.640]   Gor Blimey, Govna!
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:47.400]   Apple Pay launched in the UK 250,000 stores,
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.200]   eight different banks participating nine months
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.200]   after its release in the US.
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:55.080]   So you can go to your chemist, go to boots,
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.160]   go do some shopping at Waitrose,
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:03.160]   and you can board the tube all using Apple Pay.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.040]   Renee, you're practically English because you're in Canada.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.000]   What do you think?
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.280]   Well, first, I didn't know where Mike Hurley came from
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:10.840]   for a second.
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:13.240]   I thought he replaced you as host there for just a moment,
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.320]   but I think it was so perfect.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.440]   Yeah, we have the same queen,
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.440]   but unfortunately, we don't have the same access to Apple Pay.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.000]   I think it's terrific that Apple Pay is broadening,
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:21.960]   started off in the US.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:22.680]   It's now in the UK.
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.120]   The UK launched with more support than the US originally had.
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:28.840]   It was interesting to see everyone with their Apple watches
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.800]   on their right wrist trying to go through the tube
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.600]   because apparently watches go on the different side of the road
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.880]   in the UK, at least in Apple marketing material.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:39.720]   But yeah, I think this is great.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:42.680]   I'm hopeful that we get it in Canada soon
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:44.760]   because we have the same sort of infrastructure.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.120]   Europe has the same infrastructure.
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.920]   A lot of the-- I don't know what you call it,
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.480]   it's the ocean Pacific countries, Australia, New Zealand.
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:54.120]   I have a lot of the same infrastructure that is NFC-based.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.360]   Transactions.
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.840]   The only thing that I think will help make a difference
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.160]   in the US and elsewhere is that they're going to support
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:06.520]   loyalty cards, in other words, for rewards cards,
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.680]   starting with iOS 9.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.120]   Because one of the problems Apple has,
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.640]   just in general, is that they don't like to share a lot of data.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.880]   And that upsets companies who make a lot of money
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:17.560]   or just provide a lot of intelligence
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.960]   from getting demographic information and other data
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.760]   from transactions and from customer interactions.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.640]   But with loyalty cards and reward cards,
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:26.840]   you're sort of sidestepping that.
[01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.200]   You don't need the transaction anymore
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.360]   because the customer specifically sought out
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.680]   your reward card and is willing to trade
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.360]   that information for whatever points or incentives you give them.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.600]   And I think the companies that are hesitant
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.280]   to join in with Apple Pay,
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:42.600]   because they don't get the same sort of transactional data,
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:46.440]   they would get with other sorts of payment systems.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:49.080]   Hopefully that will break down their last resistance
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.440]   and it'll just be everywhere soon.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.680]   Yeah, last time I was in London,
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:58.040]   everybody is using chipped cards on the tube.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:59.800]   You can actually just tap your credit card.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.600]   It's smart enough, it's not just a transaction,
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.000]   it's monitoring when you enter an egg to the tube
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.400]   and it figures out what your rate is going to be
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.520]   and then it charges your card.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.480]   That is very intelligent.
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.120]   Since they built that infrastructure out,
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:14.040]   they're able to apply it to Apple Pay as well.
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:17.080]   I know my friends in England are very excited that they've got this.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.400]   And Scotland and Wales too, sorry, I don't know.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.440]   It's Magic East.
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.400]   I don't want to leave anybody out.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.400]   I've already angered so many people,
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.160]   including everybody in Montreal,
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.920]   because it is a French city,
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.760]   but they still have an English queen.
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:32.040]   It's not me, I didn't do it.
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:33.000]   It's just how it is.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.440]   We, before I create more international incidents,
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.480]   I think maybe we should take a break and hear from the master
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.120]   who never has created an international incident in his life,
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:43.960]   although he might be creating one right now,
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.880]   Leo Laport with our next sponsor.
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.680]   Thanks Jason.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.000]   One more little bit I want to talk about
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.080]   before we get back to the Apple news
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.320]   and that's a brand new sponsor for us.
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:55.880]   It's a little complicated for me to explain,
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:58.600]   but I think you're going to get this and I think you're going to like it.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.960]   It's called Wealth Front.
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:04.440]   And it's a low cost automated investment service.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:10.280]   They're using software to do things remarkable, basically.
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.720]   I want you to try it out.
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:15.320]   If you're going to an investment advisor,
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:18.680]   you're letting somebody else do your long-term investing.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:21.560]   That's for a house or for your retirement.
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:27.960]   You're probably paying that advisor between one to two to three percent in fees,
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:30.520]   not to mention the transaction fees, the charges.
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.520]   Wealth Front is point, what is it?
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:38.040]   It's one quarter of one percent a year, 0.25 of a percent per year.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.160]   It's 25 basis points.
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:40.840]   Nobody does it for that.
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:41.960]   It's incredible.
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:45.000]   And that means there's no commission, there's no hidden fees.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.560]   If you had a $30,000 account with Wealth Front, less than five bucks a month,
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:55.480]   and they do an amazing job, they're going to auto balance everything.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:59.720]   They do some things that are super sophisticated you really couldn't do by yourself.
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:04.200]   Things like tax lost harvesting and they do direct indexing.
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:07.400]   They're going to optimize your after tax returns,
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:12.440]   lowering your tax bill and giving you the highest possible return on your investments.
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:18.920]   No wonder they've got over $2.4 billion in client assets.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.960]   The company itself in the last two years, they're not very old.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:22.840]   They've grown.
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:25.880]   Their investment fund has grown 20 times.
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.720]   Wealth Front.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.400]   I want you to learn more.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:32.600]   You can actually go right now to wealthfront.com/macbreak.

[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:43.240]   You'll answer some questions about your risk tolerance, your time frame, that kind of thing.
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:45.480]   This is so much better than a traditional advisor.
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:50.920]   Even if you yourself trade for your own account or your day trader,
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.760]   I think you're going to want to check out Wealth Front.
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:59.640]   And put in some money because if you right now sign up at wealthfront.com/macbreak,
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:03.880]   they're going to manage your first $15,000 free of charge.
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:07.320]   No basis points, free of charge.
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:09.160]   And that's not just for a year or so.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:09.720]   That's forever.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:14.920]   For compliance purposes, I have to tell you, Wealth Front Incorporated is an SEC registered
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:16.120]   investment advisor.
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:19.880]   Broke Ridge services are offered through Wealth Front Broke Ridge Corporation.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.920]   Member FINRA and SIPC.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:26.200]   This is not a solicitation to buy or sell securities.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:30.520]   Investing in securities involves risks and there is the possibility of losing money.
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:33.560]   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:36.920]   Please visit wealthfront.com to read their full disclosure.
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:41.000]   I wish I could do this silly SEC.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:49.080]   SEC regulations don't allow a company like Wealth Front to do testimonials from customers.
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:55.080]   So I was going to sign up and they said you can't because then you would be a customer and this
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.840]   would be a testimonial from a customer.
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.880]   So this is the first time ever we've had an advertiser.
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.680]   I wish they would stop.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:04.280]   So I could use the product.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.160]   Hey, you can use it.
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:11.560]   Wealthfront.com/macbreak your first $15,000 fee free forever.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:15.880]   This is, I'm not just find out about this.
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:16.840]   You're going to be blown away.
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.760]   Wealthfront.com/
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:19.720]   Macbreak.
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:24.440]   Now back to Mr. Snell and his gang of four.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:29.480]   Well, I'm glad we have actually four of us on the show today or that would have been awkward.
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.040]   It's awkward.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.040]   My invisible friend also here.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:34.840]   So I wanted to talk a little bit about Flash.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.520]   I hate to say that this is the point in last segment, but it may be a little bit.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:44.600]   Alex Stamos, who is the recently appointed CSO Chief Security Officer at Facebook,
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:49.720]   went on Twitter the other day and basically said Adobe needs to kill Flash.
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:53.960]   They need to literally announce a day and say on this day everybody's going to agree.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.240]   We're going to turn off Flash.
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:21:01.160]   Flash is going to go away because that's the only way that as Mr. Stamos put it,
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:06.200]   only way to disentangle the dependencies and upgrade the whole ecosystem at once.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.760]   Now famously iOS never shipped with Flash.
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:13.240]   Steve Jobs wrote his thoughts about Flash and we've had this world where Flash's
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:15.400]   importance on the web has faded away.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.080]   Well, not only its importance, but its detriment.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:22.440]   I mean, it is the zero-day exploit are becoming really problematic.
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:27.720]   I mean, we have a lot of our clients that won't let us put to use any Flash for what we do,
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:28.680]   which is very difficult.
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:31.720]   And that's why this is the CSO of Facebook saying Flash is a problem.
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.240]   It's a security problem.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:37.800]   And the whole web doesn't rely on it, but there are still a lot of things on the web that rely on it.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:42.760]   And I think it's an interesting point where such an influential group as Facebook,
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:47.560]   saying, "Look, we just got to stop this because the security implications are way too great."
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:49.640]   It's the open window on the house of the internet, Jason.
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.480]   That's scary.
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:52.440]   It really is.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:56.600]   I know a lot of people who use Chrome as their dedicated Flash browser,
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:00.760]   they may use Safari with Flash not installed on their Mac, but they use Chrome when they need
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.680]   to load something in Flash on the desktop.
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:06.600]   And the scary thing about these security stories is, you know, some of them are
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:11.560]   some of the security breaches, my understanding, are problematic enough that you kind of just
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:17.240]   don't want to run Flash anywhere ever because you really open yourself up to a lot of risk.
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:22.200]   The hard part is, and that is needed, you know, in places like live streaming, which is what we do
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:25.720]   a lot of, taking Flash out of that mix is very complicated.
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:30.200]   You know, it is not, you know, Dash and a lot of the other solutions are not mature yet.
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:35.640]   So a deadline would definitely help accelerate that process because people are kind of just slowly
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:39.560]   moving along and using the other ones as backups and not really hoping to get away with not
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.160]   having to make change.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.600]   We know we have to get there and we're kind of getting there, but if there was a day that, like,
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:47.800]   my stream will no longer work, there would be an acceleration in development.
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.280]   At the end of 2016, mid 2017, even.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:55.720]   The hard thing with a lot of this is that like Alex's point, Flash exists because it solved a
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:59.800]   really bad problem. The Internet just did not have functionality and Flash managed to provide it
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:04.200]   and did a lot of things that made the Internet much better. And to this day, Don Milton was just
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:08.280]   talking about this. A lot of the streaming media apps, like if you subscribe to Spotify,
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:12.280]   and I think a couple of the others, their app is a wrapper around Flash because there's all sorts
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:17.320]   of file system access and things that Flash just makes super easy. And that's also the detrimental
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:21.800]   part of Flash is that it makes all this access super easy. It's basically a runtime.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:27.560]   And we don't, we have solutions for like HTML5 video, but we don't have really good solutions
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:31.720]   for all the other stuff yet. And, you know, there's a lot of web standards that have been proposed,
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:37.640]   but Flash started this wonderful little frame-based animation thing and it's just budging into an
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:41.720]   underpinning of the Internet and removing it is non-trivial, but it's gotten to the point where,
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:47.880]   like Jason said, I haven't had Flash installed in Safari since Apple stopped installing Flash.
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:52.520]   On Safari, I had it in Chrome, and now I'm reticent to even launch it in Chrome. And I wish I could
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:57.480]   unbundle it there. And just making a drop-down date, I think we need to really make sure that
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:01.320]   the technologies are there and that all the companies that are using Flash, I remember some
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.720]   companies just use Flash to have an open-in dialogue on the web so you could upload files.
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:09.400]   And all that stuff still has to work. So I don't know how easy it's going to be.
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:12.680]   It is, but it is that this, because it is that one thing that works everywhere. I mean,
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:17.000]   I think that that's the whole thing. You know, there's a lot of, you know, other technologies
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.400]   that are being used. And they work on this browser, but not that browser and this thing over here,
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:25.080]   but not that thing. Flash is the fallback that has the fallback that kind of works on every day.
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:28.840]   Andy, you were going to say something? Yeah, it's just, it's not just for playing video.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:33.080]   A lot of developers use it because you can build this once and then deploy it on all kinds of
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:36.920]   different systems that happen to it. It's a time saver, but it is a, it's one that
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:41.400]   causes all the problems that we've been talking about. And also it needs to be pointed out that
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:48.600]   when Steve Jobs wrote his letter in April of 2010, he was, in my opinion, he was spreading a lot
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:55.960]   of fear and certainty and doubt. And 2010 was not a good year to get rid of Flash as you could
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:59.720]   remember if you were using an iPad for the first couple of years of his existence. It's like,
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:05.880]   you get to use all the web except for the 20% that has video and other content that will give you a
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:10.600]   beautiful little puzzle piece instead of something else. But that was five years ago. And almost
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:15.800]   everything that can use Flash has decided to use something other than Flash because it's such a
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:22.200]   pig. And it's, it is a good time to finally delete the floppy drive from the iMac, where it's going
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:27.000]   to cause some problems initially. But now there are people who really, people who really need that,
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.920]   they have the ability to, to help their own transition. And it really is a situation where it's,
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:37.240]   we're never going to get rid of it until there's an actual drop dead date until Adobe actually
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:41.880]   pulls the plug on it. But this is certainly a case where I think Apple's decision not to include
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:51.400]   Flash and iOS moved along the, the lack of enthusiasm in all circles for Flash.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:54.520]   And when that, and when it came out, there was a big discussion about whether or not having Flash
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:58.280]   would kill iOS or iOS would kill Flash. Most people thought it would be one or the other.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:01.720]   And it turned, I'm the android back out of Flash too.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:07.960]   It never worked. Flash on mobile was like one of the biggest lies perpetrated on, on consumers
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:12.040]   because Adobe would just say Apple wouldn't let us have Flash on the iPhone and Apple was painted
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:16.840]   as a villain. And in truth, Adobe could not ship Flash for mobile. And I had it on my palm
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:22.120]   pre-winned eventually shipped and on my BB-10 and on my Android device. And it was, it took years
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:28.120]   to get out and the version they got out was horrible. So I understand Andy's point about Steve Jobs's
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:33.480]   letter, but I think it was 100% accurate. And I think we can't kill Flash fast enough. We just
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:37.640]   have to make sure that everyone else who is supporting these technologies gets off it in time too.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:42.760]   I just remember the first of a mobile device I had that had Flash support built in was the
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:47.560]   Blackberry playbook. And it was the only thing, it was the only good thing I can write about it,
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:53.560]   which is that, wow, I can actually watch CBS.com content. And unlike this, this is where my opinion
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:57.960]   on Steve Jobs's letter was really formulated because he was saying, oh, it's going to kill the battery,
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:03.320]   not really. I mean, it's certainly faster than not running Flash content. It's going to be
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:08.120]   bugging unstable. No, it's running fine. It's going to be a frame rate that makes it unwatchable.
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:15.560]   No, it's pretty much as good as Flash on the desktop. And when other content was available on
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:21.400]   other devices, the same stuff proved to be true. It was still a platform that needed to die that
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:27.480]   was on its way out back in 2010 or 2011. I was talking to some people I know at a couple of
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:32.360]   different TV shows who was responsible for creating, for creating video content for network sites.
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:35.400]   And they were saying, well, we already have a roadmap because we can't get rid of Flash fast
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:41.000]   enough. So it's, I think that Flash needed to stay around for a few years while all these big,
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.840]   big bruisers figured out a way to adopt better standards. But again, my own opinion is that
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:53.400]   the Steve Jobs letter was mostly fear and certainty and doubt. He was making claims that did not
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:58.120]   prove true when I had Flash on a mobile device, not just like three generations or four generations
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:04.520]   and I'm talking about the first device I got that had Flash on it, had none of the disadvantages
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:08.440]   that Steve Jobs was talking about. That was weighted. That was a few years after.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:12.680]   That we still need Flash. I'm just saying that in 2010, 2011, it was just not true.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:17.560]   Well, that's years after Adobe said that Apple wouldn't let him do it. So the timeline was very
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:22.920]   different. Well, Flash is fading from prominence. And I think the most telling thing about this,
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:29.240]   this story about the Facebook CSO saying Flash should go away is that there didn't seem to be a
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:34.680]   whole lot of hubbub about it. And it wouldn't surprise me if at some point Adobe does announce
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:39.720]   their... Surely Adobe has seen the writing on the wall for a lot of this about putting in maintenance
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:46.440]   mode and saying that Flash support is going to go away at some point. That doesn't seem unreasonable.
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:50.360]   And there was a time when that seemed impossible for Adobe to say that. But Adobe's business has
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:54.520]   moved on. Adobe put all its eggs in that basket for a while. They're on the web. They bought
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:29:02.200]   Macromedia and they took Shockwave and they built Flash. And that was their web strategy and their
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:08.520]   web authoring strategy for ages. But it's really not anymore. That company has changed dramatically.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:17.400]   So I think that Flash's days, certainly prominence are at an end. And perhaps it's days
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:24.600]   altogether as well. We should move on to less controversial topics like if Pluto is a planet or
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:30.280]   not. It's definitely a planet. It's totally not a planet. It would definitely kill you if it
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:35.720]   fell on you. That's planet enough for me. It's a minor planet. But regardless of what Pluto is,
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:41.800]   it's neat. We should say it is not a robot. Well, we don't know. What we now know is definitely
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:45.720]   not a robot. Pluto, we should just say this. This is not macro-related at all, but it's cool.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:53.400]   This is the day that the New Horizons spacecraft flew past Pluto. We don't actually know if it's
[01:29:53.400 --> 01:30:01.320]   survived as we record this because it is so busy taking pictures. It was moving so fast that it
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:05.880]   had to spend all of its time during its flyby taking pictures and not communicating with Earth.
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:12.040]   So it will be a few hours. Oh, very nice. We've got a picture of Mickey's friend,
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:18.760]   Pluto. And once you see it, you can't unsee it. You cannot unsee it. Some people say it looks
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:23.800]   like a heart. And it's maybe even a little Pluto's got a little heart and it's got little hands
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:28.920]   hugging the heart there. But it is the best pictures by far that we've ever had of Pluto.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:35.080]   And hopefully later today, as we record this on Tuesday the 14th, we'll hear the all clear from
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:39.400]   New Horizons. I wanted to mention some tech things about this just because I think they're cool.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:45.720]   New Horizons runs on a 12 megahertz MIPS processor. It was launched into space before there was an
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:55.400]   iPhone. It transmits about 1000, what is it, 1000 K per second back to Earth from 4 billion miles
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:31:02.600]   away. So it's a very slow modem connection. And it takes four and a half hours for a signal to
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:08.680]   reach Earth from the vicinity of Pluto where New Horizons is. Fortunately, all of its instruments
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:14.120]   were working today, assuming it didn't get hit by space debris. It saved all of that data to
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:19.320]   its SSDs, essentially. It's flash storage. It's got solid solid state memory that it stores
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:24.840]   everything in. And over the next not day, not week, not month, but almost the next year,
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:31.320]   it will slowly trickle back all of its science data. So this is entirely a story about delayed
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:37.320]   gratification. But they have NASA is one to understand the PR value of what it does.
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:39.640]   It's a year of releases. That's what that is.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:46.600]   It may also take 10,000 different images that it took in the last couple of hours,
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:51.960]   but they know which one is going to be the most spectacular. And that's the one that's going to
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:58.120]   uplink immediately. So you're saying that 2015 is the tick release next year will be the talk release
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:03.560]   of data. They just released the color data, the color images a few minutes ago.
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:08.440]   Yeah, just because you fly by it in a couple of hours doesn't mean you've got a year's worth,
[01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:13.480]   you don't have a year's worth of news. We definitely do that. But just think about the old technology
[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:17.080]   people. Think about the old tech that's in there in the slow connection and they have to cash
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:22.200]   everything because they don't have enough time to get it back right away. But still with all the
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:27.240]   old tech that they've got, and it's actually from a platform built in the 90s and then it got
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:33.240]   canceled and it got revived. So it's very old tech. And yet it is producing pretty spectacular
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:35.800]   images and other science data. So I just think it's a cool story.
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.760]   And just think if you move to Pluto, you would still be able to text message.
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:44.040]   Yeah, the internet out there is the internet out there is very, very slow is what I'm saying.
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:49.160]   But we've proven it's not a battle station. It's not Unicron and it's not some other
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:52.360]   galaxies prison. So we've managed to do three very important things today, Jason.
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:58.520]   Or the Pluto's overlords have managed to convince our spacecraft to come over to their side and
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:02.280]   tell us the lies that serve their interests. Ambassador.
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:04.760]   I'm not saying that's what happened. But that's definitely what happened.
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:09.400]   So I don't want to assume things, but I know at least two of you well enough to know that you are
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:13.640]   nerds and Alex, I'm just going to guess that you are too. Comic Con was last week. Do we have any
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:18.760]   feelings about Comic Con as we're getting toward the end of the show and I, you know, we're nerdy
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:24.920]   people here. We have another hour, Jason. I don't want to debate the DC cinematic universes design
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:30.200]   decisions. But I am curious if you had any favorite news from Comic Con that you wanted to point.
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:33.720]   It's almost like a pick of the week. I love the Star Wars backstream footage. I mean,
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:39.880]   the real sets, real locations, real Chewbacca, real Han Solo. I was really trepidacious about
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:44.680]   Star Wars anything anymore. And I can't say it won me over completely, but I may or may not be
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:48.360]   lining up for the movie already now. The line makes into your house.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:56.680]   Yes. They showed the first finished Batman versus Superman trailer. And I don't want to get ahead
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:02.520]   of the story, but it almost seems as though they heard a lot of the complaints, a lot of the loudest
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.400]   complaints about the this the Men of Steel movie and said, well, what if we made that part of the
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:14.200]   story of this one where there was so much damage that this did not go unnoticed and the reappearance
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:19.880]   of Jesus Christ, the appearance of Jesus Christ on Earth is going to have a natural effect upon
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:24.840]   the population. It really got me excited about this in a way that the announcement of Ben Affleck
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:28.840]   playing Batman did not get me excited about this thing. I had the exact opposite area. This was so
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:34.760]   bleak. It made suicide to go out and look joyful to me. Oh, but it's DC, which means that for my
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:38.920]   personal thing, and we're about to turn this to an episode of the Accompromable, but yes, like to me,
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:45.640]   I've always had this. I seem to have consistent reactions. No Marvel movie has ever made me feel
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:51.080]   a moment of actual emotional connection to any of the people in it. No DC movie has ever made me laugh.
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:55.400]   Yeah, I think that's fair. I think they're both really good at really different things. And when
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:59.160]   they make mistakes, they make mistakes that are consistent with those things that at least I've seen
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:03.800]   about it. Fighting indictment of Green Lantern just slid right under the door. Oh, the Deadpool
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:07.720]   trailer. Oh, God, that was even better. Don't put Ryan Reynolds in superhero movies. Oh, wait,
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:13.480]   they did. They he's a deadpool. Let's make this an hour. Let's go for it. Any other nerd news that
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:17.320]   we need to cover here just because we've got the cameras on slightly on nerd is Jennifer Lawrence
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:21.960]   is still really cool. All right. I saw the excerpts of her. Every time she gets on a panel, you just
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:26.040]   want to see what comes out of her mouth. Yeah, she has no filter and it's a beautiful thing. It's
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:30.360]   so much fun. It just goes off. Off she goes. You know, there she goes. You know, my Comic-Con
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:34.600]   highlight is probably watching Peter Capaldi, who is the current doctor who walking around San
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:38.280]   Diego. He'd never been to Comic-Con before. I think, you know, there's one thing to know that
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:42.920]   your show is an international hit. And there's another thing to go to another country since
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:49.240]   Dr. Who is an English show to go to another country and see a wall of fans at a giant
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:53.960]   convention and people waiting in line overnight to see you on a panel. And he walked around San
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:57.560]   Diego and told some stories about it. And I thought that was adorable. I mean, the panel was
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:01.320]   interesting, I suppose, but I just love the idea that these English actors who have no idea what
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:05.960]   they're getting into when they fly into San Diego and the sun is shining and there are fans everywhere
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:10.600]   and they realize that it's not all just these cold studios and whales where they shoot the show.
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:15.400]   That was my favorite thing from Comic-Con. We should move on to the picks of the week.
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:21.560]   Andy and I code, do you have a pick for us? Yes, I do. I don't know. I don't remember any of us
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:25.480]   on this show making this a pick of the week. I just got this. Amazon just sent me this a few
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:33.960]   weeks ago. It is the Amazon Echo, which I absolutely love. It is essentially their version of Siri.
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:38.600]   Only there is no screen. There is no nothing. There is just an omnidirectional microphone and
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:43.960]   a really good speaker. And it's a great device if you have a pass through between your kitchen
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:47.640]   and your living room, which is where I have it. That means that pretty much anywhere on the first
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:53.000]   floor, I'll be washing dishes and it occurs to me, "Oh, I can be listening to music right now." And I
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:00.120]   will say, "Hey, keyword." Or not even "Hey," just keyword name, play me Abbey Road, side two, and we'll
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:06.440]   start playing it. Or I'll be watching Top Gear and they'll say, "The new Katerum in five weighs only
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:15.240]   503 kilograms." I can say, "Alexa, how much is 503 kilograms and pounds?" And you don't, it's sort
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:19.800]   of like the same sort of stuff that really excited me about getting smartwatches that have voice
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:24.440]   commands built in. You don't recognize how much you're being distracted by any kind of a screen
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:28.040]   until you don't have to do that anymore. And the number of times that I'm in the kitchen and I will
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:33.240]   literally be closing the door to the oven and just simply saying, "Set a timer for 23 minutes," and
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:38.040]   a timer for 23 minutes starts going. Not having to look up from what I'm doing, just simply
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:43.960]   impassing and all this stuff happens. Really, really cool. It's the thing that got, it achieved
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:49.080]   one of its core goals and that it sold me more Amazon products in that I'd never really found a
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:54.600]   need to upload my entire music library to Amazon Cloud Storage until I had the ability to access
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:59.640]   the entire thing just with a voice command. I mean, I got to say that I've got the Sono speakers
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:07.320]   and I can activate it anytime by getting my iPhone out. But it's so much simpler, even just,
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:12.840]   it's almost simply just simply call out, play the marriage of Figaro and just simply,
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:15.800]   it starts happening. I'd much rather hear through this mono thing. So I'm really,
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:20.200]   really happy with it. The review is going to be coming soon. It's $179, which is not a whole lot
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:25.080]   of money for this. The other reason to recommend it today is that tomorrow is the big super
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:31.720]   promotional, hey, Amazon's having this big Black Friday sort of event for Amazon Prime members.
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:37.720]   There is a rumor that this is normally $180 that they're going to discount it to $130 tomorrow.
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:42.840]   At $179, I was thinking of buying one for my own so that I could have one after I have to send
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:49.400]   this back. For $130, I'm almost definitely going to buy one. I'm surprised by how cool it is
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:52.280]   and how much I'm using it. That's my pick of the week.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:56.680]   That's great. I was visiting our mutual friend, Mr. Dan Morin, and he's got one of those. The
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:00.600]   thing that blew me away is not just play this album or this artist, but just say, "Play some jazz."
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:07.800]   It has a lot of intelligence. Also, developers can write apps, so quote-unquote, for it. So it
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:12.120]   has connectivity to home automation. So you can say, you know... Yeah, you turn off the light,
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:15.000]   actually, you can say. Turn off the light, turn off the light, turn off the light, turn off.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:21.160]   And yeah, pretty cool. All right, Alex, what do you have? I've got two things. One is a website
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:24.920]   that I would suggest just checking out. It's called Virtual Photo Walks.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:31.160]   It's a site mostly for folks who have some disabilities and what they do is they take
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:34.520]   photographers and they actually stream it using Google Hangouts and everything else. And we've
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:38.920]   worked with them a little bit in the past. It's just this great... What they do is they experience
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:42.680]   going to different places and they can do it from their house, but you can watch those as well.
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:47.880]   It's just a very, very interesting concept. So definitely check that out. I think it's kind of
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:53.640]   cool. And then one of the other things that we've been doing, of course, a lot of is 360 degree,
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:40:00.680]   you know, spherical production. And one of the things, the first problem you're going to have
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:05.560]   is what cameras to use and how to get them all together. And I've got a lot of GoPros now.
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:09.400]   So I've got lots of... I've got like all these little six camera and seven camera and eight
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:13.560]   camera rigs. But then the next step is trying to stitch them together. And there's a couple
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:18.680]   different pieces of software that stitch these together. And we have used, I think, all of them,
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:23.560]   or very close to all of them. And the one that we found to be the best so far is called
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:29.320]   Kohler. And we're not the only ones because GoPro bought them. So now we're... But we didn't start
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:36.120]   using this, but we've kind of grown to using it. And so anyway, Kohler is a piece of software that
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:40.360]   will take your cameras and you can have lots of different configurations. They don't have to be
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:45.880]   a very specific one. They do sell hardware rigs. I actually don't like their hardware rigs as much
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:50.920]   as some of the other ones. They're nice and small, but I have some heating issues. But with the
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:57.960]   software itself, I think, is really great. And so on a panel video and then there's Gigapan
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:01.800]   that you can use as well. And you get these... There you go. So that's... And of course, if you have
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:10.600]   the spherical... If you have a... I don't know why I'm suddenly blanking out, but innocuous, or
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:15.480]   if you're shooting for cardboard or if you're shooting for any of these other things, you can use
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:20.920]   this software to kind of stitch all those videos back together. And so typically, when you're
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:27.080]   looking at any of these, this is anywhere from two to 16 cameras that are being seamlessly
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:35.880]   stitched back to a continuous video altogether. And so it might actually be the future.
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:41.720]   So anyway, that's the cool software and you can download a demo and play with it. Then you have
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:47.960]   to get a bunch of cameras. Awesome. Renee, what do you have? I have... Oh, look,
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:53.400]   it is in that ultra light right now. It doesn't work unless you hold your jaw slack where you're
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:42:02.600]   using BR. I books author, huh, Renee? I predict. So I'm going to channel Sennedy Caldwell here
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:06.200]   for a second. And I books author was great. It came out and it'll let you make these really
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:12.520]   immersive, really high quality books, except there were two problems. It was iPad only. And
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:17.480]   unless you made it for the iBooks ecosystem, it's greatly reduced to what you could do.
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:22.040]   The new version of iBooks author version 2.3, which has been a long time coming,
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:27.400]   does two really awesome things. First, it adds complete support along with iOS 9 for sure. I'm not
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:32.760]   sure if it's in 8.4, but iOS 9 for sure lets you make iBooks author books for the iPhone as well.
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:36.760]   And that means you can get the same sort of really great, really interactive experience
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:40.760]   that you've been enjoying on your iPad on the iPhone. And that's a big deal for people who
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:44.840]   want to use the software because iBooks author is really good. It's what you see is what you get.
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:49.240]   It makes it much simpler to create these kind of books and other tools. But you have to decide,
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:54.280]   you know, ease of creation versus very limited audience, just iPad users. And now you can hit
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:59.720]   iPhone users as well. But what's more is they've added support for ePub3 and they sort of opened
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:04.920]   up their licensing. So you can just use it not only to make the iBooks files, but to make real
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:11.000]   ePub3 format files that have almost, I mean, somebody could tell you for sure what the exact
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.960]   differences are, but have a huge level of interactivity. I think there's fewer widgets or maybe something
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:19.480]   available. But still, if you don't want to use iBooks, but you want to what you see is what you
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:26.760]   get. eBooks creation tool for the Mac, iBooks author is just pole-volded itself out of maybe
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:32.360]   a niche product into a really good alternative for almost anyone, especially small businesses,
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:37.160]   independent publishers, one person shops. If you've had your heart set on making a really,
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:43.480]   really cool e-book, I would seriously look at iBooks author 2.3. It suddenly become fantastic.
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:48.760]   Yeah, people were a lot upset with Apple about the terms of the original iBooks author license.
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:52.600]   And my understanding is those have changed. So that's good. So you can build things in iBooks
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:56.680]   author and use them elsewhere, which is a. And you can publish now to anything. I mean,
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:03.320]   I think when it started, of course, it was an iPad only. Yeah, I was 8.4, I want to say, or 8.0.4
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:08.360]   allows iPhones to use it, as Renee was saying. So yeah, it's no longer this thing that only works
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:13.000]   on iPads is basically a story. I was so excited to see that. That's just great. That's great.
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.400]   Apple Apple doing good for everybody. It's just great. My pick is not exciting because we already
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:21.080]   talked about it, but I just do I want to give a plug to a young up-and-coming NAC developer
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:25.480]   who's waking some apps that look pretty nice. And they're a little bit of an underdog, but you
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:31.640]   might want to give them a chance. It's Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac. Excel is really nice.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:38.040]   And they have pretty colors now. So check it out because if you need to use Office, you know it.
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:43.720]   And you should go get it because it's good and it's way better than what was there in Office 2011.
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:47.880]   So check it out. And that's all I have to say about Office. It's too bad. It's not a game
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:52.840]   with NAC purchases because they can't make any money off of this, but still you like to see these
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:57.000]   youngsters in their kitchen tables just trying. Yeah, they're giving their note teaching themselves
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.840]   swift and then realizing, you know, this little experimental project, maybe other people would
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:05.560]   want to use it. That's just great. It's spunky. They are they are a spunky team. They're somewhere
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:09.640]   in Seattle area, I think. But I don't know exactly. It's a coffee shop. I'm pretty sure
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:14.440]   that they're working out of. Well, we have reached the end of this Mac break weekly.
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:18.840]   I want to thank all of my panelists for being so gentle with a first time Mac break weekly guest
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:23.320]   host Alex. Thanks for keeping me company here at the table. My pleasure. Renee Richie,
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:28.840]   imore.com and many other places. Thank you so much. I was glad that you could join us today.
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:32.920]   As always. Awesome job, Jason. Thank you so much. Thank you. They haven't thrown me out yet.
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:37.560]   That may happen as soon as we're done. Andy and not co, I have known you for far longer than
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:43.480]   either of us care to admit. It was a pleasure doing this. So so so long that you were the person
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:48.200]   who told me how to use the bold tag in HTML. That's how long we've known each other. Yeah,
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:55.320]   went back when it was B and not strong. So it was a long time ago. We're all we're all people.
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:46:00.200]   We're we're hopefully we'll start to as we enter our fifties, we will get into the respectful
[01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:04.920]   elder sage part of the industry as opposed to the burned out old men who've been
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:09.720]   who've forgotten how to love. Where's my cane? Get off my lawn. I need to waggle something.
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:15.000]   Something something like that. And if you don't know who has been talking to you for the last
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:21.480]   couple of hours, I'm Jason Snell. I write about Apple stuff at six colors.com. I podcast about
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:27.080]   pop culture stuff at the incomparable.com and about tech stuff at relay.fm. So check me out at
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:33.480]   all those various places. And that's it for this edition of Macbreak Weekly. So get back to work.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:42.040]   Break time is over.
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:44.620]   (upbeat music)
[01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:45.620]   .
