[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.360]   Welcome to Mac Break Weekly, the show that talks all about Macintosh.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.280]   Although there hasn't really been much to talk about lately.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.280]   So we'll add we'll throw in iOS.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.120]   Basically it's anything Apple does.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.440]   We will basically obsess about joining me for the first time in ages in studio.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.280]   I'm so glad to have you Mr. Alex Lindsey of Good to be back.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.000]   Who has been traveling around the world.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.760]   Just give us the last three cities you ran them today.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.120]   Chicago, London, D.C., New York, and a bunch of them.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.120]   A lot.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.120]   A lot of them.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.120]   A lot.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.120]   Well, welcome back.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.120]   It's nice to have you.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.120]   We miss you when you're not here.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.120]   I, every Tuesday I'm like, I know something's missing.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.960]   I know I should be talking about Mac.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.000]   Oh, of course Andy and Naco is always here and we love that.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.800]   He's the rock, the consistent, Mr. Consistent.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800]   Exactly.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.120]   It's like Alex, Alex is the clutch performer who like he's a Reggie Jackson.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.320]   Every time he comes up back, home run clears the bases, wins a world series.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.920]   I'm just here to drive in the RBI's game after game and then Cal Ripken like 40 years
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.240]   later they realize, oh wait, I want the perfect attendance medal.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.240]   You should.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.800]   He's now on a 7,843rd Mac break weekly without missing the show.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.520]   Mr. Andy and Naco, the Chicago Sun times and the CWO be also joining us from Google
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520]   Plus.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.520]   He's not at Google.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.400]   He just spends his life on Google Plus.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.720]   Mr. Mike Elgin, Elgin, e-l-g-a-m.com.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.720]   Hey Mike.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.800]   Ah, we figured out how to keep him quiet.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.520]   Your mic is muted, Mike.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.360]   You know, I thought I wasn't hearing anything from Mike.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.120]   The silent Mike Elgin.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.240]   Mike, you could just make, why don't you do sorry, you could be the draw something guy
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.560]   and just draw, you know, do things with your hands.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.520]   It was when he put his headphones on.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.520]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.720]   How about, how about now?
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.320]   Wow, what an ordeal.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.080]   We made him put on headphones, but now Mike, can I just tell you, you sound wonderful.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.880]   My wife likes me better when I'm silent, so you may regret this.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.560]   Actually, we thought it'd be kind of fun.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.560]   We do draw something.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.760]   One, one person on every show will be the draw something guy and you just have to draw
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.320]   your reaction on the screen.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.320]   That's a good idea.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.320]   We need a little centique for that.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.720]   Hey, it may, OMG pop $180 million.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.280]   Wow, wow, that's an amazing story.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.360]   It's always funny until you find out how much money they've made.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.800]   Apparently I read that they were on there like the guy who had $1,700 in the bank.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.560]   If draw something had not taken off, they had already 30, something like 35 apps that
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.440]   just didn't really go anywhere.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.480]   And they had, as any startup does, they have a lot of just ongoing expenses and they were
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.480]   down to their last $1,700.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.440]   And they were ready to pull the plug.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.200]   And then they come up with draw something.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.640]   In six weeks, I don't think there's been an app that's grown this fast ever in history.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.920]   And in six weeks they sold the company to Zinga for $180 million.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.760]   From $1,700 to $180 million in six weeks, ladies and gentlemen, that is why the app
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.320]   economy is transforming America.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.320]   Holy cow.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.800]   All I can say is well played.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.120]   Yes, well played.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.600]   Well played, sir.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   I saw it in infographic and you know, infographics never lie, that the app economy, if you include
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.560]   all the apps, iPhone, Android and everything, has created 466,000 jobs in the US.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.680]   I mean, since 2007, since the iPhone came out, that's a huge transformation.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.280]   Well, and I think that when we're talking about job growth in the United States especially,
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.400]   or all around the world, I mean, I think that a lot of governments are still trying
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.280]   to figure out how to do quote unquote "shove already" projects, you know, and I think that
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.280]   they really need to be thinking about.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   Shove already.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.280]   You know, that's the whole, you know, that's why we just go.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.880]   You know, that's why they added that lane between here and the Vato.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.880]   Right.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.320]   Because it was shovel ready and we could throw a bunch of money into it and hire a bunch
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.320]   of people.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.200]   But that's not, the future is trying to figure out how do we develop more people that can
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.360]   do what we're seeing here.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.320]   Yeah, I mean, presumably some of those 466,000 people were gainfully employed as developers
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.320]   already.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.960]   What's great about them is that it's sort of an entree into the world of software development
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.960]   and entrepreneurship.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.240]   So people in high school or people with limited skills can actually build an app, sometimes
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.800]   succeed, sometimes not, but learn about it and connect with other people and sort of
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.520]   bring them into the world of entrepreneurship.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.200]   And it's that, to me, that's the best part of it.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.280]   There was a story about a guy named Shea Pierce who worked at OMG Pop.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.840]   He was one of the developers.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:16.280]   Apparently the way it worked when Zinga bought OMG Pop, they, and this is often what happens
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.560]   in a, when a company buys another company, essentially everybody's fired.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.960]   And then the new owner offers contracts to everybody saying, okay, now you know, you're
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.400]   terminated with OMG Pop.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.800]   Now you're now you're becoming a Zinga employee.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.720]   And in this contract, according to this column that Shea Pierce wrote on Gama Sutra or Gama
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.920]   Sutra, they said to him, okay, but everything you develop is ours.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:49.880]   We own and you cannot anything that you, even side developments, anything you're doing
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.360]   at home in your own time, you, we own or you have to stop doing it.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.160]   We don't want you competing with us in the marketplace.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.140]   And Shea had written a game for his wife.
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.960]   As an independent contractor was called Connect TroAD, it's on the App Store.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.960]   He said, I designed it on my own.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.080]   I did all the coding in my spare time.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.440]   I contracted the visual and audio work to talented friends here in Austin.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.240]   And I submitted it to the App Store shortly after my employment with OMG Pop began with
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.360]   the company's awareness and permission.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.560]   He says financially, it made me about his money as most spare time indie game projects.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.960]   So not so hot.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.840]   It never broke into the top 10 and never sold millions.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.040]   It wasn't changing anyone's life, but I love it.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.040]   I made it.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.800]   My wife wanted me to make it.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.960]   It's dedicated to my wife.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.840]   The code has a special case so that on her phone, the dedication appears on every launch.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.840]   Now that's true love.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.840]   That's nerd love.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.840]   But you're naming a hard rep after her.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.480]   And for a computer after your daughter, like the Lisa, the Lisa.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.360]   Yeah, after you're a strange daughter.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.920]   You're an acknowledged daughter.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:05.120]   Anyway, Zinga said, no, you either sign this contract as is and take Connect Road off the
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.560]   market or you don't have a job.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.920]   And he said, why am I trying to work at Zinga anyway?
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.440]   I politely declined Zinga and became the only OMG Pop employee to be left behind.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.600]   I don't have a job, but I could sleep soundly at night knowing I'm not working for any
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.320]   employer with whom I strongly disagree.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.320]   He says, I wasn't screwed.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.320]   I had a small amount of equity.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.200]   I received compensation and that was never at stake.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.920]   I'm not bitter.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.960]   But he said, you know, I don't really like Zinga and I don't want to go to work for him.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.600]   He's the only guy who didn't.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.560]   But that's just the story there.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.080]   By the way, he says Zinga paid $210 million.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.520]   So it's some dispute over how much money.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.800]   Nevertheless, anything over $100 million, I think.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   That equates to.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.520]   That's a lot of money.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.400]   But I think kind of like shooting themselves in the foot like Zinga, because if you don't
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.520]   allow your employees to have their own side projects, then you're kind of telling them,
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.840]   please don't think outside of the office, please don't.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   Wait, why there's a squirrel?
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.840]   Watch out.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   There's a squirrel.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.840]   There's a squirrel.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.840]   He's coming over your shoulder.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.840]   What?
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.840]   Doc, can't.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   I mean, to scare the squirrel.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.840]   He's there looking after my interests.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   He's looking after your nuts.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.840]   It's a it's a barter trade.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:25.720]   But yeah, no, I will explain that in a bit, folks.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.760]   Maybe I should change my background to something.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.480]   It's a little distracting squirrel.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.840]   So I don't want to even guess what how you react when the crackles start appearing.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.840]   Oh, well, I saw he saw.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.280]   Oh, did you see that?
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.480]   He just like grabbed it.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.240]   So this is a just as an app and selling.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.240]   It's exciting.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.240]   It's exciting.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.440]   Leo, the port of this weekend technology is raving about.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.440]   I love this app.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.440]   It made me cry.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.720]   Oh, look, he's putting more nuts out.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.720]   So this is the video.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.120]   But for those of you listening, Andy has as always a screen behind him and it's always
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.520]   something of interest.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.520]   Unfortunately, to somebody like me who has absolutely no attention span, it often derails
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.160]   the entire show as it has now.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.320]   This is you have a go cam, right?
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   Yes.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.720]   The brand new version of the GoPro hero to cam hero to that right.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.680]   I took it for its first test run over the weekend in the Boston public garden and because
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:21.720]   I don't skydive nor do I have a skateboard or a motocross bike, I have to basically set
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.800]   it up in trees and take videos of squirrels.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.800]   I love this.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.800]   Here come the crackles.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.800]   Wow.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.960]   This is really cool.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.960]   So this is not live.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.960]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.960]   This is not live.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.960]   This is live to tape.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.960]   Right.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.960]   So there's no editing.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.960]   There's no editing in the mail.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.420]   If recorded live and verbal live, it's the tape.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.840]   It's an audience of squirrels and gravels.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.760]   That's so cool.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.760]   All right.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   Okay, I'm done.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.760]   I think I.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.840]   All I was saying is that I certainly understand that.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:53.480]   And this crosses across so many industries, especially as big companies have to get used
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.920]   to the fact that it's possible for their employees to make money on their own time
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.680]   with their own skills.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.280]   And it is surprising to see Zinga do something like that because-
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.840]   It's a shame, yeah.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.120]   It's a shame because I can't remember the details, but a year and a half ago, I was
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.000]   speaking to somebody who was involved in that kind of a transaction.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.560]   And I was asking that question because I actually found myself in that situation a
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.160]   few years ago.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.400]   And they're saying, no, we believe that our agreement says that we have a first look
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.760]   at everything that you do, just like kind of like what HP had with Woz.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.000]   So if you develop it, you at least have to bring it to us first so we can make the first
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   offer.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.840]   But if we say no, then you're free to do whatever you want.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.200]   And it was, that was exactly what he was saying to me.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.120]   He feels as though we want to encourage people to have their own lives, to pursue their
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.120]   own side projects.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.960]   And we also hope that if they think that we can be good partners with them, that makes
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.600]   our company more valuable and our company more interesting.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.160]   So that is sort of disappointing to see Zinga demand like that.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:54.360]   And I've worked in production for a long time and those kind of contracts are pretty
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.360]   common.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.760]   I mean, you know, that you can't do anything outside of that in the field that you're in,
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.760]   specifically.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:06.960]   And I've actually, as an owner of a company, have been screwed by employees who took work
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.960]   away.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.960]   So you come down on the Zinga.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:15.120]   So I'm afraid that I don't have our employees sign those contracts, but it is pretty clear
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.960]   in our company that if you cross that, I will take it badly.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.760]   So it's not a legal thing.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.000]   It's more of a, I'll never work with you again.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.740]   The problem is that employees, creative employees are steeped in conversations and meetings
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.720]   and technology and ideas and all that stuff.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.520]   And then that's their sort of knowledge base for going home and creating a competitive product.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:40.920]   It's kind of like when you leave a company, you sign a thing saying you're not going to,
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.640]   you know, talk about anything you saw in your company for the next two years or whatever.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.760]   And it's a real problem because, you know, a lot of employees can just show up to work,
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.360]   clock in, go through the motions and all the while they're working on their own startup,
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.160]   which is actually a competitor to your product.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.960]   So they have to do something like that.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.800]   It's a tough, it's a tough problem.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.920]   I mean, the Google got into the situation where they had so many 20% time products that
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.280]   they had to start slashing and burning everything because it's just too many.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.520]   You can't launch every product that every employee creates.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.120]   Well, you don't have to.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.080]   Google, I presume owns 20% time projects.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.960]   So I mean, sure they don't those, but you really gave the perfect counter example, Andy,
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.680]   yourself, we would have there be no Apple computer if it weren't for WaaS being able
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:31.640]   to do, in fact, use HP parts to build it on HP's, you know, as an HP employee, not an
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.240]   HP's time, but as an HP employee.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:39.200]   I mean, I also wish the things and it is important that you not hire somebody to compete with
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.680]   you in their off time, but there are certainly ways to write such a contract that simply
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.480]   says we don't own 100% of your output as a developer.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.760]   We just say that you can't, you can't do something that will compete with both.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.760]   It might be a little different.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.760]   I got it.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.400]   I'm just saying my own example was about, was some years ago when I was offered a staff
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.080]   position at a newspaper, not the Sun Times, but someplace else.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.440]   And the sticking point was that I couldn't write for anybody else under any circumstance.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.440]   It was 100%.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.760]   And I said, Oh, and I came when the offers on the table, I had to come back and say,
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.080]   okay, but the number that you gave me, you're going to have to add to that because you're
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.240]   buying, I will buy 100% of my stuff.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.240]   You're buying 100% of my stuff.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.240]   Everything that I could ever write, but I don't think you can afford that.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   You have to pay me accordingly.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.240]   That makes sense.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.040]   And it, it, the point is to be made that WaaS was probably very low level when he was
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.640]   doing a side project.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.760]   That's a little different from a developer who's making maybe your primary product and
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.520]   at home is making a competitor to that product.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.520]   I can kind of understand that.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.960]   Also, it's happened to us, you know, Kevin Rose started Ignatian after being on Twitter
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.960]   for a couple of months.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.680]   He said, I could do a better job and started Ignatian.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.200]   It didn't make me happy, but it didn't, it didn't sundur our friendship.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.560]   John C. Devorek after poo pooing podcast for a long time, then doing Twitter for a few
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.640]   months started cranky geeks.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.720]   So it's happened to me a number of times.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.720]   And we encourage, I think, I don't think there's a single host here who doesn't have
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:58.360]   a show of their own, including Andy, who has his show, but Andy to his credit, not who
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.360]   wasn't required, but did offer me the show first before bringing Andy and Aco's journal
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.480]   to Dan at five by five.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.440]   And then some people create shows and then bring them back into Twitter.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:14.560]   Yeah, I mean, to me, I feel like I feel like I'm in a different position perhaps because
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.840]   you have some, Alex, you have some proprietary technology people are learning.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:24.240]   You know, I mean, I just feel like I don't want to keep that title lit on people.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.240]   I want to encourage the creativity.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.200]   And if we lose a little bit, we lose a little bit, I mean, Colleen became a streaming video
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.760]   engineer and then went to Google with what she learned here.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.960]   She was a sociology major.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:40.080]   She was our engineer here became an adept at streaming media and has a great job at Google.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.120]   And it comes back, what goes around comes around.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.120]   I mean, she's paying it forward.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.840]   So I don't have a problem with that.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:50.440]   But I also understand when you, you know, you are giving people proprietary technology
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.040]   that is unique to your company and they're going out in the evenings and saying, yeah,
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.040]   I could build something even better.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.040]   And it's not good.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.480]   And it's really hard when you're one of the things to remember is when you're in one
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.880]   of these companies, it's also, you know, a lot of what you know is based on, I mean,
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.960]   my master's degree, I mean, I was an Easter philosophy major, my master's degree in filmmaking
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.400]   was working at Lucas Omen ILM.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.560]   It's very hard for me to separate the fact that that's where I learned everything about
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.680]   filmmaking, you know, and when you're in that, yeah, I mean, that's how large isn't
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.680]   it.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.120]   But I mean, the thing is, is when you're in that, that, that cauldron of, of all these incredibly
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.480]   smart people, it's, it is hard to separate.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.280]   Where does that really belong to you when you start doing stuff on your own?
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.280]   Right.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.760]   When you're still at the company, you know, that's the, that's the hard thing.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.760]   I do think it is important.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.160]   I mean, I think that for instance, working at ILM and Lucas Film, there were lines that
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.080]   you couldn't cross, but there were definitely a lot of places where we could go and do our
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.080]   own thing.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.600]   Creative people need to have some outlets.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.600]   Photoshop, right.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.080]   Is something that was done really on the side.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.080]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.080]   No, yeah.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.680]   So, so I mean, that's the kind of, you know, so the know, the know brothers were at Lucas
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.040]   when they created photo show was John was Wow.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.880]   And Twitter was a side project.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.880]   And they kept Twitter, didn't they?
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.880]   Although I suppose it could have gone on to be something else.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.200]   Webby made a good point in our chatroom.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.600]   He said, if one feels stifled by one's boss, one should never boss, go start your own company.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.600]   And I think that's the other thing that happens.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.080]   A lot of times people do.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.760]   They get, that's what you did.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.600]   You got inspired by what working at Lucas and you said, I got a lot of, and then you
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.800]   did your own thing.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.480]   And that's how the world gets better.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.920]   So there's a kind of, I think there's, there's two different ways of looking at it, but I
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.200]   don't know if there's a right answer.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.120]   Anyway, that's how they do it at Zinga.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:26.920]   And are you worried that they're going to, I actually deleted OMG Pops, draw something
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.040]   from my, my iPad.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.320]   I felt it was too much of a distraction.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.320]   I had to stop.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.320]   I had to stop.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.800]   When I got, I got the word the rapture and this was inspired to do a seven panel comment
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.800]   exactly about it.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.800]   That's a backdrop, by the way.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.000]   And I was a little bit upset when the person guessed it on panel number three, they didn't
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.480]   see like the whole wrath of God thing going on.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.960]   I did the same thing.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.920]   That's what I realized that perhaps I should, you know, be quiet.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.920]   Maybe stop playing the game.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.800]   But that was such a smart move on these, on these developers because can you really see
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.240]   draw something becoming this, still a big hit three months from now?
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.520]   I really, they sold this thing at the top of the table.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.520]   Perfect.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.520]   I agree.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.520]   I agree.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.280]   I disagreed with the cup, but was it business insider said they left 800 million on the table.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.280]   No, they didn't.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   No, they didn't.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.400]   Well played, sir.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.440]   So top story coming up with just a second.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.760]   That was believe or not, all preliminary.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.760]   That was just us warming up.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.760]   That was the pre show.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.680]   We were just just testing the microphone.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.720]   Just like stretching out a little bit.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.960]   I love Jean-Louis Gesset's Monday note.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.200]   I read it every Monday.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.600]   He's the former Apple president.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:40.440]   He was the president of Apple France and then we came to Apple under scully.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:46.000]   And he was the guy who left Apple to create BOS, was in the running for the next version
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.360]   of the Apple operating system.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.560]   Steve Jobs got the job.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.200]   Gesset to his credit said that Apple made the right choice.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:19:02.280]   But he says that what Apple's doing is the effective equivalent of bloodletting.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:07.200]   And that's how it's going to handle its problem of too much cash.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.240]   It's going to let a little bloodletting go on.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.960]   I think it's a good comparison of the Wall Street investors to leeches.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.920]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.840]   First, let's talk a little bit about trust and go to meeting.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.480]   When you work with somebody, we're just talking in a way about trust.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:30.440]   When you work with somebody, a client or a colleague, a prospective client, a lot of
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.600]   what collaboration is is a matter of building trust between you and your partners, you and
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.680]   your colleagues at work, you and your clients.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.880]   They have to trust you, you have to trust them.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.560]   And one of the things that really hurts this is the fact that we don't anymore work in
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.920]   the same space a lot.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.360]   Their companies are distributed all over the place.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.040]   Clients may be in another country.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.000]   And so how do you build that trust without face-to-face meetings?
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.200]   And that's where go to meeting is really fantastic.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:02.360]   Now I don't mean just the screen sharing because go to meeting has now added HD faces.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:08.040]   And by the way, when they first added it, you had to be using the desktop Mac or PC to
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.040]   do it.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:14.480]   Now you can use the camera on the iPad and have HD faces and be in a meeting and they
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.360]   can see you from the iPad.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.440]   I'm telling you huge.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.520]   This is incredible.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.440]   And it is beautiful quality.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.720]   Really takes advantage of the iPad's camera, the high res screen.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.120]   You do screen share, but you also can talk to each other.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:35.160]   You hear each other and you see each other's body language and faces for training, for
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.000]   sales presentations, for weekly status meetings.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.080]   This is the way to do it.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.480]   Go to meeting.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.480]   You've got to try it.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.800]   The iPad app is free by the way.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.400]   They could charge for this, I think, but they don't.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.400]   So here's the deal.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.720]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   Click the try it free button.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   It's right here.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.240]   It's the orange button right here.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.400]   And use our offer code Mac break so we get credit.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   That would be a nice thing to do.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.440]   You don't have to, but it'd be nice if you did.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:06.400]   And then, because we'll get credit anyway, they know, they know who's responsible.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.240]   And then download it on your iPad and try it on your iPad.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.560]   Works with Windows, works with Mac OS.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.400]   It is, I can tell you all the additional features.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.440]   Secure 128-bit SSL.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.000]   There's never been an exploit.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.320]   There was, you know, you keep hearing exploits with these other solutions.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.840]   The way go to meeting works, it's really secure.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.480]   It also does not require you to open holes in your firewall for the ports, which is also
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.280]   security risk that uses NAT traversal, so it just kind of works.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.280]   I could go on and on.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.720]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.720]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.720]   Have a meeting.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:47.840]   You know, you could actually play, draw something with go to meeting kind of by hand, and you'd
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.360]   see the person, and you'd draw a picture on the screen, and you could watch them guessing.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.360]   You could actually do that.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.360]   It'd be even more better.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.360]   Right?
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.360]   More better.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.480]   Or you could even, you know what you could do?
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.640]   You could play, draw something.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.640]   You go iPad to iPad.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.880]   You could play, draw something, and watch the person's reaction as you drew it.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.120]   That'd be so cool.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.120]   Anyway, give it a try.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.320]   You could think of lots of ways to use this.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.160]   Go to meeting.com, offer code MacBreak.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.480]   We thank them for their support of MacBreak Weekly.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.480]   I like Sean that we guess.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:23.840]   He has a turn, a good with a turn of the phrase, "The treatment for the blood disease called
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.920]   polythemia vera," too many red cells.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:28.920]   Goes back to the dark ages.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:34.440]   Okay, now if you're eating breakfast, you might want to just cover your ears.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.320]   Lance of vein and relieve the patient of a pint of blood.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.600]   Flobotomy treats the symptom, but not the condition.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.600]   There's no known cure.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.000]   The bloodletting must be repeated indefinitely.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.520]   This is what comes to mind.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:50.560]   When I see how Apple intends to treat its polycash, e-me vera, too many greenbacks.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.520]   Apple's going to bleed off $45 billion in excess cash through a combination of dividend
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.880]   payments and through stock repurchase.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.160]   Why get rid of the excess cash?
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.400]   He says, "How dangerous is it and what exactly is excess?"
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:11.060]   I encourage you, it's a long and elaborate post, but he talks about the debate on Wall
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.880]   Street about what to do.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.920]   Is it better to keep this cash?
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.560]   Is it better to get rid of this cash?
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.680]   Is Apple going to, they say, "We'll replace the cash anyway, just in normal operations."
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.560]   It isn't going to even cost us anything.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.480]   It just keeps us from going over $100 billion.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:33.000]   Wall Street's fear is that Apple's going to go nuts and buy every company in the universe
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.240]   and thereby get distracted and waste money and time and energy and all that stuff.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:43.480]   That's a really good thing to be afraid of because Wall Street insider types are among
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:50.680]   the only pundit commentators out there who are a little bit more disciplined and realistic
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.960]   about what acquisitions can give you.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:59.360]   I just wrote a cult of Mac post on Saturday, which is essentially saying what he's saying.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.520]   That is that Apple should buy nothing.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.360]   I rounded up all of these articles that said Apple should buy Twitter, Apple should buy
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:10.000]   Yahoo, Apple should buy Canada's postal service.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   It was just nuts because everybody wants to be Dr. Evil sitting in a lair and spending
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.240]   hundreds of billions, spending all this money.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:29.800]   Me too, I would make ridiculously bad acquisitions if I were the emperor of Apple.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.520]   One of the things that's great about Apple is that they're very disciplined about that.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.240]   They make small acquisitions when they buy the technology or the people.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:43.040]   When you buy a big HP bought compact and an HP bought palm, those were terrible acquisitions,
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.840]   hugely wasteful of money, resources.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:52.000]   HP had 900 people working full time on just the acquisition strategy before they bought
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.880]   compact for six, nine months, something like just an insane waste of time and money.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.040]   They always say, "Well, this is going to give us synergies and all these wonderful benefits
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.560]   and those rarely pan out."
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:06.080]   I think time Warner AOL is another one that was just horrible.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.440]   Well, I don't think Apple has shown any interest in doing any major murders with anyone at
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.440]   any one at any one time.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.440]   No, that shows discipline, I think.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.680]   I don't think they need to, trying to integrate what Apple does to most of these companies
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.480]   will be almost impossible.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.600]   It's like trying to teach a caveman to drive a F1 racer.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.480]   It's like, because the thing is that these companies, what they measure and what they
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.800]   think is important and what they build their infrastructure around is so backwards most
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   of the time.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.440]   There's not really any reason for Apple to do that.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:38.720]   I don't mean that all Apple's approaches are well done, but it's just a much more refined
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.720]   system.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.040]   I don't think there's any reason for them to pick those up.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.160]   I think that one thing that I think is interesting is if I was Apple and I was going to spend
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.160]   money, I would just start buying back all the stock until it was all gone.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.000]   I don't know why they even put up with these guys.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.560]   So the thing is that it starts to take it private.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.560]   Take it private.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.840]   $45 billion a year and in 10 years you own the company and you don't have to, and then
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.600]   there's no more reports, there's no more.
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.600]   There's a lot less of issue.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.240]   I would think that would be a desirable thing.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.240]   You want to get rid of cash.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.680]   Except that you do want stock options, publicly traded stock options to reward employees.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.400]   I think that's the only reason that a company like Apple would want to be public.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.400]   Why?
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.400]   There's other ways they can reward them.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.760]   And the SEC requirements, although we have this new jobs bill that apparently is changing
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.440]   that requirement a little bit, but not enough probably to get Apple out of the requirement
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.800]   to be public.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.120]   It was a 500, if you have 500 investors, you have to go public.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.400]   And I think they've raised that number or about to raise that number to a thousand or
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.400]   more.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.400]   Look at Apple's stock price.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.320]   The stock market likes it.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:38.880]   Record high today of $615.48 is a little bit off that peak.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.880]   Just want to...
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.120]   Yeah, it's going up.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.320]   It's almost eight bucks up today.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.320]   Today.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.840]   Now, one share of Apple stock costs more than a 32 gigabyte.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.640]   That's the new metric.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.560]   We now say how long will it be until we can get a MacBook Air for the price of one share
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.560]   of Apple stock?
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.160]   Not long, I think, at this rate.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.920]   It does make you wonder.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.600]   I've been reading financial reports for the past couple of weeks that keep saying, "Well,
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.360]   if they continue on this tech, they continue making..."
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.240]   It's almost impossible for Apple to bleed off as much money as more money than they're
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.120]   actually taking in.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.840]   I haven't seen a good answer to the question, "Well, what if this is a really good..."
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:26.360]   Apple is truly at a right place, right time, right product sort of situation, where right
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.440]   now they have some of the hottest selling products in the market, but right now they still have
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.600]   the iPad market completely to itself.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.320]   What happens when a year from now, two years from now, other companies finally figure out
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:41.160]   how to make a $400 tablet that actually works extremely well.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.680]   That's why Apple is...
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.760]   The new product is everything.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:52.280]   The new product is iCloud supporting Mac's MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, iPads, phones,
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.280]   everything.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:28:00.040]   Even if Samsung came out with a superior tablet to the iPad, it wouldn't be part of
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.760]   your ecosystem.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:07.040]   If you're like I am, which is you have Apple TV, you have everything, it still wouldn't
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.640]   be better.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.200]   Is iCloud such an intensively good value add?
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.720]   I know you're just making one example.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.200]   That's not the whole argument.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:21.560]   Is Apple ever going to be able to make anything again that is so uniquely the only thing you
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:25.680]   can get that will be as good as anything else that we can be coming out with?
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.600]   Once they come up the tablet, what's next after that?
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.480]   It's the TV going to be that next thing.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.480]   I saw...
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.440]   I've seen that last week was in the first time that I think what you got to say who was talking
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.840]   about a friend of his suggesting that maybe Apple's going to revolutionize cameras next.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.000]   I'm just keep thinking.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.680]   I keep wondering where is the...
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.680]   Are they approaching the ceiling of innovation where there's a limit to how many revolutions
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.000]   they can accomplish in a five-year period?
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Cars.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Cars.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   All right, I'm going to tell you what Apple should do.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   It's very simple.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:55.840]   It's very obvious.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:03.400]   First of all, there is some threat that they'll lose their hegemony in the iPad market, but
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.840]   Apple's very good at coming up with new products.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.800]   They don't put very much of their money into R&D.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:12.800]   In fact, they put a notoriously small amount compared to other similar companies into R&D.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.120]   Put a little more on R&D.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.240]   If I were Apple, I'd want to control my supply chain a little bit better.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.760]   They are, for instance, very dependent on Samsung.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:26.680]   For every single display right now in the iPad, LG's ramping up, Apple should start, I think,
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:30.680]   if from a business point of view, should really start maybe building their own supply
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.120]   chain because they don't control it.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.120]   That is a real risk.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:37.880]   It's why they couldn't make enough iPads in years past.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.880]   That's one.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:44.920]   The other thing that I think Apple probably could spend its money on, let's see, I had
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.880]   two things.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.720]   I would like to see them spend their money on that they won't, is moving manufacture
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.960]   back to the US.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.080]   That could tie into controlling the supply chain.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.160]   We've already seen studies that say it costs 60 bucks more for an iPhone if you made it
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.160]   in the US.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.160]   It's not a huge significant increase.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.760]   I think it would be very good public relations for the company to just say, "You know what,
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:07.760]   you're right.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.560]   We used to make everything in the US.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.000]   American workers are the best workers in the world.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.160]   We want to make the best products in the world.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.320]   We want to make quality.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.040]   We're going to go upstream.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.880]   Everybody else in the tech industry is making them in China, making them in Thailand, making
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.960]   them in Korea, making them in Brazil.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.640]   We're going to move it all here to the US."
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.640]   That's what I'd spend the money on.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:29.440]   It'd be very good for business, I think.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.280]   One thing, Apple and its character doesn't care what other people think.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.440]   Meaning this is not the country they do, really.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:41.160]   Well, I'm saying, well, I think of that as putting on the box how fast your processor
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.160]   is in benchmark.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:47.720]   But they do put design in California and they did that for a reason.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:31:10.620]   The
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:16.460]   company is selling more than they actually manufacture as it is.
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:21.460]   They're not faced with a problem right now where they're saying, "Gosh, how do we be
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.820]   more competitive against other companies?"
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:27.620]   I think that their solution to that is always make sure that you can make them fast.
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:32.140]   Also make sure that you do a really, really compelling, compelling product.
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.940]   They are actually building more factories in the United States of America.
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:40.460]   I don't think that building 100% of a majority of Apple products inside the United States
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:44.220]   would be their priority unless they were absolutely certain that they could do these
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:47.900]   really, really quick prototype turnarounds, these really, really quick turnarounds of
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:52.300]   adjustments in the United States and do them as quickly as they can do them where they're
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.820]   doing it right now in Asia.
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:54.820]   Which will never happen.
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:32:00.060]   I think one of the things you have to remember is that iPhones and other Apple products are
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.700]   actually made all over the place.
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:08.700]   The final assembly takes place in Foxconn factories for the most part.
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.260]   The parts are made everywhere.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.300]   This isn't something that's broken for Apple.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:18.300]   People think, "Oh, those poor Chinese workers, we could really help them by firing them."
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:19.300]   You're right.
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:24.260]   And the chatroom's pointing out that the global market is becoming more and more important
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.620]   at Apple, only about a third of their products are sold in the US.
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:31.940]   So I take it back, but maybe improve conditions for workers around the world.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.500]   Maybe use the money to do that instead.
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:34.500]   How about that?
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:38.780]   I'd rather see $45 billion going into improving conditions at Foxconn.
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:39.780]   I agree.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.780]   You don't want to fire that.
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:41.780]   This is a bad message.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:43.780]   The conditions are bad.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:44.780]   So we're going to fire you all.
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.180]   But also, they deserve better working conditions a lot more than the folks that are going to
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.180]   get the dividend check.
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.180]   I agree.
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.180]   I agree.
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:55.700]   The thing is, the problem that I have with all of this is that if you are, I totally
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.220]   understand the idea of getting dividends if you are a slow growing company.
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:03.620]   If you're growing it 2%, 3%, 5% a year, that's just not what Apple is doing.
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:09.380]   Apple is growing like a small company that's nimble and it's growing by crazy percentages.
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:12.900]   The investors are riding, they're riding that along.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.340]   They don't deserve an extra penny.
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.340]   They don't like it going to invest somewhere else.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:24.260]   When Apple slows down, and they will, eventually Apple will slow down to 3% or 5% a year, then
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.860]   to continue to engage those investors, it is part of the market for them to start applying
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:29.860]   dividends.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:33.300]   That's how you make that meal sweeter.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.900]   But right now, it's not a certain thing.
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.900]   Pressure?
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:37.900]   Steve's not there anymore.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.380]   Yeah, because Steve's in trouble.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.380]   Internal conversations are a big FU.
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.380]   You know, you know the line.
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.980]   He said, "No, I'm not even going to consider it."
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:44.980]   So they're...
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:48.700]   We have to understand that the decision-making process is being made by a whole bunch of
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.860]   people who own a whole lot of stock.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:55.740]   So this is, to a very large extent, it's like, let's pay ourselves a lot of money.
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:56.900]   They're the biggest stockholders.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:57.900]   Right.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:58.900]   I didn't even think of that.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.740]   That's like, you know, 'cause Ilean shares.
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.620]   And what this means for you, you know, quarterly, you get this huge check.
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:09.020]   If you have a million shares of Apple stock, which a great many of Apple executives do,
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:13.140]   you just gave yourself a $2.65 million raise every year.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.140]   Not Chevy.
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.140]   That's it.
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:16.140]   You could buy a decent boat with that.
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:18.700]   And Apple will have the same amount of money left at the end of the year because they're
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:19.700]   going to keep on making money.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:23.260]   And I mean, because when we look at the growth of these, we're still looking at the penetration
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.260]   of the iPhone is what?
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.980]   2%, 3% of the total phone market.
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:31.940]   I don't know when someone is going to compete with the iPad.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.220]   It'd be great to have a competition with the iPad.
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:38.940]   I keep on trying new devices.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.620]   But I think that they're going to continue to grow that market.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.940]   And I think they're just going to keep on chewing up the computer market.
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.620]   And I think that they can keep on moving into those markets, using them to leverage it.
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.580]   This is what people worry about when they talk about antitrust is, of course, they're
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.980]   going to keep on using one market to leverage themselves into the next one.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.820]   Well, it's kind of the same market, actually.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:59.500]   I think that the next big, big thing is going to be desktop iPads, essentially, that are
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.900]   as powerful as the iMac or more.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:07.500]   And just a gigantic touchscreen on your desk at a drafting table angle.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.500]   And I think that's an absolute certainty that's going to happen.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:15.380]   And that's going to be a difficult transition to get people who are hooked on their mice
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:20.740]   and physical keyboards to virtual keyboards and never again use a mouse.
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:24.820]   That's going to be a hard transition, but it's going to be a very profitable one.
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:28.780]   Apple is absolutely going to dominate it completely.
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.980]   I mean, Microsoft has had Surface for several years and they just can't seem to turn it
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.220]   into a consumer product.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.940]   It's going to be another iPad-like bloodbath when they do that.
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:43.420]   I think you've kind of answered the question for me about what should Apple do with the
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.420]   surplus.
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:49.420]   And for me, it's, I hope that they use that money to take a bath on a product that the
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:51.420]   world isn't quite ready for yet.
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:59.180]   Because if you get the idea of a 24-inch Surface computer, I'm not quite sure that people
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:04.180]   are ready to really grasp that right now as a replacement for a desktop.
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:09.780]   However, the reason why people would actually turn to these is if they wouldn't buy the
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:14.340]   first generation, they wouldn't buy the second generation, they'd start looking at the third
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:19.980]   generation where fans like us, fans of new things, not necessarily fans of Apple, have
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.220]   started to understand exactly how this is different.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.180]   We stopped thinking about it as a giant iPad.
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.820]   We stopped thinking of it as a virtual keyboard.
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.980]   We start thinking about it as a whole new thing.
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:31.860]   If they can sell enough, if they can really take a bath on this product year after year
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:37.380]   after year and not have to be in the CEO carousel and say, "Well, unfortunately, the
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:41.660]   company has to answer, well, how come you guys put X billions of dollars in this product?
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:47.380]   You've sold exactly 500 million tablets or 500 million dollars for the product.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.780]   You have to go because you have to start killing these unprofitable products."
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:54.660]   Apple's probably one of the few companies right now that can simply say, "No, we've
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.660]   got that thermometer of...
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.580]   We've got this hourglass of money."
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:02.060]   As soon as we release this, we turn the hourglass over.
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:05.860]   When the last dollar rolls through the top of the glass and drops in the bottom, then
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:06.980]   we'll consider canceling it.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.820]   But we have a good three or four years in which we make this a successful product.
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:14.460]   I think the hard part for Apple is that right now they have a lot of people like us to some
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:18.300]   degree that will buy almost everything once because when you buy it, it's going to be
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.940]   great and it's going to work and it's going to...
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:25.140]   I don't think that they want to experiment too much down the path that would get people
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.340]   to not do that knee jerk.
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.700]   I've never touched it, but I'm going to go stand in line and buy it, that type of thing.
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.940]   Oh, by the way, this was pointed out in the chat room and I just checked on it.
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:37.380]   Tim Cook, just as a note, is not receiving any dividends on his unvested chairs.
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.020]   Oh, because he's unvested.
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.020]   They're unvested, but I mean, it's...
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.020]   But that's the most...
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.020]   He's got a few of them.
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:45.380]   So the shank members and a lot of these folks have stock options, not necessarily.
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.380]   They haven't necessarily covered...
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:49.420]   Of course you don't get dividends on stock options because you haven't bought the stock
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.420]   yet, but when you talk about...
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.420]   But here's not shares.
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.220]   They probably have a few shares.
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:55.620]   Oh, they have a few shares, but it's not when you think about them getting all of these
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:59.140]   stock, a lot of them are stock options, not the actual stock, so they're not actually
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.140]   paying that.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.140]   Good point.
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.140]   But the...
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:05.100]   No, I'd like to see Apple actually spend money on making the iCloud more useful, for
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.100]   instance.
[00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:11.620]   I think that a lot of these cities could really use a better kind of Wi-Fi grid type of thing
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:16.020]   that would allow our iPhones, for instance, to call or to use...
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.180]   Do you ubiquitously connected without 3G?
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:24.180]   You know, it comes to me really, is that it is not easy to do to be at Apple's position,
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.460]   despite the fact that they are on top of the world.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.340]   It is not obvious what you do next.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.860]   And you could easily do something wrong, stumble.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:39.220]   And this is what Andy Grove, who was the CEO of Intel for many years, he wrote a book
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.300]   called Only the Paranoid Survive.
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:46.740]   He said that in order to succeed, even when Intel is on top, you have to constantly be
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.620]   facing failure, facing your doom.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:54.420]   And the yardstick is out of control.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:00.100]   If Apple had your over a year growth of, say, 25%, it would be a colossal disaster.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.100]   What a loser.
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.100]   Yeah.
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.100]   That would be...
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.100]   Well, what has happened to Apple?
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:08.660]   The higher you climb, the farther you will fall.
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:12.820]   Eventually, eventually, the oxygen starts getting pretty thin in the stratosphere.
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.460]   So, I think Apple's at that position.
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:17.180]   I mean, their stock price is incredible.
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:21.900]   They have a huge cash in the bank, and it's not clear, and Steve's gone.
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:22.900]   You couldn't...
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:23.900]   It's a perfect storm.
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:29.100]   I mean, if they continue to run it as flawlessly as they have for the last 10 years, I will
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.140]   be very impressed.
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:34.980]   That will be an... that will re-down to Tim Cook and say...
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:39.020]   And Steve, who picked the right guy, that will be an amazing success.
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.020]   We're going to take a break.
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.180]   I want to show you...
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:45.340]   Apple, we're going to debate in a bit the size of the next iPhone.
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.700]   Some say it should be the same three and a half inches.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.900]   Some say four six is in the works.
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.300]   Some say four inches.
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.820]   Let me show you why you want a big screen.
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:40:00.700]   This is Peter the Elephant with the 5.3 inch Samsung Galaxy Note.
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.780]   If you ever own an elephant, you are going to want...
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.780]   Samsung.
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:06.780]   A Samsung Galaxy.
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:10.020]   This video, he takes a...
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.020]   At one point I decided that is a prosthetic trunk.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.540]   There is a human on the other side.
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:15.540]   Look at this.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.540]   He's actually swiping?
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.900]   No, he's not.
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:18.900]   He's playing the...
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.060]   That's a prosthetic trunk.
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.060]   Come on.
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.020]   There's a raw video to...
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.020]   I know.
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.020]   It's real.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.020]   It just...
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.020]   It feels like he's got a finger.
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.220]   I think he's like one of those train movie elephants.
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.700]   He must be a movie elephant.
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:32.700]   You rarely see this...
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:33.700]   Watch, he's drawing!
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.700]   I know it's in the wild.
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:38.100]   He's freaking drawing with the S-pin!
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:40.100]   That's a good portrait.
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.100]   It's in the other...
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.380]   He can play draw something.
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:44.380]   And this is funny.
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.380]   He takes a picture.
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:50.100]   Anyway, this is why you want a big screen in case you have any elephants in your family.
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.100]   That is...
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.100]   I don't know if this is...
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.100]   Did Samsung make this or did...
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.100]   Apparently...
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.100]   Well...
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:56.100]   It must be a Samsung.
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.100]   Yeah.
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.100]   Disguising it...
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.100]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.100]   Some people theorize it.
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.100]   No, look at...
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.100]   Disguising it.
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:03.100]   That's definitely a match from Samsung.
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:06.860]   We're going to take a break at the debate.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.140]   How big should the next iPhone be?
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.500]   Is there even going to be a next iPhone?
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.980]   Evidently, Apple is going down the toilet.
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:14.980]   That's what we've decided.
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:15.980]   We've decided that...
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.860]   Well, you know, if I were an investor...
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:20.860]   Which I'm not.
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:24.820]   And I don't allow myself to buy any tech stock.
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.820]   Partly because I'm an idiot and I would lose my shirt.
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:33.900]   But if I were an investor, I might start shorting Apple only because at some point the roller
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:36.580]   coaster has to go back down, right?
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.460]   I probably ride it for a little while longer.
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.460]   I would short him.
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.020]   But I'm not because I don't.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.940]   And I can't.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.940]   But I just...
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:44.940]   It's...
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:45.940]   It's...
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:46.940]   It's...
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:47.940]   It's...
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:48.940]   It's...
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:49.940]   It's...
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:50.940]   It's...
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:51.940]   It's...
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:52.940]   It's...
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:53.940]   It's a big word.
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:54.940]   I know.
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:55.940]   I know.
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:56.940]   I do that...
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:57.780]   I do that...
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:03.860]   com. bound is off course domain registration made simple management that simple
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.780]   and they've added to new features that I really love premium domains and
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:15.080]   clunker trade-ins. So go to Hover.com actually if you go to our special Hover.com
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:20.380]   address that's probably the best thing to do which is Mac break dot Hover.com do
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:22.620]   you get is it does it look different if you go there I think yeah I think
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:27.740]   there's pictures of us and stuff. Oh look at that in the old cottage
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:34.700]   with Scott Born look at that and Merlin man whatever happened to him. Anyway that
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:39.140]   if you are a Mac break weekly listener you have some advantages but let me just
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.340]   talk a little bit about just the general advantage of Hover. So you
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:46.140]   probably you know when I started registering domains I used I think Vary
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:49.780]   sign we've gone through I've gone through a lot of them. Dotster go daddy. I'm
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:52.580]   moving everything over to Hover there's a few locks that I haven't been able to
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.300]   move I got to get in there and move them. I should have used the Hover
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.940]   concierge service by the way see in the upper right hand corner that phone
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:05.500]   number 8667316556866731656. If you go to Mac break dot Hover.com you'll see it.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.540]   If you call them and say hey look I heard on Mac break could you just move all my
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.980]   domains over they'll do it for freedom it's $25 they'll do I don't know why
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.140]   and do this they just it's their concierge service they'll move it over.
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:20.380]   You do pay for transfer $10 but you get an additional year so it's a it's
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:25.540]   definitely a deal so they'll add a year registration you don't have all the
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:30.780]   upsell gobbledygook you automatically get for instance I met one of these
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:35.140]   other guys you'll have to click 20 or 30 times to buy a domain including choose
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:39.620]   whether you want domain privacy with Hover it's built in automatic they don't
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:44.620]   put your address your phone or anything like that free part of the deal and now
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:48.660]   this premium domain and clunker trade-ins is pretty cool let's say I want fancy
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:54.140]   pants.com because I've got an idea for a business fancy pants everybody loves
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:44:02.300]   fancy pants so what will happen is obviously somebody has fancy pants somebody
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:06.420]   has Ms. Fancy Pants now that you may like see that star that means it's a
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:11.820]   premium domain so the owner of that domain it is owned has set a price 350
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:16.860]   bucks so if you decided Ms. Fancy Pants is the way to go you could get that and
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:20.940]   it's a set price so that's kind of nice because as soon as I call hey there's
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:25.660]   Leela port from Twitt I would like fancy pants that's the price $14,200
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:30.300]   you know it goes off as soon as they so anonymous is a great thing fancy
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:34.820]   pen so all of these starred domains are domains that the owner is willing to sell
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:38.420]   and here's the other neat thing that's those are the new premium domains and
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.580]   it's nice because you don't want to sit there negotiate you don't have to
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:44.540]   save your time and they set the price and if by the way if you have a domain you
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:49.340]   want to sell you can do this on your side too now if you have domains you
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:54.500]   registered or renewed at hover and you want to upgrade to a fancy domain they'll
[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:59.540]   take the old domain name back and credit you with everything you spent with hover
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:03.380]   including the original registration and any renewal fees anything you spent
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.180]   obviously if you spent with somebody else they're not gonna rebate it but if
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.700]   you spent it with hover though so this is why you want to register stuff at
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:14.580]   hover because it's kind of like insurance domain name insurance for the clunker domains
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:19.700]   there's lots more great things the domain management is fantastic if you
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:24.060]   need a standard non-premium domain use the offer code Mac break and you'll save
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:30.020]   10% if you want to trade in a clunker call customer service or email help at
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:35.780]   hover.com I think hover is just the way to go and I get tweets and emails from
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:38.580]   people all the time and say yeah I use those other guys and I am so happy I
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:42.420]   moved to hover it just I move everything to hover. The customer service is really
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:45.460]   what makes it. I'm just the ease of use I mean just like boom boom boom I don't
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:50.180]   want all of it. You don't like to clean your face. No gauntlet. No gauntlet but
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:53.140]   also if you ever need customer service these guys they're Canadians so they're
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:58.060]   extra nice. That's really the truth of it. Right? Where are you guys from? Montreal.
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:02.340]   Canadians they're all nice if you bump into a Canadian on the street they
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:05.780]   apologize. It's weird. I know it's just they go oh I'm so sorry you bumped into
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:09.740]   me. There's a there's some kind of video about that. Is that Andre Nantel? Oh you
[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:17.420]   brought he brought some maple butter Andre. I didn't recognize you thank you
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:22.220]   for coming I appreciate it. This is our source for maple butter. Don't take that.
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:29.140]   I want some this time. This is a new kind. This is this is this is beautiful. Oh look
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:35.300]   more maple butter for all. I've got a start coming into the studio for this.
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:43.540]   Yeah I was about to say. Sorry you missed out. Andre is a regular in our chat room.
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:51.220]   He also does a podcast called well he actually photo blog called Digital
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:58.540]   Apoptosis. What does that mean? Apoptosis. What did he say? Program to sell death.
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:03.820]   A program to sell death. No no. Program to sell death as in sell like a or like a
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.060]   sell organism. Oh that's how you're saying see if you don't have that you get
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:12.020]   cancer. So it's a good thing right. You want your cells to die. Not right away.
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:18.740]   Otherwise you have too many. After after a while. He's apparently a biologist
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:32.660]   right as well. Hey thank you. If you've not tried this. Oh my god. This is
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:34.820]   different than the kind you gave us last time. This is like maple butter
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:41.260]   mayonnaise. It's good. No I like the last time but.
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:50.100]   What would you use this on? Toast bagels. Painted butter sandwich. I can't believe
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:55.660]   it's not maple mayonnaise. It looks like maple mayonnaise. Wow. What will they
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:48:02.340]   think of next? And you do don't you do a podcast too Andre?
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:05.540]   He's I've heard you on futures on biotech with Mark Beletier. Mark is in the
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:09.660]   chat room as well another Canadian. Canadian food show. We should do that. The
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:16.900]   coffee. Chocolate cigars. Wine beer tea and Canadian food products show. Please
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:20.980]   let me be on that show. I saw one of you on that show. That would mean we could eat
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:25.340]   poutine. Oh I don't want to eat poutine. Oh yeah. There's a couple of things I
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:29.340]   could pass on. Poutine and smoked meats. Really? I know Montreal's famous. I'll
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:35.780]   take your smoked meats. All right guys. Agus. I love haggis. All right we're
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:39.060]   gonna move on. Thank you. How do we how do we get to talking about haggis on
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:44.100]   Mac break? Well it is Mac break. That's how delicious with maple butter. It's a
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:52.780]   raffle. Yeah. 1243 full. I should I have the music here somewhere. Squirrel hole.
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:59.580]   Squirrel hole. iPhone size. Let's just look at a few chat. I mean a tweets from the
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:03.780]   world. Total carnage says. Leo LaPorte you're in cloud. Kooku land. Apple bring
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:08.620]   manufacturing back to the US. Unilateral. What's in that coffee? There
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:11.900]   you have it. Nick Glor said just called hover to ask a support question about
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:15.100]   transferring domains. They were so helpful. I'm not even a customer yet.
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:20.780]   Canadian. I'm telling you. And I'm sure that we're gonna start getting tweets
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:25.820]   about maple butter in just a bit. Moving along. iPhone size. Actually you
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:30.380]   could tweet us at Leo LaPorte and I will I should start paying attention to
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:34.620]   Twitter. I mean really. Turns out I bet you that they might have a business
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:39.740]   model there. Some I don't think so. No. By the way. Allah just seems says Leo
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:43.020]   LaPorte is right. You cannot be a good artist on draw something. You can't because
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:47.380]   you're drawing with your fat finger. If you had a galaxy, you know you could
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:53.780]   be. We had by the way, we had Kyle Wiens of I Fix It On Him. We made a
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:58.860]   special out of that. They're the folks who tear down the new Apple products. In
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:02.860]   fact, they fly to New Zealand. He says we draw lots to see who gets to go to
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:06.420]   New Zealand to be the first to buy so that when the iPad 3 came out they were
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:10.980]   there when the iPhone came. And then they take it to a friendly
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:14.260]   shop and they tear it down. And it's fun because they do it as a live blog at
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:18.700]   I Fix It dot com so you can actually watch to see what's in it. Piece by piece as
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:22.500]   they tear it down. They're really great. So that's a special if you go to
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:27.620]   twit.tv/specials. You can watch us talk to Kyle. It's the episode 113. And if you
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:31.740]   watch it, there is a offer code in there. I don't know what it ended up being how.
[00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:35.300]   I think it was twit. The offer code was twit. I wasn't going to say what the offer code was. I was
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:39.940]   going to make them watch that. Sorry. But what I didn't know is what you get when you use the offer
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:44.180]   code to it. Do you get like a percentage offer? I don't know what you get. Well, anyway,
[00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:49.780]   I won't say any. Watch it and find out. No, you don't have to watch it now. Just just use the offer
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:54.860]   code to it. I fix it. And I think it's still going on. A. W. C. Farcourt says, how can you not like
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:51:03.780]   protein? You know what poutine is? It's cheese curds and gravy on French fries. It is so good.
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:08.460]   Is it good? I haven't tried it. The first time I actually had it was in Paris of all
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:11.660]   play. We were watching a stealer game at a Canadian bar eating poutine and drinking kai
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:15.420]   pettinas and watching a stealer game. I tell you that part of the stealer game. We were watching
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:18.700]   a stealer game. It was eating poutine and watching the stealers. That's an interesting
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.460]   in Paris, right? Right across the Notre Dame was like right across the. They have
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:27.820]   spoutino pears. In Paris in this Canadian bar that they do exotic foreign food. Yes. And
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:31.340]   apparently, according to Anna van Pelt, you can get genuine Montreal smoked meat from a
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:36.220]   restaurant in Omaha, Nebraska called brew burgers. He's getting some delivered this week. So there
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:43.860]   you go. I don't know what Biskoff spread is. And I got two tweets that just say maple butter.
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:51.260]   So moving along, how big should the iPhone be? I there's a rumor. I don't give any credence to
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:58.220]   that it's going to be 4.6 inches. You don't you don't buy it either. That's it's silly. I mean,
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:04.300]   it's what what what advantage would Apple have to having a big iPhone outside of the fact that
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:09.580]   outside of worrying that so many Android phones are at least four inches diagonal these days.
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:13.980]   Well, and that's a legitimate word. Do you think customers will start to look at the iPhone at
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:18.700]   three and a half inches and say that's kind of small. I think Apple really will be focused on
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:24.060]   can this screen be read at that size? Yeah, those two how big is it physically? I could I could
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:31.500]   possibly believe a four inch screen because I still the the the the big limiting factor is you
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:36.780]   hold an iPhone in your hand and can you still operate all the the entire screen just by moving
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:41.740]   your thumb around? And when you get to a foreign screen, you could still sort of stretch and
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:46.860]   reach it every time I've tested a screen that's larger than four inches. It really turns it into
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:51.500]   two hand phone. You lose the ability to be hopefully carrying something in this hand,
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:55.580]   take something out of your pocket, get the answer that you took out your your phone to get and then
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:59.580]   put it back in your impact in your shirt pocket. That's what you lose when you go larger than four
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:04.140]   inches. And they would the other problem is of course that they did they certainly don't want to
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:10.620]   fragment iPhone any further by having an odd ball screen size that programmers are going to have
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:14.780]   to develop for and target specifically. What if you made it bigger but had the same resolution?
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:20.380]   Yes, I'm saying I actually actually looked in use the handy dandy online DPI calculator.
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:26.940]   And if they kept at a 960 by 640 display at a four inch diagonal screen that would result in a
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:32.780]   288 point four. That's written. So they could it's they wouldn't I think they would do it if
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:38.140]   they could still say this is a retina grade display. If they are so I don't I haven't done the there's
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:42.460]   actually trigonomically true trigonometry involved to figure out whether or not that qualifies as
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:47.660]   retina grade retina they define retina as below the resolution of the human eye with 20 20 vision
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:55.180]   actually detect pixels. I don't think they'll ever build an iPhone that's any larger that's so
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:59.900]   large they could not still call it a written display is the big point. Yeah, even at 4.6 inches
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:05.980]   at the same resolution as 250 pixels per inch which is about the same as the new iPad.
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:13.900]   The current the current iPad is 263. Yeah, they still get to that crazy. But I realized that
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:19.500]   with an iPad you're I think the distance is given as 16 inches. Right. But yeah, you don't hold
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:24.380]   that far off. Yeah, exactly. I think we're on the cusp of a world where pretty much all smartphones
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:29.740]   and all tablets are quote unquote retina, you know, qualifying screens. Yes. And it's just not
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:33.900]   going to be an issue. And they may be other ways that they can improve the quality of screens and
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:38.940]   graphics and all that stuff. But it's it's it's about to become an issue like like megapixels.
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:43.980]   At some point it's just too many and nobody cares and it's just results in big problems.
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:48.620]   But in terms of the size, you know, Andy is right. I think you know you you Apple's going to have a
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:55.420]   one size fits all phone. And yes, when when when an Android handset maker comes out with a gigantic
[00:54:55.420 --> 00:55:00.780]   phone, there's going to be a minority of people who like gigantic phones and don't mind this massive
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:05.100]   thing in their in their pants pocket or in the area. It's called the galaxy note and I have
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:11.180]   a elephant time fingers. And if you're average user, then then then they're really onto something.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:15.020]   But I think it's the outliers that like the giant phones really for one size fits. Yeah,
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:19.420]   absolutely. You know, people put them business people put them in their shirt pocket or in their
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:23.100]   suit pocket or in their front, you know, people put it in their front pocket. Some people put it
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:27.580]   in the back. I mean, you really can't have too big of a phone and still hope to gain hundred
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:31.180]   million hundreds of millions of users. I put it in my front pocket all the time. It fits fine.
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:36.540]   Well, I mean, again, you're you're you're a lot of extra big front pockets.
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:41.980]   Well, but you're a lot you're a lot more technology centric than you know, the vast majority of phone
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:48.300]   users just, you know, they want case that they close, you know, like women will have it in a
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:53.180]   small handbag or whatever. I mean, it's it's really a problem with each size. I don't know about the
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:56.620]   size of putting in pockets, but I can tell you this looks silly. No, it doesn't.
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:02.460]   No silly or the taking a picture with an iPad does. We're going to get used to all that stuff.
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:07.420]   So when I'm voting for a small iPad, not not a big iPhone, I don't know.
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:13.340]   Arnold Kim, Arnold Kim writing at Mac rumors says that the 4.6 inch display rumor comes from a
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:19.340]   previously unknown Korean media source with no track record. Yeah, so forget it. However,
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:24.620]   he says, I lounge, which got the iPad thickness right, which has had other says from the same source.
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:29.980]   The next generation iPhone will this is a quote from my lounge will not look like the teardrop
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:34.540]   shape version that was widely rumored for release in 2011. We've been told the device will have a
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:40.060]   four inch display and will be eight millimeters longer than before with a metal casing probably
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:47.420]   aluminum. It's on track to be introduced in the summer of 2012. This I find none of this believable
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:52.860]   and it's still in the engineering phase, not early production. We suspect that poor battery life
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:58.380]   doomed the prior prototype version. And this one is being built with LTE ready battery drain.
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:04.780]   In mind, four inches would be about right, I think. Same resolution. That's the other component
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:10.220]   of this that I find interesting that we might be focusing on the wrong element of why Apple
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:13.980]   would make a big phone. If you have a big phone that allows you to put in a bigger battery,
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:18.300]   if you have a bigger battery, then the problems of putting in an LTE radio aren't quite as important
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:21.900]   as they are if you keep the three and a half inch form factor. So I don't think that I don't think
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:24.780]   that is the argument, but I think that's an interesting area. Yeah, you got more room.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:32.460]   Bigger battery. And that's why the iPad survives. I do find that I on my Galaxy 2S or S2,
[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:36.940]   I find that typing on it is much harder than the iPhone. It's the same thing that Andy was talking
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:40.620]   about. The screen has just gotten to some point where I type a lot slower on it. Really? And I
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:44.780]   type slower on my iPad too. I don't like to go to an iPad. I'll check it out. You could type like
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:50.620]   crazy. I do think the note is a really, really nice device. And also, it also points out how
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:56.060]   different the Android market for phones is than the iPhone market. Samsung can build a phone like
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:58:00.060]   this because that's not the only phone they're making. They're making every single kind of phone
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:04.540]   that any user could possibly want. Whereas if Apple is going to say, we're going to make a
[00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:09.020]   five inch iPhone and this is going to be the only one of two choices that you will have for
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:13.100]   this entire operating system, that's when they're going to start to feel some pain. They're going
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:17.660]   to start to feel some blowback from consumers. And the advantage of only making one is that you
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:23.820]   get all the accessories. I mean, it's really hard to find the breadth of accessories for
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:27.660]   your Android devices. You're right. There isn't any choice at all. But then again,
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:32.380]   how many cases do you need? How many kickstands do you need? It's, I don't think it's quite a
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:37.020]   big deal on mobile devices as it is on the notes and notes. Does anybody think that Apple's going
[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:43.180]   to come out with an ice cream sandwich like version of iOS that kind of sizes itself automatically
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:48.060]   to the right screen size? Or are they going to stick with it? It's got to be a multiple of the
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:53.420]   existing resolution. You know, it's funny because on the iPad, when they first came out, remember,
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:58.140]   you had that weird, you still do that weird iPhone thing where you have one X2X. And yet,
[00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:02.780]   on the new iPad, old apps run just fine. There's no one X2X. There's no one.
[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:06.620]   There isn't no one. When you go from iPhone, there is from iPhone, it stays that way. But
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:11.180]   if you use old, un-updated iPhone apps on the new Retina display, just fills it up. It just fills
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:15.500]   it up. It's no big deal. And it works great. And it looks great. And to be honest, I often can't
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:20.380]   tell the difference between an unadapted program and a one that's designed for the Retina. So,
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:23.420]   I think that that's completely doable. I think Apple's doing it.
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:28.300]   Yeah. And it's still a multiple. I'm just wondering if they're going to--
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:32.460]   They're going to stay with the multiple they have to. And in fact, I think you can, as Andy pointed
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:38.380]   out, a bigger four inch or even a four point inch screen, which is the same resolution, no
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:43.100]   problem. It's resolutionary. And I think you just-- I don't think you change the resolution.
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:46.540]   You can't. I think that it also makes a big difference. When you start doing something other
[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:52.700]   than 2X from a scaling thing, everything goes soft. Well, why did they do that with the iPhone?
[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:56.380]   Because it is 2X. I guess because the keyboard's different and the controls are different.
[00:59:56.380 --> 01:00:01.500]   That's why. I hate those 2X, the iPhone apps on an iPad. I just can't stand these.
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:05.980]   I don't know. They don't swivel to landscape mode.
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:09.340]   I think the only one that I use is G+ because it's--
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:14.700]   There are a few. An app looks pretty good. A path looks pretty good on the iPad.
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:22.700]   It looks big. Kind of big. It looks pretty good. All right. So what do we think? What do we--
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:25.660]   do we have a consensus? Next iPhone. Mike Elgin, what do you think?
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:31.980]   It's in terms of the screen size. I think it's going to be very, very close to what it is.
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:35.340]   Now identical or the same. I don't think they're going to do a gigantic phone.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:41.180]   And you think fall? You believe this summer? I can't be so much.
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:46.540]   Yeah, the summer. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to say. I mean,
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:50.460]   everyone-- remember everybody was expecting the iPhone 5 and it was--
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:58.860]   and then we got something lesser. So I-- the big jump is coming. The big revolutionary
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:03.100]   transformation is coming. I think it's probably going to come this year. I mean,
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:06.620]   it's really painful for Apple. Now we're talking earlier about the higher expectations. It's
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:11.500]   really painful for them to go an entire year without a new iPhone. I mean, they really--
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.260]   Well, they'll certainly have one in 2012, right?
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:17.340]   Absolutely. And it's going to be some of the--
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.540]   It's just a question of junior sift-depress.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:25.980]   Yeah. Yeah. And what I think is going to be interesting is going to be the sort of Apple as a
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:31.500]   kind of mobile wallet platform. I think they're going to make a big play for that. So that's going
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:35.980]   to be, I think, one of the game changers. Apple's going to become your credit card.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:41.020]   Well, nobody's better positioned than Apple to do that. Google tried to do it with Google
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:46.140]   Wallet and NFC and your field communications. And Apple already has your real credit card.
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.620]   Right. Well, they already know. Have you bought anything?
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:51.900]   Actually, Google does, too. But Google's been, as you know, Mike, because you're a Google+
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:58.540]   guy. Google's-- you're strongly encouraged when you sign up for Google+ now to give it a credit card.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:02.460]   So Google's making that very concerted effort to have what Amazon and Apple already have,
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:07.500]   which is your financial credentials. And today they had Google I/O and it's like they sold out of
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:14.780]   Google I/O tickets in 28 minutes. And they required Google Wallet. And it was like, I think that's a
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:18.140]   sign of things to come. I think they're just going to coerce everybody who does anything
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:21.900]   monetary with Google to use high wallet. We'll talk about this tomorrow and this week in Google,
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:26.940]   but I think this is a turning point. Google is now evil. Period. It happened.
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:34.540]   I mean, no more evil than anybody else, but Google clearly now is using their power to coerce people.
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:40.700]   Look what they've done with the black bar at the top of Google+ now. It's pushing Google Play.
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:47.740]   Like, I don't-- what? If you don't have an Android phone, Google Play is worthless.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:54.460]   So Google is now using their market cloud. See, this play. Google's now using their market cloud to
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:03:00.620]   push other products to front and center Google+ even though it's not the best search results.
[01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:05.260]   They've really turned the corner. This is different from the integration of Google+.
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:09.100]   Because Google+, there's an argument to be made for improving search results.
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:11.820]   They made that argument, I understand. But nevertheless, you--
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:15.500]   This has just come by our stuff. This doesn't improve our search.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.260]   It's gotten worse and worse and worse. Yeah.
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:26.220]   You can argue over-- and I will argue that I think upgrading Google+ results in search
[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:32.060]   is definitely evil. This is what evil meant when they came up, when Paul Bucheit came up with
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:37.020]   "Don't be evil" as the Google slogan, what they were talking about is paid search results.
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:41.340]   I mean, that's what it was in those days. And that's what they're doing in effect. They're putting
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:45.500]   YouTube and Google+ higher on the results because we own it, not because it's a better result.
[01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:51.420]   More interestingly, if you look at the really big long-term picture, we're entering into a world
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:57.180]   where it's going to be like the Cold War. It's going to be an Apple world and a Google world.
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:59.900]   And an Amazon world. I think Amazon's in there too.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:03.100]   I think Amazon is in big trouble over the next couple.
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:09.420]   Yeah. Because they've been trying-- just being very cavalier about getting right directly into
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:13.820]   the businesses of Apple and Google. And so they've inserted themselves into this
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:19.020]   dance between two elephants. And I think at some point they're just going to be-- especially if you
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:23.980]   look at the tablet, I think the Kindle Fire is going to be in real trouble. Look at how wonderful
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:31.660]   it is to read on the new iPad. It's just like, why would-- that was the original great thing about
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:35.100]   the original Kindle. It was like, wow, I can go out in the sun and read this thing. And it's very
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:43.660]   pleasant on the eyes. I think the era where ordinary run-of-the-mill phone and tablet screens are
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:48.540]   difficult to read on is over. And so I think Amazon's in a lot of trouble. But we're going to--
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:54.380]   the point is that both Apple and Google are going to want to do everything from your television
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:05:03.340]   set to your tablet to your e-commerce to your personal contextual advertising.
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:08.220]   And it's going to be very difficult for almost anybody else to really compete in a meaningful way.
[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:12.700]   Have you gone to the Apple Store and bought something from the Apple Store with your own iPhone?
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:13.820]   Have you seen this yet?
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:17.900]   You walk into the Apple Store and you-- oh, you're using physical stores.
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:23.980]   You walk into the Apple Store and you open up your Apple app and you take a picture of the
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:29.180]   thing and you pay for it with your iTunes, whatever, and then you walk out of the store.
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.060]   With self-service.
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:31.420]   You don't even talk to anybody?
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:31.900]   No, you don't.
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:32.700]   I love that.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.460]   No, no, but I don't want to talk to anybody.
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:37.980]   No, no, no, it's totally-- so I take a picture of this maple butter.
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:40.380]   It charges me and then I pick it up and I go out the door.
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.140]   And I don't-- right now I don't know how that really works.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:45.660]   I'm like, I don't understand-- well, wait a minute, because they don't have open stock on the floor.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:46.460]   You're the do-
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.820]   They have like-- you get like your--
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:48.620]   They have a stack of--
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:48.780]   They have a stack of--
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:49.100]   --findable.
[01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:49.260]   --findable.
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:50.220]   So you have like a Thunderbolt.
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:51.980]   So you take out your Thunderbolt cable, you take a picture of--
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:52.300]   You take a picture of--
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:52.780]   That's what I bought.
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:54.220]   And you--
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:55.740]   You have $50 Thunderbolt cable.
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:58.460]   No, I don't think they're putting out the computers yet, but all I'm saying is you--
[01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:02.380]   I buy a lot of accessories at Apple Store because I forgot something and I'm on the road and I need to--
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:03.580]   so I buy power supplies.
[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:18.780]   So when you go in the accessories, you can just do it.
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:19.580]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:21.180]   But what else--
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:22.060]   Hey Eli, come here.
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:26.940]   But he's under 18 and he won't get arrested.
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:29.660]   But I think that the interesting thing is that you--
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:34.300]   is that that's really interesting to see Apple doing it.
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:41.980]   It's really cool in the Apple Store, but obviously that could be seen as beta for something far bigger than just doing this at the Apple Store.
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.660]   There's a little difference between yourself with--
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:47.660]   --people are getting everybody in the Apple world to do something and then getting everybody in the world to do something,
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:50.300]   especially something as fundamental as how you pay for stuff.
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.820]   But there's enough people in the Apple world.
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:52.300]   Yeah.
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.540]   You don't need everybody.
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.380]   Are you going to convince--
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:00.220]   When you look at the numbers of how many people like own iPhones and you realize that--
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:02.220]   --the Apple is not the number one manufacturer of phones.
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:02.940]   No, but they don't need to be.
[01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.060]   They don't need to be.
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:10.220]   And then you get-- then even Google, who has the ability to put this sort of feature on every single device,
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:17.020]   they too will have a problem of getting people-- remember how every single credit card owner was essentially given this offer.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:21.100]   If you will give this little tag for your keychain that will have an embedded RFC chip,
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:27.580]   they just simply tap a display terminal at the pharmacy or at the gas station and pay for your stuff automatically.
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.900]   That has not gone exceptionally well.
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:30.900]   You still have to--
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.220]   A lot of that has to do with the UI though.
[01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:36.700]   I mean, the thing is, is that one of the reasons that I don't like self-service at Walgreens or at
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:40.860]   Rayleys or whatever is because it stinks.
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:43.500]   I mean, actually doing it is a real pain in the neck.
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:48.860]   And it has to be easier than going to-- I go to Rayleys and say it's like Safeway or whatever.
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:54.380]   I go there and they have a self-service and I never use it because it takes me longer to go through the self-service than it takes to just go to a person,
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:55.820]   even if I have to stay in line.
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:56.620]   That's the problem.
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:01.180]   And when you look at how much retailers give up, if I'm going to buy something, I see a really long line.
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:03.980]   A lot of times I'll just walk out and I'll go, "Oh, I'm just going to get this on Amazon."
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:07.180]   And in a with-or-self service, I don't think it's really the point.
[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:11.500]   The point is that Apple and Google are going to be involved in the retail experience.
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:21.180]   And already, I think one of the most under-reported phenomena that's happening with the iPad is the fact that it's becoming the cash register of choice using Square.
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.660]   And it's actually really huge.
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:34.940]   If you go into the point of sale industry, they're Quagen and they're Boots because of this, because people, instead of buying a $20,000 point of sale system,
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:38.300]   they're buying a couple of iPads and a couple of Square devices and they're good to go.
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:39.980]   Yeah, Acre Coffee, which is right down the street from us.
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:40.700]   So cool.
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:41.980]   It's such a great experience.
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:44.220]   You walk in and you order coffee.
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.820]   I buy more coffee because of it.
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:46.780]   Yeah, it's just easy.
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:46.780]   It's easy.
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:47.340]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:52.620]   So if people haven't used it, you have the app on your iPhone or Android phone.
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:53.500]   Which they just made it go.
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:56.700]   I have it turned on so that when it's proximity, it turns on.
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:58.620]   So I don't even have to push a button on my phone.
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:00.060]   I just walk in the door.
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:02.620]   I say, "Give me a coffee. I know yeah, I'm Leo."
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:03.740]   And that's it.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:05.020]   And I walk out the door with a coffee.
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:07.820]   It's very similar to maple butter purchasing at the Apple Store.
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:15.340]   The other scary thing about brick and mortar is, or for brick and mortar stores is that a lot of people are going in, and I've done this myself.
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:18.620]   You go into a store, you use the Amazon app or use some other app.
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.700]   You take a picture of something.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:20.780]   It recognizes the product.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:24.540]   You just find me the lowest price online and deliver it.
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.140]   And you walk out of the brick and mortar store.
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:28.620]   They've paid for the electricity, the stocking, and all that stuff.
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:30.220]   And then you're buying it from someone else.
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:39.740]   It's really going to be, there are going to be so many options for alternatives for just buying something in store and paying for it at a cash register.
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:43.180]   And most of those biggest alternatives are going to involve Apple and Google.
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:49.820]   Have you noticed that a lot of stores now put their own park code over top of the bar code that's on the box?
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:50.140]   Really?
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:52.220]   Yeah, it's very specific to make it.
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:52.860]   Why do they do that?
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:54.540]   So that you can't do what he's just talking about.
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:55.660]   You can't order from Amazon.
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:58.140]   You can't take a picture of it and say, oh yeah.
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:02.540]   If I'm traveling and I wander into somewhere, I almost always ordered off Amazon.
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.740]   And it's not because of the money, it's because I don't want to, I can't put it in my bag.
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:06.860]   I don't have any room in my bag.
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:10.620]   And so I'll buy it from a lot of the local retailers here in Petaluma.
[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:13.900]   I try to buy from, if I walk in and support them.
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.500]   But if I'm traveling, I won't do it.
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:20.700]   And it's so easy. I mean, that's the thing is that it's such an easy way to buy stuff.
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:21.820]   And it shows up.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:23.100]   We're going to take a break.
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:29.900]   Oh, before we do, I do want to mention this is, I'm not sure if this has been updated or not.
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:38.700]   But a couple of days ago, there was a security alert that Safari for iOS was vulnerable to something called address bar spoofing.
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:47.660]   A security researcher at majorsecurity.net said that users can be tricked into supplying personal
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:52.780]   information to a malicious website because you could put a link, here's how it would work.
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:57.980]   You put a link in an email, hidden link that people click that is to hacker.com.
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:00.220]   In the email, you could say bank of America.com.
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:05.180]   But normally when you go, when you click the link in the browser, you'll see hacker.com and you go, whoo.
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:10.940]   But what this spoofing can do is it actually could say bank of America.com in the address bar,
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:15.420]   even though it's not bank of America.com, then you put up the bank of America login,
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:18.380]   you get in, you capture people's credentials.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.900]   Apple has been notified of this.
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:24.620]   It's a little unusual for a security company to notify Apple and go public.
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:27.420]   But I guess this is serious enough.
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:28.780]   So here, I'll show you how this works.
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:30.700]   They've made a demo.
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:33.820]   Well, actually, I can't because I have to be on, you could do it on your iPad.
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:37.740]   But they have a demo that if you go to majorsecurity.net,
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:40.220]   I don't even want to run a demo on my iPad.
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:43.260]   No, it seems like a good idea.
[01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:48.220]   You could go through this process and it would actually show you the wrong URL.
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:51.340]   So it's definitely an exploit that is demonstratable.
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.660]   The monsterable.
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.980]   So anyway, just a word of warning.
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:59.260]   I guess the reason they went public is to let you know that you should be extra careful.
[01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:02.460]   And it's bad I did a click links and emails anyway.
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:06.060]   If you hand enter the domain name in your browser bar, you're always safe.
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.460]   They haven't figured out a spoof that yet.
[01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:16.220]   Signs in Mountain Lion point to written display in MacBook sooner than later,
[01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:17.660]   according to ours, Technica.
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:24.380]   Right in here in OS 10, 10.8 Mountain Lion,
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:30.140]   there's double sized graphics we're seeing in all sorts of places.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:31.980]   Are we surprising?
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:37.340]   Including Apple's messages while using the app under the second developer preview of Mountain Lion,
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:40.700]   some icons are erroneously displaying 2x resolution art.
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:41.100]   See that?
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:44.060]   See the icon's too big.
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:47.900]   That sounds like a mistake, obviously.
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:53.260]   But the fact that double sized icon is in there and Mountain Lion comes in.
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:55.580]   Now, I think you could say, you could reasonably say,
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:58.860]   well, they're going to put it in Mountain Lion because sometime before the next release of 10,
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:01.180]   they will be offering written displays.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.700]   I want a written display on everything.
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:05.340]   I think that's the obvious direction.
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:12.060]   Doesn't make a immediate sense for everything, but device like the 11 inch air definitely needs
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:12.540]   graphics.
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:18.620]   I was trying to figure out the difference between why you would choose an 11 inch air
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:23.980]   if you had both an iPad and another Mac, what role would that fulfill into mobile?
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.500]   And because it's just not of an optimal experience for any sort of desktop operating system.
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:30.700]   A couple more quickies before we get to our tips of the week.
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:35.660]   We've mentioned on iPad today, but I should mention it also that apparently the iPad keeps
[01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:39.660]   charging for as long as an hour after it reports 100% on the battery.
[01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:42.460]   So if you've got the new iPad, keep it charging.
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:47.100]   But there are some other interesting battery tidbits and non tech
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:55.420]   said that users running a Verizon iPad and hotspot mode can see as much as 25 hours of battery life.
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:14:01.020]   So if you I guess you have to turn off everything else, but if you want to use it as a hotspot,
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:05.900]   25 hours, of course, the hotspotting is not available in AT&T just on Verizon in the US.
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:07.020]   I feel like I screwed up there.
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.260]   I got the ATC of Verizon.
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:15.820]   Australians are pissed because Apple selling the iPad as a 4G iPad in Australia, even though it's not
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:18.700]   no LTE compatibility in Australia.
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:21.900]   The Australian FCC is getting involved in this one.
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:24.220]   The ACCC.
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:27.980]   I don't consider the 4G label a lie.
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:31.420]   I think that I think that needs some explanation, but you can sell me.
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:40.060]   Well, the standard is broad enough that I don't think that that's necessarily wrong.
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:47.740]   Also, the optimum speeds of the 4G on 3G network on AT&T are actually within the
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:52.860]   within the margins of what you'd expect from an LTE connection, but not in with near the maximum,
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:54.780]   but it's certainly within the margins of the minimum.
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:56.780]   I don't know.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:15:00.700]   I wish the AT&T and Apple would be a little bit more open about why they're doing that.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:07.260]   It's not definitely a proud moment in consumer clarity, but I don't think it's necessarily fraud.
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:12.140]   Australia is pretty finicky about advertising claims.
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:15.020]   They may force them to change that just because to make it clear.
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:21.500]   Also, talking about the battery, apparently the new iPad when charging really sucks juice up to two
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:27.020]   amps of current, that really pushes the 2.1 amps in the iPad's charger.
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:32.620]   And it certainly means that the smaller one-amp iPhone charger or the dock
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:33.180]   takes forever.
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:33.980]   I've tested this.
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:33.980]   I've tested this.
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:35.580]   It's not going to charge it fast enough.
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:36.220]   It's like a day.
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:39.100]   It takes like a day to charge an iPad from one of the little ones.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:42.540]   It says the two amps quickly drops once the iPad begins to charge,
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:46.540]   but you only get 500 milliamps on a standard USB port,
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:52.300]   900 milliamps on a USB 3 port, and only one amp on the iPhone adapter.
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:53.180]   So use the big one.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:59.660]   Use the big boy to charge your new iPad or just be very patient or wait all night.
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:02.540]   It doesn't say charging, but it is charging slightly.
[01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:05.740]   You know, that's the new thing though.
[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:10.860]   You have to charge your iPhone 4s and your new iPad all night.
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:15.340]   If you don't charge it the night before you go to bed, you're going to have trouble.
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:16.860]   At least I've found.
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:19.740]   You know, I'm charging my iPhone 4s constantly,
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:25.180]   and it's kind of similar with the new iPad it takes forever to charge.
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:33.180]   And then I'm personally not getting quite 10 hours, which is less than advertised.
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:35.340]   But it's just I think this is the world we're headed into,
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:39.260]   where the batteries just get bigger and bigger and bigger and take longer and longer to charge.
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:41.820]   I have the craziest bug right now with my iPhone.
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:43.500]   It won't charge when it's on.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:46.860]   So it'll only charge if I turn it off and then it'll charge.
[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:48.860]   And I'm getting ready to get a new one or get somebody.
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:50.220]   What about when it turns itself on?
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:51.980]   When it turns itself on, I'm still screwed.
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:54.140]   It'll like it turns itself on and then it'll stop charging.
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:56.700]   So if I plug it in and walk away, it'll it'll turn on,
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:01.100]   stop charging and then run out and then go off and then come back on again and do it.
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:02.060]   Just keep on doing that.
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:02.860]   That's not good.
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:05.580]   It is the craziest bug I've ever seen because it's I first,
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:06.540]   I thought it wouldn't charge at all.
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:08.300]   And then I realized that I think it has something to do with the mophie,
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:09.660]   to be honest with you, the way I was using it.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:11.020]   Oh, I have a theory.
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:13.420]   I should say it's a show because I'm going to say I'm going to go to the Apple Store and go,
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:15.420]   I don't know what's wrong, but I do know what's wrong.
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:16.300]   I use it your way.
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.260]   So you think that's a bad thing.
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:18.860]   So leaving it on all the time, that's what I do.
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:22.940]   I think that my iPhone has gotten into some kind of weird cycle where it's not happy.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:24.460]   So I'm going to get it.
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:25.340]   I'm hopefully going to get anyone.
[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.820]   And it's going to be the batteries.
[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:30.460]   It could be some iOS thing because as I said, it charges fine when it's off.
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.460]   Just not when it's on.
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:34.460]   Like once the iOS and it will not sync.
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:36.700]   So here's one argument for the iCloud.
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:37.340]   It's broken.
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:42.140]   The one thing is the saving grace of the iCloud is that I was freaked out.
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:45.420]   But I have thick photos on here and I've all saw this up and I realized,
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:47.740]   I backed it all up to the iPad.
[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.260]   So all I have to do is take it in.
[01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:50.220]   They can do whatever they want with it.
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:52.140]   And I just restore it.
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.900]   Let's see.
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:18:01.900]   Other quick stories, Apple has done the right thing and is no longer approving apps
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:08.060]   that access the iOS's UDID, that unique identifier in the iPhone.
[01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:10.620]   That's good.
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:11.820]   That's a privacy issue.
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:15.420]   Apple has allowed apps to access that UDID.
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:20.620]   Actually, they deprecated the UDID August of last year.
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:23.180]   They discouraged people from using it and now they are.
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:25.580]   Now they're Apple.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:29.580]   Apple always does the right thing when there's no benefit for doing the wrong thing.
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:32.460]   Oh, I like that boy.
[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:34.140]   Let me write that one down.
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:35.660]   I think that's true of all of us, isn't it?
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:38.860]   We only do the wrong thing when there's a benefit.
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:46.780]   If there's no consequence to doing the right thing, why not?
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:48.380]   Right?
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:49.020]   Exactly.
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:49.820]   Do the right thing.
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:55.740]   They've been feeling pressure from legislating from what we have.
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:55.980]   Yes.
[01:18:56.620 --> 01:19:00.780]   Also, how much the app store is?
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:06.620]   It's not exactly the Wild Wild West, but if there's a way that some app developer can
[01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:10.860]   figure out to make a little bit extra cash from an app that they're releasing,
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:11.900]   they're going to find it.
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:14.620]   There's no reason for them to have access to that information.
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:16.380]   So they're going to simply say, "Nope, you can't have it."
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:18.780]   You can't have nice things.
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:20.380]   You've ruined it for everybody.
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:24.620]   Speaking of you can't have nice things, the Apple store is being sued because an 83-year-old
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:25.660]   walked into the glass.
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:30.060]   She says, "She broke her nose. I shouldn't laugh."
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:36.140]   But she says, "Apple should not have big glass windows because I thought I didn't know it was glass
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:37.180]   and I walked right into it."
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.780]   Because no other building ever has glass doors.
[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:39.820]   I mean, that's the thing.
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:41.260]   Apple really has this.
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:42.700]   They have a patent on that, actually.
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:45.260]   They actually started installing white stickers on the glass.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:48.780]   I'm sure Steve Jobs, if Steve Jobs were alive, this would not be happening,
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:51.420]   but these white stickers are now being installed on the glass.
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:52.700]   And she still walked into it.
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:54.220]   I saw this and I really thought of you.
[01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:56.060]   Because I've walked into it.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:20:00.620]   So this glass door right here, if you go back and look, there's a really big right where my
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:01.100]   forehead...
[01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:01.980]   Did you walk into it?
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:04.700]   I walked out of the show last time and I walked right into it a full tilt.
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:05.660]   I had a headache all day.
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:06.700]   I just want to let you break my nose.
[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:07.340]   I didn't break my nose.
[01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:08.220]   I was thinking about this.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:08.700]   But I saw this.
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:10.380]   I was like, "Maybe I do not lead with your nose."
[01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:11.500]   Exactly.
[01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:12.540]   I was glad of my belly.
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:15.740]   Fortunately, I was in a rush, so I was leaning forward.
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:16.220]   That's why.
[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:17.100]   So I hit the rush.
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:17.500]   I hit the...
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:18.380]   Do not be in a rush.
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:20.140]   So you know there's a door there.
[01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:23.420]   But yeah, well, I know not because when I get close to it, I can see my forehead mark.
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:24.140]   Still there.
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:25.020]   We'll leave that there.
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.220]   You just don't watch the door because...
[01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:26.940]   It's forehead.
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:27.340]   I'm sure.
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:28.860]   You have a diamond forehead.
[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:29.340]   It's there.
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:32.300]   I actually have many, many times...
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:37.660]   Not in my office for some reason, but walked into the glass on Lisa's office because there's a
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:40.700]   door and then there's what looks like a door, which is a pane of glass.
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:43.100]   And I bounce off that all the time.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:43.820]   We have an X on our side.
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:46.460]   And Lisa just laughs hysterically.
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:47.980]   She just goes...
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:48.540]   Who the hell?
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:50.060]   [Laughter]
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:53.100]   So I guess I won't be suing myself.
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:53.980]   Please don't sue me.
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:55.340]   I'm not going to sue you.
[01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:57.100]   I'm glad you didn't break your nose.
[01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:58.380]   I still wouldn't have sued you, Leo.
[01:20:58.380 --> 01:20:58.940]   Just so you know.
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:01.740]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.100]   I feel bad.
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:04.140]   I didn't know you walked in.
[01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:05.500]   It was my fault.
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:08.140]   Is that why you didn't come back for weeks?
[01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:08.620]   I had to go...
[01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:09.420]   I was in the hospital.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:10.060]   I was in a coma.
[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:10.620]   Oh my God.
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:13.420]   [Laughter]
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:13.900]   It doesn't.
[01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:16.060]   I mean, if you look at it, you can't tell there's a glass.
[01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:17.260]   It is smoked glass though.
[01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:18.300]   It's not clear.
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:19.820]   It's like two or three stops down.
[01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:20.780]   I was just in a rush.
[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:21.660]   There wasn't been a tension.
[01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:22.460]   It's all my fault.
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:25.500]   Anyway, there's glass all over this building.
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:26.380]   You could walk through it.
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:27.180]   Exactly.
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:27.980]   Look at my office.
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:30.300]   This is just a walking liability.
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.660]   This is just a crazy liability, Leo.
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:33.100]   I think you have to redesign the whole thing.
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:35.340]   I think there's going to be a retrofit here.
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:38.140]   I have to put little white things all over.
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:39.740]   I think it's all over for Twitter anyway.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:43.580]   I got the new Apple TV and I go to the podcast section.
[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:48.620]   We have no podcasts anywhere in the podcast section.
[01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:49.500]   Because it's all...
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.660]   The way they wait it is new subscriptions.
[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:54.540]   And we just don't exist anymore.
[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:55.340]   I think it's all over.
[01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:58.140]   No wonder they don't invite us to events anymore.
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:01.980]   I'm just going to pack it up, sell it, try to recoup my losses.
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:03.340]   Meanwhile...
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:05.260]   You're taking office on that chair?
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:06.140]   I really like that chair.
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:06.780]   You want the chair?
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:10.620]   That's a chair of an estimate podcasting authority.
[01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:11.340]   It is, I know.
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:13.020]   It costs a hell of a lot of money.
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:14.140]   I'd like to bid on your coffee accessories.
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:16.780]   No, I'm holding on to those.
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:19.180]   Even if I'm in a homeless shelter, at least I'll have good coffee.
[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:20.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:25.580]   What we first just said is, "Oleo, you're being silly.
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:26.620]   Don't close down Twitch.
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:27.500]   What is the user's success?"
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.260]   Instead of saying, "Can we be the buzzers?"
[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:30.220]   You're saying, "Ooh, I want that."
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:31.420]   "What's the jaguaro?"
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:33.100]   I'm just telling you, this is my life.
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:33.340]   Just...
[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:36.300]   Would you ask Dan Benjamin if he has any positions down there in Austin?
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:36.700]   I don't.
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:37.980]   But seriously, I'd like the chair.
[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:38.700]   It's a really cool chair.
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:39.260]   You're gonna have the chair.
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:39.900]   I'll give you the chair.
[01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.260]   I'll give you the chair.
[01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:42.380]   And then my worker is done.
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:47.980]   Maybe if I do an ad, we can recoup some of our costs.
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:48.460]   Sounds good.
[01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:48.940]   Try that.
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:54.300]   If only you had some worthy advertising with a wonderful product.
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:57.340]   75,000 people listen to this show every week.
[01:22:57.340 --> 01:22:59.740]   It is a very successful show.
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.820]   That means a total of 300,000 every month,
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:04.540]   which is comparable to the subscription of Mac World Magazine.
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:07.500]   But we don't show up anywhere on iTunes.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.260]   Like there's none of the lists.
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:10.460]   Not that we're bitter.
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:12.220]   Well, it's like, I give up.
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.300]   I give up.
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:15.260]   You win Apple.
[01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:16.460]   Steve, you won.
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:17.020]   It's okay.
[01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:18.060]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:18.700]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:23.020]   I held up the laptop and took pictures at the iPad announcement.
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:24.220]   You win.
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.340]   I give up.
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:31.100]   Let's say if you're interested in creating a website, perhaps you are.
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.700]   I know you do this all the time.
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:33.740]   And I am doing this.
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:38.780]   I got access before the folks at Squarespace and Anthony realized
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.540]   that Twit was a dying brand.
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:43.420]   They gave me access to Squarespace 6.
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:45.820]   And look at this.
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.020]   This is-- I am so excited.
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:48.460]   I'm moving to Leo Gildeskirt.
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:52.780]   Squarespace, everything you need to create an amazing website.
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:53.900]   And they make it so easy.
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:56.780]   If you go to squarespace.com, they've got this big green button that says,
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:57.660]   "Try it free."
[01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:59.660]   For two weeks, you don't need a credit card.
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.340]   You don't need to give them any personal information.
[01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:04.140]   Just your email address so they can email you when the two weeks are up.
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:08.300]   You can use every bit of the Squarespace interface,
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.940]   including their 13 new template redesigns,
[01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:14.220]   their 85 new style options, their two brand new templates,
[01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:20.620]   the 300 Google Web Font Library, which is amazing.
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:24.540]   By the way, it's a simple thing, but using some of these web fonts
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:26.860]   makes a site just look spectacular.
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:28.380]   It looks a lot more refined.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:31.980]   It's funny because we're so used to the, you know, aerial,
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:34.780]   health, whatever it is, health, vetica, the four fonts or five fonts.
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:36.460]   It makes a big difference.
[01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:37.980]   It just gives it a certain--
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:41.420]   Genesiquant to yes, maple butter.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:42.380]   It looks designed.
[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:43.260]   It looks designed.
[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:44.780]   Couldn't be easier now.
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:47.820]   Of course, if you are a designer, you can also use all of the tools you're used to,
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:51.260]   like they have a CSS editor now with coloring and everything.
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:54.300]   It's just beautiful if you're a CSS expert,
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:55.340]   but you don't have to know it.
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:58.140]   That's the point to use all of these great features.
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:01.740]   Take a look at some of the example sites and you'll see,
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:05.180]   here's a coffee place, Quills Coffee, that uses Squarespace.
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:07.260]   This makes me want to drink Quills Coffee.
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:10.460]   Just beautiful stuff.
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:17.980]   So whether you're a store, whether you're a blog, whether you're a photographer,
[01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:22.700]   they've got portfolios, whether you're a school, Squarespace is fantastic.
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:26.300]   And all you got to do is click that try it free button to get a good sense of what they can do.
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:33.180]   They even, if you go to workshops.squarespace.com, they even offer free live classes.
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:35.340]   And the support is amazing.
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:38.140]   I mean, you send them requests and it comes right.
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:39.340]   I mean, it's not just us.
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:41.340]   I mean, I've talked to a lot of people about it.
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:41.740]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:42.540]   They're the same as Hover.
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:43.740]   You know, it's very committed.
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:44.220]   Very, very.
[01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:46.460]   And we try to work only with companies like that, to be honest.
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:48.860]   So I don't want to work with a company that's going to,
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:53.420]   I don't know, you try to renew the, you know, reset your password and they never respond,
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:54.300]   and eventually give up.
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:55.580]   I don't want to work with that kind of company.
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:57.980]   Squarespace is fantastic.
[01:25:57.980 --> 01:25:58.860]   They're responsive.
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:01.740]   And if you want to buy, and they're very affordable, by the way,
[01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:04.060]   I should explain because I think it's not always obvious.
[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:07.900]   This is both web hosting and the great content management system together.
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:10.140]   And it's good to have them together because it's automatically updated.
[01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:11.260]   It's always secure.
[01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:14.540]   You really want to, and you cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:20.620]   We bring down sites all the time because of the very sophisticated virtual network technology
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:24.620]   that they use when you get a lot of traffic to your site, just ramps up.
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:26.940]   And you're building a site where you hope that someday you're going to be, you know,
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:31.740]   getting the big bucks, you know, selling your company for $180 million a single.
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:37.260]   You want to make sure that when you actually get on the quiz, you know, like on Sunday,
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:38.780]   that your site doesn't actually melt.
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:39.980]   Somebody came on the radio show.
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:44.940]   He had such a good idea for, it's kind of the rotten tomatoes for car.
[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:45.260]   Right.
[01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:45.820]   For cars.
[01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:49.740]   So he used to, he was the editor-in-chief at edmunds.com, started this up.
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:55.660]   And the aggregate, all the ratings of the different magazines and stuff on a car.
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:58.140]   So if you want to know, like, it's a great idea.
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:00.780]   And he talked about it on the website, site went down immediately.
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:06.140]   So he's got this great plug on the radio show, million, and boom, it just crashed.
[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:07.020]   It happens all the time.
[01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:08.940]   I have never crashed a square space site.
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:10.540]   We try all the time on the show.
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:13.580]   We did it on Twitter where you have a huge live audience.
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:15.500]   Couldn't bring it down in our blog.
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:17.340]   I'll go there right now inside that to a TV.
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:18.140]   You can't bring it down.
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:21.980]   $12 a month, but you can save.
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:24.940]   That's, you know, there's different plans, but that's the personal plan.
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:30.940]   You can save on any of these plans 30% for the first three months when you use offer code MAC break three.
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:32.220]   So that's our deal.
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:36.540]   MAC break three, four, 30% off for three months.
[01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:40.300]   Squarespace is fantastic.
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:43.900]   And I, you know, I've got Leo Villan, Squarespace, but I want to tweak it some more.
[01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:44.940]   I'm using Squarespace 6.
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:45.500]   It's really fun.
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:46.540]   It's really cool.
[01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:49.340]   Time now for our tips and our, you haven't been here so long.
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:51.180]   We have not really done iOS tips.
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:51.980]   You have an iOS tip.
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:52.940]   You want to pass along or no?
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:53.260]   I do.
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:53.740]   You do.
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:53.900]   Yeah.
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.340]   Alex Lindsey, go to that.
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:55.820]   Go right at it.
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:56.940]   Pixelcore.com.
[01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:59.020]   So this one, this one actually, we had a bunch of good suggestions
[01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:00.140]   which are going to come up in some future ones.
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:01.420]   This was from one of our producers.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:05.340]   So I have a problem.
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:06.460]   My lucky arm.
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:07.900]   I have a lot of problems.
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:10.700]   But one of my problems is my arms are too short.
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:11.340]   They're getting too short.
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:11.980]   I'm getting older.
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:13.420]   And wait a minute.
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:14.860]   Wait two for your body?
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:16.300]   Too short for my eyes.
[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:17.900]   So hold a phone.
[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:18.140]   Yeah.
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:21.900]   So one of the suggestions from one of our producers, Shanna Cooper,
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:27.180]   is that you can go into general and into your accessibility.
[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:27.740]   Yeah.
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:30.460]   And if you click, if you turn zoom on,
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:34.780]   so zoom is on the iPhone, if you turn zoom on,
[01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:36.140]   it doesn't really say what's going to happen.
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:40.860]   But if you go into your text messages, so here's me talking about.
[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:41.740]   You could zoom in.
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:44.780]   So if you take three fingers, tap it.
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:47.500]   You tap it.
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:48.380]   I didn't know about that.
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:49.660]   And then you take three fingers and you.
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:50.220]   Let me show people.
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:50.780]   Tap it again.
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:52.060]   As you don't mind if I show this text.
[01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:52.540]   That's fine.
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:53.100]   All right.
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:56.780]   So he's turned on an accessibility options on the iPhone.
[01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:58.780]   He's turned on zoom three fingers.
[01:28:58.780 --> 01:28:59.900]   By the way, your batteries died.
[01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:00.380]   I know.
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:01.500]   I can't charge it while it's on.
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.260]   Oh, look at that.
[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:04.060]   He had zooms up.
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:05.020]   But I can't read it.
[01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:06.860]   Well, you have to move it over.
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:08.060]   Anyway, so.
[01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:10.860]   If I have to send the word.
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:11.420]   It depends on where you.
[01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:12.460]   Okay.
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:13.660]   Well, you have to take some practice.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:14.460]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:14.780]   All right.
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:15.500]   Never mind.
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:15.980]   Forget it.
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:17.100]   Forget I said anything.
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:18.220]   It worked for me.
[01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:18.780]   Well, wait, I do it.
[01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:21.180]   See, can you read the edge of that one?
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:22.300]   You have to use three fingers.
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:23.260]   It's because I'm wearing zoom in.
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:23.260]   You're zooming in.
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:23.820]   You're zooming in.
[01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:24.300]   You're zooming in.
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:25.820]   But you can't scroll it around.
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:29.180]   No, you have to use three fingers to scroll it around.
[01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:30.700]   Oh, you do it with three fingers.
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:31.500]   So you go like this.
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.340]   And then you.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:33.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:34.940]   And look at that.
[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:35.660]   I can't refer you.
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:36.940]   Watch this.
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:38.140]   You got to move it down.
[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:39.740]   Oh, no, you're hit.
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:40.220]   There we go.
[01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:41.820]   Oh, look how big it is.
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:43.420]   You can get it really big.
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:44.220]   And if you.
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:45.180]   Yeah, so you can.
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:46.060]   Oh, that's great.
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:47.660]   And then you pop back.
[01:29:47.660 --> 01:29:49.340]   And then you go.
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:51.580]   Anyway, so.
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:51.900]   I wanted.
[01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:53.580]   Is that working on the iPad too?
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.060]   As well?
[01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:54.620]   I don't know.
[01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.660]   Anyway, I was holding it wrong.
[01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:58.300]   It was my fault.
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:29:59.900]   So anyway, very nice.
[01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:00.700]   I thought that was not that.
[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:01.740]   That was a great one.
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:02.780]   Our iOS tips.
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:03.180]   It's all I have.
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:04.540]   Do you have.
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:06.060]   Mike, did you say something?
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:08.620]   I said, oh, not that you're holding it wrong.
[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:13.980]   Andy and I call you have a lion tip for us.
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:16.460]   Yes, this is actually a cool one.
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:19.740]   Where you know how we install a piece of software.
[01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:22.140]   You have to click through this agreement before you will allow
[01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:24.540]   you to use this software.
[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:27.820]   There's actually a feature like that that you can make people click through
[01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:29.820]   before they get to use your Mac.
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:34.780]   So all you have to do is create a document in text edit and say,
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:36.460]   Hi, this is this belongs to the.
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:38.700]   Copernicus school system.
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.620]   You please don't download porn on it.
[01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:43.100]   Please don't use it to allow people to send porn.
[01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:46.620]   Just basically porn is a red letter word and porn should not be associated with this.
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:48.540]   You can put pictures.
[01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:49.820]   No porn pictures.
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:53.740]   And this you just simply save it as with the title policy banner.
[01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:58.700]   One word capital P-O-L-I-C-Y capital B-A-N-N-E-R.
[01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:03.500]   And you stick it inside the system level library slash security folder.
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:07.500]   And from that point onward, every time this machine is booted up,
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:11.180]   before you'll get to the desktop, before you'll get to the login page,
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:13.340]   someone will have to see this document and click say,
[01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:16.060]   Yes, I agree to these terms before you go through.
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:20.540]   Now, I have tried to, I've only found out about this recently.
[01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:24.860]   I've been trying to see if you can get it to attach to just two individual user accounts.
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:30.300]   It'd be great if you could just attach this to a guest account so that if someone tries to use
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:33.740]   your guest account on this machine, you could say, Oh, by the way,
[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:37.340]   yeah, in case you found this in a bus terminal, here's the here's who I am.
[01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:38.780]   Here's where you can return it to.
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:43.820]   Here's the dog who's very, very sad because his owners are sad because this computer has got lost.
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:47.580]   And please click through this before you get to use this evening guest mode.
[01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:51.820]   Unfortunately, apparently the only way I can get it to work is if you actually just have to
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:57.260]   actually restart the Mac from zero and it will affect every single account.
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:32:02.060]   So it is attached to this computer and not from a specific account.
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:05.420]   But either way, it's a really interesting way to present some information,
[01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:09.980]   if whether it's actual terms of use for like a shared computer,
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:13.740]   or just as an extra way of having some information in there in case this machine
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:14.780]   ever gets lost or stolen.
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:16.060]   Excellent.
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:21.820]   And that was the worst good.
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:23.580]   That's actually how lions sound.
[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:27.420]   But it sounded more like Borber Riggmas than a lion.
[01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:29.900]   Oh, it's Larry the OS tip lion.
[01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:34.700]   He gives a five five claws and an emissory.
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:38.620]   Oh, sounds like a war.
[01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:41.980]   Yeah, that really did not sound like a lion the first time I heard it.
[01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:46.780]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:49.500]   Lion who just ate a bell for lunch.
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:52.300]   One of the monsters lion.
[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:53.340]   Let's see if this one's good.
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:58.060]   Better?
[01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:00.220]   A weird blue lion breath.
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:01.260]   All right, never mind.
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:01.900]   I'll find it.
[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:07.660]   That's full specter studios version of lion.
[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:09.740]   That's a wall of lion.
[01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:17.340]   All right, let's start with our picks of the week with Mr. Michael Elgin.
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:18.700]   Elgin.com.
[01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:20.220]   That's right.
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:25.260]   I have something here called the I don't know if you guys are Edgar Allen Poe fans,
[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:30.460]   but there's this new app book thing called I Po Collection.
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:36.140]   And it is it's basically a children's book for adults.
[01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:36.620]   Ooh.
[01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:39.500]   In all these kids books with all the yeah, yeah, I want one.
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:39.980]   Yeah.
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:41.420]   And check out how cool it is.
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:42.860]   It has amazing illustrations.
[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:46.540]   Amazing soundtrack.
[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:47.900]   Wow.
[01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:51.580]   And I don't know if you can see that, but it's very cool.
[01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:54.780]   Has a lot of interactive elements just like the kids books do.
[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:58.780]   For example, if you I don't know if you can see this thing there.
[01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:00.700]   You can just.
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:02.060]   Ooh.
[01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:04.220]   Really nasty stuff.
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:05.260]   So what's that called?
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:05.740]   I Po.
[01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:07.820]   It's called I Po Collection.
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:08.700]   I P.
[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:11.580]   I P O E.
[01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:13.260]   O E collection collection.
[01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:16.620]   It's in the it's in the books category of the app store.
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:19.180]   And it's just a lot of fun.
[01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:23.500]   It's so it has three short stories, the oval portrait, the telltale heart,
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:25.580]   and the mask of the red death.
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:27.660]   These are all very short stories.
[01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:28.140]   Wonderfully.
[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:30.220]   Oh, it's Edgar Allen.
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:32.300]   Oh, yes Edgar Allen Poe got it.
[01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:37.660]   And yeah, and it's it's there's something about his work that lends itself to
[01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:39.500]   goofing around with an app like this.
[01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:41.660]   It's really pleasurable to read.
[01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:43.740]   There's eerie music throughout the whole thing.
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:44.140]   There's like.
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:46.780]   Oh, yeah, it's it's really a lot of fun.
[01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:52.220]   And it's kind of going to be a year of Edgar Allen Poe because the Raven is coming out this year.
[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:52.380]   I know.
[01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:52.860]   Thank you.
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:53.420]   Thank you.
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:58.460]   So it's highly recommended three ninety nine in the app store and is it is.
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:34:59.180]   Is it is it spooky?
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:04.140]   It's very spooky, but it's spooky in a kind of cartoony.
[01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:05.980]   Fun way.
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:09.820]   Did you imagine what Edgar Allen Poe would think of this?
[01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:13.100]   If he could see it, I mean, it would just blow his mind.
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:13.340]   Yeah.
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:15.740]   And he would probably get it.
[01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:17.260]   Oh, he totally dig it.
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:19.340]   I want them to do HP Lovecraft next.
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:22.620]   It's really on that.
[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:23.180]   How much is it?
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:24.700]   Three ninety nine.
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:26.540]   God, it's gory.
[01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:28.140]   Love it.
[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:30.620]   I'm buying that tonight.
[01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:31.020]   Awesome.
[01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:34.220]   I might make that my Mac break pick actually my iPad pick.
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:35.740]   Thank you, Mike Elgin.
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:37.900]   Andy, not co your pick of the week.
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:44.220]   My pick is something that the that iOS has needed for a long, long time, a really muscular
[01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:44.780]   music player.
[01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:50.460]   This is what I've called on cue by Dan Peraldi, a very, very good writer.
[01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:53.500]   He's through right for the the unofficial Apple web blog.
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:55.660]   He's worked on this for for a few years now.
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:57.820]   He recently came up with version five.
[01:35:57.820 --> 01:36:04.540]   What I like about it is that it's it's much better than the built in the standard iTunes player
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:09.020]   because it really does understand the concept of how you tend to listen to music when you've got
[01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:10.860]   several gigabytes on a device.
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:12.140]   So it understands this concept.
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:14.220]   I don't know if you can see it over my shoulder here.
[01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:15.340]   I'll duck out of the way.
[01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:19.260]   I've had to terminate the the squirrel has been terminated.
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:19.820]   Oh, dear.
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:22.060]   So it's number one.
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:25.980]   It's a this runs on your iPhone or your iPhone or iPad.
[01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:26.300]   Okay.
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:27.580]   So it's universal app.
[01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:32.940]   So instead of having just like one list of your music, what it gives you is that it gives you a
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:39.020]   standard music browser over here on the side of the screen here is your cue of tunes that
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:40.460]   you've selected to play.
[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:45.100]   And as you're you can be you can actually just take any piece of music and drag it here.
[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:47.740]   You can take any piece of music as you can see it follows my finger.
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:50.300]   You can drag it here into the top and then it immediately starts playing.
[01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:51.260]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:54.620]   And as you're listening to that, you can say, oh, actually want to hear golden slumbers after that.
[01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:57.100]   Just drag that to the left into your into your cue.
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:37:01.900]   And as your as things are playing, you can actually re-ordering your cue saying,
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:03.980]   oh, I want back in the USSR to be playing next.
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:05.260]   I don't want to have to wait for that.
[01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:08.220]   So it's really, really easy to make these plays.
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:11.500]   It's not just like this, this, these simple like point and click.
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:13.100]   That's all you can do.
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:16.860]   Build one like instant instant playlist with a standard player.
[01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:20.540]   You can really be very, very interactive adhold albums, adhold artists,
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:23.980]   be editing as you go as your as your as your wins go.
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:30.700]   It also adds smart playlist features so that if you want to if they call the smart cue,
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:34.220]   where it doesn't give you all of the features of an iTunes smart playlist,
[01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:40.860]   you can't, but you can simply say, I want you to give me, I'm going to create a new smart cue.
[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:46.860]   I'm going to call this Halliburton because it brings the pain in a congressionally legal way.
[01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:48.300]   But you can say, please match.
[01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:55.500]   You basically say, give me a bunch of Beatles songs that has never been,
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.940]   that have been played before by on cue or by the built-in music player.
[01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:04.140]   You can say, but then as you keep adding more music to your iTunes, to your on device library,
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:06.700]   it will of course keep, keep manipulating it that way.
[01:38:06.700 --> 01:38:09.660]   So it's a double barrel recommendation.
[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:11.820]   It's a really good player for what it is right now.
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:17.500]   Especially if you're like in a party sort of mode where you really want to take sort of an
[01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:19.660]   active interest in what's playing at any given moment.
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:23.580]   But also because I thought the first version was kind of interesting.
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:26.300]   He showed to me before you even released version 1.0.
[01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:28.300]   I thought it was kind of interesting.
[01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:30.380]   The next versions were good, better.
[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:32.300]   This version is one that I really, really like.
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:34.940]   I can't wait to see what he does with the next version.
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:37.580]   He keeps adding to it and keeps making it better and better.
[01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:42.940]   I'm hoping that the next version with a smart cues feature will give me something back
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:48.060]   that I lost ever since Apple introduced the iCloud, which is a really predictable way
[01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:50.300]   of being able to listen to podcasts.
[01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:51.580]   So I don't have to keep managing it.
[01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:55.820]   I don't have to keep wondering, why did you not sync these three new podcasts?
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:39:01.180]   Even though my smart playlist says specifically, you should have copied over these three things
[01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:02.940]   that we're just added today that I haven't listened to yet.
[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:04.780]   Why do you not like me iCloud?
[01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:06.220]   Something like this.
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:13.660]   I really think that the time has long, long passed for them to be a really good music player on the
[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:16.460]   iPod and the iPod, iPhone, and the iPad.
[01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:19.420]   I don't think that Apple's built-in players or anything like that.
[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:21.340]   I mean, also, I mean, take a look at this.
[01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:26.220]   You can also bring up a whole bunch of more information.
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:28.700]   So you can bring up the entire album from there.
[01:39:28.700 --> 01:39:29.660]   You can bring up.
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:31.900]   There's a whole bunch of double tap and triple tap.
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:36.460]   There are a whole bunch of different cues for doing things.
[01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:42.380]   But it's much easier to bring up related information about individual tracks on here than it is in other things.
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:45.420]   It has ties into Last FM's library.
[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:49.820]   So if you want to find related artists, if you want to find biographies of these performers,
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:51.340]   you can get all this from the app.
[01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:53.500]   It really is something that I think Apple would hope.
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:58.140]   I guess to sum up, I should say two things.
[01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:04.060]   I hope that either Apple buys this product for Dan or steals from it mercilessly,
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:07.420]   because this is something that we really, really need on iOS right now.
[01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:08.780]   It's a really good music player.
[01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:10.060]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:13.900]   I hope that they're inspired to improve iTunes.
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:16.620]   I'm hoping they put him out of business.
[01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:19.980]   I hope they give Dan a lot of money for this or hire him,
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:22.060]   because that would be the nice way of things happening.
[01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:25.980]   But the fact is, I have never been really, really happy with the built-in music player.
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:28.220]   So I'm really, really keen to get an app like this.
[01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:29.100]   Oh, 29.
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:33.260]   And there's another one that's on SpaceQ that is not the same from Pegasus.
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:34.540]   That's the one I was showing.
[01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:35.580]   This is the one you want.
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:38.620]   The one from Pegasus has terrible reviews.
[01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:41.980]   So this is a much nicer than what I was showing briefly.
[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:43.020]   I had the wrong one.
[01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:45.420]   C-U-E-O-N-C-U-E, no space.
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:50.540]   The music player, as you said by Dan Poor-Hadi, P-O-U-R-H-A-D-I.
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:51.500]   That's the right one.
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.420]   Very cool.
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:57.100]   Can't wait to try that iPad or iPhone 299.
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:59.740]   As long as we're talking music, I want to mention,
[01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:02.940]   for a long time on the iPad, if you wanted to use a music service,
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:09.340]   ARDIO was the only one that had an iPad-specific app.
[01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:12.540]   You had to use the iPhone app for Spotify.
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:13.980]   You still do, which drives me crazy.
[01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:15.420]   I wish Spotify do an iPad app.
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:18.860]   But the good news is MOG, which is, I think, an excellent music service,
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:21.820]   is now offering an iPad app.
[01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:24.940]   Just came out with one that will use the iPad screen fully.
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:27.580]   MOG has a lot of nice features.
[01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:29.660]   I'm a big MOG fan.
[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:31.180]   They have high quality streaming.
[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:36.700]   This also supports radio stations, Pandora-style radio stations.
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:38.860]   I use Pandora a lot.
[01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:43.180]   MOG, you might prefer it as artist-specific artist only.
[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:45.660]   They have a little slider that you can customize it with.
[01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:48.940]   320 kilobits streaming, which is really nice.
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:52.460]   And I think that that's the best quality available out there.
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:55.900]   $10 a month, just like Spotify, just like ARDIO.
[01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:58.460]   They're all kind of the same basic stuff.
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:00.700]   But MOG now has an iPad app.
[01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:03.340]   I'm a MOG subscriber, so I'll be very happily using that.
[01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:05.900]   Actually, I mean, I become completely obsessed with Spotify.
[01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:09.660]   I don't understand why Spotify has not updated to do an iPad app.
[01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:10.300]   I think it's frustrating.
[01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:11.020]   It doesn't.
[01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:11.820]   I use it all day.
[01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:16.060]   So the big thing is being able to sync up with the different computers and my phone.
[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:19.260]   And I'm constantly making new mixes and sharing them with people.
[01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:22.220]   So the thing is, the one thing I hate about Spotify is I don't really want everyone to want
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:23.740]   know that I listen to certain bands.
[01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:24.860]   You could turn that off.
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:27.340]   I try to turn it off, and it keeps on wanting to turn me back on Facebook.
[01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:27.900]   You mean?
[01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:31.420]   Well, Facebook, I can turn off, and then it keeps on showing it on Spotify.
[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:33.740]   So I keep on going to a private session, private session, private session.
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:38.140]   But the big thing is, if I want to send friends, I make a mix.
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:40.700]   I can send someone else in Spotify.
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:44.620]   And then all of my devices are being synced instantly every time they turn on,
[01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:46.060]   except for the Android.
[01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:46.940]   I don't know why it doesn't.
[01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:49.100]   So we use it on the radio show.
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:51.980]   We make a Spotify playlist of all the music that we use.
[01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:53.820]   But no iPad app.
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:56.060]   So RDO has had the only one for a long time.
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:57.020]   MOG now does.
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:58.860]   This has got to put some pressure on Spotify.
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:42:59.420]   I think you're right.
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:01.340]   I think Spotify of the three is the best service.
[01:43:01.340 --> 01:43:03.020]   But it doesn't have everything.
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:03.660]   No, Peter Gabriel.
[01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:04.700]   We're not very much Peter Gabriel.
[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:05.180]   It's really kind of--
[01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:06.540]   Yeah, it's a little weird sometimes.
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:07.500]   It's like you're really--
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:08.300]   Like put on there.
[01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:09.500]   --like all the who, but not--
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:09.660]   Right.
[01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:12.140]   --let my love open the door.
[01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:14.780]   Like, because I was watching "Ghost Point Blank," and I was like,
[01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:16.300]   "Oh, I'd really like to have that in a mix."
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:18.540]   Yeah, sometimes I get playlists with their great ads.
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:19.660]   Yeah, you're like, "What? Come on."
[01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:19.660]   Really?
[01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:20.380]   And I have that.
[01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:21.260]   Are you kidding me?
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:22.220]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:23.980]   You're pick of the week, sir.
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:26.780]   So I'm doing a return pick because I shot some cool stuff.
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:27.500]   I have a gimbal.
[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:30.380]   Yeah, so they've changed it, though.
[01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:31.500]   There's a new gimbal.
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:34.140]   Well, they improved it based on your feedback, actually.
[01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:34.620]   Oh, really?
[01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:35.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:36.860]   One of the problems was taking it off.
[01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:37.740]   It was impossible.
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:40.860]   In fact, I gave away my gimbal because I borrowed somebody's iPhone
[01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:41.580]   to put the gimbal on.
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:42.540]   You took it off much easier.
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:43.260]   Yeah.
[01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:44.940]   So what happened was, is what they did is they put a little--
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:46.140]   Put a little teflon in there.
[01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:48.060]   No, instead of having rubber there, they put--
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:48.460]   Uh-huh.
[01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:49.020]   --help.
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:50.460]   Turns out that was the whole--
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:50.940]   That was it.
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:51.500]   So that works.
[01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:55.020]   So this is still one of the best cases, if not the best case.
[01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:57.740]   So notice the shot so you know where you're showing it.
[01:43:57.740 --> 01:43:58.540]   OK, there we go.
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:43:59.900]   So you have this little case here.
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:01.100]   And--
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:03.820]   So that's the negative, is that you have to use a special case.
[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:05.340]   But when you have the case--
[01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:05.980]   When you have the case--
[01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:06.940]   You look what you can do.
[01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:07.420]   --slide it on.
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:09.820]   And what's nice about it is, is that you're able to--
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:12.300]   So once you get the slit on, you have this nice little slot
[01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:12.780]   here.
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:13.100]   Right.
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:14.780]   And this slot, this is a tripod mount,
[01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:16.140]   and you just slide it on like that.
[01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:17.260]   And you can put it on your tripod,
[01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:18.220]   and you can do your little thing here.
[01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:19.500]   You use this instead of the alley.
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.340]   No, not instead.
[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:21.740]   It's like--
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:22.860]   It just gives you another thing.
[01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:23.420]   It's another thing.
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:24.460]   So I can put that on the tripod.
[01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:25.180]   I can put this one.
[01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:26.700]   It's just nice because this is a nice little tripod.
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:28.700]   That's a hand held.
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:31.100]   You can do a hand held where you can set it down.
[01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:34.140]   And the big thing is, is when you're out on the road
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:35.980]   and you want to slide it in, you just go--
[01:44:35.980 --> 01:44:36.780]   And you're done.
[01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:39.020]   And there's not a lot of screwing around with it,
[01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:39.580]   like that.
[01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:41.180]   And then they have a kind of a test case.
[01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:43.100]   Gordon Fowler was actually here over the weekend.
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.700]   And he said, look at this.
[01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:46.700]   Is that somebody else's?
[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:47.820]   No, this is his.
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:49.100]   This is just a prototype.
[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:49.580]   Oh.
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:50.540]   A metal one.
[01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:50.940]   So--
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:51.420]   But this has--
[01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:52.460]   They don't sell this yet.
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:53.100]   Not yet.
[01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:55.580]   But anyway, so if you go to my G+ page,
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:56.580]   did I send you this?
[01:44:56.580 --> 01:44:56.780]   No.
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:45:00.780]   He shot Twit Panoramas.
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:01.280]   Oh.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:01.980]   So go to my G+ page.
[01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:02.700]   And was he here?
[01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:03.260]   He was here.
[01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:04.180]   Oh, you sent me an email.
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:05.340]   You did send me an email about this.
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:06.340]   Yeah, I wasn't here that day.
[01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:06.780]   Yeah.
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:09.660]   So the Panoramas on my G+ page, you'll
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:12.060]   are shot with an iPhone.
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:13.580]   And when you see it, you'll understand
[01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:14.380]   why that's impressive.
[01:45:14.380 --> 01:45:15.660]   I mean, they are--
[01:45:15.660 --> 01:45:18.780]   I think the original files were 180 megabytes.
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:21.420]   I mean, it was insane.
[01:45:21.420 --> 01:45:23.180]   Well, the iPhone has a great camera.
[01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:25.260]   And especially if you're doing a Panorama.
[01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:27.260]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:29.620]   It's on 360cities.net.
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:30.700]   Yeah, and there's a link there.
[01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:35.780]   If you search for Twit, you will see the Twit command center.
[01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:36.100]   And there's--
[01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:37.820]   So this is UBQ.
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:38.740]   Is that how you pronounce that?
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:39.260]   UBIC.
[01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:39.740]   UBIC.
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:40.820]   And this is--
[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:41.460]   Wow.
[01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:42.460]   Look at the quality.
[01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:43.860]   Yes.
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:45.260]   I think you can zoom in there.
[01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:46.660]   But it's like--
[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:48.580]   [SIGHS]
[01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:49.780]   So he used that mount.
[01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:50.340]   This mount.
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:52.260]   This is kind of a prototype mount.
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:52.780]   Wow.
[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:54.020]   I'm getting queasy.
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:55.020]   But that's--
[01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:56.940]   But I get queasy any time I come in here
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:58.220]   when I think of how much money.
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:45:59.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:00.740]   Yeah, you're just looking at the Panorama.
[01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:03.700]   It's not the wide FOV.
[01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:04.300]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:05.300]   So--
[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:06.300]   [SIGHS]
[01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:07.300]   Look at that.
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:08.300]   Look at that.
[01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:09.300]   What happened?
[01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:10.540]   I don't know what you--
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:12.020]   Oh, it went to another image.
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:13.020]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:14.620]   Now look at-- and look down.
[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:15.820]   See if you can roll.
[01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:16.820]   No, that's going to take you.
[01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:18.340]   [SIGHS]
[01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:19.740]   Look at how much data there is.
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:20.500]   There's a ton.
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:21.100]   So you do--
[01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:23.660]   We've got to do this with the bricks.
[01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:24.860]   We did a gig of Pan in the bricks,
[01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:26.260]   but this is very nice.
[01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:27.540]   We'll do some more.
[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:28.060]   Wow.
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:29.620]   That's pretty cool.
[01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:30.620]   [SIGHS]
[01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:32.180]   Anyway, how much is that?
[01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:32.540]   And--
[01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:34.140]   This is still in process.
[01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:35.820]   They don't sell that handle yet.
[01:46:35.820 --> 01:46:39.260]   But as a device as far as something
[01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:41.420]   to attach quickly when you actually
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:43.220]   want to use a tripod and so on and so forth.
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:44.380]   And it feels really great.
[01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:47.540]   And the one big problem with it was taking it off your iPhone
[01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:49.060]   was like a surgery.
[01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:50.340]   And they've fixed it.
[01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:51.540]   That's why I wanted to talk about it again.
[01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:53.460]   Yeah, because I lost--
[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:56.180]   I was demonstrating it on the Daily Gizwiz.
[01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:56.700]   Right.
[01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:58.180]   And I didn't have my iPhone with me.
[01:46:58.180 --> 01:46:59.420]   So I borrowed a listener--
[01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:01.380]   one of our studio audience members' iPhone.
[01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:02.060]   I couldn't get it off.
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:05.340]   So I had to give him the gimbal.
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:06.140]   They sent me another one.
[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:07.420]   That was very nice of them.
[01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:09.340]   So anyway, that improvement has made a huge difference.
[01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:09.860]   Awesome.
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:11.580]   You're looking for just the right one to have a tripod
[01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:13.180]   and so on and so forth.
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:13.700]   It's pretty nifty.
[01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:17.660]   And how much would it be for the stuff that they make that is not--
[01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:19.620]   Is it all-- you get all of that in one kit?
[01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:20.620]   Yeah.
[01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:22.580]   One kit on the 99 or 149.
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:24.580]   And you get all these little bits and pieces.
[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:28.420]   This is the pro version, which is, I think, of the set.
[01:47:28.420 --> 01:47:30.420]   What is the website for the gimbal?
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:31.620]   I think it's UBIQ.
[01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:35.340]   Why are you B-I-Q dot C-O-M?
[01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:37.420]   Here we go.
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:42.980]   And you can get the gimbal there.
[01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:43.460]   That's cool.
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:44.660]   G-Y-M-B-L.
[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:46.140]   There you go.
[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:46.860]   And the gimbal pro.
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:47.420]   Is that a pro?
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:48.420]   Is that what you've got?
[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:48.820]   That's the pro.
[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:49.780]   Of course it is.
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:50.980]   Alex never use anything.
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:52.580]   Am I a church?
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:53.700]   Only the pro.
[01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:55.900]   Yeah, anyway.
[01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:58.380]   It's still, I think, the best all around mount
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:47:59.660]   that you're going to get for your--
[01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:01.500]   I mean, if you really want to be able to have something
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:03.260]   that you can travel with.
[01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:05.620]   Alex Lindsey is at the PixelcorePixacore.com.
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:08.620]   If you want to join that guild of multimedia artists
[01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:10.460]   learning, working together.
[01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:11.700]   Please talk to us.
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:12.700]   I know.
[01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:13.460]   We're not--
[01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:14.220]   No, no, you don't need to--
[01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:15.140]   we're just growing so fast.
[01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:16.340]   We just need more members who are going to--
[01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:16.780]   That's awesome.
[01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:17.380]   We're going to reopen it.
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:19.500]   In other words, you have so much work to do.
[01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:20.940]   That you need more people to join.
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:21.700]   We're just constantly.
[01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:22.940]   So you can give them work.
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:23.300]   We don't--
[01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:24.140]   Yeah, it's--
[01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:26.020]   So that should be enough incentive to join.
[01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:27.300]   Yeah, so the--
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:28.260]   Yeah, we're a little busy.
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:29.660]   It's a good way to get busy.
[01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:30.020]   I know.
[01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:32.860]   So anyway, we're going to reopen the membership soon.
[01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:33.980]   We can't.
[01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:35.380]   We-- it's been closed for a while,
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:36.980]   because we were doing a lot of some stuff.
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:38.180]   And so we're going to--
[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:39.420]   we'll talk about it in the next week or two,
[01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:40.900]   because we're reopening it specifically
[01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:42.900]   because we have so much work.
[01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:44.020]   We need more people to absorb it.
[01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:45.060]   So that's good.
[01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:45.540]   Yeah.
[01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:47.060]   That's a good thing.
[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:48.700]   You can also find Alex's podcast
[01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:49.700]   at pixelcore.tv.
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:51.300]   And every Thursday, they do a live stream
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:52.340]   for pixelcore.com.
[01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:53.180]   Almost every Thursday.
[01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:54.540]   Is that busy part that has been killing?
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:55.060]   I bet it.
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:56.140]   Our internal podcast.
[01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:57.820]   You're out of town.
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:00.540]   Yeah, but we're going to be doing a lot more streaming soon.
[01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:01.300]   Go stay tuned.
[01:49:01.300 --> 01:49:02.660]   Good.
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:05.020]   We also want to thank Mike Elgin for joining us.
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:08.380]   He is a regular on Google+, or just go to elgin.com.
[01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:09.860]   That'll take you to his Google+ page.
[01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:12.260]   And that's where he now creates his newsletter.
[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:15.340]   So you can watch it in process.
[01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:16.780]   And then, of course, subscribe to the newsletter.
[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:19.060]   So you get it in your mailbox.
[01:49:19.060 --> 01:49:19.780]   That's right.
[01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:22.300]   And I'm also on Cult of Mac every week.
[01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:23.180]   That's right.
[01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:24.100]   You're doing a lot of that now.
[01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:25.260]   That's great.
[01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:25.980]   Love that.
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:27.940]   Cult of Mac.com.
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:29.220]   Yeah, we love Leander.
[01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:30.340]   We love Cult of Mac.
[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:32.740]   And that's great to see you right in there.
[01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:33.820]   Thank you.
[01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:35.540]   Thank you for joining us, Mike.
[01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:38.660]   Andy Nocko's at the Chicago Sun Times and his website,
[01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:40.260]   www.cwob.com.
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:44.660]   But if you're ever at the Boston Public Gardens,
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:46.340]   look for him in his squirrels.
[01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:48.260]   Performing squirrels.
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:50.060]   Andy and his nuts perform nightly.
[01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:53.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:58.420]   Uninfiliated with nutsforsquirals.org.
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:49:59.780]   Andy, always a pleasure.
[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:00.780]   Thank you for being here.
[01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:05.300]   Andy and Nocko's Almanac is a regular audio podcast at 5x5.
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:08.660]   Do you have a live stream of your recording?
[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:10.460]   I know Dan does that with a lot of them.
[01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:13.700]   Yep, that's 5x5/2.
[01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:15.340]   5x5/2.
[01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:18.020]   I'm unprepared for reading a URL.
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:20.380]   But you go--
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:28.700]   Are we all 5x5.tv/live?
[01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:29.260]   Let's try it.
[01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:29.780]   And what time?
[01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:30.860]   Just when do you do it?
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:31.740]   It is live.
[01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:32.860]   When do you do it?
[01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:35.780]   Normally Fridays at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
[01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:38.020]   11 a.m. Eastern 2 p.m. Pacific.
[01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:39.300]   I mean, sorry, that's 8 a.m.
[01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:45.300]   Pacific because you're on the other side on 5x5.tv/live.
[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:46.900]   Live.
[01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:48.700]   I'm going to say live.
[01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:49.700]   Live.
[01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:50.700]   Live.
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:51.700]   Oh, live.
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:52.900]   I'm not going to think of your life now.
[01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:53.900]   Live.
[01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:55.700]   Nocko's Almanac.
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:57.220]   Hey, thank you all for being here.
[01:50:57.220 --> 01:51:00.380]   We do this show 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time
[01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:02.580]   on twit.tv every Tuesday.
[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:04.980]   Unless Apple's got an announcement on Wednesday,
[01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:08.260]   then we move it to Wednesday, but not in the near future
[01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:11.820]   until we get that invitation.
[01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:14.780]   When I thank Eileen Rivera, our producer first, not only
[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:16.980]   putting together the rundown, but doing all the work.
[01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:18.380]   Look, it's Veronica Belmont behind her.
[01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:19.460]   I see it.
[01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:20.540]   That must be coming up.
[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:24.300]   She must be coming up on TNT.
