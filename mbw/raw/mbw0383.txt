[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to MacPray, Weekly Andy and Aco, Renee, Richie and Alex
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   Lindsey are here to celebrate the end of 2013, the beginning of 2014, and just a word of warning,
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.080]   I don't want you to be upset, but sometime during this show, this bottle of champagne will
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.400]   spontaneously erupt. Stay tuned. MacPray Weekly is next.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.040]   NetCasts you love. From people you trust.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:38.640]   Manwit for MacPray Weekly is provided by cashfly@cacfly.com.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:48.960]   This is MacPray Weekly, episode 383, recorded December 31st, 2013.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.040]   Buy that ferret. It's time for MacPray Weekly to show the covers your Apple needs,
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.480]   and it is our New Year's Eve edition part of our 24 hours of 2014. Hello everybody.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.160]   I am Leo Laport and I've been here since four in the morning,
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.600]   and I'm going to be here till four in the morning because we're going to ring in New Year and every
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.240]   time zone of the entire globe. Actually, turns out, little did I know, there's 25 hours.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:25.440]   How could that be? The sun, the earth, the moon, rotation? Turns out that New Zealand opted for
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.480]   to go into summertime, and so they are actually, we missed them. They started at 3 a.m. We missed
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:40.160]   them. Samoa and American Samoa are the bookends. Samoa where the day begins, or Guam, and then
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.480]   American Samoa is the last, and we're going to try to get all of those in there.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.240]   If you work in one and live in the other, wouldn't that be weird? You can just go back and forth and
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.560]   you lose a whole year each time. That's Renee Ritchie from iMOR.com. Happy New Year Renee.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.280]   Happy New Year Leo. You look fantastic. I'm wearing my tux.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.960]   So James Bond. Bold. Yeah, I don't think James Bond wears striped bow ties. This is a little more
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.640]   James Banker. Also here, Andy Ennaco from the Chicago Sun Times. Hello Andrew.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.160]   Hello Leo. I was going to say it's more like when you have someone who's been running a company
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.160]   very successfully on the money that could raise, they need to get that next level of funding,
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.520]   and now they have to prove to people who can write a $500 million check that, oh, I guess I better
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.800]   now get my picture on Forbes wearing a bow tie and a nice suit. Nailed it. Half a billion
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.760]   dollars? Sure. Nailed it. That's exactly what I'm up to. Also, 10 points out of 10 for going for
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.000]   the actual nodded tie and not the, because that's a clip on it's a it's a it's a slop. Yes, lip
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.760]   off. No, it's a real deal because how else can I untie it and start singing, you'll never walk alone.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:59.600]   You start off by berating a stage hand. Say something that's vaguely racist and then
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.720]   awkwardly pull her on the stage. Just say, oh no, see, we're a failure. We love each other.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.880]   We see how comfortable she is on the stage with me. So I could call her that horrible word.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.400]   We love each other. So I, you know, that was really what I was telling myself all day yesterday.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.440]   If Jerry Lewis could do this year in, year out, I can do it once.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.440]   Hey, hey, hey, look who's here. Alex Lindsey, our bartender for the day. Yes. You're going to do
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.880]   a little mixology. Oh, you have a couple drinks. Now, we're gonna do that on camera.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.960]   Yep. So I'm going to have to taste each of these. Of course. Oh, yeah, yeah. In fact,
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.120]   if I'm making it, if you have to drink the whole thing. No, no, no, no, no, no. I have a, I'll get
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.880]   Jeff Needles in here to finish them off. They're going to be little. You remember my little classes?
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.520]   Yeah, I know. But I, you know, if I start drinking now, I won't make it. I really won't.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.000]   You see a big number. If you're watching video in the lower right hand corner of the screen,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.080]   that is how many minutes to the next countdown. It is Afghanistan's new year at half past the hour
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.760]   and we will countdown. Do we have, we've been trying to get via Skype people from every
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.880]   time zone, not possible. We have had all sorts of time zones. We had Australia several, they have
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.040]   six time zones. We have several Australians. We had Hong Kong, we had Osaka, we've had the
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.920]   Philippines, we had Cat-Man-Doo. Really? We had Napole. So it's been fun. In fact, every sign you
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.960]   see behind me is a New Year's countdown. We put up a new sign each time. So two minutes till
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:36.480]   New Year's in Kabul, Kandahar, anybody there wants to let us know. If you're still in,
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.720]   if you're still in country and the armed forces, I'd love to hear from you. We have a phone number
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:51.120]   toll free, 8888-ASLEO, 888-27536, 888-27536 toll free in the US and Canada. But if you are in
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.480]   Afghanistan, just use Skype and call that. Love to hear from you. How many balloons do I have to
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.120]   have to pop to get the stuff monkey? I don't know. We don't know which balloon it's in. We don't
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.880]   know which one it's in. You have to pop them all. So, hey, John, where are you going to go to the
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:22.480]   Apple Store and see if they have any Mac Pros lying around? Is he sleeping? So the Mac Pro has
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:29.280]   emerged as we mentioned, but unfortunately, unless you ordered it within seconds of its announced
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.640]   date, you weren't going to get it until next February. That was the rumor. Yeah. Well, I'm on
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.640]   the let me go to store.apple.com and see. Did you get one, Renee? I did not. I think Mark Gurman
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.400]   had the best joke when he said that picture Tim Cook tweeted. That was all of the available
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.480]   supply. Those six units were it for launch day. Well, but there were units for the trade press.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:57.280]   Yes. The tame trade press. Let me buy now and see. I decided not to buy because I thought
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.160]   February, yeah, available ship February. I wanted one now. It's just a big later on later. Yeah.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.040]   December 31st was in theory the day. Is there anybody? John, John, where are you going to go to
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:19.360]   the Apple store, John? Hey, Johnny. Did he do it already? Anyway, $3,000. Andy, did you get one?
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.880]   Were you one of the? I did not. It is definitely not the sort of stuff that I normally write about
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.800]   if they have Apple were to offer me one. I will certainly take one for review, but I will be so
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.120]   damn careful with it because not not it's half of me wants to test it very, very thoroughly.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.560]   The other one wants to be very, very aware of what is my electric bill going to be that month
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.800]   during the three weeks that I have a Mac Pro plugged into my personal grid. We should call Jason
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.520]   Stone got one. Yes. Let's call Jason. I believe he's clicking pizza on top of it right now.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:54.400]   He did say you know he said it's silent. Right. But if you put your Happy New Year,
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:02.480]   Kandahar say, say, say, a, say, a, say, a, a, nay, o, mr. Say, a, nay, o, mr. What does that mean?
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.440]   Over throw. Happy new year. Oh, happy new year and after any. How do you know that? I googled it.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:17.920]   What happened? There's one. Oh, the guy moves. Thank goodness. We were dropping the ball or
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.800]   the balloon drop on one guy. You moved over smart man. Although, frankly, I think that could be
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:31.600]   sensuous. A sensuous. Yeah. I just think it feel like it would be feel good. Like being inside the
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.920]   fruit of the loom. Great man. New comment. Show title.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:45.440]   Jason said that though, when he put his face on it, it's hot air coming out of there. Yeah.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.240]   I would have started with my hand. I wouldn't put my face on first. Yeah. The other funny thing
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.640]   is that I don't think that most of the most of the most of the publications I got them for review.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.280]   I'm not sure they were really ready to photograph it because they weren't prepared for how glossy it is.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.160]   I have had at least two people emailing me and ask, how do I get one of the silver ones?
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.560]   And I'd say what silver one. They sent me a link to a Mac world review. Yeah. It's not silver.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.440]   It's just that it's so glossy that when you have it in a white lab, it just reflects everything
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.840]   around it and it looks like it's a different color. Wow. USA Today got a review unit and of
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:26.080]   course gave it their traditional deep dive. Apple Mac Pro Small, but super powerful.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.360]   It reads the review. Great home theater piece. Yeah. Also known as room, room, room, room.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.360]   Dan Frakes had the best piece so far where he shows how small it is in a slideshow compared
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.560]   to other objects. It's really tiny. It's incredibly tiny. I mean, we do the dimensions.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.560]   It's not like this is a rise. It's like a, like a roadblocks is what it is. Yeah.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.800]   When you actually see it, it's small. That's why we were joking last year that it would be the Mac
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:55.200]   Mini Pro. I still want one. Let's see that that's how you know how pro it is. Rest the Mac Mini comes
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.240]   has only four sides. The Mac Pro has infinite sides.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.480]   Understanding is that store stock isn't great. If you talk to a business rep,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.440]   they might try to help you out, but you'll probably be waiting in line with everybody who
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.440]   ordered them. Well, that's what we did. We called and they said, we don't want to have any.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:19.920]   Did we call it a business rep? I presume we did. I would love to get one now, but I don't think
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.440]   it's going to happen. Here are some of the pictures from Dan's review and Macworld.com.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.480]   It really is small. There it is next to a cheese grater. It looks like, I don't know,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.560]   Pringles can. It looks like a power supply for any computer made before 1990. It really is that
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:42.720]   small. Yeah. Now, one of the things I think we found out, other world computing tore it down and
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:49.200]   noted that it was a socketed CPU, although others have pointed out, yeah, of course it is. All the
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:55.440]   Zons of that class are socketed. But it's not usual for Apple, though. It isn't. A lot of times,
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:01.040]   they solder it right down or they do surface mount. I don't know if I would jump to the
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.640]   conclusion that some did the most upgradable Mac Pro ever. First of all, are you going to put
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:13.360]   in a new chip and is it going to work? I don't think that a user is going to, or even a fairly
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.640]   experienced technician is going to want to do that. It's definitely doable, but I think if it is,
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.040]   if it is a future update upgrade thing, and it's something where you kind of want to send it to
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.880]   somebody who has done more than one of these. I was standing by when someone did something very
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.800]   similar. And even this person who does nothing but handle $8,000 towers every single day of his life,
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.160]   it was, here are nine things I have to do before I even start this, because if I screw this one up,
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.760]   that's a really, really big invoice to get this fixed. Yeah. It starts at $3,000.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:53.760]   Not even just the Mac Pro, but just the CPU. It's just, oh yeah, the CPU itself is $1,500 or
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.720]   something. Yeah. There aren't many of these. It's difficult to manufacture just when you get one
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:04.160]   that's working out of the factory. So yeah, that's one component that is you can either have a very,
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.800]   very good retinomac book Pro, or you can have just the CPU for this new computer.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:14.240]   He's, so here's the I fix it to tear down. And as usual, they do their excellent
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.240]   sterling job of tearing it down. But I don't, I think the jury's out about how
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.920]   upgradable it is. I agree. I don't think you're going to put a new chip in it.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.840]   You can upgrade the RAM. They've always said you could do that, right? Yeah. Yep.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.560]   How about I void my warranty if I just left the cover off all the time. It just looks so much
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.040]   better. It's prettier. It looks like Darth Vader. You do want to have it like runs with the cover
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.000]   off. I don't know from, I don't know myself, but I have someone who has access to one told me
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:48.800]   that it's nothing a paperclip couldn't fix. Permitantly. Molly would got one. She was a guest
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:55.600]   columnist. They're trying out people at the New York Times to replace David Pogue. And
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.520]   they've gone through a number of people, Molly Wood, the latest in the state of the art column.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:06.480]   Futuristic Mac Pro has power to spare. She, at least she was smart or the times are smart. They used
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:13.520]   Apple stock footage for their photo of the Mac Pro. Difficult to shoot, I agree.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.720]   You really want someone like Alex to review it because you want someone who's going to throw
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.840]   a Final Cut Pro and massively parallel tasks at it. Well, I don't know why Apple should definitely
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.080]   send me one. Yes. Well, we're a non-tech because a non will really do those benchmarks.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.960]   All the benchmarks I saw were the kinds I would do. Geek, bench, and Cinebench.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:36.800]   It's not, I don't know what's own. Yeah, non would write his own just specifically to test the
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.840]   memory throughput. And I just, I really want to see what they say about it.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.360]   We'll definitely post stuff once we get ours. We're just trying to negotiate a purchase of a couple
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.960]   of them. Will you be able to get them before February? No, I have no idea. I'm going to try.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.960]   If you buy six, Alex, they come in a really big egg carton. Do they really? Because that's
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.760]   no, no, they come attached with like plastic rings are going to be hilarious. There we go.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:06.480]   Six pack. Yeah, exactly. Six pack. 23 minutes to New Year's in Moscow, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Muscat
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.760]   so if we can get anybody, anybody who's listening, if you're listening in any of those places,
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:21.040]   anywhere that it'll be New Year's in 23 minutes, please call 888-867-5536. It's a toll freedom
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.720]   we're in the US so you can use Skype out to call it or some sort of white product. It won't call
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.200]   you anything, cost you anything because we'd love to drink it with you and drink it and to celebrate
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:36.720]   it with you. And I will be drinking. Wow, this is great. From somebody on your team, this is a Russian
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:43.040]   pink mosquito, semi-sweet. That always worries me when I see semi-sweet on a wine.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:52.960]   I don't know. Nastravia. Nastravia. Dazvidaniatavarish. Have some Sovetskor Miskvato.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:14:00.400]   Yeah. The dollar store has some very, very nice wines. The Russian dollar. The Ruble store.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.720]   The Ruble store. Just don't get the confused with the novelty shampoos they also have.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.920]   Thank you. Did you get this in Russia? No. Freemont.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.840]   What is New Year's in Freemont? Oh, I bet there are a lot of Russians in Freemont. Sure,
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:26.160]   that makes sense. They all came in to make Teslas. So Molly did get somebody with some big 4K files
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:32.720]   to come in and try importing them in. She said it was they were able to preview and play the
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.960]   extremely large video files without delay. But when we started to apply multiple filters in color
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:42.240]   correction, video playback slowed noticeably. And finally Final Cut said drop in frames from
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.200]   playback. But that's to be expected, right? They were 4K. They were 4K. You just have to keep
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.720]   in mind. Yeah. And then we try to do it with any other app. And it just, you know, one thing that
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:58.080]   we've that I've heard already from a few folks is that you definitely can throw. You can definitely
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:04.080]   see what optimization looks like for this machine where it is not just Final Cut is handling a lot
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:09.120]   of video. But you know, Abbott and Premier have not been updated yet. And it's definitely,
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.480]   they're not performing that. It's not like you can throw anything onto a Mac Pro and it's going to
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:20.960]   work like Final Cut. Final Cut was obviously they had the advantage of having a lot of time to optimize
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:27.600]   it. So it's also, I think, Apple's I think part of Final Cut's existence there is to prove to people
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.440]   this is you should, you know, developers, you need to go back, you need to look at what you can do
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.520]   to take advantage of this hardware. We gave you just a lot of hardware to work with. And, you know,
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.640]   in the beginning, I don't think we're going to see a lot of performance improvements on a lot of
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:45.360]   the software until it's rewritten to take advantage of the hardware. Things like OpenCL and yeah.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:59.040]   The Verge did give their video editors the new Mac Pro. And they played with it a little bit.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.280]   I don't want to hear this ad for Call of Duty. I've already lost
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:09.360]   after life. I've already lost half my life. And most of this morning to Paul Theron and Call of Duty.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:16.720]   But there, you know, I think this is, I think the jury's out. We just, we need to see benchmarks.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.200]   We need to see more people using it. And it's one of those things where it's a little bit ahead of
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.800]   the time. There was an interesting conversation on Twitter. I think with Guy English and Chris
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.760]   Leachio and Gus Mueller, who are all developers and they're just anxious to write software for it.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.000]   So we're still on the stage where this device is hugely appealing to people who are super smart
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.720]   about OpenCL and OpenCL. And it'll take some time for them to figure out what kind of apps they can
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.480]   make that'll make a huge difference for those of us who just, you know, use them and don't write them
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:48.800]   necessarily. Would you explain? I don't know. Maybe Alex, what OpenCL is as opposed to OpenCL?
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:57.280]   Well, do you not use this? No, no, it is. I mean, the NVIDIA's version of this would be CUDA, I believe.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:06.480]   So these are, OpenCL is strictly a graphics processing, you know, is how to accelerate graphics
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:12.080]   processing, you know, mostly for real time. Whereas the OpenCL and the CUDA libraries are really
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:16.880]   designed to improve the speed of anything. So the idea is that we're not just using these,
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:23.040]   the hardware for playing back video on your screen, but we're going to use them for
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:28.240]   processing scientific calculations or processing, you know, an application, you know, anything that
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:39.280]   requires a lot of math. It turns out that the GPUs are specifically very designed for, you know,
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:44.400]   obviously big math processing. And so you can do a lot of other things to speed up everything
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:51.920]   beyond just display, which is what all OpenCL does. So this is, you know, as people take more
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:58.400]   advantage of that, you'll definitely see a snappier photo editing, snappier, but also for scientists,
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.600]   it makes a big difference when it comes to calculating big stuff that normally takes lots and lots
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.680]   of machines. And that was the conclusion the Verge came to that the software is going to have to be
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.000]   tuned if you really want to see what this can do. Again, that's what we saw with Final Cut. Final
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.360]   Cut is the only thing really that's been optimized for. I think that's why it was kind of linked to
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.400]   its launch, where you definitely see immediately as soon as you walk away from Final Cut, everything
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:27.200]   not moving as fast. So it definitely will take some time for people to tune this up.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.120]   This really is a supercar.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:36.640]   It's like the moves of 64-bit, you know, applications have to be rewritten for it. And in this case,
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:41.360]   applications have to be rewritten to send all those general computing tasks to the graphics cards
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.680]   instead of the CPU. And that'll take time, but it's hugely interesting for anybody who will
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:50.480]   benefit from doing many, many things at once or just leaving their CPU free to do main stuff while
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.240]   they're processing stuff on the side. It could lead to a whole new class of applications. The
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.920]   thing that's most exciting is that it could create things that we've just never seen before.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:03.840]   Well, and there's a lot of things that you want to do that are both CPU and GPU. Having the CPU
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.720]   be able to work on one thing and having the GPU work on another. For instance, we do a lot of
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:17.200]   hangouts. And the hangouts use CPU, where our compositing apps use GPU, which means we can do
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.720]   both of them on the same computer at the same time and do some pretty interesting things in the
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:27.920]   background. I think this is a computer that's been optimized for Mac OS 10.10 or Mac OS 11,
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.600]   where we're going to see over the next year a trickle of apps that can run this very, very well.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.840]   Apps that are very well targeted towards the sort of people who actually need this Mac Pro as
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.400]   opposed to those of us who are like, "Oh, wow, it's cool. It's tubular and it's the best Apple has.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.680]   I've got money." Great. I want one. But I think that really is going to take some time for every
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.480]   developer and even developers inside Apple to learn how to truly exploit everything that's inside
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:58.480]   this tube. And I do think that it's going to do extremely well on Final Cut and those optimized
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:03.760]   apps over the next year. But when we get up the next big rev of the operating system that was
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:08.240]   targeted specifically towards architecture like this, that's what we're going to see
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:14.640]   that great across the board sort of performance. And I hope that this is not a machine that's
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:22.880]   built to beat benchmark. This is a machine that's built to enable a whole class of apps and a whole
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:30.080]   usage profile that was not possible before we had machines of this power and integrity.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:36.400]   If you're that guy who says it's pretty, and I got the money, should you buy it or would it be a
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:41.680]   mistake to buy it? I'd say no. Well, for a couple of reasons that you're not going to,
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:47.280]   I do think that for most people, a brand new iMac out of the box is going to give them
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.000]   the same performance across the board that they would be hoping to get from a Mac Pro.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.560]   Also, this is always just good advice. Anytime any manufacturer comes up with a brand new
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:03.280]   radical redesign piece of hardware, it's always a good idea to stand back for at least the first
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:10.640]   revision of it. So if there were only six of those Mac Pros that ship, then I think that
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:16.320]   the models are going to be shipping in February are going to be much, much better than anything
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.120]   that's out in public hands today. I think that I think that they're going to have to tweak things
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:26.800]   a little bit to discover where the problems are, where the manufacturing bottlenecks are,
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.280]   where what parts are likely to, what parts in the process are more likely to cause problems
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.600]   than others, and that process is going to have to be refined before. I would be really,
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.600]   really happy spending three to $7,000 on this machine.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.600]   You said something very interesting that for a normal user, the iMac will be as fast.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.840]   I mean, in terms of there's speed and then there's perceptive speed.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:56.560]   For those of us who have been into Macs for, since the mid 80s, we're used to the idea that if
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.120]   we buy the, if we have the consumer level or the mid level Mac, and we suddenly decide,
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.400]   you know what, this time I'm going to get the promo, I'm going to get the best power,
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.720]   we're used to getting across the board performance increases. We went from the,
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:20.080]   we went from the G4, the G5 to Intel. We went from a single core CPU to multiple core CPUs,
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:26.320]   and suddenly everything is faster. I think that it's not so much that the Mac Pro doesn't perform
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.040]   as well as the desktop iMac, but I'm talking about in terms of going from whatever mid range
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.360]   machine you have to the best you can afford with the money that you have. I think that if you,
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:42.000]   if your goal is to spend $3,000 to improve your computing experience and even improve your speed,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.560]   the answer might not necessarily be $3,000 to $4,000 for Mac Pro. The answer might actually be
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:55.360]   how about $1,500 for a desktop iMac, and then $1,500 for the first really, really good
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:01.760]   Nazaret that you have on your network, or finally going in and rooting out every single non-gigabit
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.320]   switch and router that you have on the network and replacing it, or buying better network access,
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:12.000]   or upgrading your hard drives from the whatever USB 2.0's that you've been using to USB 3 or
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.440]   Thunderbolt. So there's a difference between test track performance and actual tactile,
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.520]   oh my god, that would have taken at least half a minute on my old system and now it's done in
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:30.000]   about four seconds. I think for a lot of people, stick with the old machine and simply say I'm
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.880]   going to spend $1,000 buying, replacing all of my onboard storage with flash storage,
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.840]   that in itself will be such a revelation to this person, and they'll sell, they might say $2,000
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.240]   in the process. So all emerging here is that there's a difference between test track speed and
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.920]   actual perceptive speed. And I would completely agree with that. I think that the, I think that
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:57.040]   if you're using Final Cut, it makes sense to buy it right now. I think that because it's going to
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.400]   make a big difference, if you're going to be using big files, and if you're using an HD or 4K,
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:05.520]   I think that if you are, if you're a developer, it makes a lot of sense to buy it right now so that
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.560]   you can figure out how you're going to take advantage of it. I think that it doesn't make sense to
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:16.560]   try to buy it because people are going to develop for it later, only because I think that with any
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:21.760]   brand new hardware with Apple, you're going to waiting for Rev 2 or 3 is usually the best way to go.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.320]   To allow things to kind of settle in, this is a brand new piece of hardware that's being
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:32.640]   gamma tested on everyone who's buying it right now. And so I think that waiting for some of the
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:39.120]   development to catch up, obviously this is going to be a huge point of discussion in June at WWDC
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:44.400]   about really how to fully optimize for the application. But I would wait unless you really know that
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.760]   it's going to make a difference. But I totally agree with Andy that SSDs is, man, you go back
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.080]   to the way to go. Like the thing to do to your computer, like we won't buy any more computers
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:25:00.240]   with that with spinning. I would like to point out that there's SSDs and there's SSDs. Most
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:06.800]   computers will put the SSD on the SATA bus. And even a SATA 6G or you're not going to get the benefit,
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.440]   you're not going to get all the throughput. What Apple's done and it's awesome on the pro is
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:16.960]   put it on the PCI Express bus. Right. Are they doing that on the iMac Renee or is that
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:23.040]   an sad action? The MacBooks for sure are doing it. I know it's on the retinas. Yeah. The fusion
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.120]   drive is still sad, I think. Right. But we don't even, yeah, we don't even touch the
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:31.360]   that would be significant. That would be a significant issue. And a significant
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.480]   exception to what Andy said, which is if it's this guy, oh, you want, then you'd be better off
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:42.960]   getting a MacBook retina or a Mac Pro because it is I mean, it is putting on a PCI Express is
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:47.280]   light years faster. The thing I would go back to is still the same hypercar thing that Andy said,
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:53.280]   it's like, will a Mac Pro increase your workflows? Like saying will a Lamborghini improve your commute?
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:58.480]   If you live on the Autobahn, if you are the stick, you absolutely know. That's great. You know your
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.880]   use case and you're going to do it immediately. If not, would you notice a difference between
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:08.720]   SSD on SATA or on PCI? When you get the new MacBook Air that's on PCI, you absolutely know the speed,
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.280]   but for most people, I don't think they know why. It's just generally faster. And the move to SSD
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:19.840]   is so much faster anyway, they're going from a spinning platter, even to a SATA SSD is so good.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:24.400]   And with the iMac, you also get a display and with the Mac Pro, you'd have to buy a separate
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.280]   display. Maybe one of those $3,000 sharp displays, maybe you want to wait for apples
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:35.520]   4K slash retina display, but it just it adds. If you have more, if you have a lot of money and
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.040]   you just want it to be like Leo said, the best looking home theater PC on your block,
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.080]   go for it. But otherwise, you know, it's Final Cut Pro, it's developers, it's exactly what Andy and
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:50.320]   Alex said. Well, and if you're going to go ahead, Andy, just to cap it off. I mean, there are ways
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:56.080]   to improve your performance by your work performance by buying a $4,000 computer. And then there
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.560]   ways to improve it by buying a $500 chair and better lighting for your office. Yeah, or just a
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.720]   bigger screen or a second screen or a holistic. There are lots of things you can do that might be
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:11.040]   more a better way to spend your buck. One thing that might be surprising for those of you and
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.760]   there are some in the chat room and say, well, I could get an equivalent PC for half that price.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:26.480]   Maybe not. FutureLux.com tried to match the top of the line, $9,599 Mac Pro by putting together off
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:37.920]   the shelf windows components. They got to $11,530. It was a lot more like $2,000 more to build your
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.640]   own PC. And it's a lot uglier and a lot bigger and a lot louder. Not as well integrated and on and on.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.000]   Apple has a deal from the component makers to get the Mac Pro done at that price point. And that's,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.680]   we're starting to, it's the same thing that Tim Cook theory when they said, you know, only Steve
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.880]   Jobs could envision the iPad, but only Tim Cook could get it done for 500 bucks. We're starting to see
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.600]   that go into Max now where they're so good at making these deals, they get those AMD boards
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:07.120]   much below even wholesale cost and allows them to make this incredibly integrated thermal core
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.440]   machine at a much lower price. Well, and I think a lot of that is also the pre-bond, you know,
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.040]   a lot of those deals come from it. And we, I think we'll eventually talk about Apple's
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.640]   money in stores. But a lot of what Apple can do is say, you know, we're going to buy a billion
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.840]   dollars worth of this from you if you give it to us at this price. I mean, they're, you know,
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.320]   they're able to make those kind of commitments and put that money down ahead of time. And that
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:32.000]   definitely gives them a better, more economy for their purchase.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.440]   That's not just that, but for you, you'll be getting a $10,000 Windows machine that's not
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:42.560]   backed by a company that is laser focused on helping developers to get all the performance
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.920]   that that machine is capable of. Well, you wouldn't, in fact, get it from anybody. You'd have to put
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.080]   the parts together. So right, right. You're screwed. It goes on. Good luck.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:55.040]   There are other, I mean, there are other ways that you can do like a Hackintosh Mac and save a
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.400]   lot of money. There are a lot of, and there are a lot of arguments to be made that if you have
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.440]   X dollars to spend on a Mac notebook, here's what you can get for the same, for $500 less on
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:07.840]   the Windows side of it. But this is a, this is a case where this is such a special machine that
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.240]   if you want to get something that is the entire experience of the Mac Pro, I'm not just talking
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.680]   about the quick or road spots, this is that I'm talking about something where you're going to
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.480]   get all the performance that you're paying for that are, that what you, what you can do with it
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.360]   reflects everything that are in the spec sheet for this device. Your money is so much better
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:29.920]   invested with Apple than with any, any Windows manufacturer at this point. And again, I think that,
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.040]   you know, when you're talking about media professionals, when you're talking about scientists, you know,
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.360]   those types of folks, I mean, this could be, you know, this is the computer to beat at the moment.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.360]   It's even faster than eight X boxes in parallel.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:51.360]   And a lot less complicated. I was thinking 2000, you know, whole Blackberries that aren't
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:56.480]   being used any longer. Are you ready in parallel? Are you guys trying to talk me out of buying one?
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:00.640]   No, we're trying to talk you into it, Leo. Oh, you're all fired. Unless you really think I shouldn't.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.720]   You should. It's, it's, it's funny. Exactly. It's, it's, there, there, there are a lot of
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.040]   technologies that are like, I compare them to ferrets, where I don't want to own one, but I want
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.680]   to have a friend who has one. So you can tell me all about it. I can come and play with it sometimes.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.560]   So I'm telling you, buy that ferret, Leo, buy that ferret for the viewers, Leo. You can play with
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:24.240]   it. Like a boat. You just bought this tuxedo and all the buttons have now popped off. Is that my fault?
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.920]   From sitting, there's a defective, uh, tuxedo button.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:34.240]   Well, but you might need to sit in a sharp display is the 4k ones. No, I'm waiting for an Apple cinema.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.680]   Something like that. Yeah. I'm gonna see if they're gonna do it. I think we're gonna get something
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.960]   like that. I think it doesn't make sense to make one without the other. So I'm, I don't have any
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:45.280]   information, but I'm, but I'm gonna wait for a little while before we, uh, probably purchase it.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.200]   I actually don't need more resolution. Lisa, call Joel the tailor. My buttons have popped off.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.520]   Lisa, call Joel the tailor. Get him over here. So my buttons back on.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:31:00.320]   Both buttons have popped off now. My buttons, Terry. Yes. So we're in New Texas.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:06.400]   Yes. Yes. Listeners. That's how excited that the new Mac Pro makes Leo.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:12.320]   But it's very thirsty and how a moment wasn't it? Lovey. Call the tailor. My buttons have popped
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:17.280]   off. Mine's like, you know, but it would be. 2014 Tim Cook puts up the slide. Leo, the port button
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:23.520]   bursting button. Hey, would you clear the phones? Whoever's running our, our phone system. Somebody
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.120]   from Moscow is in the chat room, says he's trying to call. He's getting busy signals. Keep your
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:32.720]   eye peeled. I would love to get somebody from Moscow for our next countdown five minutes away.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:39.440]   Pardon me? Haudenosaunee. Yeah. He's, I gave him the number to call 827, you know,
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:48.160]   yeah. Well, yeah, he says nobody's answering. 888-827-5536. His name is Ramsey Orles. There's
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.480]   actually two guys from Moscow. Hope you're calling from inside the US. Yeah, if you're
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:58.880]   calling from inside the US, it's toll free. All right. Let's talk about the NSA.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:05.040]   How about those guys? Apple says, that's what I say. NSA is industrious. Wow. We were
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:12.000]   talking earlier on the tech news today about the revelation. This revelation comes oddly
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.840]   enough from Reuters. It's not, I don't know if it's one of the Snowden documents or if it's
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:23.200]   other sources, but oh, should I have my phone here? All right.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:33.680]   Ryders says that the NSA has a nearly complete backdoor to access Apple's iPhone.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.440]   Well, that's the Apple bomb talking. The security researcher, Apple bomb, did a talk.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:41.920]   Jacob Apple bomb. Oh, I'm sorry. It's not Reuters. It's Der Spiegel. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:49.040]   The NSA program is called drop out Jeep and allows according to Jacob Apple bomb,
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:54.880]   who is credible, right? It allows the agency to intercept SMS messages, access contact lists,
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:33:03.680]   locate a phone using cell tower data, even activate the phone's camera and microphone remotely.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.600]   Does require physical access to the device at this point, still, although they're working on a
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:13.760]   remote exploit, apparently. Yeah, right. I don't know how we know so much.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:22.880]   Apple says we didn't do it. It's not our fault. So we never, Apple contacted tech
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.720]   crunch with a statement. I'm sure they've contacted others. Here's the full statement.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.880]   Apple has never worked with the NSA to create a backdoor in any of our products, including the
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:37.120]   iPhone. Additionally, we have been unaware of this alleged NSA program targeting our products.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:42.800]   We care deeply about our customers' privacy and security. Our team is continuously working,
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:47.440]   blah, blah, blah, make our blah, blah, blah. Whenever we hear about attempts to undermine Apple's
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:52.080]   industry-leading security, we thoroughly investigate and take appropriate steps to protect our customers.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:59.440]   The last line is killer. We will continue to use our resources to stay ahead of malicious hackers
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:05.280]   and defend our customers from security attacks, regardless of who is behind them.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:12.720]   We have to say that the NSA admiral or whatever that runs the NSA talked about the damage Snowden
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:19.120]   was doing. I think that one of the things about that is specifically that what's happened is
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:25.280]   security has now become the sexy thing to build for all these companies where it is going to be
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:30.240]   the next couple of years these companies are going to be trying to outdo each other on how
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:35.680]   secure they are, which in some ways will shut the NSA out of a lot of this stuff.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:41.440]   Maybe. When you have a company with smart guys and an unlimited budget and a mandate,
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:47.360]   but if you're building the hardware, you've got a lot of money too. It's an arms race where
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:51.280]   the companies that actually care about privacy will spend a lot of money to do it, and governments
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.840]   will spend a lot of money to circumvent it and it'll leapfrog back and forth. It's sad for us.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:03.520]   It's exactly like how cars got awful mileage and awful safety standards until whatever happened
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.560]   to society to make that into a marketable thing. We have a lot of devices that aren't very,
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.560]   very secure. A lot of transports that aren't very secure. A lot of services aren't very secure,
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:18.320]   but now that, hey, we are locking up your data so tightly that even us, Apple has no
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:22.960]   ability to crack into it. That is now a marketable thing. And so now we're going to start to see
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:27.840]   all these manufacturers taking this authentication security very, very, very seriously because now
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:34.240]   that it's tied to sales, it's tied to advertising. We are just a minute and 18 seconds away from 2014
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:44.080]   in a large slat swath of Russia, Azerbaijan, the UAE, Dubai. And I think on the line, we have
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:52.400]   somebody in Moscow, unless I'm being punked. Ilya, are you there? Hello, Ilya. We're happy new year.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:59.600]   We're in Moscow. Are you? I'm in the northern part of the northern region of Moscow. And you
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:06.560]   watch our shows from there? Yeah, that's the first time color, long time listener. You even
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:13.040]   have the idioms down. That's great. What do they do in Russia to celebrate the new year? Well,
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:19.840]   first of all, we listen to our president speaking for five minutes before the bells ring. And then
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:29.040]   we pop up the champagne, the kind of the guy presented you with. Yeah, this is it, huh? I have
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:34.880]   the right kind. All right. Will you count down with me in Russian? Yep. All right, we're at we're
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:42.000]   going to come up on 10 here in a couple of seconds. And then I will pop this fine champagne 10 9 8
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:51.040]   Oh, I can see him. She's dead. She's there. Three. No, I didn't. Happy new year.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:59.360]   Oh, I'll let you that too slowly. We're going to have a little sip. So this is a authentic
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:08.640]   pink muskato semi-sweet. Happy. Do you like your blue drop and the anti-scenes? Overcome with a
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:15.360]   motion 10 years from now when like the Twitter network is like NBC CBS, we're going to be
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.880]   we're going to meet you guys. Remember the days where they had to like have just tied together
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:25.440]   balloons and re-raised them every single time? Hey, this is high tech. This is high tech. I'm
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:30.160]   saying this gives us something to shoot for at some point very, very soon. I know even
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:38.240]   even New York City drops the ball but once we drop it 27 times in 24 hours. This is non-trivial.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.760]   Elia, what are you going to do in 2014? What does 2014 hold for you?
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:48.560]   Actually, I'm coming to US in January and probably in summer too. And I hope
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:54.080]   visit the East Coast to visit my friends and hopefully I come to California to you and
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:01.040]   hopefully I be on my break sometime in summer. It would be our privilege and pleasure. So
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.400]   please make it out here. Elia, what do you do for what do you do for a living?
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.520]   Well, I'm an actor in puppet theater and you're a puppet.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:14.320]   Do you, is it a marionette or do you have your hand up the puppet?
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.640]   It's like a hand puppet.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:22.240]   Hand puppet. How awesome is that? Bring your puppets, do a little show for us. Can you do Tim Cook?
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.160]   Of course I can.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.720]   This is what we've been looking for.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:32.320]   The one piece that's been missing from our coverage of Apple events is a really fine
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.760]   Tim Cook puppet. Tim Cook.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:39.760]   Elia, happy new year, happy 2014. I hope you have a wonderful process,
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.920]   prosperous year. And I hope you get to the States and to our Twitbrick House studios next year.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.960]   All right. This year for you. Thank you.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.920]   Take care, Elia. Happy new year. Happy 2014.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.560]   Happy new year. How do you say that in Russian?
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.160]   Snovum gawdom. Snovum gawdom.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:01.440]   Right. Yeah. Happy new year. Take care. Do you want to try this?
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.560]   Yeah, sure. Can we get some cups?
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.520]   I just want to try this.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.840]   So this is authentic. He says this is what we drink.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:12.000]   You knew. So they're drinking free money. It's what they're drinking.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.480]   It's solvetsko. Miskato.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.520]   So will you successfully ship New Year to Russia?
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:26.000]   Happy new year. It looks like Horaszio.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.280]   Horaszio, Spasiba.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:35.120]   Oh, that's actually good. It's quite good. I did not expect that.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.240]   That's good. I think it might taste like crankcase oil. I didn't know.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:43.360]   Take it. Take it away. Because if we drink too much, we'll be sorry.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.920]   I should have asked Elia and how they feel about the NSA.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:52.080]   We've been living with that for many years. Yeah, they're used to it.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:57.440]   That was cool. When I was a kid, we moved here from South Africa and my mother used to
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.960]   tell me stories about how they never knew who the spy was in class.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:04.400]   They tried to figure out who it was or they would hear when the phones were being tapped.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.280]   But it never seemed like something I would have to live or go through.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.520]   Is that it? It always seemed like a relic of past.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.480]   Yeah, isn't that amazing?
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:15.120]   I will say that it's kind of cool that turn about his fair play back in the 70s and 80s.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:20.960]   We used to get all the best ballet dancers by defecting to freedom.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.520]   Now, Russia's going to get all the best hackers and cryptographers defecting to
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.280]   defend Russia now.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:35.520]   Let me see if I can find the Dubai fireworks because we did show Sydney's amazing $7 million
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.560]   fireworks display earlier today.
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:44.560]   And I know Dubai has equally exciting fireworks.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.280]   I'm setting fireworks on fire.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.120]   They're setting what? The birds on fire.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:52.000]   Let me see. This is a click here to watch live streaming. This is from Emirates.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:57.200]   They're going to light up the Burj Khalifa. That's the world's tallest building, is it not?
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:03.120]   This is we can watch DMI's live feed Dubai media incorporated.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.680]   Let's see if we can find that.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.960]   An error occurred on server when processing URL.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.960]   Please contact Sistem in Ditties-Threetha.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:14.000]   Well, let's see. Let's try another one here.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.960]   Downtown Dubai. This is YouTube. This won't ever go down.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.000]   Wow, look at that. Can you get audio on it?
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.800]   Yeah, this is live because it just they just had their countdown.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.520]   Wow, that's the Burj.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.600]   Holy cow.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.080]   Looks like a Jim Cameron movie.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.280]   Go full screen on this.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.600]   Holy moly.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:42.080]   There's a there's a bit of a competition between Sydney and Dubai.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.320]   Holy cow.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.040]   Then again, Dubai is real estate markets.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.280]   Well, after they have a lot of really, really big building.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.640]   They can load it up with the pyrotechnics.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.840]   Nobody's going to complain.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.800]   It's a fireworks tower.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.600]   Wow. Good show though.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.760]   Quite something.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:07.200]   Quite something. Well, Happy New Year. Dubai. Happy New Year.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.200]   Moscow.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.960]   Doesn't this make you really?
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.880]   I'm saying this without any sarcasm.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:16.240]   Doesn't this make you really, really happy that as a human species,
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:21.040]   we get together to say, let's just put on one killer like display that everybody will just
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:25.920]   spend 10 or 15 minutes looking up, gawking and being absolutely delighted by it.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.360]   It is kind of amazing.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.600]   We are a very, very good species.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.200]   Pretty cool.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.800]   Pretty cool.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.840]   London will have a very big fireworks display as well.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.520]   And we will if the weather is clear there, we will go there as well.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.440]   San Francisco always has a great one for the July.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.800]   You just don't actually see it.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.720]   It's just like big blurry lights in the fire in the fog.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:47.520]   Fire in the fog.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.560]   Our next one is Iran at half past the hour.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:55.600]   I don't think we have anybody in Iran, but if you're watching in Iran, I mean,
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.600]   look, Ilya was listening in Moscow.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:57.920]   Right.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.680]   If you're watching live in Iran, we would love to celebrate New Year with you live.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:06.560]   The number is, it's toll free in the US, but you can use Skype to call it.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:12.000]   888-827-55.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:16.400]   3, 6, and as GKO says in our chatroom, no matter what our culture,
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:21.360]   no matter what divides us, our religions, our creeds, our races,
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.440]   we all like watching stuff blow up.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.240]   And I think that that's...
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.880]   Yes.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.200]   Since the previous gave us fire, we won't.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.080]   I think we'd set it off.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:36.320]   Continuing on with this NSA story, I don't know what more there is to say,
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.080]   except that it's not just the iPhone.
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:45.440]   We went down a list, a very long list of exploits that the NSA has collected,
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.680]   and has been collecting presumably for some time,
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:54.240]   that allow it to hack pretty much everything, some very creative names in the list.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:44:03.280]   This is the Ant Division, they call it, and this is from leeksource.wordpress.com.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.240]   This has got to be more of this note and stuff.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.760]   It sure feels like it, but I don't know if it is.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:13.600]   I saw that the hardest was Blackberry, which took them a year,
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.240]   but they managed to get pretty much every modern platform.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.000]   Yeah, they didn't go the route that the Indian government and the Chinese government
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.480]   went just saying, "Hey, Blackberry, can we have your source code?"
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.640]   They decided to do a little bit more surreptitiously.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:28.320]   This creeds is real value to doing it that way, because people still trust it.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.320]   If you go through the list, Iron Chef,
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.760]   this allows you to target systems persistently by exploiting motherboard bios.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:43.360]   You put it in the bios and they can reboot, refresh, reformat them matter.
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.800]   Feed through. They were only intercepting them in shipment, right?
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.040]   Yeah. And then install this by where? Hacking them.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:55.200]   Gourmet trough, Alex Water.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.200]   I don't know whether you would get this any other way other than the snow.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.000]   You could make it up.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.400]   I mean, somebody very, very creative could create it, but I will play it if you did.
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:08.160]   Yeah. It sure feels like it's a zachic persistent.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:13.200]   I don't know if it's just me, but I don't know whether I could trust a system or not.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.480]   My default, my only same response seems to be, "You can't trust it."
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:20.480]   And we were kind of teasing Andy a couple of months ago when he said he taped over his webcam
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.720]   when he wasn't ready to have it used. And now I know exactly how he feels.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.080]   I want to tape over everything.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:30.800]   Well, Steve was telling us that the NSA has the capability of turning on your Mac webcam
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:36.880]   without turning on the light. We were really, two years ago, trying to figure this out.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.920]   Is it a hardware connect? Is it possible? Well, the NSA figured it out probably two years ago.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:47.840]   And I think maybe if you don't want somebody to spy on you, it's not just the light,
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.720]   it's the microphone. It's not just your Mac, it's your cell phone.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.320]   Well, I think that if you don't want someone to spy on you,
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.520]   if you really want to be serious about this, you need to stay in a room.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:59.520]   And close off the windows and make sure there's a soft pad between those windows,
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:03.040]   because of course you can laser the windows. Oh, you mean like loud audio,
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:08.960]   the audio-based RS retro reflector that provides room audio from a targeted space using radar and
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:12.400]   basic post-processing. You mean like that? Yeah, that's old stuff. And they were using audio too,
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:16.160]   just a new attack encryption, right? They were trying to read the sounds off the CPU to get through
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:22.000]   4,000, whatever, 696 bit encryption. How about this, the wireless exploitation injection tool.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.440]   You just carried around it's a x86 laptop running Linux. You put some software on there and you can
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:34.640]   get into windows, whatever you want, inject via wireless. This list is kind of scary.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:38.320]   When I was a kid Leo, I watched things like Firefox where Mitchell Gantt could use Russian
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:42.800]   thought to control a plane. I wanted all this stuff. I wanted thought. Yeah, you got it. Everything
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:47.360]   connected. I wanted, and I don't want any of it anymore, the idea that I could have a neural implant
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:51.600]   that someone would hack now is just appalling to me. And the names are so good.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:57.120]   Ginsu, that is a software application persistence for the CNE implant.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:04.240]   It's a conger on target systems, the PCI bus hardware implant bulldozer. I don't even know
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:10.480]   what I'm reading here. But anytime I see persistent, get a little nervous. Howler monkey.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:19.120]   This is a short to medium range implant RF transceiver. I don't think they mean like
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:24.400]   implanted in your skin or do they? Probably to a device. But this gets into that whole thing
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:31.600]   where they were talking about the fact that they were intercepting shipments and then implanting
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:37.040]   stuff into the electronics. Yeah, like junior mint. It's very refreshing. A digital core packaged
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:42.640]   in both the mini printed circuit board PCB to be used in typical concealments and a miniaturized
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:47.200]   flip chip module to be used in plants with size constraining concealments. This you could stick
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:51.440]   this pretty much anywhere. And the thing was if you chose not to use Google or Facebook,
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:55.200]   I mean, if you did not want to share your information, you could make that choice and just not participate.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.360]   Yeah, you have absolutely no choice. Yeah. If I were Canadian, I'd be pissed.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:03.280]   You see, well, the thing is like, CSIS exists only really to spy on Canadians because we're
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.040]   Canadian. We really have nothing else to do. And in England, they have certain laws. And other
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:11.360]   countries like China, this is just par for the course. But the idea is that you want them to be
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:15.040]   upfront about it so that no, you're getting and all these secret programs kind of shatter is not
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.720]   that they shatter your trust that they make it impossible if you ever trust your own government
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:23.280]   again. Or any piece of hardware. Yeah, absolutely. It's what do you do? You could
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:27.200]   bomb yourself back to the stone ages and live with your pet rock in a cave somewhere and worry
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:31.280]   about, you know, like Alex said, ceiling off the cave door at night. It just just, there seems
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:36.240]   like there's no answer to this. Yeah. Why don't you just give up? I give up. You win.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:44.720]   Well, I have to admit that I went from a I went in in the early 90s. I was extremely, you know,
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:49.760]   I would like literally in Colorado made you give your friend Thumbprint and I and I burn my
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:54.480]   Thumbprints off with my with my skill. What? You met them out right off. They come back. They come
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.640]   back. What are you nuts? Really funny. It's really funny after you've after you've melted them off
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.920]   because you go in there and you keep it. They keep on asking you for your thumbprint. Doesn't that hurt?
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:08.880]   It hurts for a minute. Well, maybe for a couple hours anyway. So but the but I was like really
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.240]   seriously, they are not going to have my thumb. I'm not I'm not giving them my Thumbprint and I
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.760]   would use cash and I was like very serious about this whole thing. And then there was some point
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:20.640]   I was just like, you know, who cares? I cannot. And so then I just gave up and I just assumed
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.400]   that I'm being viewed. I'm being viewed by the government. It's the panopticon. That's what the
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:31.280]   other way. It's the panopticon. The whole notion of panopticon was industrial era invention of a
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:35.680]   guy named Bessemer who said, well, here's what you're doing. Make a prison where the guards can see
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:41.840]   into any cell at any time. But the inmates can never tell if they're being spied upon or not.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.640]   So the presumption of the inmates is I could be watched at any time. And so they'll all behave.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:51.920]   That's what we have a panopticon. We don't know when we're being spotted, but we presume they
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:57.200]   could any time. And there are certain levels of security. You know, I've been really thinking
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.640]   about a lot of the low the low energy, you know, Bluetooth stuff. I just got these little
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:06.240]   but I have a I put this little Bluetooth, you know, one of the low energy ones on my key ring so I
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:10.960]   can find my love and stuff. And but I realized, you know, it's going to get to a point where you put
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:16.080]   one of those on your kids, you know, in the mall and you can set it up to say, my kid can't leave
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:20.880]   them all, you know, and it will literally, you know, some some day in the future, it'll get to a
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:24.880]   point where it won't open the door for your kid, you know, like those auto doors will just shut
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:30.560]   because they'll, you know, they he has an ID, which means for a parent from a security perspective,
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:34.240]   you just know that your kid A won't, A won't walk out like you're, you know, three year old,
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:39.200]   won't walk out and someone won't, won't try to, you know, won't pick them up. You know, and these are
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:43.200]   all, you know, these are all things that are going to happen pretty quickly. I mean, you know, and
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:47.840]   so I think that, you know, it's going to be very, very hard to be anonymous.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:55.280]   You know, I think that it's it really is going to have us reevaluate the how what what is the
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:58.960]   trends what is the contract that we have with our phone and I'm not talking about the contract we
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:03.680]   have with the carrier I'm talking about here is the ways that this pocket device is going to
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:08.880]   enhance my life on a day to day basis. And here's what I get to give I have to give up in order for
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:14.160]   that sort of convenience. And we're used to the idea of where we've been seeing over the past 10
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:20.640]   years how we can create our own terms of service that technically speaking, this will allow anybody
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.880]   to get in touch with me at any moment for any reason. But I also have the ability to ignore it,
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:29.680]   to not have this public have a living response to it. But now we realize that another part of
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:36.320]   that contract that we have is that it is incredibly useful to have this device that can maintain a
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:41.440]   communication between ourselves and the world that's around us. I'm talking about our physical
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:46.160]   presence, you know, having GPS around having connection to Wi-Fi around being able to access
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.920]   information everywhere. But now we know that part of that cost is going to be that that
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:54.720]   information is going to be exposed to a third party. And whereas traditionally we always used to
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:00.480]   think about that in terms of what if I'm using an unsecured Wi-Fi hotspot now it's also what if
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:05.280]   there are people who have the sort of resources for which encryption encounter measures mean nothing.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:10.560]   Is it am I okay with the idea that the fact that I'm drifting through this Wi-Fi network,
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:14.320]   not accessing the network, I'm just happy to be driving through it. Am I okay with the idea that
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.800]   a government agency or even a private individual will have that ability to know to know that sort
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.240]   of stuff? Well, and I think one of the one of the things you have to I mean, and I don't mean to be
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:26.160]   so resigned to it, but it's just like I you know I worked with a lot of folks in the 90s that
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:30.800]   kind of shattered any any view that I had that I was ever going to be private. I mean, you know,
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:36.720]   we can there's a lot that they can do. So the thing is that is that you know, there's a lot
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:41.040]   that that can be done. I mean, they can identify you from 50 feet away of an embassy, you know,
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:45.440]   from the heat recognition on your face through through cloth, you know, and so and if you start
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:49.920]   coming past that embassy more than more often than they than you're supposed to, they start tracking
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:55.040]   you. You know, you know, so the thing is is that is that that and that that was that's circa like 1993,
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:59.680]   you know, so so the thing is is that it's you know, I think we just need to be clear that this
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:03.680]   technology has is, you know, a lot further along. I mean, the whole enemy of the state stuff is
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:11.040]   probably not that far off of what of what's available. And we also have to understand that
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:16.080]   it's not it's not either or proposition that I whenever I whenever I think about the more extreme
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:21.840]   ways to react to all these all these NSA revelations, I think about that that viral photo of that
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:28.240]   guy who was was the PGP encryption key that became public. And then and some someone tried to make
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:33.680]   it illegal to post that and said, Oh, until I'll show you I'm having the I'm having the key actually
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:39.040]   tattooed on me. This happened, mister, you can't control me enough for the rest of his life. He has
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:45.040]   this thing on his chest that means absolutely nothing to anybody. Yeah, I decided I decided that
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:49.680]   the events of the past week required that a stupid and friend useless gesture be made on
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:54.080]   someone's part and that I would be exactly the right person to do that. I remember when I was a
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:57.680]   little kid, my grandmother told me that there was an omniscient being looking at me and watching me
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:02.560]   all the time. What kind of I tried to make this analogy like, you know, I had 10 channels of cable
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:06.560]   back then and I was bored stiff. I was flipping channels all the time. And I couldn't imagine
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:10.800]   anyone with any level of sentence would find me interesting for more than a microsecond. And I
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:15.280]   took solace in that. But the thing like so surveillance doesn't bother me as much as the idea that all
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:20.400]   this stuff is being stored so that it's persistent and they can be referred back to for years. For
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:24.640]   example, someone doesn't like me being on Mac break. So they say, Oh, 10 years ago, Renee did this and
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:28.960]   they, you know, all of a sudden that video is just everywhere. I'm okay with the idea of a police
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:32.880]   officer stopping when I go through a stop sign. I don't like the idea that they can go back five
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:36.960]   years and say, Oh, by the way, we want to get you now. Here's a stop sign you ran five years.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.160]   Well, and I think that it's also the ability to manipulate that. I mean, I think that if you go
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:43.840]   back to a movie like enemy of the state, you can see what what happens when when you have all of
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:48.320]   that is not so much. And you can see stuff in the NSA of let's let's let's follow this guy around
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.480]   and find find things that are embarrassing for him. My ex girlfriend, we found out they were
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:56.400]   following some of their ex wives and girlfriends. And I don't want to feel like a prisoner. I want
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:00.800]   to feel like a citizen. I mean, I think that's the scarier part is is individuals going down this
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:06.080]   path or or even officials going down a path of, you know, we now have the last 10 years of everything
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:13.040]   you've done electronically. And we're going to use it, you know, to quell, you know, any argument
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.240]   against the government. And I think that's the thing that is is very frightening. I'm not saying
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:19.520]   that I'm not, you know, that I don't think I don't I'm not saying that I think this is a good
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:23.360]   thing. I just think that it's it's pretty deep rooted. That's all what really what really
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:29.440]   concerns me more than anything else is when people who are doing were legitimately fearless,
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:33.280]   though they're doing their jobs and not they don't have malicious intent. They know that they have the
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:39.920]   they have the they have their duty bound to protect the public interest. Time and time again over the
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:45.760]   past several years, we've seen law enforcement get for lack better word get cute and say that,
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:51.120]   for instance, well, we decide that we don't need a warrant to surpitiously install a GPS tracking
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:56.080]   device on someone's car because we've already demonstrated that it is legal for us to simply
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:00.320]   assign somebody to tell this person. So this is really from a legal point of view, absolutely no
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:07.760]   different from taking one of the few few few police officers that we have and having him
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:11.600]   tail this person 24 hours a day for an entire month. It's exactly the same thing.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.840]   Well, and so and so when we get to the it just makes me concerned that we'll have that sort of
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:21.760]   that same sort of thing saying that, for instance, as drones become, you know, a part of like standard
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:26.720]   equipment, what if someone wants to say that we really, really need to get a look into every single
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:31.920]   window of this, how this three story house, you know, we have the legally that we can we were
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:37.040]   allowed to fly an airplane above the airspace and like and take like photos of the yard.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:41.520]   Technically, this is another type of aircraft. So we don't need a warrant to do that now because
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:47.280]   yes, this was this person was set 30 years ago before the idea of a tiny affordable
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:51.440]   remote, remotely controlled and operated investigative camera was even considered.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:55.680]   That's the sort of stuff that really concerns me. You need a warrant for stuff. You need to at
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:59.760]   some point present yourself to a judge and say, here is what we want to do. And here's why we want
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:03.840]   to do it. And when you start to think that we don't need to get permission from anybody,
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:04.960]   that's when I start to get.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:08.240]   Or the one thing and they said because we gave Google stuff, we're not allowed to entitle to
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:11.360]   not give it to the government. Well, and I think that the other side of the other side of the
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:15.280]   obviously the other coin of this is stuff like the Boston bombing where those guys were dead to
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:20.000]   their rights like within a couple hours after that happened. The only reason that they that that
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:26.080]   that they were there video was released of them, which was one tenth of what the FBI had was
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:30.480]   because visual entities were starting to go down the wrong path. You know, I mean, those,
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:35.360]   I mean, the thing is, is that that the you really got I don't know, I mean, if you really look at all
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:41.280]   the the the information that was acquired of what they've made public of what was acquired of those
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:46.240]   guys from all the surveillance cameras. Obviously, there's a lot of stuff that you know, it takes all
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:51.200]   the, you know, the fun out of having a terrorist act in the United States, you know, and and I think
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:57.120]   that that is or in any place that is that is highly unfortunate didn't stop it. It didn't stop it,
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:01.040]   but it did, but they had more explosives. They had more things they had, you know, there was a lot
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:05.200]   that's true. This was to get more stuff. They were not that wasn't going to be I mean,
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:10.240]   when you saw what they already had, they definitely were planning more, you know, and it also has to
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:18.160]   be said that we don't we shouldn't set ourselves up to think that law enforcement is the bad guy
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:24.640]   universally, because you know, just yes, the whatever surveillance that was in place was not able to
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:30.640]   prevent the the Boston the Boston Marathon bombing. But every time that law enforcement has a victory
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:36.560]   like that, they almost by a definition can't say we prevented this and here is exactly how we did
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:40.880]   it. Well, and they're also and also they're not they're not telling you about most of their
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:46.240]   successes because you know, I they don't want to scare us from leaving our house. You know, I mean,
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.960]   there's you know, the cost of I think we also have to be clear of the cost of being an American
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:55.840]   is very high, you know, and we are the rich of the rich and there's a lot of people that are
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:59:00.000]   upset with us that have a lot of other things and you know, we, you know, we can talk about why
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.080]   and everything else. But the point is, is that there's a very cost there is a very high cost of being
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:09.600]   American that that we just have to be aware of as well. For me, it's the checks and balances. I
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.720]   of course law enforcement is going to want every tool at their disposal. They should want to be
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:17.120]   able to do everything they possibly can. But there should be an equal and opposite oversight of that.
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:20.800]   And I think that's where we're having the failings now, especially in the government, you know,
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:24.640]   whenever we're scared, whenever we are injured, whenever we're hurt, we're usually more than
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:28.640]   willing to sacrifice a little bit of freedom for the perception of protection. But that's supposed
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:32.800]   to readjust and rebalance and we're supposed to have people in authority saying, okay, these are the
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:37.440]   tools you need this far and no further and it seems of this far and no further, like Andy said,
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:40.480]   is becoming very, very slippery. I think it's obvious that the biggest thing is missing right
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:46.560]   now is checks and balances. Yeah. So Anand has just released his Mac Pro review. Thanks to the
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:56.240]   chat room who noted that he just tweeted it. And I guess we'll have to kind of parse it bit by bit.
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:04.000]   Anand, of course, very good at getting down to the really the hardcore guts of performance
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:12.320]   in particular. Let's see if I can. It's a long article as usual.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:18.400]   Let me just what he does best. How many people are just like sighing and saying,
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:26.400]   T L D R because it's a substantial piece that'll actually make you smarter at the end of it. So I'm
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:33.200]   sorry. He's got five generations of Mac Pro compared. This is where the the the the history,
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:38.080]   the heritage of Anand is just remarkable because of course he's done these benchmarks going back
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:46.080]   years. And here is Cinebench, which of course, I'm not sure Cinebench is the best measure of this.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:50.560]   I think he does the standard ones just to give you something to relate across different platforms
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:57.200]   and he does his own to try to dig deeper into it. Yeah. He's Firefox build time.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:06.640]   He's got plot putting Mac Pro performance and perspective professional apps Mac Pro versus
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:12.640]   consumer max. That was that discussion that we were having the PCI layout GPU choices gaming
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:19.680]   performance power consumption and noise. Let me let me skip what we'll do is I'll skip to the
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:26.080]   bottom and invite you all to go to anandandtech.com. If you want to read the full word, it's bad
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:33.280]   final words. I honestly never thought I'd go back to a Mac Pro. I appreciate the flexibility
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:37.200]   offered by my 15 inch MacBook Pro as a desktop and there's no way I was going to take two steps
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.160]   back in a single threaded performance just to get a quieter system. Over the past year, I spent a
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:47.520]   lot of time with the 27 inch iMac as I continued to evaluate Apple's Fusion drive. I appreciate
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:52.400]   the greater thermal headroom, the quieter operation, the better GPU performance the Mac offered me
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.880]   above the retina. Combine that with the fact that I've been on the road a lot more lately,
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:04.800]   I've been having to take my 13 around. It's actually, he says, shocking how poorly Final Cut Pro 10.1
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:11.280]   runs on older Mac Pros without an upgraded GPU. So it sounds like the time is right for this.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:15.840]   He likes how much RAM it can support. He likes to chassis a lot. It's a risk,
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.800]   but one that absolutely must be taken if the desktop is going to continue to exist and thrive.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:27.040]   The thermal design makes a tremendous amount of sense. Thermal Core works extremely well in
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:32.320]   practice. Apple did a good job of hiding most of Intel's IV-bridge-y, Poop platform faults from
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:38.320]   the end user. USB 3 and Thunderbolt 2 are present. Latter can drive up to six displays without any
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:44.720]   funny cable trickery. He says he's disappointed that there aren't any high DPI modes for the 32 inch
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:52.160]   sharp. That's something that 4K people will be interested to see. All in all, the Mac Pro is a
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.720]   good update to its aging predecessor. Apple did a great job with a new chassis and built a desktop
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:03.280]   that's extremely dense with compute. I don't know what that means. More compute per square
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:09.120]   inch. It's compute density. That's true, given the size of that thing. That's going to be hard to
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:15.120]   beat. It's amazing how Apple's... They're so sick from our B's and take these huge risks with
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:20.560]   their desktops. The old Mac Pro is a big bulky pain to work on and substantially behind the
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:25.520]   consumer Macs in single threaded performance. The new Mac Pro literally fixes all of that.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:30.960]   If you have a workload that justifies it and prefer OS 10, the Mac Pro is thankfully no longer
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:37.520]   just your only solution. It's a great solution. So a very positive review from non-law Shimpi
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:41.680]   at an on tech.com. After I got over the whole round thing and I understood why they were doing it.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:47.040]   Why? For cooling? Well, yeah. You can't build something that small if you don't cool everything
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:54.000]   at one time. By the way, the Zen is thinking, I don't want to go back on that. But Apple did
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.240]   announce that they are going into China big time starting January 17th. China Mobile is bringing
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:07.680]   the iPhone to China. I have to wonder if this leak about the iPhone didn't our government
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:14.000]   warn us about binding Chinese phones? What will China's response be? And what will China Mobile's
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.240]   response be to these revelations? They're about to launch into this market in a big way.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:26.320]   Not good timing for Apple. Because the Chinese government will be concerned about Americans
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:33.440]   flying through iPhones. Exactly. That's fair play. Turn about his fair play.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.040]   They're manufactured in China. So there'll be so much spyware on that machine. It won't even work.
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:42.240]   Well, you know, you know, it's telling when when Obama says that he can't, he's not allowed to use
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:48.720]   an iPhone. They said, you know, I think he's blackberry either. He had to use a he's got a
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.920]   blackberry, but he does now. But when he first got an office in Windows phone,
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.320]   the China, I think they said he has to use the NSA secure. Yeah, mobile, not even Windows phone.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:01.680]   No, it's Windows 6 5 mobile. Yeah. Is that still the case? That's still what he's using?
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.920]   I don't know. But they said he can't take his blackberry into China.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:09.120]   She's Louise. Yeah. Anybody from Iran? Anybody at all. We have a minute 42 seconds until
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:16.640]   a new new year in Iran. Last chance. So did a non convince you to hit the buy button, Leo?
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:20.160]   I will buy it, but I don't want to buy it not for delivery two months from now.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:27.600]   I want it now. Don't you think at an Apple store with stock? Well, that's what see, this is what
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:34.480]   I'm it's a gamble. I could I could guarantee delivery in February sometime, right? Or I could
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.960]   take a chance that someday my Apple store will have one in the next order. It's now Leo and then
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:44.560]   I could cancel it. Cancel it. Yeah. Somebody in the chat room who has a degree in psychology is going
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:50.320]   to give you exactly the name of this syndrome. It is cognitive dissonance. The guarantees
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:55.200]   was the guarantee reward in two months time or the chance of reward immediately. I have very
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.440]   poor impulse control. Learn helplessness. I believe it's all learned helplessness. Welcome.
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:03.840]   Being an Apple consumer. Welcome, Apple customer. You learn helplessness.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:07.440]   The majority of porn in the United States is viewed on smartphones.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:13.600]   Why is that? What? That's very surprising. Yeah. But that's why Apple really wants to stick with
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.800]   that one handed operation.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:19.200]   There's a big screen joke in there somewhere, Leo.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:26.640]   I'm not sure if I want to see porn at 4K. I don't know. I already.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:35.360]   I talked to a guy in LA. I was at a speaking at some event and I asked him. This is years ago.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.760]   I said, so what do you do? And he goes, oh, I'm a rotoscope artist. Rotoscope artist is
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:48.480]   someone who does paint fixes. Hold on. 10, 10, 9, 8, 8, 7, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, really?
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:55.280]   2, 1, Happy New Year! It's 2014 in Iran.
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.720]   There was a guy there actually and he moved.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:14.160]   And this is very similar to Afghan. It's Seilah, no Mubarak.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.920]   Ah, Mubarak. Why is President Mubarak showing up in both of those?
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.040]   I don't know either. Happy New Year.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:24.000]   Evidently was a real party in. Yes. In Farsi.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:31.120]   Thank you, everybody. It is 2014 in about half the globe. But we've got more to go.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:38.400]   And we're going all the way to American Samoa. Our next New Year's Eve will be in Nairobi,
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:43.200]   Baghdad cartoon. I've been sitting here trying to get a hold of somebody in Nairobi.
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:48.560]   You know people in Nairobi. Well, I have friend Hanif in Darsalom and I was like,
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:53.440]   are you awake? And he is, but he's in Doha on his way to Orlando. I was like, oh, that's not going to help.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:59.760]   So you can call us plus one eight eight eight eight eight two seven five five three six.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:04.000]   It is a toll free number in the US, which means if you use Skype, that'll be toll free to you.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.040]   I'm sure I'm sure that our listeners across the world are like who are also Apple fans are like
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.960]   relishing this because you know usually it's those of us here in the North America,
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:17.760]   we get the stuff first and we let them and the rest of the world have to wait for the cool stuff
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.840]   to arrive. Here we are just holding on. We can't have we can't pop the corks. We can't really do
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:26.240]   it because you know, but okay, I hope when New Zealand, I hope that in Iran, I hope that in Russia,
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:31.840]   you're enjoying it. Just don't spoil it for us. We will read we will read your reviews of 2014
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:36.160]   because we can't wait. We'll be with you in moments. Very curious what they're drinking in
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.240]   in Islamic countries where you don't drink what I've been drinking. Martin Ellie's sparkling apple
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:44.880]   cider. Oh, there you have it. It's lovely, a lovely beverage. Why are you going to do your
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:49.360]   mixology class after Mac break week after Mac break about an hour after Mac break? I'll do. I'm doing
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:53.680]   I think three three sessions. Okay. And we'll talk about two drinks each time. Okay, good.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:09:00.080]   The gizwiz is coming up in about two hours, a little less one and a half hours. So maybe we
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.560]   should wrap up Mac break weekly. I think we've got all the big stories. Might be a good time to do our
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:12.560]   picks of the week. And actually my pick is your pick from last week I brought in the Yankee.
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:17.360]   So we're doing a little onky driving, but first let's get Renee Richie's pick of the week this week.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:24.880]   My pick of the week is Sonos's home theater system. A friend of mine Kevin Mitchell has been telling
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:29.520]   me how good Sonos has been for a long time. And I just didn't have a use case because I do not
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:34.640]   listen to a lot of music. But recently they've added a play bar which is sort of like a center
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:40.160]   and two side speakers. And they've added a sub which is a giant subwoofer to their system.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:46.560]   And I watch a lot of movies and a lot of television. So immediately I had some reason now to justify
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:52.160]   the still rather massive purchase price of this equipment. And Andy very kindly on Twitter gave
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:56.160]   it one of the best things he ever says is this is something that I would actually keep myself.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:00.960]   When I hear that from Andy, I know that it's really safe to buy. Yeah, I agree. So I went straight
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:07.360]   in. I got the play bar. I got the subwoofer and I got two play threes for the size because I have
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:12.240]   a rather large octagonal cavernous. Wait a minute. Let me do the math there. That is you're talking
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:17.120]   about what like $1,500 with a crap there. It's Canadian money Leo. So I'd be pretending
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:22.160]   that it's like it's like eating calories on a plane. But I want to point out I have exactly the
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:28.000]   same setup. It's fantastic. It's awesome. By previous to this, I had a pioneer and I had the
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.200]   element speakers and it took me forever to wire them up to try to run wires around this massive
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:37.840]   room to get everything calibrated. This I plugged in the play bar right into my network. It sits
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:42.400]   right next to my router. So it was easy to do. It detected the other components. It asked me a
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:46.480]   few simple questions about where they were positioned. It ran some software updates. It
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:51.520]   calibrated everything. The controller they've gotten rid of the expensive $300 controller. You
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:56.880]   have an app now on your iPhone or iPad. It lets you control all the elements. I can easily go to
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.840]   night mode so my neighbors don't complain after 11 p.m. I can easily make it enhance speech so that
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:07.520]   the sound effects aren't overshadowing all the dialogue. And it sounds terrific. It is 5.1. I
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:12.720]   used to have 7.1 but I am not acoustically sensitive enough to notice the difference. It still sounds
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.920]   terrific. The subwoofer is much more impressive than I thought it would be. The play bar compared
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:23.520]   to discrete speakers in the front and left. Absolutely fantastic. You can also, it does not
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.600]   unfortunately support airplay. That's the one thing that I'm missing but I have an Apple TV
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.320]   hooked into it anyway. The optical cable comes right out of the TV and into the Sonos system.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:36.800]   So it doesn't matter what source is going into your TV. It'll just go right out into the system.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:43.040]   And it is almost miraculous. We've talked about the Hue light bulbs before. I have that all over
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.120]   the house so I can control that with my iPhone. And now all the sound is being controlled with
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:52.880]   my iPhone too. I had a bunch of family over for the holidays. We've been watching a ton of movies
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:58.880]   and I'm more impressed with it than I thought I would be. I agree. Love it. Yeah. Love it. It's
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:04.560]   also, they get you because you buy this like you buy a model train set. Yes. Where you buy the
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:10.000]   few by the first set. And then because it's what I like about what I like about Sonos is that it
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.320]   is an expandable system because if all you want to do is I want to have really, really great sound
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.720]   in my living room where I listen to music, you can do that. And then maybe four months later you
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:24.400]   realize, oh, if I throw another Sonos, the $200 like play one speaker in my bathroom,
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:28.160]   then I could like be listening to music in the bathroom while I'm showering and shaving the
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:32.800]   box. I should also put one in the bedroom because that way I compare those two as two different
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:38.000]   mono speakers. And so because I'll get, I'll shower, then I'll move into the bathroom and get dressed.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.120]   And I'll have the same audio going from, oh, God. And by the time, but it's like, but the great
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:49.920]   thing is that you can start off with a really good $200 like bookshop speaker that is exactly the
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:54.640]   same price as a Bluetooth speaker that you'd buy just as have something to listen to in the office.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.080]   And then as you keep adding, it just becomes better and better and better. Great stuff.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:05.040]   I have them in every room. It is ridiculous expense. But if unlike me, you actually do listen to music,
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:09.920]   they ties into songs on a bunch of other fantastic services. So you can, you can just play directly.
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:15.200]   It's quite marvelous. And I use it's not, it's not like what I used to do. I used to do the sort
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:21.120]   of stuff by having Bluetooth speakers. And the thing is it's the their independent streaming
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:25.760]   media devices. So really, if you've got, I've got the app on my Android phone, I got the app on my
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:31.520]   iPad. I've got the apps on all my Macs. And each one of these can simply direct whatever music I
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:36.160]   want to any speaker I want. So I don't need to simply have this phone with me. That's the
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:42.320]   repository of my music. And oh, it's good stuff. Yeah. And if you do, if you are a person who loves
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:49.600]   great music, this, you can have a Sonos connect in your stereo system, which I do. So I can use my
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:55.600]   nice speakers and my nice amplifier, but use the Sonos wireless capability. So that adds the regular
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:00.640]   stereo into the mix. And that's nice too. So you have a lot of choices, one of nice choices.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.760]   We didn't finish your, thank you, Renee. We didn't finish your story. I interrupted it with a
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.800]   countdown. I don't remember what story I was talking about. What was the story he was talking about?
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:14.560]   Oh, oh, the roto. So roto is, we're talking about 4k. Oh, rotoscoping.
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:18.480]   Rotoscoping is when you are paint paint art as you paint stuff out, you know, you correct things.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:24.000]   There've also been movies and entire movies that are rotoscoping. Well, making life is an amazing
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.680]   right. But I mean, pretty much the original ratings. The Ralph Bakke effect shot has some
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:32.640]   roto in it. Yeah. So 80% of Lord of the Rings, you know, 90% of Star Wars, there's some
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.920]   roto. Like there's, they're touching something. I go that something went behind his head,
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:40.000]   I might got into the shot, you know, and there's a lot of stuff that's pretty intense. So anyway,
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.440]   so I said, Oh, I was interested in what movie is working on. And I said, so what, what, what do you
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:49.520]   do paint fixes for? And he said porn. And I was just like, wait a minute, they rotoscope porn.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:54.320]   And he said, I said, he said, yeah, he goes when we moved to SD to HD, there's a certain class of
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:58.880]   actors that don't really go from SD to HD well. And so my job is to fix that.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:05.280]   Wow. That's that. That is about the worst job I've heard. And he said, he said, I just got to
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:08.960]   get out of this. I just got to go. But he goes, I just can't, I can't, I can't, you know, he goes,
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.840]   I was kind of amazed that the budget was born to allow for rotoscoping.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.120]   Evidently for some of it. In fact, this is years ago, though, this is back before,
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.840]   you know, the Internet of things. Too bad they can't rotoscope acting in.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:27.360]   Yeah, that would exactly. So anyway, your pick of the week. So I have really got into short cables.
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:32.560]   So so these are these are lightning cables. Cables are too long. So my whole thing is, is I have to
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:36.000]   pack a lot for a long period of time. And so I'm always thinking about I need a certain number of
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.320]   cables to connect everything. And all that extra cable means that it gets, it gets all tangled up.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:45.840]   It's hard to store. It is, you know, it's everywhere all the time. And so I've really
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:50.000]   gotten into short cables. Apple makes a pair that makes these, these lightning cables that are,
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.680]   this is, these are lightning cables that are short. But I kind of, I like these in case ones a
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.400]   little bit better. So these are all different colors. And I don't know why I like the colors,
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:03.600]   but it makes me happy. So, so they have lots of different colors, two or three different colors.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:06.800]   Are they more than charging? Because I mean, I know that, I think these do everything.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:10.800]   They do, they're saying they're fully licensed. These are licensed. These are in case. So they're
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:15.680]   like, they're, yeah, they're, they're licensed and, and they're great. And I have to admit,
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:18.640]   I don't really connect my phone to my, I don't really know, because I don't connect my phone to
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.560]   all I do is use these four is charging. But you can get them at the Apple store. So I'm assuming that
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:27.040]   they are, they must be fully that they're fully blessed. And they're hideously expensive, right?
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.560]   So yeah, I mean, sure that they're, they're, they're pretty expensive. So I don't know,
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:36.080]   they're 24 bucks or 25 bucks or 30 like that. Yeah, I'm paying on how the length of them. But,
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:40.960]   but the, but you know, they're, you know, if you're looking for kind of something a little bit more
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:48.960]   fun and short, that that is my last girlfriend. No, I'm sorry. Anyway, yeah, the, so anyway, so
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:53.120]   that's my, that's my pick. So I agree cables are could be very long and they get tangled. I get
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:57.920]   lots. I don't needs them. Exactly. What do you want to phone across the room? Real laptop,
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.440]   that's crazy. Then I have a couple long ones. It's not like I got rid of all of them, but I,
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.840]   but I have, but I am charging a lot of stuff. So I like to keep just a handful of short ones.
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.760]   We're spending your money today. Andy and I go to you have an inexpensive pick of the week.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:14.720]   Actually, I have two really good and expensive picks of the week. There are two sales that are
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:22.720]   going on this week. Every single year, comic craft has the New Year's Day sale image. Every one of
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:27.920]   their hand-lettered and display fonts is one penny for every year past the birth of our Lord Jesus
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.520]   Christ. If you believe in such thing, I don't mean to say you don't believe it. Whether you believe
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:36.480]   or not, it's still going to be $28.14 for every single font in their catalog.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:40.080]   And they act now because next year, it'll be $20.15.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:45.600]   I know boy, will it want you be kicking yourself. And so that that price applies to the few fonts
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:53.680]   that cost $19 normally, but it also applies to the fonts that cost $495. And so every single year,
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:58.160]   I like will buy whatever new font has come. They've come out with over the past year that I really,
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:04.320]   really like. And they're great things. They specialize in, as the name of their company
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.880]   indicates, they specialize in hand-lettered style fonts that are actually used in comic books.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:14.720]   They went to digital a long, long time ago. And so many companies are now using lettering
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:18.560]   that comes from the fonts that they actually make. Some of these, you actually see that they're
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:24.400]   named after a specific style of artist because they might have actually have been developed for
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:29.760]   specific books. So they give it a distinctive look. But if there's a reason, there's so many times
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:36.560]   when you want to, you want happy holidays on your family Christmas card and you look at the 40 fonts
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:41.040]   that came free with your Mac and you don't have the perfect one, they have the perfect one and it
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:48.000]   will be exactly $20. Or you have sometimes you should spend $20 on a good, like thick brush stroke,
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.080]   hand-lettered sort of thing. Because how many times you have to print, you know,
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:58.240]   passive aggressive notes. And there is a reason why I put my name on the cottage cheese,
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.560]   not so that you can thank me for giving you free cottage cheese, but so that you know that this
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:07.440]   is my cottage cheese. It will seem a lot less of a prickish thing to put up there if it's
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:11.600]   a beautiful, like, hand-lettered brush stroke font, as opposed to, you know,
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:18.080]   Helvetica aggressive, which is whatever comes there. Helvetica aggressive is good. That's my
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:23.600]   favorite font. We should definitely do that. So the sale is tomorrow. It doesn't, it's not today,
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:28.640]   it is tomorrow, January 1st. New Year's Day. New Year's Day. Sometimes they extend it by a few
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:32.560]   hours. So if you're not, so if this goes out like a little bit later than that, it might still be
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:37.360]   there with a chance. If you're listening live, what I recommend you do is definitely hit the site
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.920]   today because that's when you, they have like the regular prices still up. And so sometimes you
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:47.440]   want to see, if you're on the fence over whether you want to buy this one font or not, maybe the
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:52.080]   fact that, well, this is normally $140. Yeah, maybe I'll just toss 20 bucks off the window.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:56.720]   You can also download a PDF catalog that has everything in it and you can browse them that way.
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:00.720]   So that's one pick. The other one is something that just, I just saw this morning,
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:07.760]   Comixology is having a really great sale on digital graphic novels of DC, some DC Comics
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:15.440]   best comics. They're $5.99 each and some of these are like 66% off. And so many of these aren't just
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:21.440]   collections of things they've done recently. So many of these are real classics. Like I,
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:26.640]   super, all star Superman, I think is for me is the definitive Superman series.
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:33.760]   Watchmen, it's the watchman, V for Vendetta, Swamp Thing, the first art in the game in Saman.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:42.240]   Yeah, I mean, and these are all like normally $13 to $20. And so you get the entire story start
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:47.440]   to finish for just $5.99. Fables is one of the best new series I picked up in the past three or
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:52.480]   four years. But I somehow managed to not have the first story arc in digital. So I had to go by
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:57.360]   that this morning. And some, it has, when I tweeted out this link this morning, some people were
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:01.680]   pointing out to me that someone pointed out to me that there is a similar sale going on on Amazon.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:05.680]   But that's a good opportunity for me to point out that if you have a choice, you definitely want to
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:12.160]   buy the Comixology digital comics because their reading technology is so much more sophisticated
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:18.240]   than what Amazon will give you. I've bought graphic novels from Amazon for Kindle that were just
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:25.600]   so badly done that I had to crack the file open, get the digital files and produce an unlocked
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:31.120]   version just so that I could not navigate it more intelligently than what's available.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:36.400]   Comixology, they are a publisher of digital comics and nothing else. They developed a format that
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:41.360]   is optimized just for reading digital comics, whether you're reading it on a big old iPad,
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.360]   a tiny little phone or anything in between. So you definitely want to get your stuff from
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:52.240]   Comixology in half of other places. Absolutely. I've bought iBooks, I bought Kindle Books and
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:57.600]   Comixology. I buy far the best. And I'd also recommend if you've only ever seen Batman on the TV,
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:01.920]   go buy Batman Year One, The Killing Joke and Dark Knight Returns. And you will know everything
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:07.760]   you need to know about Batman. Oh, I love the Dark Knight stuff. So last week, you, Mr. Alex
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:11.920]   Lindsay, maybe it was a couple of weeks ago, recommended that we all run out. Was it you?
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:15.280]   I don't know, but I did go run out and go buy it. No, actually it was a Renee.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:18.880]   It was we were talking about the Anki Drive. And it was me. Was Andy,
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:22.640]   Andy, and K.I. I don't know who recommended it, but I know that I bought it. It's sitting and
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:27.600]   waiting tonight is the cost me a lot of money this holiday. Oh, so you haven't played with it yet?
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:33.360]   No, it's I'm trying to roll. Yes. I'm rolling it out. I'm rolling it out for my son. Fortunately,
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:38.320]   he doesn't watch the show tonight. So my son was underwhelmed. He wanted more explosions.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:41.920]   So I get to keep it. My son's younger. Yeah, no, I think he's gonna he just looks.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:48.320]   It's very cool. So you you all saw it, which was it's these kind of slot cars using Bluetooth
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:53.600]   LE get your get your Anki drive on your smartphone so we can play here. And they're really cool.
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:23:00.560]   The the chargers look like mice, they're USB chargers, and it comes with a three-plunk plug.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:05.760]   The starter kit is and by the way, ridiculously expensive to what it's two ninety nine for
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:13.360]   a for a track and two a track and two cars. And then you and I both bought four cars total.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:19.280]   The cars are autonomous. They have AI. So you can drive one and the other three will drive against
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:23.760]   you, which is a lot of fun. So I thought we did do this. So they charge up. They take about
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:28.480]   eight to 10 minutes to charge up for 20 minutes of driving. That's good. And each car has its own
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:34.080]   unique, not only look, but its own unique capabilities. Some are better defensively.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:38.560]   Some guess there's guns, although they're all imaginary. They're they're some are real.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:43.760]   They're not real guns. Question is, does the NSA have a backdoor to your to your computer?
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:47.760]   This is row. I'm sure the NSA is a little chip in this one. They know exactly how you drive.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:53.280]   This is a catal. I think these are the start. These are not the starter kits. These are the
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:24:00.320]   extra ones. This one is a Boson. It's kind of pretty, isn't it? And then finally, and these are all
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:04.080]   charge up. I've been charging. They don't take very long charge up. The yellow one is called
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:09.200]   kurai. So I don't know how we're going to do this microphone wise. You have a handheld? Okay,
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:14.480]   good. So let me let me why don't you join me Alex? Get the on key drive. It's an iPhone app
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:18.240]   on a and K I drive. Well, we'll get started with it. You have to kind of program these.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:24.720]   All right. And he's already done this, right? Yep. I as a matter of fact, I had someone over
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:28.880]   and it was hard to get the controllers back. It's a lot of fun. As a part of the starter kit is
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:36.160]   this big track. It's a vinyl just a vinyl sheet. But the the cars are smart. So I'm going to turn
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:40.480]   up the sound which they recommend. Whoa. Some Apple stores have demos set up too. So if you're
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:45.760]   not convinced, you can go and watch them. It's fun to play. I got to say, I like it. But Henry was
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:51.760]   less like I said, less than overwhelmed. He wasn't underwhelmed. He wasn't overwhelmed. He was just
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:56.800]   well. Yeah, it's kind of cool. His friends played over the for a while. I think it's a little too
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:02.880]   intellectual, frankly. I think he wants something that actually blows up. So I'm going to keep,
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:07.200]   you can hear me a little bit, right? Because I want to keep the mic near the the iPad. I'm running
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:13.280]   the iPhone app. So notice the first thing it says connect to my cars. Whoops. Oh, that's scary.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:18.800]   Connect to my cars to get started. So it's going to tell me drive as best with sound. Yes, indeed.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:27.840]   I've turned it up. And now it's going to say get started. And I'm going to plug in the vehicles.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:31.520]   I've already charged the vehicles. We have a yellow one and a silver one. Let's put those
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:37.520]   down with you. You're almost done. All right. So I'll put these down here. These vehicles are
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:45.680]   here yellow and silver. My shoes, Leo. You like the shoes? Yes. Very comfy. They go well with my
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:50.880]   tuxedo. Do I have to be on this? Oh, very Mickey Mouse. I have to go plug these in. This is part of
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:58.800]   the annoyance factor. Huh? Is that the setup is, I mean, arcane. Well, and the other question is,
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:03.520]   do I have to be on the same Wi-Fi network? Yeah, we all have to be on production. No, it's blue
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:10.080]   juthele. You do not have to be on any Wi-Fi network. So plugged in and plugged in. Okay,
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:16.400]   they're plugged in both. Okay, good. Now connecting, put vehicles on track and push. Okay. You see
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:21.280]   already why Henry was disturbed. It's like, what? I got to go plug it in. I already charged it.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:27.440]   And Leo's like, in my day, you had to put gas in your car. All right. Now watch. You get started
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:34.400]   by doing this. All right. And now they're following the track. So it says initializing AI.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:39.920]   The future racing. The car's just did that themselves.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:45.920]   Is there a Patrick Stewart? Sounds like the card.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:01.920]   And watch, because the cars are doing the little tricks. I'm not doing all art. All right, Eric.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:07.840]   And let's slip the cars off. The line must be drawn. Yeah.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:20.960]   That's so windy. So far I've done nothing. Watch as the yellow car
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.800]   carie uses its pulse carbine weapon to attack his opponent.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:31.040]   Second car on the left.
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:47.040]   Isn't it just a little bit freaky that you're you're hearing this voice over while it's matching
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.240]   perfectly to something that is physically happening with these two cars.
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:58.480]   That's part of what I like about this. A lot of it is really like having
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:04.480]   an aquarium. This physical things interacting with each other in a very real way.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:06.960]   You're asking for onky fish.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:15.040]   Now choose a car and let's teach you how to drive. I plugged them in.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:16.640]   All right, I'm going to select the yellow car.
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.080]   He's talking to Wesley Crusher and the inspirational.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:27.520]   You have tractor beam and you have a pulse charge.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:34.320]   And I'm the yellow car. Remember, so I'm going to slide the speed up.
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.720]   We slowed down. I wrote the post-order.
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:41.120]   If Andy and I had Scottish accents, we could do the traditional BBC coverage.
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:49.200]   And now you oversteered it.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:55.440]   I'm going now. This is as fast as it goes.
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:59.600]   But in real life, that'd be 432 miles.
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:03.360]   It's James May. I'm watching.
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:06.640]   So I'm right now. I'm in the outside lane.
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:08.640]   I'm going to hold you to the left.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:16.160]   And so you can't not stay in.
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:22.400]   Blast him, Leo.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:27.040]   I'm going to create a little pain.
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:32.800]   Don't call Leo the the Intimidator of the carpet for nothing.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:36.880]   This is your trigger, which fires your currently equipped weapon.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.440]   All you drive is start with this.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:43.120]   This is my Yankee car. There are many just like it, but this one is on.
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:48.480]   This is your support, which activates your vehicle.
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:53.920]   A little teapot, short and stout. This is my handle.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:56.720]   This is my spell.
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:00.320]   Now press and hold the trigger to fire your weapon.
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:04.320]   I tout the car on the back of the car. All my hate and all my anger.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.640]   But I had a false panic. It's about my...
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:11.040]   Good job, Leo.
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:14.320]   Leo got the Decepticon.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:18.880]   Using them too much can make you vulnerable to attack.
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:24.160]   When a vehicle runs out of energy, it becomes disabled and the attack earns a point.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:29.120]   Congratulations on completing the new use of drugs.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.120]   You might be able to care.
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:34.000]   Pedal to my drift.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.200]   I'm going to create a player and that player will be me.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.680]   My intro, buddy, felling cars.
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:45.200]   Turn up the track and someday morning action action action action action.
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.480]   That's a little wrist way.
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:47.680]   Twist studios.
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:48.880]   I'm going to play with friends.
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.440]   So who will host some say?
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:54.080]   Choose players looking for players.
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:54.880]   All right. All right.
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:55.840]   So you can play.
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:58.560]   You can pair with them.
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.560]   Oh, now you have to go through the training now, I see.
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:01.440]   It's at the same time.
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.120]   See, this is what I found.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:05.280]   This is why the kids didn't want to play with this.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.240]   Because everyone had to get trained.
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:07.760]   Because everybody has to go through this crap.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:08.720]   Right.
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:10.800]   Like drivers.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.240]   I'm going to play against you by...
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.080]   I'm going to play against all three of you.
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:14.800]   Hold on a second.
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:16.640]   All right, here we go.
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:18.080]   We call them "bustig".
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:20.560]   Oh, we know it.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:25.520]   And on that bottom shot.
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:33.520]   You've already been scolded.
[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:36.320]   These are to all the vehicles.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.040]   Right.
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.800]   A little hazard lights on the back of it.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.160]   They're not registered yet.
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:42.800]   Oh, lap three.
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.560]   We already have a yellow caution out.
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:48.480]   Very, very slick road surface today.
[01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.680]   Not surprised.
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:50.880]   Let's see how this could be annoying.
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:55.040]   And Tony Stark is just doing on driving.
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:57.200]   I think I'm going to have to do this all before my son gets home.
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:00.160]   Because he won't put up with going through this training process.
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:03.840]   How old is he, Alex?
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.040]   He's six.
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:06.800]   Yeah, I think the chance.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:12.560]   Whoa!
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.120]   Whoa!
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:13.600]   Whoa!
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:15.600]   That guy.
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.080]   That guy.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:18.400]   I've got lightning McQueen attitude.
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:22.880]   Oh no, he's...
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:24.080]   He's...
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:27.360]   Days of thunder, saying, "You know what?
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:28.640]   I don't know which one I'm controlling."
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.000]   Back on the Oakheart track,
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.760]   you might have been the hotshot driver,
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:34.480]   but here you're part of Pennzoil Racing T.
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:37.600]   No, I think you're in gray.
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:40.560]   The cinch.
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:43.440]   Mine still, I'm showing like some kind of...
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:47.440]   Red cars, a show-blader.
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:51.280]   Look at that corner.
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:52.160]   That's so draining.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:53.680]   That's extremely still talking.
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:56.240]   Red is the pace car.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:57.760]   Wesley shut up.
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:00.560]   Engaged.
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.320]   Oh, hands!
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:03.280]   Abandon ship!
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.320]   Abandon ship!
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.480]   It happened in the past.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.360]   It's in the past.
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:07.680]   Well...
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:10.160]   Whoa!
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:17.200]   Playing the role of Godzilla on the wristband.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.280]   Also, a track.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:19.840]   It's a track.
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:21.280]   The wall.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.080]   There's a little hazard ledge.
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.800]   I'm almost there.
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:25.600]   I think I'm...
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:29.360]   This is down.
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.200]   The thing is, it's hazard monitor.
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:32.000]   I have control of the yellow.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:38.000]   I don't know, I can...
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:38.480]   I'm...
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:39.680]   Blue.
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:40.080]   Whoa!
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.760]   Whoa!
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:42.400]   I spun out.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:48.080]   Pennz will turn all the vehicles to the track.
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:48.720]   Make it serve.
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:49.280]   Obviously...
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:51.520]   Obviously, it's not a single effort.
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:55.440]   I really have to give our due to the Mountain Dew Pit crew.
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:58.000]   That really got me times out there quickly.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.480]   Also, we got the Omega Watch hat system
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:04.880]   that we've got for the timing really came through.
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:06.480]   T.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:10.160]   Well, it's changing baseball caps three times during the speech.
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:16.320]   It's three minutes till New Year's somewhere.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:19.760]   [Laughing]
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:26.720]   Damn you bandit!
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:28.960]   [Laughing]
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:31.600]   Leo, you're in control of semi-sentient organisms
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:32.800]   just banning their destiny.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:40.480]   Nairobi, Bangkok, Cardone, Minsk, and Riyadh.
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.480]   You're still getting trained.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.400]   So this is what I found very annoying.
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.080]   And then the other problem is you can only...
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:53.040]   It says you can, you know, once you choose your upgrades,
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:53.520]   that's it.
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:55.440]   I don't know if that's tied to the car,
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.600]   or tied to your software, or what.
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:00.240]   Can you put a beverage holder on top of them?
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:01.440]   Hey, you're shooting at me?
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:03.680]   Somebody shot at me!
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:06.320]   Oh!
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.640]   See, may someone think about Binsk.
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:10.720]   I found this to be part of the fun.
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:14.400]   The idea of just learning how this thing works.
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:15.200]   Oh!
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:16.240]   That's not allowed!
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:21.920]   And unless you play much more in title,
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:23.360]   they're going to be asked to surrender your password.
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:23.840]   No, I'm blue.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:26.160]   I am?
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:28.640]   This keeps the shiny side up, boys.
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:29.200]   No, I'm blue.
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:30.160]   [Laughing]
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:33.600]   I don't know who gray is.
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:36.000]   Brazen AI.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:36.960]   So you're playing now.
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:41.360]   I hear Patrick Stewart is still.
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:42.240]   A talent gray.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:43.520]   A talent.
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:47.760]   Anyway, that concludes this episode of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:51.040]   I want to thank Andy and Aco, the Chicago Sun-Times,
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:52.480]   for being here.
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.640]   Do I ask no while gear, or whatever you say,
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:56.480]   and whatever weird language you say,
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:57.040]   serving it?
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:58.160]   I'm sure you're there, yeah.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:01.200]   And I do want to thank you for getting Alex and me both
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.400]   to waste our money on this.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:05.040]   Well done.
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:10.160]   For God's sakes, open up your heart to childish wonder Leo.
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:12.320]   Leo, we have 20 seconds still,
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:12.960]   nairobi.
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:14.960]   20 seconds still, nairobi.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:15.760]   Do we have anybody in nairobi?
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:16.720]   Yeah, we do.
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:17.280]   We do.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:18.640]   So get on over here.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:19.120]   10.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.640]   Oh, we got something in nairobi.
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:28.800]   8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:29.840]   Happy New Year!
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:32.800]   [Cheering]
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:34.160]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.600]   Thanks to Alex Lindsay.
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.360]   Renee Ritchie, i'm Warr.com.
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:38.720]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:39.920]   Now get back to work.
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:41.040]   Wait, we got it.
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:44.160]   Here's our nairobi and happy new year, nairobi.
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:44.960]   What's your name?
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:48.480]   Please, this is my name behind.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.240]   Nice to see you.
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:51.200]   And where are you?
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:52.080]   Are you in Kenya?
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:52.240]   I am.
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:54.320]   Please, I am.
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:54.960]   I am.
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:55.360]   I am.
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:55.920]   I am.
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:56.400]   I am.
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:57.040]   It's my country.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:58.960]   That's wonderful.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:00.720]   Well, it's great to talk to you.
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:01.840]   And do you celebrate?
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:02.960]   Do you celebrate New Year?
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:04.080]   Is your calendar the same?
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:04.880]   I don't think it is.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:06.880]   It is.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:07.360]   It is.
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:10.000]   Actually, it's a better thing.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.040]   You guys invented it.
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.720]   So.
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:13.120]   No, actually.
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:15.920]   So I think some pope made it up.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:18.320]   I don't know.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:19.520]   [Laughter]
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:20.080]   You don't know.
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:23.840]   Well, that's welcome to 2014.
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:24.160]   Yes.
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:27.600]   Finally, after a long period of listening and
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:29.440]   being your videos, finally I'm talking to you.
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:31.040]   Oh, it's wonderful to talk to you.
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.240]   Yeah, by the way, my name is Sammy.
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:35.040]   Did I mention?
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:35.440]   Sammy.
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:37.760]   Lamb.
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:38.320]   Islam.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:38.960]   That's your name.
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:40.880]   Yes, exactly.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:41.360]   Oh.
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:43.120]   What is that?
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:43.600]   It's like religion.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.760]   It's your name and named Islam.
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:47.040]   Well, it's nice to meet you.
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.560]   And say again where you are.
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:51.120]   Okay.
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:56.560]   Bahrain is an island between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:56.960]   Wow.
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.320]   It's a kingdom.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:03.200]   And I am in the capital Bahrain,
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:03.600]   which is my name.
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:07.840]   And there are a couple of records.
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.440]   Bahrain means Putin.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:12.320]   He's in Bahrain.
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:13.120]   Yeah, Bahrain.
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:13.680]   Yeah.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:14.480]   It means what?
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:19.760]   Two C's.
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:22.800]   Because you are in between two different C's.
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:29.200]   I'm going to, we're going to pull it up on Google Maps
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:29.680]   right now.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:33.440]   There is al-Mannama, which is where you are.
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:34.400]   Wow.
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:36.720]   What is the weather like right now?
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:38.560]   Is it beautiful or is it cold?
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:41.680]   Slightly cold.
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:43.520]   When you mention cold,
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.280]   to every degree centigrade,
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:47.680]   we have a wet picture here.
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:50.320]   So I'm not sure what is that Fahrenheit?
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:53.040]   It's a good temperature.
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:54.560]   That's a pleasant temperature.
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:55.920]   It's fact it's just right.
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:57.600]   Running around 20.
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:57.840]   Yeah.
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:01.680]   So you're in the bay there between Qatar
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:05.120]   and Saudi Arabia.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:06.720]   Exactly.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:09.280]   And above us is by the dead and to it.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:10.240]   Wow.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:13.040]   Well, it is so great to talk to you.
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:15.760]   What does the celebration of New Year's in Bahrain mean?
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:20.720]   Well, it depends because we have a lot of Americans,
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:23.120]   here in British and New Zealand,
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:24.240]   for a lot of countries.
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:28.320]   We have a humanity amount of Asians.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:32.800]   From every country in Asia, we have V-point here.
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:36.240]   Well, so it's a melting pot.
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:40.400]   Exactly like everyone's celebrate different.
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.320]   We have from Pakistan, we have from China,
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:43.760]   we have from India,
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:46.640]   we have in Russia, UK,
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:49.680]   we have an army base.
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:52.320]   I actually live near here in Bahrain.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:56.160]   I am so thrilled that you spent your New Year's Eve with us.
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:58.320]   And I'm sorry we didn't get to you for the countdown.
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:00.160]   We were busy playing with those silly cars.
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.520]   The eye was counting down.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:04.800]   Would you do it for us again?
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.880]   Is it Arabic that you do it?
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:12.480]   No, I didn't finish because I'm not sure Arabic is a common language there.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:13.280]   Do it in Arabic.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:14.320]   Let's hear it.
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:14.880]   Five.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:17.440]   No, five is true.
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:26.880]   And now how do we say Happy New Year?
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:31.840]   And how do you say Happy New Year?
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:34.400]   He said it.
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:36.400]   Yeah, actually.
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:38.560]   He has somebody from Saudi Arabia visiting us.
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.520]   So he's waving at you all the way across the ocean.
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:43.920]   Actually, you're very lucky to be there in your state.
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:48.640]   I'm seriously hoping to look for to see you in person.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:51.280]   And I actually thought to Tony a lot about
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:54.640]   actually covering two points.
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:56.400]   Would you please allow me to do this?
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:57.520]   Absolutely.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:58.400]   Please go right ahead.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:05.040]   You did something pretty nice converting your next cast, as you call it,
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:12.400]   from an audio only to video only, because this enhances the perspective of your talk
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.000]   and grabs the attention.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.280]   And this is very critical for me because I'm a visual person.
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:17.680]   Yes.
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:22.160]   I thought it was listening to Twitch on an application on the right calls.
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:24.240]   But I couldn't handle it.
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:27.360]   I kept losing track of talk.
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.200]   I switched to Twitch with DC directly.
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:32.560]   I watched about seven or seven.
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.000]   I don't remember perfectly.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.840]   Seven podcasts from your network.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:38.480]   Wow.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:39.680]   Which are your favorites?
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:44.960]   I started all about Android because I met.
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:45.440]   Good choice.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.680]   I met an Android fan.
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:51.840]   No, actually, the first one was this week in Google.
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:52.400]   Okay.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.560]   Then all about Android.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:56.720]   And then this week in technology.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:01.760]   And then this week in tech news and in TNT.
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:06.640]   I watched NSFW for once and they didn't like it.
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:07.840]   I'm with you.
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:09.360]   I've only seen it once.
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.600]   I don't want to see it again.
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:12.880]   I'm going to be in it today.
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:15.040]   Maybe we could, you know, Brian Brushwood is here.
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:16.080]   We are going to have a magic show.
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:17.680]   You can raise the bar a little about this.
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:19.840]   I know I believe me, Islam.
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:23.040]   I know where you're coming from on that one.
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:24.800]   But we try to please everybody.
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:31.600]   I watched iPad and iPhone 5 maybe.
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:32.160]   That's great.
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:32.400]   Yeah.
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:34.240]   iPad today and i5 for the iPhone.
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:36.880]   Do you, what is your business?
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:37.840]   What do you do for a living?
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:42.960]   I'm actually an engineer in one of the three companies here.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:43.600]   That's awesome.
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:48.560]   And I'm in a lot of perspective.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:50.720]   I am in Bahrain, TNT.
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:52.880]   Ah, he's a telco guy.
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:57.520]   So does the NSA have a tap into the telco in Bahrain?
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:02.240]   Well, no, no, no, don't worry.
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:04.000]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.720]   We don't need one thing about this.
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:07.920]   No, I'm serious.
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:09.040]   I don't mind it.
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:09.360]   Okay.
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:12.480]   The fact that it is in many ways,
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:17.040]   we have a known perspective that everyone is listening.
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:17.360]   Yes.
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:22.160]   I watch the dates.
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:26.880]   I just had spontaneous combustion of this champagne bottle.
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:27.680]   I apologize.
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:31.440]   It's just all of a sudden it went off all by itself.
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:34.000]   Wow.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.560]   I'm glad that wasn't, you know, like I wasn't sitting on it.
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:41.280]   So you, you, you and you're in a Bahrain,
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:44.080]   you assume that people are listening all the time.
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:49.120]   In the Middle East, we assume that you, it's listening.
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:50.160]   We are listening.
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:50.880]   Of course we are.
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:54.160]   Here's assuming this.
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:56.160]   No, I think it's probably the case.
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:56.800]   Absolutely.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:01.280]   I'm seriously amazed that you didn't believe this.
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:07.840]   Well, I think I think we knew of this and we knew of going back to post 9/11,
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:13.200]   we knew of widespread snooping.
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:15.680]   But it wasn't until we really saw the scope of it.
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:18.480]   I think that people really realized it wasn't, you know,
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:21.120]   here and there investigating a particular case,
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:25.840]   but it was really, it was really a wide, a net that was cast very wide.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:27.200]   It's a much better story.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:29.840]   See, before it was being told to us and now they're showing us.
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:31.440]   See, they're just over a visual.
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:32.400]   As you said, it's love.
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:33.360]   They're always watching.
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:35.840]   Very, very good point of view.
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:37.920]   Point of light mentioned.
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:40.400]   And this is, I guess you mentioned this today.
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:48.480]   And I was having this very bad problem with all tech news in the internet completely.
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:52.400]   There is, okay, let me go back a little.
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:56.640]   I started working on the internet because I'm actually a little young.
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:58.240]   So I'm 29 years old.
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:01.040]   So I started around 2000.
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:08.240]   And as usual, as a young person, I started in 10 bedrooms.
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:09.840]   I remember this, but what's the name?
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:16.240]   And people did not believe me when I mentioned that I am from Egypt.
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:17.600]   I'm actually from Egypt, by the way.
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:17.600]   Ah.
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:22.640]   So, no, I am from Egypt.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:24.960]   No, you're not.
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:25.440]   You're Jewish?
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:31.280]   I would always say Egypt was the second country that had failed.
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:38.960]   So in Egypt, we had computers since the 80s.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.600]   We had the internet since the 90s.
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:45.840]   And the internet became a public thing in the 2000s.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:48.240]   So 13 years old.
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:51.920]   We are in a very good shape.
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.680]   Let's see that it's not as good as in USA or UK.
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:59.280]   But we have a good internet connectivity.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:04.480]   We had a good understanding of technology.
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:06.000]   I am a technology geek.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.280]   I started on Windows 3, I remember.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:09.840]   Wow.
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:14.400]   At 1993, when I was 80 years old,
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:19.680]   then started Windows 95, I un-
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:26.080]   I disassembled my first computer at 1996 with my brother.
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:31.360]   And I bought, I assembled a new computer in 1998.
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:37.920]   I started with every version of Windows and Office since...
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:39.920]   Office, sorry, not Office, Word.
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:41.840]   And Word.
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:44.400]   Then Office 93 and Office 93.
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:48.320]   You've convinced me, Islam, you're a geek, I believe you.
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:53.440]   When did you come from Egypt to Bahrain?
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:56.480]   Five months ago.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:57.440]   Oh, you're new.
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:59.920]   Are you going to stay there or go back to Egypt?
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:00.480]   Yes.
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:04.000]   I know I'm staying here because I work in the company.
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.120]   I'm not a visitor here.
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:05.920]   Right.
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:07.600]   I have to say one thing.
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:12.640]   Every time, everywhere on the internet, make it quick, make it together.
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:13.680]   Both are stored.
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:19.840]   Any sit, it will stay world-wide.
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:23.040]   And then when I see this world-wide list,
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:28.320]   there is no Middle East or Africa at all.
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:29.760]   And then you say world-wide.
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:31.760]   You are missing one continent.
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:34.720]   And what continent is that?
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:39.440]   Do we...
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:40.480]   As he frozen?
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:41.360]   I never know.
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.560]   I think what he was saying is he was missing...
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:45.040]   He said in all of the news, you're missing Africa.
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:46.560]   We sweep through Africa, which is...
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.440]   I'm really sorry.
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:48.320]   And one of the...
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:49.200]   I'm sorry?
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:50.160]   Oh, we got you back.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.200]   We lost you for a little bit.
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:52.960]   It's a weak connection, Islam.
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:53.840]   But you know, one of the...
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:55.280]   I'm actually...
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:55.920]   You are...
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:59.760]   That you are overloaded with connections from people
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:01.280]   and trying to stream your body.
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:02.320]   It could very well be that.
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:05.680]   I'm glad to hear it Islam.
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:06.560]   That's great.
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:08.000]   And you know, we have this guy here,
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.240]   Alex Lindsey, who goes to Africa at least once a year
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:13.920]   and has been really good at helping us understand better
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:18.320]   the diversity and the vast size of that country of a continent.
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:23.120]   It's a difference to this force of saying that
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:27.680]   Middle East immigrants from the planet and Africa as well exist on the planet.
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:29.760]   And we have everything.
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:33.840]   And actually I'm a very interested person in technology.
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:34.800]   And I have...
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:35.840]   Who...
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:37.440]   I'm actually believing that
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.200]   in the Middle East alone,
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.840]   Samsung is investing a lot because
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:45.440]   they are selling millions of phones in Middle East,
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:47.600]   on and in Bahrain.
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:50.720]   I saw about...
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:54.080]   or 20, not three in the same way to flow.
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:56.880]   One and the other thing,
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:58.800]   if you want to see a bunch of great videos,
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:00.560]   we streamed Transform Africa,
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:02.400]   which is out of Rwanda in October.
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:04.000]   And it's all up on YouTube now.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.320]   And it's a great collection of everything from leaders from Africa to...
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:12.880]   I mean, around East Africa, as well as from all over Africa
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:15.840]   in the Middle East talking about, you know,
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:17.040]   the what's happening there.
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:18.240]   And it's definitely worth checking out.
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:19.280]   I really want to say that this...
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:25.440]   I hope that this today will begin a new focus from us here to focus globally,
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:27.120]   not just the Middle East, not just Africa,
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:30.160]   but globally and not be so US-centric.
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:32.640]   Because I think that that's one of the things that connects us,
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:34.560]   all of us geeks, is technology.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:36.480]   I'm sorry, I'm not getting into from you.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:38.640]   All right, you know what?
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:40.160]   The Skype is failing.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:42.960]   Islam, it is so good to talk to you.
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:45.440]   I wish you a happy, happy 2014.
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:47.440]   And I look forward to having you here in the broadcast.
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:48.560]   All you're here.
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:49.200]   Thank you.
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:50.640]   I'm looking forward to this year,
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:52.960]   and I'm looking forward to follow everything we do.
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:54.000]   Thank you very much.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.040]   Take care.
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:56.560]   Happy New Year, Islam.
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:57.360]   Happy New Year.
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:49:59.520]   And we will...
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:03.040]   Yeah, you know, this is really to me the most important thing about everything
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:05.120]   that is happening in technology,
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:07.200]   is that we really remember it as a global world,
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:09.600]   and there's nothing that brings us together better than the internet.
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:10.080]   Absolutely.
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:15.040]   And the best hope for peace on our planet is this kind of connection,
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:16.800]   talking to people instead of demonizing them.
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:18.960]   And I think it's really fabulous that we can do this,
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:20.240]   and we want to do a whole lot more.
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:23.280]   I have to say that if someone wants to...
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:26.160]   If someone in the chat room or anywhere wants to recommend
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:31.440]   like an Apple like tech podcast that is actually based in Africa,
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:37.840]   that's actually based in Asia, that's based someplace about 6,000 miles away from North America,
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:39.440]   I'd actually be very, very interested.
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:45.920]   Ideally in English, but it's like there's such a totally different perspective when you...
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:49.200]   It's the same technology, same types of users,
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:53.360]   but when you put into a different environment and you wonder why are people...
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:58.560]   Why is a certain type of phone, why is a certain type of device much more popular overseas
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:01.520]   than here? Why is this application the number one seller over there?
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:05.920]   When you think that there is a localized equivalent available for it,
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:11.040]   and that's the only thing you get by listening to the counterpart to...
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:15.120]   Geeks are geeks everywhere, even if the environment is different.
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:18.880]   So it'd be great to hear the same complaints that people need about Microsoft,
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:21.520]   filtered through the problems about using it in a different process.
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:24.720]   We had a better connection, I would have asked Islam, what do you think of all the crap where
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:30.000]   Samsung's loaded on the Note 3? And we would have had a good conversation about that, no doubt.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.880]   We're going to wrap up Mac Break Weekly, we've got a science show coming up,
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:38.640]   we're going to blow some stuff up in just a bit. I want to thank you Andy and Aco for joining us.
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:43.760]   Happy New Year, have a great New Year's Eve, and we'll see you in 2014 on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:49.280]   Thank you Andy, take care. Thanks to Renee Richie too, happy New Year in Montreal.
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:51.040]   New Year, Bonane.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:54.480]   Bonane, Au revoir, and we'll see you in...
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:55.520]   Alaprochene.
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:56.080]   De Mio...
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:01.440]   These are the cattors, de Mio cattors, yes?
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:03.680]   Yeah, I'm off to CES next week, but I'll be back the week after.
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:06.800]   Okay good, have fun at CES, maybe we'll hook up you with you there.
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:07.760]   That's great, thanks Renee.
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:08.240]   Thanks Renee.
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:09.200]   Take care.
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:10.560]   You're going to go to Vegas too Andy?
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:14.480]   Yep, I'll be leaving the middle of the week, but I will be there for the first few days.
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:17.760]   Unheard of, unheard of, that's awesome.
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:22.560]   I decided that I need to increase my risk of sunstroke and skin cancer.
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:24.720]   I doctor advised it so.
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:27.200]   Enjoy a fine cigarette or two while you're out here as well.
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:31.280]   Thank you everybody, thank you Alex Lindsey, you're going to go make some drinks,
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:32.720]   we're going to go blow some stuff up.
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:35.600]   Thank you everybody for joining us, now get back to work because
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:53.040]   back break is over and two-thirds over at 2.30.
