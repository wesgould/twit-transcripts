[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.520]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.640]   We're going to cover Macintosh.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.040]   We're going to cover iPods.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.960]   We're going to cover iPhones, all the Apple stuff.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.120]   With my good buddy, Mr. Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.240]   in studio with us today.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.840]   Say hello, Alex.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.760]   Hello.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.520]   Also via Skype from Boston, Massachusetts,
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.680]   the Snowden and the Inatco.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.360]   Snowden, but never snowed out, sir.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.160]   Never snowed job.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.360]   And Andy is, of course, the tech writer
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.880]   for the Chicago Sun Times and his celestial waste of bandwidth
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.960]   blog is a must read.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.440]   We gathered today just two weeks away from the big, perhaps,
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.880]   Apple announcement on the 26th.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.480]   Andy, you believe so deeply in the goodness and the kindness
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.720]   and the great good fortune of Mr. Stephen K. Jobs.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.760]   What is Steve Jobs' middle name?
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.000]   Tiberius.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.640]   Tiberius.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.800]   It's a trick question.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.600]   That you are going to fly out here,
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.400]   even though there's been no invitation, no confirmation.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.120]   Yes.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.520]   You're crazy.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.080]   Well, no, no.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.360]   Realize this is not an article of faith.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.720]   This isn't a statement that I'm so
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.720]   much certain this is going to happen,
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.560]   that I've made all these arrangements.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.720]   It's more like I'm so certain about a week ago,
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.200]   I was so certain that I was not going to find a better
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.680]   airfare than 230 bucks that I have friends.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.160]   That's a good deal.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.880]   Worst case scenario that I can stay with in San Francisco,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.880]   so maybe it won't cost me that much money.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.040]   And that if a week before the purported event,
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.640]   Apple does tender announcement and puts something
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.520]   in that invitation that makes me think,
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.920]   yeah, either they're being real jerks about it
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.880]   or this is definitely a tablet announcement.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.680]   That's when I'll be thinking, OK, so airfare will cost me $780.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.920]   I can't buy my friends around a town,
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.800]   so I can't stay with them.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.000]   So it only costs about $1,300 to attend.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.720]   And if this is a talent announcement,
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.480]   this does come under the purview of,
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.000]   this is what you're paid to do, son.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.120]   You really should be there.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.160]   So this is either a vacation or the most important
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.720]   announcement of our lifetime.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.880]   Our lifetime, yes.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.880]   I'll find some way to make a tax deductible.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.680]   I'll wind up some work.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.600]   And if worst comes to worst, it'll be nice to have
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.080]   a couple of days in which I don't have to be the person
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.440]   saying, oh, wow, yes, I had no idea
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.880]   that I had a twin brother.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.720]   And yes, the documentation is perfect.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.640]   I'm actually going to be in your town next week,
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.240]   but gee, I'm already triple booked.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.600]   I really don't have time to see you, but thanks for emailing.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.200]   So I'll have a couple of days to see this.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.000]   I understand there's a bridge that's all read and sparkly,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.640]   and that could be visited.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.560]   I'll do some sightseeing.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.360]   I'll do some tourism.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.600]   I'll have some of those chops.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.400]   I understand the cheesesteak sandwiches
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.360]   that are so popular in San Francisco.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.360]   I've never had one because I've never had time to go to--
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.560]   Andy.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.760]   He knows I think is the place--
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.360]   Andy, that's Philadelphia.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.200]   I know they're fattening.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.920]   I know they're fattening.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.360]   You know, you're on vacation.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.200]   You're on vacation.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.040]   You've got to live it up.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.640]   That's Philadelphia, Andrew.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.200]   We have walking crab cocktails out here.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.280]   But I'm going to take you for a Permanis style sandwich.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.360]   Oh, what's that?
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.320]   So there's a--
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.440]   There's now talking about going right into a rat hole.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.680]   Let me mark that.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.680]   Eight minutes into the show.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.040]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have now had rat hole.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.240]   You know, we barely call it a rat hole,
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.560]   because we just entered it.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   Like we just entered the show.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.060]   I know.
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.440]   How can you have a rat hole from a show that
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.320]   has yet to begin?
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.820]   Exactly.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.000]   So it's not a deviation.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It's just the main core.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.600]   Anyway, so the Permanis is an incredible restaurant
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.640]   in a very blue collar restaurant in Pittsburgh.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.840]   But there's actually geodontos in San Francisco
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.160]   has the Permanis style sandwich.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.560]   And so it's really good meat.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.960]   It might be--
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.480]   it can be all kinds of different meats
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.000]   with coleslaw and fries in the sandwich.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   It's so good.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.120]   Because it just takes too long to--
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.620]   It is a--
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.120]   It is a four.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.880]   It is a version of a burrito.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.360]   The truckers are the truckers who are picking stuff up
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.320]   in the strip to turn--
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.820]   Strip to turn.
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.120]   But you can get this in San Francisco.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.920]   There's one guy.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.760]   And here's the thing.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.000]   Here's what's scary is it's actually better than the original
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.120]   because it's got better bread.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.800]   Can we get back to the tablet?
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.360]   Please.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.080]   I beg of you.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.320]   Fine.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.680]   Well, I just want to say--
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.000]   We haven't said everything there is to say about sandwiches.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.500]   Yes.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.720]   I'm not sure we haven't done the same thing about tablets, though.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.280]   I do want to say that I've made the commitment that I am going
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.520]   to drive all the way from Petaluma.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.520]   I made the commitment that that Tuesday, two weeks hence,
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.840]   I will be sitting here on this bouncy ball with cameras
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.520]   turned on--
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.000]   Waiting.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.720]   Waiting.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.560]   Because you know how many--
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.600]   For Andy, you live up Petaluma, driving to San Francisco
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.320]   becomes more and more of a-- you might as well fly across
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.680]   country.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.200]   Actually, now that I know that you're going to be--
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.840]   no, you haven't got an invitation, though, Andy.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.200]   You're just kind of going to be out here.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.160]   But I presume that somebody of your stature
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.840]   will receive an invitation.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.280]   Well, it's not an entitlement.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.720]   There's always--
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.880]   It's always possible if they've read any of certain things
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.960]   have been written in the past 10 years that might have pissed
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.640]   in the past 10 years.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.640]   No, they're not like that.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.560]   Oh, no, it's not like that.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.200]   I will never understand why they stopped inviting me.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.520]   But maybe because I never went.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.600]   I don't think it's bitter.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.040]   But I'm going to get an invitation--
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.800]   well, I'm going to try to get an invitation
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.160]   because Shira Lazar is going to be in town.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.280]   She said she would also go in and cover it for us.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.440]   So what I wanted to do is have a couple of people inside,
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.280]   a couple of people outside.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.080]   We're going to put Dane on his cardboard box.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.080]   He has a special cardboard box for his camera,
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.200]   and he's going to stand outside.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.720]   And we're going to have Jason Snell.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.120]   We're going to have a--
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.880]   if this is the big announcement, we're
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.280]   going to cover it top down up.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.200]   We're going to do our job.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.920]   And I'll tell you, let me tell you something.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.640]   At CES, everybody certainly believed
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.920]   that Apple was going to do a tablet.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.320]   Not only that, they pretty much seemed
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.480]   to think it was called the slate because there were about 800
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.120]   slate computers there.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.240]   And I'm not sure I buy this.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.000]   I'm not even rushing for the door.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.600]   They're rushing for that open door.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.920]   They're saying, whoa, here's a chance.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.880]   So I think there's a lot of credibility to this.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.040]   In fact, we're seeing some reports now.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.560]   According to ours, Technica, Apple
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.720]   is hoarding 10-inch screens.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.240]   They did it with NAND memory when they started making the iPod
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.040]   with lots of memory and the iPhone with lots of memory.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.440]   They bought up the entire world supply of flash memory.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.240]   Suppliers in Asia reportedly telling customers
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.880]   that there are no 10-inch LCD or OLED panels available anywhere.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.320]   Apple is buying them all according to a source that told
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.880]   T.G. Daily, we were designing a product for a customer
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.600]   and we needed 10-inch screens, but we've
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.360]   been trying for months and can't get one from any of the Asian
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.280]   suppliers.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.960]   We were told that Apple pre-ordered them all.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:50.960]   All.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.440]   That's like you walk into the supplier and they go,
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.360]   so how many would you like?
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.920]   We can do 50,000 or 100,000.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.800]   And the guy just says, yeah, we'd like all of them.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.880]   8 billion.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.400]   It's all of them.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.680]   It's interesting, though, LCDs and OLEDs.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.360]   So maybe there's going to be two models here,
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.000]   the cheaper LCD model, but you're going to want the OLED
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.240]   screen, but a 10-inch OLED.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.400]   You know, the 11-inch OLED TV from Sony was $2,500 last year.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.040]   Maybe we see a 799 OLED and a $4.99.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.920]   $11.99 OLED, $7.99 LCD.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.560]   Right, Andy?
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.040]   Yeah, I don't think they'd say--
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.440]   I don't think they'd be that granular about it saying,
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.040]   well, we have two identical tablets.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.280]   One has a slightly better screen at a premium price.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.920]   No, they'd say, this is the great one.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.560]   This is it.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.280]   Oh, no.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.360]   Why would you want a better screen than this?
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.120]   We're giving you the best screen there is.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.640]   You're right.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.760]   It's not Apple-style to have a cheesy screen.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.520]   But a 10-inch OLED screen--
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.960]   Oh, it's the first thing to admit that the cheaper one is cheesy.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.920]   Right.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.560]   So maybe this rumor is not credible, then,
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.560]   because they wouldn't have cornered both.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.400]   There's-- yeah, I mean, supplier rumors
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.800]   are always bought at the bottom of the totem pole,
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.080]   when I'm trying to evaluate whether something is true or not.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.880]   Really?
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.440]   There are a lot of reasons why something can go out among them.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.240]   Poor maintenance at a factory is possible
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.160]   that they were making plans one year in advance
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.400]   about how much demand there be for a certain component,
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.080]   and they totally blew it out of the water.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.320]   It's interesting, but it's just not usually very relevant.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.440]   I'll tell you, though, I love the thought that it might be OLED.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.520]   I just don't think there's any way it could be OLED.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.200]   Seems like you're really packing a lot in.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.840]   If you're going after the perfect tablet--
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.680]   That's what I would do.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.680]   No price consideration.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.080]   No cost is no consideration yet.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.560]   The Nexus One OLED screen is just stunning.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.480]   I mean, it's really gorgeous.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.560]   It's not great in daylight, though,
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.720]   and that's another thing you might want to keep in mind.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.720]   We had the same problem with the OLED on the Zoom HD.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.000]   It just didn't look great in daylight, so.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.160]   That's something to keep in mind.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.560]   You want a slate to look good in daylight.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.560]   All right, so that's good news.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.840]   The slate's definitely happening on the 26th.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.960]   Actually, Andy, you might have jinxed it.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.520]   I'm just thinking--
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.800]   No, I'm not a jinx.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.840]   I'm a tastemaker with an apple that's saying,
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.200]   if Apple's coming here, you know what?
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.760]   Let's bump it up three months, because he brings
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.520]   the world's attention with him.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.320]   What with his drunken escapades and his dating lady Gaga?
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.920]   I'm sure he'll bring a crammer crew.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.240]   Well, you will.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.120]   We've got that remote rig that Colin--
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.600]   All the collages--
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.720]   I'll be sure to pack my mustard wool sports coat
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.760]   with the ABC sports logo embroidered on the pack.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.960]   Because if I'm going to be like the wiper mode guy,
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.640]   I'll have a microphone with the huge foam ball on top of it.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.280]   That's it.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.440]   Blazer boy.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.440]   I want to get a lock on six in T can.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.920]   I'll be like, so what you see here is--
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.720]   The LED is going over the outside.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.960]   Boom.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.440]   That's it.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.480]   We can tell us straight it.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.360]   That'd be good.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.200]   That'd be good.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.280]   So yeah, it's two weeks hence.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.160]   Of course, it's on a Tuesday, right?
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.280]   Because that's when the show is.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.880]   We would spend perfect timing.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.480]   Be a morning event.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.760]   So that's when the show is.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.640]   We will turn on the cameras at 9 AM by Pacific time.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.760]   And we'll just--
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.680]   Assuming that we--
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.880]   No, no assumptions.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.240]   We will turn on--
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.360]   Even if it's a picture of Andy and Akko standing
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.520]   for Lornley and his mustard blazer--
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.960]   No, you can watch me by comics.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.320]   You can watch me at the Virgin Store if that's still open.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.040]   No, it's gone.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.640]   John Gruber says, for what it's worth,
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.080]   I'm hearing there's no camera webcam or otherwise on--
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.320]   And he capitalized it--
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.000]   The--
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.560]   Tablets.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.880]   I haven't heard that same rumor.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.800]   I've heard different rumors.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.560]   I've heard a front-facing camera on it from a fairly good--
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.520]   I would expect not only a front-facing camera,
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.040]   but I would expect minority report style page turning.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.800]   I didn't hear any--
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.920]   A number of people showing that off at CES,
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.440]   including Toshiba that had a remote-less remote control
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.880]   system that you would point at the screen,
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.640]   and you would wave your hand at the screen,
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.320]   and it worked only somewhat well.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.240]   But it requires a camera because a camera
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.840]   has to watch your gesturing.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.520]   I'm not sure you want to eat a lot of CPU cycles
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.200]   in a small device.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.120]   It'll be interesting to see.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.480]   It'll be interesting to see what they have.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.160]   We saw a lot of devices that had the Snapdragon processor
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.040]   from Qualcomm.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.400]   That's a 1 gigahertz, pretty powerful arm style processor
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.520]   from Qualcomm.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.760]   It seemed like a likely-- good battery life, something
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.560]   like eight or 10 hours on a small lithium-ion battery.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.200]   That's what a lot of these tablet makers at CES we're
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:20.960]   choosing.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.480]   Right.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.520]   Of course, you have no idea what Apple's going to do.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.760]   I'll be interested to see how well these other tablet
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.960]   manufacturers do.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.480]   I think they don't have the secret sauce,
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.680]   whatever that magic formula that Apple's going to have.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.280]   I still think they could be successful, though.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.480]   I think that the issue is that they--
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.320]   when you look at Apple is going to take the high ground,
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.480]   but there's Apple haters, and there's people
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.480]   looking for a bargain.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.320]   So if you got--
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.320]   Sounds like a Scottish folk song.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.080]   Oh, you take the high ground, and I'll take the low ground.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:50.580]   Exactly.
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.240]   They're going to meet at the Arboboena Center for it.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.340]   If you got the money, Apple's going to give you
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.340]   the best tablet.
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.540]   But there's going to be people who don't want to spend $800
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:12:59.980]   on a tablet.
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.920]   And there's also people that just don't want to buy anything
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:01.920]   from Apple.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.920]   I really liked it.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.420]   I think there's a $2,000 laptop that
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.060]   had this detachable tablet screen from Lenovo.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.800]   They call it the IdeaPad U1.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.440]   It was pretty cool.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.640]   It had a Snapdragon tablet.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.140]   And--
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:12.660]   It would run on its own?
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.500]   Like, all the tablet just run without--
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.620]   For 10 hours on its own running,
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.700]   Snapdragon and a Linux variant.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.900]   But you snap it back in, it becomes a screen for Windows 7
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.660]   laptop.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:21.660]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.140]   That was pretty interesting.
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.660]   But I think that any solution like that
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.020]   is just bound to fail.
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.780]   There's just-- people have never shown any interest
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.660]   in investing in a convertible style machine that either
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.780]   make it a really good tablet, make it a really good notebook.
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.620]   And if you're going to try to even do a convertible,
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.180]   try to make a cost less than a notebook and a tablet.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.180]   Because for that of my money--
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.220]   Yes, too great.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.900]   You could buy an Apple tablet and a real middle of the range
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.340]   Dell or HP notebook with an Intel Core dual processor.
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.380]   And probably an iPod besides.
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.700]   So no, that's not going to work.
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:56.220]   Not going to work.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.820]   Not going to happen.
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.740]   There's got to be a Bluetooth keyboard option for an eyeslight,
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.340]   though, right?
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:01.900]   I think so.
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.580]   I don't think so.
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.060]   No.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.220]   I can see how they wouldn't.
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.180]   I really feel like they should.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.380]   Why not, Andy?
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.980]   I feel like they should, and I want one.
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.340]   But I think that from what I've seen Apple do in the past,
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.540]   I think that they're going to be absolutely
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.340]   committed to the idea that this is a touch-based interface,
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.900]   that they don't want to give somebody an external hardware
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.180]   keyboard because then they'll see the touch interface
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.620]   as an option as opposed to this is part of the language
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:28.460]   of the machine.
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.460]   Surety.
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.860]   Steve's in the purity.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.220]   I'm not 100% sure about that.
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.700]   But I do believe that if Apple has the choice
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.660]   between adding Bluetooth keyboard as an option,
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.260]   or simply we're not having it, I don't think
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.300]   we're going to see a hardware keyboard.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.860]   I just love this speculation.
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.180]   And we're going to just replay these tapes later
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.660]   and let everybody laugh at us.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.620]   Because we don't know.
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.740]   I think the show last week was in a recording session
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.020]   like the night before that show.
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.500]   Yeah, we should.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.500]   The thing is, Apple has to do something radical.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.020]   I don't know.
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.820]   Have a foldable display.
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.700]   I know that's wild.
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.740]   I know that's nutty.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:06.820]   I'm sure I'm going to be wrong about it.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.620]   Go for it, man.
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.100]   Go for it.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.180]   Something in the air tells me it's going to be a foldable display.
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.820]   I think it's going to be flexible display.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.460]   I think it's going to roll up.
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.380]   You can actually roll it up.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.700]   It's going to be soft rubber OLED.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.340]   And it's going to go in like a little tube for parchment paper.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.820]   Yeah, perfect.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.180]   Actually, the rumors now, Andy, I hope you have a ticket
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.260]   that can be extended because the rumors now
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.060]   may be the 27th, not the 26th.
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.660]   I have.
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.460]   I'm hitting town late Monday night.
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.140]   I'm taking the Red Eye home on Thursday night.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:35.980]   You'll be cool.
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:36.820]   There's no way.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.180]   So Apple has a three day--
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.420]   this is what I wrote about.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.380]   I've said that I'll be very, very disappointed
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.900]   if they do something on Friday or on Monday.
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:49.180]   I will have Apple reason to say, OK, so it is personal then.
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.700]   This isn't just narcissism.
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.260]   They actually are trying to screw with me.
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.140]   OK, good.
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:53.860]   Good to know.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.820]   I love all the link bait from all the Apple rumor sites.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:02.980]   Mac Observer, a source who said as a photograph of what he
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.900]   claims to be the glass used in Apple's--
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.860]   yeah, I know.
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.220]   Right at the front, you got to laugh a little bit.
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.060]   What he claims to be the glass using Apple's
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.540]   under an announced tablet device.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.340]   It looks like a giant iPod, an awful lot.
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.620]   There's no way it's going to look like that.
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:25.020]   It's just a Photoshop touch, basically.
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.340]   Of course, you'll look bad if it does.
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.780]   I'm prepared to look bad because that sucks.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.700]   And if that's what Apple does, then Apple looks bad first,
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.340]   me second, because that sucks.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.300]   I don't think it's going to look like that.
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.340]   I'm kind of surprised that Apple lost--
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:46.780]   Avi, by the way, Avi Tovanian has joined
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.740]   Elevation Partners, Bono's investment group--
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:50.540]   Putting some money.
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.300]   --as a managing director.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.420]   It's got to be a good--
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.260]   Avi was the chief software technology officer at Apple
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:56.940]   for a long time.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.660]   And I think he was part of the next team.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.460]   He's really considered the guy behind OS 10 in many ways,
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.380]   I think.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.140]   So that's kind of weird.
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.540]   Vice president of software engineering,
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:12.060]   he led the team that developed OS 10.
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.060]   Vice president of software engineering at Next.
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.940]   Now he's an adventure capitalist.
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.500]   Yeah, I'm sure he's getting--
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.540]   Oh, I'm sure he's getting bank, but that's kind of sad.
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.700]   Can't hold it against him.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.180]   No, he was.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.340]   All right, he went for it.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:31.740]   I'm sorry, I did leave my post for a second there.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.220]   I just got a delivery from UPS.
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.140]   And I don't want to start any irrational rumors,
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:37.980]   but here's the--
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.820]   Oh, stop it.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.740]   Here is the FCC ID for something called a work slate.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:43.740]   Oh, my God.
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:44.500]   Oh, here they come.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.740]   Oh, my God, it's the Model W100, which
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.660]   means it's the first of its kind.
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.940]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:51.500]   You don't see--
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.420]   Does it have a speaker?
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.060]   Is that a speaker?
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.660]   Now it's odd.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.340]   It does have a Mac or cassette.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.180]   I haven't booted it up.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.380]   Is that a Tandy?
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.660]   Is that a Tandy you got there?
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.180]   No, no, no.
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.340]   See, now it's a very tactile keyboard,
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.540]   even though it is virtual.
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.540]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.540]   As you can see, I'm already--
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.180]   Yeah, the lighting is so realistic.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.060]   Yeah, they really-- they do a great job of making it look
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.900]   like a TFT screen.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.700]   Yeah, I mean, I'm excited.
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.980]   Obviously, I haven't charged it up yet,
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.260]   but we have a Mac briefly first.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:19.860]   That's a first.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.260]   We've got the slate.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.820]   Let's have an unboxing.
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:27.260]   So for Leo, for your link bait, I'll hold this up really.
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.700]   As well as you can get the screen capture.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.460]   That's good.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.460]   Linkbait works slate.
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.300]   Model WX100.
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:35.740]   There you go.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.540]   FCC approval.
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.460]   We got that from the FCC.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.340]   Look, I've got another slate that I just found.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.460]   Oh my gosh.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.220]   It went to stars and bars.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:45.820]   What's going on?
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.940]   Are the cameras going through some sort of mode?
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.660]   It's in a mode, man.
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.260]   I was going to make a joke.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.620]   That's actually the Nexus 1 Google phone.
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.420]   Which I like a lot.
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.180]   Have you got yours yet, Andy?
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.100]   Yep.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:18:59.980]   And I like it a lot.
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:00.860]   I think this is the--
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.140]   Avi left Apple in 2006.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.660]   Is that true?
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.660]   I'm about to--
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.740]   There you go, that.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.780]   And the Lenovo-- OK, I'm going to correct myself now.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.820]   This is now the portion of the show where Leo corrects himself.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.340]   The chat room says the Lenovo U1 is $1,000, not $2,000.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.260]   That's a little bit better.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.460]   And Avi Tovanian left Apple in 2006.
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.540]   So can we just edit out that whole chunk right there
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.580]   where Leo got it all wrong?
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.460]   And can you go back to you guys saying
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.660]   it's going to be a giant--
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.140]   it's going to have fur.
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.660]   I think fur would be great.
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.980]   A fur notebook.
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:36.940]   Fur and flexible.
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.180]   So you could roll it up and it just turns into like a little fur
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:39.980]   ball.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:40.500]   Totally.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.060]   Like a fur tube.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:42.660]   I like that.
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.300]   You can put it behind your neck so that when you're flying,
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.460]   you have a little pillow.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:46.940]   I like it.
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.380]   And then when you need to read something,
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.140]   you can pop it open.
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.860]   And the fur would be a little velcro-y.
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:56.940]   So you could just press it up against the back of the flight
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.340]   seat in front of you.
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.340]   I think that would be awesome.
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.540]   It furted you and fur puttered.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.140]   Yeah, I think that we really ought
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.060]   to be thinking about fur.
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.460]   Enough of this smooth, whatever.
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.340]   I think furry, rough, flexible.
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.900]   And it can make little growling noises
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.420]   when you haven't used it for a while.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.220]   And they say, I think fur's always been the kind of--
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.780]   I think Craigslist has proved that there's
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.500]   an infinite market for infinite fetishes.
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.220]   So we have the fur fetish version, the rubber fetish version.
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.340]   Well, and as many.
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.180]   Well, it's just like in a big high stiletto shoe
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.500]   that you pound into your head.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.900]   You know, that's--
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.660]   As many techies know--
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:35.700]   Not on the table there.
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.340]   You know, fur is the hardest, the most difficult surface
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.020]   to do.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.420]   And I think a fur laptop would really
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.660]   be kind of almost saying--
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.380]   you know, become boasting, almost saying we can do anything.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:46.860]   It would be.
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.860]   You have to-- a fur flexible laptop?
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.940]   Flexible fur.
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.820]   I mean, that would-- when they say you have no idea what
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.420]   the tablet's going to be like, they men it.
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.940]   That's all I'm going to say.
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.740]   People say, no, I am checking out the rumors
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.940]   as we do the show.
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.620]   There is a rumor that says that it's almost impossible
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:09.300]   to get a cat, a dog, or a large rat in Asia, Europe,
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:09.820]   or most of them.
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:10.700]   That's exactly right.
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.140]   Exactly right.
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.900]   There's a fur shortage.
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.980]   So even the CIVIT population has been decimated.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.340]   And you know that you don't really
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.220]   want to use CIVIT for it because it's-- well,
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.260]   it's a little fragrant.
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.420]   Let's put it that way.
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:31.740]   TheFingerWorks.com-- a website has been removed this week
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.700]   after remaining online for nearly five years
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.620]   after the acquisition of the company by Apple.
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.140]   FingerWorks makes this.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.100]   The world's weirdest keyboard--
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:48.900]   multi-touch keyboard gestures--
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.420]   until last week, fingerworks.com had photos and details
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.340]   about their multi-touch keyboard and gesture
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.820]   pads that they released for Max years ago.
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.820]   Apple acquired the company again almost five years ago,
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.660]   but left the site up until last week.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.980]   Boy, that starts a rumor, doesn't it?
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:04.500]   Look at that.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.580]   Look at that.
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:06.060]   Uh-huh.
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.580]   Multi-touch.
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.220]   Uh-huh.
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.860]   So do we think that's where Apple might have gotten
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.500]   some of the technology?
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.100]   That or maybe somebody stopped paying the bill at GoDaddy?
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.540]   It could be either.
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:21.020]   I prefer to think that Apple got the technology there.
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.660]   That's my stance, and I'm going to stick by it.
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.540]   It gets to be silly season in the last couple of weeks
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.540]   before a big announcement.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:29.380]   Yeah.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.620]   We don't even know if it was the last couple of weeks
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.540]   before a big announcement.
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.340]   And it's silly already.
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.580]   It's been over months.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.220]   But I wrote my call last week.
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.940]   It's like you've got this fridge full of leftovers.
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.700]   They're all going to go bad maybe after January 27.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.820]   If you don't use them, you're just
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.340]   going to have to throw them all away.
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:50.020]   So every half-baked, idiotic left field rumor you ever
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.020]   got to hold up.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.020]   Last chance.
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.900]   That's too crazy for me to actually report.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:55.540]   And you know what?
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.900]   I will never, ever have--
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:01.860]   I have to say that Apple has acquired technology, first used
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.220]   in McDonald's, Shamrock Shake Machines.
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.340]   And that's going to be a special multi-touch, sort of lever
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.140]   apparatus.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:08.980]   It's inventory.
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.340]   You have to use your inventory.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:15.020]   Last chance to use up that rumor about the flexible frees.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:15.980]   I'll give it to you.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.740]   And we have a show title.
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.660]   Like we pull frees.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.420]   It's the new--
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.700]   Talk about Linkbait.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:23.620]   Wow.
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.900]   Talk about touch.
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.900]   Yeah.
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:26.900]   Hi.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.660]   We were at--
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.700]   I'm going to-- we're going to take a break and talk a little bit
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.260]   more about something having to do with Apple.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:34.780]   Orly.
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.540]   I'm sure we'll find something.
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.220]   Or we can go back to sandwiches.
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.660]   Because really, at this point, I think we've
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.260]   used up all the Apple news.
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:46.100]   I think it's just hysterical that during CES,
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.180]   the biggest consumer electronics show,
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.860]   the big show of the year, that really--
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.180]   besides 3D TVs, which is, as far as I'm concerned, a big--
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.740]   Huh?
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.660]   The topic of conversation was the Nexus 1 phone from Google,
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.500]   which is announced the day before, and whatever Apple's
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.020]   going to do at the end of the month.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.700]   That's all they've talked about.
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:04.620]   I mean, that was obvious.
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.980]   I was joking with somebody the other day that the official CES
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.780]   2010 drinking game is to take a shot every time you hear
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.980]   the word "tagra" 10.10 LED.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.820]   I'm like, oh, work, you know, the number of times I've
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.700]   seen or been told about or had someone give me information
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.620]   about a "tagra" based Android slate device.
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.340]   I'm like, just put it on the pile.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.060]   Once I get a stack, one foot high,
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.060]   I'll start looking at these devices.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.220]   We haven't talked about what other announcements.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.660]   I mean, it could see what there's to be others.
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.980]   Well, we'll talk in just a second.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.180]   But first, I want to tell everybody about my good friends
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.180]   at Citrix, they were the ones who, by the way,
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:45.060]   our trip to Las Vegas for CES, and they did it in a kind of
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.820]   a mean, mean way.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.500]   They said, you know, you could just use go to a meeting
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.300]   and you wouldn't have to go all the way to the CES.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.380]   That's the whole point of going to a meeting.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.580]   You do more, you travel less.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.900]   And, you know, while I like going to places and meeting
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.540]   people and, you know, there's nothing like pressing the
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.380]   flesh, you can't have as many meetings that way.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.940]   You certainly can't save money that way.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.180]   That's why go to a meeting is great.
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.580]   It's going to save you, jump it in your car and driving two
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.900]   hours for a one hour meeting or flying across the country
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.900]   in the center seat with some bizarre weirdos on either side.
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.140]   You just have meetings right from your desk as if you were
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.900]   in the room with the people you want to meet with, your
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.300]   clients or your colleagues.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.300]   It's just indispensable.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.740]   We use it all the time.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.460]   We even use it on our shows.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.060]   And whenever anybody wants to have a meeting with me, a
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.940]   teleconference, I say, can we use go to a meeting because I
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.060]   want to see what you're talking about.
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.420]   I want to see your sales presentation or your product
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.620]   demo, your training session, even if we're just taking
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.780]   notes, we like to have that up.
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.580]   And the good thing is when you pay the $49 a month, you've
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.540]   got unlimited meetings.
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.860]   So you just use go to meeting all the time.
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.540]   For every phone call, that's what I use.
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.100]   Go to meetings running in the background.
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.300]   Now, I want you to do it too.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.460]   And you could do it free for the next month.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.660]   And this includes phone and voice over IP conferencing.
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.140]   It's part of the deal.
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:59.420]   Go to go to meeting.com/macbreak and sign up today for go
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.060]   to meeting the amazing Citrix product that lets you meet
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:06.980]   online and get as much done as you would if you were flying
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.100]   all these places, but you don't.
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.500]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.900]   We really appreciate the support they've given this show.
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.580]   And all of our shows on the Twitter network over the
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.220]   past few years and they're back for 2010.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.660]   And we're glad about it.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.300]   What about the iPhone?
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.260]   No, March, I guess, is when the iPhone
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.500]   announcement traditionally is, right?
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.460]   Do you think they will couple a tablet or a slate
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.980]   announcement with an iPhone announcement?
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.540]   I think they're more likely to couple the slight
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.260]   announcement with a new software announcement.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.780]   I don't think we're going to see a new iPhone.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.900]   Software, what would the software be?
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.220]   They've been talking about 4.0.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.140]   The only thing that OS X 4.0.
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.900]   No, no, no, 4.0 for the iPhone.
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.780]   iPhone 4.0.
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.500]   Oh, a new software for the iPhone.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.780]   A new software for the iPhone.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.420]   I mean, I think that that's what we're more likely to see.
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.620]   I think that one of the things that I'm really interested to
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:56.340]   see happen and I don't know whether Apple's going to do it
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.780]   or not is really--
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.940]   We talked about it last week and I did get some email
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.540]   about that where there are phones that are--
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.740]   I think I believe it's T-Mobile has a phone that
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:10.140]   does do the switch between Wi-Fi and--
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.540]   So.
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.940]   You just automatically look for it.
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:13.420]   That's cool.
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.500]   So it does exist.
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.020]   Well, this Google phone, you have the choice of using
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.020]   Google Voice for all your calls or not.
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.660]   And that's a big thing.
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:25.100]   And I think that that would be the thing if I liked yours,
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.220]   which I'll probably play with a little bit.
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.940]   You've got to play with it because you don't want to.
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:28.500]   It's good.
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.260]   But the Google Voice thing is a pretty big deal for me
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.060]   because we're going to be doing a lot more with that.
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:37.060]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.740]   Dual Core, that's one of the rumors.
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.780]   Korea Times claimed Tuesday that sources at KT said the new
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.700]   phone would have an OLED screen.
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:47.780]   I think it's got to at this point.
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.100]   Google's doing it.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.700]   The Zoom has OLED.
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.500]   Would feature video chat functionality.
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.740]   That means a front-facing camera.
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.740]   A removable battery, highly likely now.
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.140]   What are they smoking?
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.340]   That takes all the wind out of that.
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.900]   The credibility is gone.
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.860]   And dual core processors, more powerful graphics capabilities
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.540]   and superior car era.
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.980]   I don't know what that word is.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.420]   I can't even understand it.
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.700]   It's in a language I don't--
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:17.620]   Oh, camera.
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:18.100]   OK.
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.180]   There's a little piece of schmutz on my screen.
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.660]   All that stuff sounds reasonable.
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.500]   I just have a hard time believing that--
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.660]   What would you put in a new phone?
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:25.620]   You'd have to go to 4.0.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.100]   What would have-- what would 4.0 have it?
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.580]   For me, the number one thing that I want to see is, well,
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.700]   I'd like to see a better phone.
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:31.980]   I mean, a better camera.
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:32.500]   Front-facing.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.900]   It's got to have a better camera.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.780]   I think an OLED screen now is--
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.100]   to regur.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.140]   And I think that the--
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.100]   I do think that the ability to actively switch--
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.260]   I think a lot of people like me-- are really frustrated
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.300]   with our AT&T cell network.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.580]   And we would love to just have the phone not have to use Skype
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.620]   or some kind of third-party application
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.300]   to use VoIP on our phone.
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.460]   We want when someone calls us.
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:58.140]   If I switch-- if I go into the office and switch to Wi-Fi,
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.580]   I want someone who calls me just to go directly to my phone.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.540]   I don't really care about 911.
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.620]   I mean, I know that that's a legal issue for them.
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.940]   But there's a lot of us that would prefer
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.660]   to just work off of--
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:13.620]   be able to have this little selector that lets us go to Wi-Fi
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.580]   at least.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:15.580]   You can even give us a warning saying--
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.380]   Multi-core is a possibility, by the way,
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:21.140]   because they're currently using the Cortex-A8 ARM processor.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:26.020]   But apparently, the A9 is multi-core and can go past two gigahertz.
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.340]   But that's-- you've got to worry about battery.
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.900]   You're going to start doing that.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:30.580]   Yeah.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.420]   I think we're really talking about--
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.100]   almost everything that I'm interested in in a new generation
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.540]   iPhone are just simple component upgrades--
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:38.340]   upgraded radio--
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:38.820]   Better camera.
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.340]   --camera, rated screen.
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.980]   Give me the exact same phone that I have.
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.100]   Don't really mess around with it.
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.020]   Give me better software.
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.540]   And just the stuff that's already in there
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.340]   should just work better.
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:51.780]   The dual-core A9 is 45 nanometer, which
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.380]   means more power efficient.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.860]   It says power consumption will increase 10% to 20%
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.420]   at peak performance compared to the current A8.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.060]   But that's not so much--
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.700]   if you lose 10% of your battery life.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.060]   And that's only during peak.
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.380]   I don't think that's too bad.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:10.660]   I have to admit, I carry around Mophies.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:11.020]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.860]   I have my old one, and my new one.
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.500]   And I really become very insensitive to the battery issues
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.460]   because of that.
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.540]   You know, I charge them all the time.
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:18.620]   I have to say that--
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:19.220]   I'm always plugged in.
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.660]   I think we've talked about that.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.740]   We've talked about the Mophie.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.020]   I think we've recommended the Mophies a couple times.
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.780]   I saw Mr. Mophie at the CES.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.260]   Did you see the new Mophie?
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.220]   Did you see the new Mophie?
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.380]   Well, this is what I did.
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.140]   I showed him my Mophie with the broken plastic top
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.260]   because both Scott Born and I immediately broke the top.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.100]   Me too.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:35.620]   Me too.
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:36.300]   Yeah.
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.340]   No, he didn't give me one.
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.060]   He said, well, what you should do is get the new one.
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.940]   But he didn't give it to me, which is fine because I'm not
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.220]   looking for freebies.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.060]   I wish I actually said, could you give me a new top?
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.060]   But he didn't have any tops lying around.
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.700]   So this is the new one with the digital TV?
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.500]   I haven't seen that.
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.380]   So there's one that--
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.380]   I went around the show floor.
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.340]   I guess it was at the showstoppers.
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.180]   Yeah, they were at showstoppers.
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.340]   No, they were at digital experience.
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.340]   They were--
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.500]   or whatever-- there was a--
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.660]   and I-- there's evidently one now with a--
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.940]   they're using the Flow TV.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.700]   It's got a receiver in it.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.100]   So it's a Mophie with the Flow Bill and--
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.740]   I just like saying, it's a Mophie with a Flow.
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:19.860]   It's got Flow.
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.060]   It's the Mophie with the Flow.
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.460]   You want the Mophie with a V for the Cad Cal based on.
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.660]   So that was something they were--
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.340]   say Mophie with the Flow.
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.140]   Mophie with the Flow.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.460]   So evidently, I think that they were--
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.540]   I had heard about it.
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:35.220]   Oh, by the way, you can buy a replacement cap for $4.95
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.220]   for Mophie.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.580]   Of course you can.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.860]   But why should I have to?
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:39.740]   It's like--
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:43.020]   That's like the razor blade that Gillette sells you.
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.220]   Of course you can.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.460]   They should give away the Mophie just
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.340]   they can sell replacement tops for $5.
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.740]   They'll live handsomely.
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.940]   They're going to do well on that.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.060]   So it's called the Juice Pack TV.
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:55.340]   So it's a Mophie Juice Pack, but it has Flow TV built into it.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.340]   So it's got the chip in it.
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:01.540]   So you can get a subscription and watch live TV on your iPhone.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.620]   So you get both the battery, which
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.860]   you'll need if you're watching live TV.
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:11.060]   But many of the largest networks including CBS, CNBC, Comedy
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:16.700]   Central, Fox, MTV, NBC, Nickelodeon, and more.
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.700]   Well, you know, Flow TV is kind of interesting.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.060]   You can buy this separate Flow TV as well.
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.660]   It's kind of an interesting thing.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.180]   Qualcomm, again, bought all the channel--
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.060]   I found this out.
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.460]   I didn't find it out at the time because I
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.300]   talked to the Flow TV people on our CES coverage.
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.540]   And the guy said, I don't know.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.740]   I don't know where it comes from.
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.900]   But I found out later that they bought all the channel
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.900]   55s in every major market.
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.860]   And I mean, that's saying something.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.500]   Qualcomm has some bucks.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.260]   And they're basically using channel 55 digitally
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.420]   to stream a bunch of channels.
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.180]   They cache the channels, including live channels,
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.340]   including sports.
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.660]   They cache the channels.
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.460]   And this Mophie thing is hysterical
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:57.020]   because it's got a little transmitter in it.
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.980]   Because you can't connect to the dock connector.
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.540]   So it's got a little transmitter in it that transmits,
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.940]   I think, I guess via Wi-Fi to this phone.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:08.060]   It's got the world's tiniest Wi-Fi access point.
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:12.020]   Well, I think that I'd much rather have this as an add-on
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.860]   to my phone than have it as a separate device.
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.700]   It gets back into that.
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.220]   And that's what I think is exciting about the--
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.620]   I mean, have you actually seen one?
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:21.620]   I don't know.
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:22.420]   I'm going to get one.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.700]   It's about two to two and a half times the thickness
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:25.820]   of the phone.
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:30.580]   You're going to be carrying a good steak in your pocket.
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:31.620]   But it's better steak.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.580]   I like steak.
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.780]   I mean, I would add that kind of bulk for seriously stupid,
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.140]   long battery life.
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.380]   But I'm not sure if I would have this just for the ability--
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:42.860]   Excuse me?
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:43.460]   Do you get both?
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.820]   I mean, maybe you get also more battery life.
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.420]   I don't know.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.860]   I haven't actually had a demo by looking at press pictures.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.620]   I'm more interested in the idea that they're
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.220]   doing some ambitious stuff here.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.900]   They also have a Mophie that's a credit card scanner.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:58.340]   That.
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.540]   So they call it the Mophie Marketplace.
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:01.580]   I saw that in action.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.140]   As a max white breeder, that looks pretty hot.
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:03.980]   I saw that in action.
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:05.580]   That was pretty cool.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.020]   No, I think the first ever--
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.380]   Never has credit card fraud been so easy or something.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.860]   Yes.
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.700]   Hey, if you're working to make your restaurant,
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:14.980]   just carry this in your pocket.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.740]   I'll tell you what, I think one of the reasons
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.540]   that got a lot of attention at CES
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.460]   is because I know that as someone who's a vendor
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.060]   at a lot of these--
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.100]   if you're a vendor and you're trying to sell something,
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.740]   let's say, at Macworld, you have to pay.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.980]   It's something like-- I mean, it's
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.220]   some crazy amount of money, $1,500 or something
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:34.220]   to charge people's credit card at a convention.
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:35.940]   Or you have to have a computer center.
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.020]   Being able to sit here and be able to be at a location,
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.740]   at a little convention, or whatever,
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.620]   and being able to swipe people's cards
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.580]   saves a lot of money very, very quickly.
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:49.420]   It is a big deal if you're doing any kind of location-based
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.820]   sales.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.020]   I mean, I can imagine having people having iPhones
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.580]   at the farmer's market here in Petaluma with a little--
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:56.420]   so you don't have to use cash.
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:56.820]   Right.
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:57.540]   I'd use it.
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:58.500]   Sure, who wouldn't?
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.100]   I don't really use cash that much anymore.
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.340]   I've heard about it.
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:04.060]   I've heard of cash.
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:04.700]   Let's see.
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:05.620]   Can I have a speaking of cash?
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.380]   Can I make a request for it to our listeners?
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:09.420]   You want some money?
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:09.940]   No.
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:10.820]   Yeah, I need some money.
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.580]   No, no, no, that's not what I'm asking.
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:16.860]   I have a request for an application that--
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.420]   Or you want somebody to write something for you.
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.220]   OK, if you make it $0.99 or whatever.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.140]   So there's a website called wherestgeorge.com.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.460]   Where's George is the dollar bill site?
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:26.980]   Yeah.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.020]   What you need is an application that
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:34.700]   lets you take a picture of the number on your dollar bill
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.300]   and have it automatically put it into where's George,
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.100]   rather than having to type the number in.
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.300]   I would actually do it more often.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.140]   I love that.
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:43.740]   Nobody's going to write that.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.700]   That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.260]   It will not.
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:46.780]   So what does it do?
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.020]   Scan the dollar bill?
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.340]   No, you just take a picture of it
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.020]   because you have all the stuff that will identify it.
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:51.900]   That's true.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.580]   You have a little thing that shows you show me the number
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.460]   and you take a picture of it and it can do it.
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.780]   It wouldn't-- people who are already
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.380]   doing some kind of image analysis could write it.
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.660]   And I think there's a lot of people that would use it if--
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.180]   Google just could add it to Google Goggles.
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.340]   It could make you feel like a geek.
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:06.580]   Google should just add it to Google Goggles.
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.140]   I was going to say that would be interesting add-on
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.500]   for Google Goggles, yeah.
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.540]   Because Goggles already does business cards.
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:12.140]   This was wild.
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.860]   It took a picture of a business card.
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.420]   And it imports it.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.260]   Sorry, that's an Android app though, folks.
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.420]   I mean, at this point, you probably want an iPhone app.
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.940]   There's iPhone apps to do that too.
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.580]   So there's people who do that already.
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:23.020]   Sure.
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.100]   So how do you have a card R, I think?
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:28.460]   You have to have a scanner focusing camera in there.
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:28.980]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.300]   So the thing is you could take these little pictures
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.100]   and then you could know where all your bills were
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.100]   and keep it going.
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.660]   And a lot more people would do it.
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.060]   And where's George is really fast as a really fascinating
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:37.380]   website?
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.380]   So the idea is that you put the serial number
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.060]   into the database.
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.220]   It tells you where your bill's been.
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.420]   If someone else has inputted it or it starts it.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.060]   And a lot of times people used to take--
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.820]   they used to make these little stamps that you can stamp on it
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.020]   and it says, where's George dot com?
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.220]   You know, find this bill.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.860]   And then it would be more likely that you'd do it
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.260]   because you'd always know that someone did it.
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.340]   I think they seeded the world with these bills
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.100]   that were pre-staffed that George people did it.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.260]   No, they were selling them until--
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.540]   You could buy the stamp?
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.340]   Treasury department told them to stop.
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.260]   You're not allowed to do that.
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.940]   You're not allowed to do that.
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.500]   But it's really fun when you get a bill that's been around
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.020]   and the number is actually in there.
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.620]   It's really fun to find it to see your bill was here
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.420]   and then it was here and then it was over here.
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:18.820]   And it would massively increase and be much more fun
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.580]   if people would just take it with their iPhone.
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.060]   Like it would be something that people would actually do.
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.220]   Anyway, that's my request.
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:25.940]   If you do it, it'll be a pick of the week
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.060]   because if it works, because I think it'll be fun.
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.660]   It's freaking brilliant.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:31.900]   I don't know if it's brilliant or not,
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:32.620]   but it would be fun.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:33.100]   It would be a--
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.660]   90s and 90s and 90s and 90s.
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.980]   So 1990s of you.
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:37.820]   Where is George?
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:38.900]   George, come on.
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:39.420]   That's--
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.460]   Is that site even still up?
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.100]   I think it is.
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:42.940]   Yeah.
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.780]   It's George.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.460]   How about the same sort of application,
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.020]   but because of a modern age, it uses your credit card,
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.900]   your debit card?
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.060]   And it will tell you, well, this is--
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.580]   this belongs to you.
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.180]   It's yours.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:59.100]   We have OCR the data and we'll keep it on file just in case.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.940]   I think you should have an app.
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.860]   And then we can keep checking in every time to time
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.820]   to see where your credit card number was used.
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:05.700]   Oh, we'll cross the word.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.340]   Hey, $4,000 for Xbox is in Mexico.
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:12.220]   Hey, a gentleman in Russia used it to buy $4,000
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.020]   in truck parts.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.460]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.860]   It's like an adventure.
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.380]   That's-- that'd be an awesome map.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.460]   You have to take-- you just take a picture of the front
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.700]   and the back of your credit card
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.620]   and it automatically sends it to me.
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:26.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.380]   I'll buy two of those.
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.260]   One for your credit card, one for Andy's.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.340]   Actually, Scott Borne's credit card,
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.420]   but I believe the one you want to picture.
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.020]   Oh, I bet you there's a lot of space on that.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.580]   Oh, there's some-- there's some headroom on that card.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.860]   One like to buy this Ferrari.
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.580]   How would you like to buy it with Scott Borne's credit card?
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.380]   Folks are going to take a little time out here.
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:49.340]   Keep talking though, because there's more with Mac break weekly
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.220]   and I want to tell you about my friends at Sync.
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.340]   Had such a good time talking to all--
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:58.300]   we talked to a bunch of people from Ford at the show.
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.340]   And the voice-activated Sync feature
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:01.580]   is getting better and better.
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:04.060]   The new announcements for 2011 and so forth,
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:04.860]   just very exciting.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.500]   They're doing SDK, right?
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.780]   Yeah, they're going to have an app store.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:08.380]   It's so exciting.
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.300]   But what's great about the app store,
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.220]   they're going to do it through Apple's app store.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:11.580]   Really?
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:12.340]   Yeah.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:13.980]   So when you-- yeah.
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.980]   That's a crazy thing.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.860]   The other thing they announced-- yeah, they're very--
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.300]   they realize that an iPhone is a great platform for them.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.700]   Why should they do anything separate from it?
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:24.300]   There already is an app store, right?
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.540]   So when you plug in your iPod or your iPhone,
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.780]   a couple of things it did.
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.100]   For HD radio, if you're listening to the HD radio
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.780]   and you hear a song you like, you just press this.
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.500]   You can mark up to 100 songs.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.460]   Then when you plug in your iPod, the iPod downloads the marker.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.980]   And then next time you sync to iTunes,
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.340]   iTunes gives you a list of all the songs that you marked
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.780]   on the HD radio that said you want to buy any of these.
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.180]   Wow.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.340]   Is that slick?
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.060]   Same thing with the app store.
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.980]   You have your iPod.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.580]   Your iPod will start--
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.820]   right now, my iPod, when I plug it in,
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.140]   has an Apple logo and a Ford logo on it.
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.660]   I presume if it's a Lincoln and have a Lincoln--
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.300]   What's crazy thing is it's a Microsoft product
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.700]   that's inside of a Ford that uses iTunes.
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.260]   But it's all US technology.
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.780]   I like that.
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:08.140]   SyncMyRide.com is the place to go.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.740]   If you want to find out more about Sync,
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:15.140]   it's the hands-free Bluetooth, phone, music, and podcast search,
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.940]   turn-by-turn navigation informational thing.
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:22.540]   They won big honors at CES 2010, including their Commercial
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.340]   Truck and Van Division, the Ford Work Solutions.
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.820]   They have a special one for work, one best of innovations
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.780]   in the in-vehicle accessories.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:32.060]   The 2010 Taurus was honored with the official car of CES
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.060]   for 10 features, including Sync.
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.500]   Sync was also honored in the CES Design and Engineering
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.540]   Awards category of in-vehicle navigation
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:42.980]   telematics and ITS for the traffic direction and information
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.580]   application.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:45.980]   They support our 2010 coverage.
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:48.340]   We thank them for that, and we really encourage you all.
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.060]   Next time you're in the market for an automobile
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.980]   to visit your Ford, Lincoln, or Mercury dealers,
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.980]   say, I want to test drive the Sync, because that is,
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.980]   to be honest, the standard by which all cars going forward
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:59.500]   are going to have to match.
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.940]   And frankly, there's nobody out there that's doing it.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.580]   It's truly amazing.
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.380]   SyncMyRide.com to find out more.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.860]   And we thank Ford for their support.
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.420]   I shouldn't say it's Ford, because it's really
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:10.540]   Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury.
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:13.780]   We thank the voice-activated Sync for their support
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.660]   of our program.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:20.460]   Ah, to take a deep breath.
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.180]   Ken Shepherson has an idea for what
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.220]   to do with all those screens.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.580]   He says, two 10-inch screens, one,
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.820]   OLED for display, the other LCD for touch input.
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:29.700]   Fold it in the middle.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.460]   You've got a keyboard.
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:37.860]   That was like the entourage edge that we saw that that ebook
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.900]   reader that had on one side an e-book, e-ink screen,
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.660]   and the other side an Android screen.
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.940]   If you were reading a--
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.060]   because e-ink is black and white,
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.300]   if you're reading a book that had a color illustration,
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.820]   you drag it over to the Android screen with your pen,
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.940]   and it would suddenly be color.
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.340]   It's really-- there are all sorts of ways to slice this thing.
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.220]   I don't know if Apple would do something so inelegant,
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:58.220]   however.
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:01.660]   I think it's going to be just a big iPhone.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.300]   You do.
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.380]   You want to see-- you know what?
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.060]   I think you should take that point of view.
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:06.380]   I'm going to take that point of view.
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.700]   So I think that somebody-- look it.
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.100]   You just got back from Vegas.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:14.580]   Let's pretend we're in the sports bet
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:19.020]   at one of the major casinos in the technology section,
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.580]   and you're laying down your bed.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.580]   Big iPhone for the nose.
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:23.060]   Really?
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:23.620]   iPhone to win.
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:24.500]   Just big iPhone.
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:24.820]   That's it.
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:25.820]   Nothing more, nothing special.
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:27.820]   No, it'll probably have a little extra features,
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:28.700]   but I think that it's going to be--
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.060]   I think it's essentially a big iPhone.
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.620]   A big iPhone to-- I think that's the easiest one
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.300]   for them to manage.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:40.300]   I think that it may be in some world halfway between an iPhone
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.980]   and an OS 10, but I think it's going to be more iPhone.
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.780]   It's going to be more of a media, something
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:45.740]   that I'm going to read my books on.
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:46.620]   I'm going to watch stuff on.
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.380]   I'm going to interact with people on.
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:49.500]   I don't think it's going to--
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.020]   the thing is, is that I think that if that's all they did
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.100]   and they had an app store, I think
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.300]   that Apple may make a lot of people to install stuff on it.
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.300]   But if I were them, I wouldn't.
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.140]   I would do the exact same thing that they do with the app store
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:01.820]   right now.
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.580]   All right, I'll take that bit.
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.140]   I'll lay off that bit, because I don't believe you.
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.380]   Annie and Naka, what do you think?
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.260]   I agree.
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:09.700]   I mean, anybody who's come up--
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.060]   Well, no, anybody who--
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.340]   Make out like a band.
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.980]   No, I wouldn't say it's just going to be a big iPhone.
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:16.300]   That's usually used as a--
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.380]   I mean, that's usually-- often used as a dismissive term,
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.300]   but--
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:21.300]   Let's say your has on.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.620]   --as you've added.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.020]   No, I'm saying a design like that
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.420]   is really the smart move to go.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.300]   What do you need other than a screen
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.700]   and then the minimum amount of hardware around it
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:34.540]   to let you operate the things that inside that screen?
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:37.940]   The cool stuff is going to be inside the user interface.
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.500]   And I think they're going to come up
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.260]   with new ideas on how to manipulate a user interface
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:45.140]   within a big touchscreen sort of area.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.140]   I think apps, obviously, are going
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:50.580]   to be pretty critical to the whole operation.
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:55.980]   But I think that Apple's method of selling a lot of these
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:00.100]   is making it the default choice for any mobile solution that
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.580]   involves a big screen and internet connection
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.820]   and a good interface.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.980]   So if that means book reader, it means a book reader.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:08.620]   If it means a TV, it means a TV.
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.500]   If it means a gaming system, it means a gaming system.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:15.860]   I mean, when I published my last set of predictions,
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.620]   my last thing about the tablet last week,
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:20.620]   and someone-- a reader was smart enough
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:22.020]   to call me on something.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.100]   I totally ignored the idea of gaming.
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:28.740]   Can you imagine gaming on a 10-inch high-def screen like that
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.580]   with basically a Nintendo Wii built into it?
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.660]   Can you imagine what a racing game is going to be like
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.180]   when you have the entire field of view
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.220]   and a steering wheel sized object in your hands?
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:38.020]   Well, on the scary thing we talk about gaming is,
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:40.380]   did you see the AR drone at the ETS?
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:40.820]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.020]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:42.860]   It is a--
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.660]   Best iPod iPhone accessory ever.
[00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:46.780]   It's got-- oh, my gosh.
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:50.180]   It's got four helicopter propellers.
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.980]   It's a remote control helicopter that with cameras built
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.260]   it with you can control via your iPhone.
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:56.340]   And it floated really well.
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:57.260]   Oh, and it-- well, I was there.
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:58.220]   I was grabbing onto it.
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.940]   I grabbed onto it and then push it.
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:01.980]   And it would automatically find its center again.
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.980]   Like it is--
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:03.480]   Right.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.900]   And you can just sit there with your iPhone
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.220]   and just kind of go, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.260]   You can say, I want to go this way.
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.100]   I want to go that way.
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:08.940]   And it's got this little--
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.100]   That'd be great for spying on people.
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:11.900]   Well, there's that.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.420]   But it would be a fun game, too.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.620]   I mean, it's amazing.
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:15.340]   It's a game.
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:15.860]   Oh, a game.
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:16.700]   Like you can do all kinds of--
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:17.740]   You're not supposed to use it inside.
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.300]   They had a big net all around it,
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.740]   so it wouldn't escape.
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:21.100]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.780]   It would escape.
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:23.860]   Because I think it's really--
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:25.300]   I can only imagine that.
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.060]   It's supposed to be Wi-Fi enabled.
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.020]   But can you imagine a noisier environment than CES?
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:30.540]   Yeah.
[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.020]   To try to operate anything that's Wi-Fi.
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.420]   It works.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.260]   We could have like an ED 209 demo situation.
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.820]   Drop your weapon.
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:38.380]   Drop your weapon.
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:39.860]   Sit as up your weapon.
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:43.180]   You arm that thing with a green laser that's been weaponized.
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:44.220]   That'd be good.
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.180]   What about-- in the chat room, somebody asked,
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:46.980]   I think a good question.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:50.900]   What about content creation on the new iSlate tablet thing?
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:53.060]   Maybe iLife 2010.
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.340]   I think that-- well, I think that I don't know what Apple's
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:55.980]   going to do.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:58.940]   I know what I would do, which is that I would turn DVD Studio
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:00.740]   Pro and DVD--
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:01.180]   And I do--
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:02.020]   We talked about this before.
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:06.260]   --into a development platform for both the iPhone and--
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.380]   I mean, I think that being able to create interactive content
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.740]   directly that way would make a lot of sense.
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:14.020]   I think that we're going to see a huge explosion in the LP
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:18.340]   slash DVD extra kind of stuff if this goes forward.
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.860]   Because this becomes like--
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.640]   Now you have this incredible experience
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.060]   of the liner notes and everything else.
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:23.740]   You're listening to it.
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:27.100]   You're watching the-- you can look through the stuff
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:28.980]   on the device or you have all the DVD extras.
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:32.140]   And it's big enough to actually be enjoyable.
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.540]   I think that there's going to be a lot of really interesting
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:35.660]   interactive opportunities.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.140]   And I think that would also create an explosion of using
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:43.180]   this thing as a content thing if anybody could do it easily.
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:46.780]   There's been-- one of the rumors from last week is that someone
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:51.020]   that Apple has developed a version of iWork for the tablet
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.260]   for actually creating documents, editing documents,
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.500]   creating spreadsheets, and that sort of thing.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.420]   I'm not sure how much stock I put into it.
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:01.060]   I don't see-- the limiting factor is that I don't--
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:04.180]   again, I don't see Apple putting a mechanical keyboard on it
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:08.300]   or making it terribly easy for me to use a mechanical keyboard
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.420]   with it.
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:11.620]   And so that puts kind of a set of breaks
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:14.860]   on writing 1,000 word column on the thing.
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:16.860]   I think that they will have some sort of a touch keyboard
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.580]   that is surprisingly useful.
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:21.700]   But it would be useful in the same way that a netbook keyboard
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.780]   is useful in that it's a full keyboard.
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.940]   And you can type on it, but you're inconvenient enough
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:29.940]   that you can't do your full 120 words a minute or whatever.
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.060]   So I'm not sure if it's going to be a content creation.
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:34.580]   I don't think it's going to be a device you create content on.
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:37.060]   I think it will be very, very easy to edit stuff on it.
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.940]   But I'm not sure if it's going to be for content creators.
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:43.180]   Not exclusive of photos, videos.
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:45.860]   I mean, wouldn't it be great if it does have a built-in camera?
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:47.180]   And I don't think it will.
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:50.580]   But wouldn't it be great to have some sort of editing
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.780]   more ambitious than what you get on the iPhone?
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:53.700]   Short of iMovie.
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:56.820]   But the ability to come home at the end of the day,
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.860]   take like the 45 minutes worth of clips that you shot at the party
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:03.700]   or just bopping around and turn into eight minutes of really good
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.580]   stuff you can then put directly under YouTube.
[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:07.220]   I think the interface would definitely support something
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:08.740]   as cool as that.
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:14.060]   In the one non-isolate story we have, it's really this--
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:17.220]   It's everybody's basically in the entire Apple community
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.260]   just holding their breath.
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:19.380]   It's all like--
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:23.860]   Next week, we're just going to be just staring to the camera.
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:25.460]   Yeah, we should put Apple on notice
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:29.340]   that on January-- excuse me-- on February 3,
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:32.060]   we are officially moving on to whatever the next thing we think
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.020]   is going to be.
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.860]   So if you want to introduce your tablet a week before,
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:36.500]   then that's great.
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.660]   But if you don't, we'll have already moved on.
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:39.860]   You will not be covering the story.
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:40.660]   Too late.
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:41.580]   We're done.
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:44.940]   And here's the worst part, though, is that what comes after this
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:49.140]   is the drama of the app developers, the drama of the things
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:52.060]   crashing, the drama of everyone running
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.460]   all the new applications, all the new pieces.
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:56.060]   It's going to be never ending.
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:57.820]   It's not-- this is just the beginning of the trouble.
[00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:59.500]   The never end of the story.
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.300]   So there is and has been, for seven months,
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:08.140]   a major bug in BSD, the Unix system that underlies OS 10.
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:11.220]   It's been fixed in Open BSD, Net BSD, and Free BSD.
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:14.660]   It's been fixed in a variety of Mozilla applications.
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:17.140]   It's been fixed, in fact, in most of the open source community,
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:21.380]   everywhere except, of course, OS 10.
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:26.420]   Apple has sat on this bug, according to a story,
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:31.820]   in Reg Hardware.co.uk for seven months.
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:37.740]   When asked one of the developers, Unix developers--
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:39.700]   I'm sorry, the security researchers have found it.
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.500]   Mark's million are Chemovitz said,
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.820]   it's not that difficult to patch.
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:45.860]   Seems that Apple comes from the assumption
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:48.620]   that when there is no exploit given that the problem doesn't
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:51.940]   exist, it is a kind of a weird bug.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:55.460]   Right now, the bug could be exploited, say, for instance,
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:59.380]   in a booby trapped website using some PHP code.
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.340]   All it would do at this point is crash your computer.
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.980]   But as we all know with buffer overrun exploits,
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:05.940]   the crash is the proof of concept.
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:07.460]   And it's just a matter of time before they
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:09.700]   get some code executing after the crash.
[00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:14.740]   Of the 16 applications or systems known to be affected
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:17.140]   by the bug, only four remain vulnerable.
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.780]   In addition to OS 10, they include Mozilla Sunbird, K-Million,
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.180]   and the J programming language.
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:23.620]   So I--
[00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:24.860]   You know, I use the J programming language
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:25.300]   for that time.
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:26.140]   Yeah, wow.
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.300]   I'm really sad.
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.500]   Yeah.
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:32.420]   So something-- you know, I'd like to see them fix.
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.020]   Be nice.
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:33.300]   Yeah.
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:39.140]   It's in the libc string to date function,
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:43.540]   and the libc get date to ASCII function.
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.100]   So don't get any dates.
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:47.340]   No dates or strings or anything like that.
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:48.940]   No dates and no dates with strings.
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:51.020]   It's a pretty common kind of a bug, actually.
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:53.300]   And it often discovered these bugs.
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.940]   Turns out that February 18, 2010 turns out
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.660]   to be the string and date.
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:50:59.820]   It's going to do it.
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:00.820]   It's going to do it.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:04.020]   Do you think that Apple should have some sort of an official
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.940]   outlet for saying, we are rare this bug.
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:08.180]   We do have a plan to fix it, and it will be fixed soon.
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:08.660]   Or even--
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.500]   I'd love to hear that.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:10.940]   I don't do that.
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:11.740]   They don't do that.
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:12.780]   I wish they would, though.
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:14.220]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:17.740]   It's all fine and good to say, oh, well, good.
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.700]   When does anybody use this language or, gosh,
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:20.620]   what's the one of the odds?
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:22.740]   This will actually be played in the field.
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.940]   We would much rather see Apple's never
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:28.820]   been shy about boasting about how safe their operating
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:30.700]   systems are compared to Microsoft.
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.860]   You would like to see them put that remaining piece
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.420]   in about saying that whenever we hear about something that
[00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:38.340]   might be exploited, we are so totally on top of that.
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:41.820]   We have an RV that will be dispatched exactly to where
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.340]   it needs to go, even if it's just a big show of force
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:46.220]   and has no purpose whatsoever.
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:49.060]   We will be there to patch that bug as quickly as possible.
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:51.020]   That's the one piece we're not seeing yet in their security
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:51.700]   portfolio.
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:55.060]   We have men with black ditto necks and sunglasses
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:58.140]   who will go out and find the person and deliver
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.620]   him to Steve in pieces.
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:03.180]   So you don't think that's a reasonable policy?
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:04.340]   I think it's a reasonable policy.
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:05.700]   I just don't think they'll do it.
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:07.140]   I'm being a realist.
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.140]   Apple just doesn't like to announce anything that hasn't
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.580]   been announced.
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:13.940]   And by the way, I understand as someone who has made the
[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:16.500]   mistake of announcing stuff before I had it done,
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:20.020]   even when I thought it was 99% done, I totally get that now.
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:22.740]   It's like I don't even announce stuff to the company most
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:24.100]   of the time.
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:27.180]   To other employees of our own company, when I don't have
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:30.900]   all the stuff signed and all the stuff done just because
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:31.820]   there's always details.
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.220]   Really makes sense.
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:38.180]   So I think that with security, it would be good to know.
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:40.700]   But when you don't know how you're going to fix it or when
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.900]   you're going to fix it, it doesn't do you any good to tell
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:44.460]   people.
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:48.260]   But doesn't it do some good to confirm that we know of this
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.380]   and we're working on it?
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:51.340]   That's what Microsoft does.
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:53.660]   They say, we know there's a problem.
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:54.860]   We're working to solve it.
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:56.700]   We need to solve it.
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:59.060]   It's just the culture of shh.
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.500]   Anything.
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:01.500]   No, no.
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.020]   No, no.
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.020]   No, no.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:05.500]   You don't want a competitor just to solve that problem
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.940]   before you do.
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.460]   Want to retain your technological edge.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.020]   It'll wait for that.
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.340]   All right, time for our picks of the week.
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:13.620]   Gentlemen, get your picks ready.
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.580]   But before we do that, I'd like to mention our friends at
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:18.460]   audible.com, the folks that do those great audio books that
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:22.260]   I save my life when I'm traveling in a plane or driving in
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:23.260]   the car.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.500]   I'm listening to great books.
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:27.740]   And it's just a really great way to get reading done at
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.540]   those times when you just can't, when you normally can't.
[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:34.420]   Audible.com/macbreaks a place to go to get started with
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:35.420]   Audible.
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:36.420]   Your first book is free.
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:39.460]   A great many wonderful things to choose from there.
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.060]   Really no limit.
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:42.700]   65,000 books.
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:45.300]   I've read 308 years.
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.100]   So I've got a few to go.
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:50.060]   I am working my way through the Audible-erve.
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:54.020]   Though as is Andy Inako, I know he's a big Audible fan.
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:57.420]   What are you going to put on your iPhone or iPod on your
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.340]   flight out here next week?
[00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:02.020]   Well, I finally finished the Sammy Davis Jr. biography
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:03.020]   that I downloaded about a month ago.
[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:04.820]   What is the longest damn book?
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:06.740]   It's a great book.
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:07.980]   It's a very, very long book.
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:11.540]   Unfortunately, it's also one of those good books that is,
[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:13.660]   when you get back in the car the next day, you don't want to
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:14.860]   pick up right where you left off.
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:18.060]   You want to rewind a little bit to put yourself back in
[00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:19.060]   back in the office.
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.060]   Sammy Davis wrote.
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:21.060]   68, right, exactly.
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:24.580]   So that's, you get value for money.
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.580]   The next download, yes.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:29.660]   Now that leaves me with a great problem where I now have two
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:33.900]   credits in my inbox right now, because I spent so much time
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:35.140]   listening to this other book.
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:39.300]   So I'm buying the 40th anniversary of the 40th anniversary.
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:41.900]   400th episode of, it only seems like it's been around for 40
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:45.060]   years of the Simpsons aired last night, a really good
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:47.620]   documentary that was good behind the scenes sort of stuff.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:48.820]   Wow, 400th episode.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:49.820]   Wow.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:50.820]   400 episodes.
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.460]   It is now the, it is now well past the longest scripted
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:54.660]   anything on television.
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:59.540]   That's 880 hours of viewing or something like that.
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:02.740]   And they are contracted for the next two seasons at least.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:03.740]   Shimmin'.
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:09.180]   So until Fox pulls the lever and money does not come out, this
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:10.940]   will still be on the air.
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.340]   So I was, I was marched.
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:13.340]   It was a great documentary.
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.780]   It was directed by Morgan Spurlock.
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.020]   And it sort of got me interested.
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:19.300]   He did the, he did the, he did super size.
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.140]   He did 30 days there that interesting series about
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:23.500]   saying any good stuff.
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.500]   And also, he didn't try to blow the lid off of anything.
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:28.820]   He just toured the country talking about different facets
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:30.860]   of the Simpsons.
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.900]   So it got me interested in sort of more of the behind the
[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:33.900]   scenes stuff.
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:37.060]   I remembered that there was a, an unauthorized history of the
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:39.420]   Simpsons that came out late last year.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.180]   But I remember looking for the audible book at the time it
[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:43.180]   was released.
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:44.180]   It was not available.
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:45.340]   I looked again and hey, they finally came out with an
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:46.340]   audio book.
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:48.740]   It's called The Simpsons, An Uncensored Unauthorized
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:51.140]   History by John Ortved.
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:54.460]   And, and, and, and as much as there can be any such thing as
[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:59.060]   real Simpsons scholarship, this is as close as we get to it.
[00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:00.060]   It's.
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:01.060]   I like it.
[00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:02.060]   I know, I know the.
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:02.860]   Simpsons scholarship.
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:03.860]   Yes.
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.140]   I know that there's a college where you can get course credit
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.780]   for it, but that's not fooling your parents.
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:07.780]   That's not fooling me either.
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:11.420]   So by the way, it won't fool future employers either.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:13.340]   So it just worked otherwise.
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:16.420]   It's not, it's not perfect, but it seems as though Ortved did a
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:19.820]   good, good job collecting oral histories, mostly from, from
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:22.380]   former writers, because they've had a hell of a lot of writers
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:23.780]   held a lot of really great writers.
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:24.780]   Sure have.
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:25.780]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:26.860]   He talked a lot of them, including he got good interview with
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.780]   Conan, Conan O'Brien, but his time.
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:29.780]   Right.
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:30.780]   Right.
[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:31.780]   For The Simpsons.
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:33.340]   He wrote, he wrote one, what is what agreed upon as one of the
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.340]   greatest episodes ever.
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:35.860]   He wrote the Monorail episode.
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:36.860]   That was all him.
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:37.860]   Huh.
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:38.860]   In case.
[00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:40.420]   They get a monorail through Springfield and this sort of
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:42.900]   yeah, Professor Harold Hill character comes through.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:43.900]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.180]   It has some problems.
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:48.900]   Number one, it is not the definitive history of The
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:52.700]   Simpsons because obviously as the word unauthorized implies
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:53.600]   they did not get it.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.340]   He couldn't get interviews with the principals.
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:56.940]   So they couldn't get an interview with Matt Granny.
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:58.500]   They could not get an interview with.
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:56:59.500]   I'm surprised.
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.140]   Matt's very open, I thought.
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:04.540]   But now who knows why?
[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:07.100]   If there's, there have been some reviewers who have claimed that
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:12.020]   this sort of lens to sort of a spin on the book where his
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:14.860]   contributions to the creation of The Simpsons is being minimized
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:16.980]   because he's not talking to Matt Granny.
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:19.100]   He's talking to people who work with him at that time.
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:21.300]   So that's what the information he's getting from.
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:24.580]   There are also people who are pointing out that the, the
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:30.780]   usually the raft of technical detail, technical mistakes that tend
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:33.300]   to happen when you don't have six months to fact check a really,
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:36.660]   really fact based book that he mentions.
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:40.100]   He makes mentions of wayland smithers, not wayland smithers.
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:43.300]   He misidentifies whether Patty, Patty, Patty and Selma's
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.620]   Marjor sisters, one of them is gay, one of them is not.
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:47.420]   He misidentifies the gay one.
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:51.260]   And of course that the Simpsons fans on the internet are
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:52.780]   third most obsessive nerds.
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:57.020]   They don't tolerate that after only because Star Trek and Star
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:59.980]   Wars have been, we're out at least 20 years before a Simpson.
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:01.260]   So they got a 20 year hit star.
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:04.980]   There's a, there are people who are genetically born to be
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:07.700]   since Star Trek eats in the, in Star Wars.
[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:08.220]   Yeah.
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:10.100]   This is one generation of Simpsons people.
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:12.140]   But other than that, it's a very, very readable, very, very
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:12.900]   entertaining book.
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.020]   You don't, you don't read it because you're doing your thesis
[00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:18.420]   project of 21st century, 20th century humor and animation.
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.940]   You just, because you just, you're interested in the show.
[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:22.260]   You want some behind the scenes stuff.
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:23.980]   You want to know something about the people who helped to
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:25.540]   create the show over the years.
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:26.660]   And this definitely delivers it.
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:27.300]   It's unabridged.
[00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:29.420]   It is 11 hours and 29 minutes.
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:33.860]   So value for money and given that there's a, there was an
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:36.100]   announcement, not an announcement, but a piece of news
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:40.460]   today from a Fox executives that Fox is about to contract Seth
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:46.100]   McFarland for a fourth Seth McFarland animated show on the
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:46.500]   Fox.
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:49.180]   That really dilutes the franchise.
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:49.660]   I think so.
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.020]   We're as much as I love the family guy.
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:54.900]   The other ones, I'm just too derivative for my desk.
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:58.020]   Well, you know, when, when you spend 10 minutes per episode
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:00.700]   writing, that's leaves you lots of free time to do more show.
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:03.580]   You don't, you don't like the family guy, I sense.
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:07.660]   I just, I, it's just the laziest produced show I have ever
[00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:08.220]   seen in my life.
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.900]   Well, we see, you see one episode of one episode of South
[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:15.060]   Park, one episode of Futurama, one, one good episode of The
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:15.580]   Simpsons.
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:19.460]   And you see more creative effort than you will see in 10
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:20.500]   episodes of Family Guy.
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:20.740]   Yeah.
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:24.260]   It's just, it just annoys me that they are so lazy.
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:25.180]   Makes me laugh.
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:27.900]   But I have to admit that The Simpsons is more craft.
[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:28.140]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:29.780]   Number one is that they don't make me laugh.
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:30.500]   So that's yeah.
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:31.420]   No, they make me laugh.
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:32.460]   I like potty jokes.
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:35.780]   Uh, but The Simpsons is definitely more crafted.
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:37.940]   There's no question about speaking of craft, by the way.
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:39.620]   Crap or craft.
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:40.100]   Craft.
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:40.540]   Okay.
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:43.340]   I want to thank, I think it was Andy who suggested this, this
[00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:45.820]   book that I, that I downloaded because I down all the only
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:48.140]   books I download are the ones eventually that Andy says and I
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:50.300]   pick out certain ones and I end up reading them or whatever.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:54.460]   But shop class as shop class as sole craft.
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.020]   Did you recommend that Andy?
[00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:58.380]   Uh, I might have read it.
[00:59:58.380 --> 00:59:59.380]   I was one of my favorite books.
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.060]   I was going to recommend it.
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.580]   I think we talked about it on the show.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:02.060]   Oh my gosh.
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:02.420]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:03.260]   What a great book.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.300]   That's all I got to say.
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:04.620]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:05.220]   I'm listening to it.
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:08.740]   I just think it's such a great, um, uh, you know, great
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:09.340]   recommendation.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:12.140]   It's very, you know, philosophic, a philosophical approach to the
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:16.420]   trades and, uh, and doing work manual work and working on things.
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:17.460]   And it's just great.
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:18.700]   Really, really well thought out.
[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:19.620]   Anyway, that's all.
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.340]   I just want to thank you for that, for that, because it was.
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.500]   And our recommendation of the week, well, you could take either,
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.460]   well, either one, really, they're both great.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:26.780]   And that's the problem with audible.
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:28.300]   You can't just pick one.
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:30.620]   It's like a Lay's potato chips, but try this one.
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:34.620]   The Simpsons, an uncensored unauthorized biography by John or
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.100]   VED, our pick of the week.
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.020]   Now here's the deal.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.860]   You can get that or the sole craft or whatever you want by going
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:43.020]   to audible.com/macbreak and get that first book free.
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:46.060]   It plays on the iPhone, the iPod plays on a lot of devices,
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:49.020]   including the zoom and the Kindle, many GPS devices.
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:49.940]   There's a device center.
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.260]   You can go to it audible.com to make sure it works with your
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:54.340]   particular player and do check first.
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:57.140]   It's very disappointing to me that no Android device yet supports
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:57.980]   audible.
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:59.540]   I want to get Google off the stick.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.060]   Come on Google because the partners have to write these.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.700]   So audible gives you lots of help.
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.460]   It gives you an SDK, but the partners have to write them.
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:09.460]   We would like an audible for the for the Nexus one.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:12.260]   That's the one thing keeping me from leaving the iPhone behind.
[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:16.060]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:19.460]   We thank them for their support of Mac break weekly.
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.860]   Andy, you haven't done the first pick in a long time.
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:25.740]   I usually defer, but this time I'm going to give you a chance.
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:27.100]   Start us off.
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:30.340]   Well, this is in the category of things that I've used for years
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.620]   and years and years and I just stop thinking about it.
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.980]   So I don't actually think of it as an actual pick.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:38.460]   This is my pick of the week is Moo cards.
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.380]   They are right.
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.860]   They are. I love them a lot.
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:44.100]   I got a bunch of Moo cards at CES.
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.340]   Yeah. I mean, because they're there.
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:50.020]   I love ideas like this because there's nothing really special
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:51.020]   or technological about it.
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.980]   There it's like a little business card that is much, much smaller
[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:54.820]   than a business card.
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:57.300]   It has any artwork you want on one side of it.
[01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:03.300]   And pretty much also any their templates built in for for just simply,
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.660]   you know, the information you want in the back or you can upload
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.140]   your own graphic for the back of it.
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.300]   You want to do your own type of it.
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.660]   We all know that is not Comic Sans.
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:11.980]   It's not Comic Sans.
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:13.420]   These are three different.
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:15.860]   The two different fonts that I got at the comic craft.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.100]   New Year's Day sale.
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:22.020]   But what I love about them is that they're exactly the way that you
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:25.380]   interact with people these days when I'm at a briefing, when I'm at a meeting,
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:28.220]   when there's a business sort of thing, I hand over my business car,
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:31.260]   which is very polished and very professional and has my street address
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:34.700]   and has my phone number so that you can, yes, please send me that Apple tablet.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:38.060]   I'll be able to sign for a package between the hours of 10 a.m.
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:42.420]   Tuesday and 5 p.m. any day after that, including March or April.
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:45.380]   But when you're just hanging out with people and someone wants,
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:47.940]   just wants her email address, of course, just hand give them a Moo card.
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:49.340]   It's much more casual.
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.820]   All this has on it is just, you know, my name.
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:56.620]   I'm starting to, I hope it was a mistake to identify myself as an
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:58.220]   internationally beloved tech journalist.
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.180]   But it's true.
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:00.660]   It's true.
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:01.460]   We love you.
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:05.820]   See, the funny thing about that, that calling yourself that is all you need
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:08.660]   is one postcard from a guy from Canada and you're in.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.660]   You are internationally beloved.
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:15.220]   But the point is that this doesn't have my home address on it.
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.420]   This doesn't have my phone number on it.
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.500]   So I can get to keep a certain amount of privacy.
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.380]   But yeah, hell yeah.
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:22.140]   If I just met you at a tweet up, I'll definitely give you my email address.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:23.540]   I will definitely give you my blog.
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:25.060]   I will definitely give you my Twitter address.
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:25.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:29.500]   And, you know, and it also gives you idea, you know, I'm not even sure if this is
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:29.740]   great.
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:33.060]   This is the most professional way to grow myself off.
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:37.380]   This is my great, great, great Uncle Godafroy just before the French
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:37.820]   didn't even work.
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:41.500]   But you could have a different picture on each card if you want.
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:41.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:43.060]   I mean, that's, that's the cool thing.
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:48.100]   It's not it's a 20 bucks, 20, 25 bucks for a pack of a hundred.
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.620]   But the cool thing is that it's not just one design.
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:54.980]   You can just keep uploading images to upload images, uploading photos,
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:55.900]   uploading JPEGs.
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:58.900]   And so you could have 100 different cards if you want.
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:02.740]   Normally I have a mix of two or three different kinds of shake things up.
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:06.780]   But I've had to actually switch to just do it giving away one because
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:10.700]   there's always that one and the one in the cat in the pack that I always
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:11.860]   decide, oh, that's the coolest one.
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:12.820]   I want to give them the cool one.
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:17.140]   I wind up with the only ones I have left are the back of you.
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:20.660]   That was really, really cool pattern months ago.
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:23.660]   I had a problem because people started collecting them.
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:26.580]   There was the Annie and that go collect all goods.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:27.540]   Like don't meet me 50.
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:30.260]   Well, actually, every time you meet me and buy me a drink, I give you a new one.
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:31.700]   I mean, he's the puzzle.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:35.380]   But they also sell cool things like I bought a new case that came with the order
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:37.660]   because it is a very, very social sort of thing.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:39.020]   So you just keep this in your pocket.
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:42.860]   So it's a, it's a slide out plastic case that I haven't figured out how to
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:43.380]   open it up.
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.100]   It's there you go.
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:45.100]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.740]   It's just a swing out case like that.
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:50.060]   It'll hold about, I don't know, like 10 or 15.
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:53.500]   So when I'm going out for the night, and especially if I'm going to a party or
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.100]   something or tweet up, I'll just have one of these in my pocket.
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:59.140]   And like I said, if anybody wants me a meal address, I don't have to worry about.
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:04:59.740]   That's a good idea.
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:04:59.780]   Yeah.
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:00.380]   I should do that.
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:00.740]   Yeah.
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:04.820]   I was, I was, I was taking a drive through Massachusetts and I thought, well,
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.940]   I'm only 20 miles away from Andy's house.
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:09.580]   I'll just drop by and remind him that I met him three years ago.
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:10.980]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:11.660]   Thank you.
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:14.300]   That's very nice and very social, but you're creeping me down.
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:17.980]   If I had hounds, I would be releasing them right.
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.580]   Release the hounds.
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:25.660]   So everyone, everyone who does anything in social, in, in, in world space should have
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:26.140]   moot cards.
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.180]   They're just a perfect solution.
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:27.740]   Could I do?
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:28.820]   And they're small.
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.660]   I just, one last thing.
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:33.780]   The printing is so good on this.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:35.420]   I wish you could see how good this is.
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:36.180]   I see.
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:37.780]   No, it's like cheap cards at all.
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:38.140]   Exactly.
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:40.380]   They're, they're very, very fixed dirty stock.
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.420]   I mean, they're, they're not, they're not cheap at all.
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:43.860]   They also make business cards.
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:46.940]   I'm actually thinking about getting them to do like my next business cards.
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:50.900]   But one of the reasons why I don't do color business cards is that I,
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:56.220]   every time I've done that, the printing comes back and my, my immediate reaction is
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.900]   I can't give these out.
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:58.420]   Right.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:01.660]   They, they, they think I don't know how to, how to work with color spaces.
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:05.140]   They think that I, I upload everything as a, as a two bit GIF.
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:06.580]   I can't, I can't give these out.
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.180]   Embarrassing.
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:09.220]   But these guys do a great job with the photos.
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:09.780]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:12.860]   Moon.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:18.180]   We love to print and how much for the, like a, you know,
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:20.140]   hundreds or whatever that is you ordered.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.380]   Uh, not expensive, right?
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.420]   It's not expensive.
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:25.020]   You're going to get a sample 10 pack.
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:27.900]   You got a sample 10 pack pretty, pretty cheap.
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.340]   They're also smart enough that when you, when you get an order,
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:33.100]   they will also give you likes of freebie cards.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.860]   So if you give someone one of these cards, right,
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:36.100]   in order to sound very, very cheap.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:36.380]   Right.
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:39.740]   The new cards, I've just had to remind myself how much they are.
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:42.660]   Fanny cards are $19.99 per 100 card packs.
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.580]   There's nothing for 100 business cards of $21.99.
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:45.900]   Yeah.
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:46.660]   That's nothing.
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:47.860]   It's, it's nothing.
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.660]   They, it's, it's good stuff.
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:52.380]   I got to, you, you've reminded me I got to do this.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:55.980]   Hey, speaking of reminders, my pick is something that you probably all,
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:57.220]   already know about.
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.180]   And so I'm not, you know, I'm not going to be telling you anything new,
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:02.620]   but you know, this week I've been at T and the week before, except for the,
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:05.620]   you know, few days that I took off to go to Las Vegas for fun.
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:09.220]   I've been teaching a class in podcasting to my kids high school.
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:10.460]   It's been called audio cafe.
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.540]   It's been a blast.
[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:15.980]   I have to say, and, and I set them up with some equipment, some microphones
[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:21.980]   and a Mac with logic, but the kids also have laptops and I wanted them to have a
[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:25.340]   way to inexpensively edit and work with audio at home.
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:29.780]   And I, you know, I have to say, I haven't used audacity in a long time,
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:31.900]   partly because it used to crash a lot on me.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:35.900]   This thing has been really rock solid audacity, which is absolutely
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:41.700]   free is probably now, I would say the premier program for audio editing.
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:44.260]   If you don't want to spend a lot of money, of course, you can get soundtrack,
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:47.860]   pro and logic and stuff, but even multi-track recording editing.
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.060]   This thing is great.
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:52.500]   It comes with a bunch of built in effects, but notice it also sees all the VSTs.
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:56.260]   I've got other, you know, Apple programs and so forth installed.
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:08:00.500]   So all of these special effects, including isotopes, ozone three and stuff,
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:05.140]   work within audacity that's got great, you know, it's got a noise removal.
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.260]   It's got compressor.
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:07.700]   It's got amplify.
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.340]   So I'm teaching the kids to edit.
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:13.380]   I'm teaching them to work with audio and I would say they're 99% of anything
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:16.420]   they would want to do to create, you know, the kinds of audio that we do for
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.220]   podcasting or for radio news.
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:19.620]   They can do an audacity.
[01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:23.340]   So I thought, you know, let's remind people who don't know audacity is still out
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:23.500]   there.
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:28.620]   And if you haven't used it in a while, the current beta, which is 1.3.10,
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:30.660]   is a universal binary.
[01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:33.620]   It's very quick download and is in is very solid.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:38.420]   The kind of the standard one that they recommend you use if you want absolute
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:42.460]   solidity, I think is 10 is 1.25 on the Macintosh.
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:46.620]   But I've had no problems with 1.3 and they've just done a really nice job.
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:51.820]   So I want to encourage people to to if you've been looking for an audio editor,
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:54.900]   I know there's some other inexpensive ones I've been using Amadeus Pro and
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:09:00.740]   felt tip, sound studio and of course, soundtrack pro and even logic and higher
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:01.660]   end programs.
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:04.540]   But audacity is pretty good start if you want to get into podcasting.
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.660]   A U D A C I T Y.
[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:10.620]   Dot source forge dot net.
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.420]   That's my pick of the week.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:15.420]   And now Alex lens, by the way, free zero Alex's.
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.540]   So you Alex, you feel you to go crazy.
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:18.500]   I'm going crazy.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.460]   Not really.
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:20.020]   All right.
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:20.700]   Check this out.
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:21.700]   I found this is a yes.
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:22.100]   Check it out.
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.100]   This is what I found the C.
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:23.500]   Yes.
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:24.780]   It looks like a suction cup Alex.
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:25.660]   It's just suction cups.
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:26.140]   Okay.
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:26.940]   Well, it's even better.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.300]   It was very techy, you know, is it?
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:31.420]   So this is called it's called if you go to suction cup.com.
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:33.220]   Well, at least they got the domain.
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:33.780]   You got the domain.
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:34.460]   I was pretty impressed.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:34.780]   Actually.
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:34.980]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:36.100]   And so here's what it does.
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:40.540]   You take the one suction cup and you put it on the back.
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:45.940]   And music is playing calls you while you're on TV.
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:47.180]   Anyway, so.
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:48.140]   Wait a minute.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:51.500]   No, you don't go to suction cup.com unless they're P I A B
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.220]   innovators in vacuum technology.
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:53.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:55.380]   Not suction cup suction clip.
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:56.220]   Such a clip.
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:56.740]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:57.140]   Clip.
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:57.340]   All right.
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:57.660]   Sorry.
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:58.140]   My bad.
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:09:59.660]   Such a clip dot com.
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:00.660]   Check this out.
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:02.020]   So I got the suction cup on the back of my iPhone.
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:02.540]   Yeah.
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:03.540]   I think the other suction cup.
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:04.380]   I take the other suction cup.
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.220]   And I stick it to my screen.
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:07.740]   And it's stuck there.
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:08.540]   It's stuck.
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.780]   It's stuck on the screen.
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:10.620]   It's suction cup.
[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:11.540]   You can't get it off.
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.780]   I'll try it off.
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:13.700]   Now, here's the thing.
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.860]   Here's what they really thought out though is that if I
[01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:18.820]   have it, it's got a little swivel so I can swivel it on the
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:19.820]   screen.
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:22.260]   But it also has a simple thing where I can pop it open.
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.820]   Would it work on an airplane seat back?
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:24.660]   That kind of thing.
[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:24.860]   Yeah.
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:25.380]   It's the whole thing on.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:27.820]   I can cover the monitor that that I don't use.
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:30.540]   Suction cup to the jet blue monitor.
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:31.980]   I can just look at that too.
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.340]   Nobody can see what you're here.
[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:34.740]   Let's go to camera five.
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:35.340]   Here I am.
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:39.180]   I've got a camera just for the suction cup cam.
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:39.540]   Suction.
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:40.540]   Watch.
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:42.020]   Even to leather.
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.060]   It sticks to leather.
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:43.820]   Look at that.
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:44.380]   Look at that.
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:45.780]   That's beautiful.
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:46.700]   It's pretty cool.
[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.700]   It's like it's 12.95 or 12.
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:50.140]   That's actually a great little product.
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:51.980]   It is a, you know, and it's small.
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.220]   It's just something you can kind of keep in your and you
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:54.860]   want to pop.
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:57.060]   You know, there are many times you broke it.
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:58.740]   Shh.
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:00.540]   I couldn't get it off.
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:01.460]   You got to grab the little thing.
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:02.300]   Oh yeah, there you go.
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.020]   There's a little here.
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:03.500]   Look at that.
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:04.140]   That's cool.
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:07.380]   So the thing is, is that the idea is that there's a lot of times
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:09.940]   where I just want to put my iPhone somewhere, you know,
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:12.740]   whether it's on a window or on a, you know, and it's a little
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:14.780]   like the one you'd have like a GPS on your.
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:15.620]   I love this.
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:16.620]   I'm about one of these.
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:16.620]   See?
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:17.500]   That's cool, man.
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:17.980]   See?
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:19.060]   That's really cool.
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:21.700]   What do you believe Billy Mays were still around to promote this?
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:22.700]   Yeah.
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:25.340]   And Billy Mays with the double cup.
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:27.660]   It's not one cup.
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:28.660]   It's two cups.
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:29.660]   That's pretty cool.
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:30.660]   Hands previewing your phone.
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:33.660]   And by the way, it's not iPhone specific.
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:36.660]   You could use it on anything that has this smooth surface.
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.660]   They probably would work with my well with the iPhone.
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:42.420]   And they have a fix for it, even if it's not rough.
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.420]   So they have this.
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:44.420]   What is that?
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:45.420]   That's the rough sticker.
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:46.420]   Okay.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:49.300]   So if you really want to stick your something that isn't really rough,
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.300]   you could stick this on.
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:53.900]   This is, this is really going to bond to it to some degree,
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:55.860]   but it makes the suction cup pop right onto it.
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:57.700]   Your suction cup can pop onto that.
[01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:01.140]   So if you put that on your dashboard or you can put it somewhere.
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:02.940]   Actually, this would be great for the car.
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:03.940]   Yeah.
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:04.940]   Well, probably not.
[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:05.940]   No.
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:08.020]   Only because it's not a hard, it's not a rigid thing.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.580]   Well, that's why you have the little suction cup.
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:11.580]   The casino chip.
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:13.660]   The casino chip that they're losing.
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:14.660]   No, but lose to it.
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:18.740]   But you have a layer of squishy rubber between the base of the thing and the base of the
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:19.740]   thing.
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:20.740]   So vibrate too much?
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:21.740]   I think so.
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:22.740]   I have another fix for that.
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:25.220]   But that's for another show.
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:28.380]   I have a super, I've been really, for some reason I'm in dissection cups lately.
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:30.740]   So I've got a super suction cup thing for camera.
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:31.740]   Can you climb walls?
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:32.740]   I haven't.
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:33.740]   Like Spidey.
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:36.100]   It's just hard to get it unsuction.
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:37.300]   It's easy to get it suctioned.
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:38.300]   It is.
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:40.140]   That's why you have to have that little lever.
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:44.340]   All the way up the wall.
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:45.340]   Yeah.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:46.340]   It's hard on the wrist.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:47.340]   Very cool.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:51.900]   Suctionclip.com for the original suction clip by Brenda.
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:56.900]   It really is.
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:13:00.900]   So it's like it's a little company that thought this stuff out and put it together.
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:02.980]   And it's a really great idea.
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:04.260]   And I would highly suggest it.
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.260]   Very cool.
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:09.500]   Some great inexpensive stuff there for you on this Macbrick weekly.
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:12.140]   Thank you, Mr. Alex Lindsey for being here.
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:13.740]   Andy Enoco, you're the greatest.
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.380]   Andy is at the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:19.700]   He will be here for our live coverage of the big event.
[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:24.380]   Two weeks hence, next week we'll probably just sit here in stunned silence holding our
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:25.380]   breath.
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:26.380]   Staring.
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:27.380]   There's always a staring at it.
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:28.980]   Waiting, tapping our fingers.
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:34.700]   You can catch Andy at the Chicago Sun Times also at his website www.cwob.com.
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:37.860]   That's short for celestial waste of bandwidth.
[01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:39.700]   Look for his MOOC cards.
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:41.860]   And tweet up near you.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:47.140]   And by the way, I'm going to be on somebody else's podcast on Friday.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:48.140]   Post it.
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.140]   Where are you going?
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.140]   I'm going to be on Facebook.
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:51.140]   I'm going to be on Facebook.
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:52.140]   I'm going to be on Facebook.
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:53.140]   I'm going to be on Facebook.
