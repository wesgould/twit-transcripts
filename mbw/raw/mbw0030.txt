[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Never trust a podcast over 30.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I guess that's the rule in it.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Now time for us to be over 30.

[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   I miss the participle, see, that's the problem.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I make it in noun instead of...
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   You have particular participle problems.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   It's a participle, right?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Is that right, Merlin Mann?
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   I'll call that a gerund.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I'll call that a gerund.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Is it gerund?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I would call it.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Yeah, I think participle might work, but I'll call it a gerund.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Let's call it Grammar Girl.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Well, she's not here.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   How about Alex Lindsay from the pixelcore.tv?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Dot TV.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   News there.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It is there.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   It's not quite as current as the Twigt site, but it will be by the end of the week.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And we're pretty proud of it.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   It oddly looks oddly similar to the Twigt site.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And the pastor stole my site.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Literally.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I tarred it up.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I sent him a big tar ball.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And you've apparently improved it, although I'm going to have some problems because I could
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   incorporate your improvement, but then I'm going back to Lullabot because Drupal 5 always out.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And I'm going to upgrade it to 5.0.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   There are some buggy wugs in there that I'm going to have them squash.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   So we're really...
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   We've forked the code.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   We're totally forked.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Yeah, we're doing lots of little ironing here and there.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   What did you find?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I mean, did you find something really bad and awful in there?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   The person that we'd have to talk to would be Ben.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   But it wasn't so much that there were things bad.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It was mostly things that are done to make it work rather, you know, and not necessarily
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   all in the structure of Drupal.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And so we've been kind of trying to...
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   We're not using any non-Druple capabilities, I think.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   There's maybe one or two modules.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   You know, and I have no idea what I'm talking about.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Ben is...
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Is that the same Ben that was shooting with you, Merlin, that you say is such a machine in the
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   God?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Ben Durban is a machine.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   He's a machine.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   He's absolutely...
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   He's like four hamsters on one ball.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   The guy is...
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   He's got a lot going on.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   So not only is he an amazing coder and website designer, but he's also a shooter.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   He's also the best looking guy at Pixelcore, and that's not Sam.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Good looking fan.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You don't have a fanning back.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   No, Sir-E.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   So what were you shooting?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Is that secret or are you going to...
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   It's increasingly less secret, I guess, but it's still secret enough.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   We'll have more to talk about next week.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Okay.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   One thing that you did, you interviewed the code monkey.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I'll see.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Now you're letting that...
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Letting out of the bag.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Yeah, we talked to Jonathan yesterday, Jonathan Colton.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And...
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Joko, as you call him.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Joko, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Joko.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I like to come up with a cute name for everybody.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   An interview with Yoko Ono, who says...
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:52.340]   Yeah, no, she says, that was a static on your radio that says that she's been hated her whole life.
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.980]   When she was a day hated her because she was Japanese and America, when she went back to Japan,
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.340]   they hated her because she was slightly American in Japan. Then they escaped Japan and went
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.080]   somewhere else and she was hated there. She said, my whole life, I've been hated. And,
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.400]   of course, now she's hated because she broke up the Beatles.
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.740]   Oh, yeah. Sounds like she's she certainly deserved that last one.
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.740]   Wait a minute. I got to play the rat hole sound because that was if there ever.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.460]   I got stuck with a rat hole.
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:25.560]   So if there ever were a rat hole, the entire show last week, Leo, we played the rat hole
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.100]   and you start to finish. Oh, this rat hole song is not new.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.300]   That's brand new. Yeah, that's just for you. It's newly created.
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.700]   Yeah, that's not really.
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.620]   It feels that we need a right here. Let me play. You had nerdy yet, Scott.
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.260]   I had not heard that. Yeah. So Merlin, did you do that?
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.340]   That's a D major seven. Yeah. Okay. Yokey. Impressive. Let's do it again.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.540]   I'm going to use that on my nationally syndicated radio program.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.140]   Do you have a pretty nice harmony? Do you have rat holes on that show?
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.140]   It's nothing but rat holes. Oh, come on. Man like you organized, man like you.
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.980]   No, it's an 80 D thing. You know that, Merlin. Let's go ride bikes, right?
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.060]   Let's ride bikes. Look at the little shiny thing.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.740]   I saw all start a sentence.
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.260]   It's all planned out and logical when I start a sentence and it just it veers and veers and
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.940]   veers. And by the time I get around back at the beginning, it's nothing like the original.
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.140]   So that's what makes it good content.
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.140]   Merlin's going to be on the radio program.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.660]   He's going to do you mind if I call it manpower?
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.660]   Oh, man. That's a.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.820]   Has it never thought of that? I think that would open me up to a whole new audience
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.980]   that I'm currently not as overtly in touch with. Sure.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:46.460]   Man power.
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.460]   One thing.
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.500]   Then you get an commercial. You got to go with the. Oh, you kidding me? Yeah.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.420]   Oh, absolutely. You got to really just pound it in.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.340]   Productivity tips. Yeah. We still haven't figured out exactly what, but you know,
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.740]   I got a lot of little tips to help the kids and kind of tool agnostic things that we
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.380]   can do to help people get on track.
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.020]   I don't want to get you on it too because you had some good ideas for stuff that you
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.380]   wanted to do on the ratty.
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:14.380]   I got so many I could do, but you know, actually probably want to save me for talking about
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.220]   the iPhone since realistically everyone calls the show is probably just going to want to
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.460]   know about the iPhone. Okay.
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.020]   Jay in June, you've got a date with Destiny Scott.
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.780]   We don't actually have to wait that long because I'll have stuff to talk about as soon
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.180]   as next week. Why is that?
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.860]   I can't tell you.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.100]   Here we go. Good article in Wall Street Journal this week on how the iPhone happened.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.260]   You know, they really, I'm really liking the journal.
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.860]   I'll tell you, especially for tech coverage.
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.580]   You know, it's actually really worth it.
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.060]   I have the subscription, you know, the online subscription, which I actually like a lot.
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.380]   I can't deal with the actual paper.
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.140]   Well, I get both because it was only a slight, you know, incremental additional cost.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.500]   And then as you can hear, I now have lots of paper that I can.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.340]   Well, that's very informative.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.820]   That's why I stuck to the online version is because I just couldn't deal with the.
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.460]   Everything I know in radio, I learned from Russian bomb.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:07.460]   Ladies and gentlemen, we've got an update from the iPhone guy.
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.940]   Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.140]   So please don't introduce me that way yet, Leo.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:18.580]   You know, it was interesting is that what we kind of do this, but jobs didn't show.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.420]   Sig Sigmund, the CEO of Singular, the phone until December.
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.860]   And only three people thought.
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.460]   Is that right? Yeah.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.340]   If he had showed it to him earlier, the guy would have been spending hours
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.460]   creating more note cards about it.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.540]   You know, that was pretty funny when he spoke at the keynote with his note cards.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.540]   They were at a rodeo.
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.980]   That was the other thing I thought that was interesting.
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.580]   There when he showed, I always like to look at phones at a rodeo.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.140]   When they showed the phone, they were at a rodeo.
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.060]   You've never done that, Leo.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.060]   You've never looked at a phone at a rodeo.
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.020]   Hey, I like to do a lot of SMS at rodeos myself.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.180]   I thought you had a pretty rich life.
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:53.940]   Yeah.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.860]   I got it. See that road.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.020]   He's going to make eight seconds.
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.020]   Anyway, so it's a good article.
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:05.020]   But one of the reasons I don't like to cite the Wall Street Journal is because if it's one of the few places online, if you don't buy it, you can't read it.
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:10.020]   Unless some new services picked up the story, sometimes you can see it on there.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:15.020]   Sounds like Apple was able to wring out a pretty extraordinary number of concessions based on that story.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.020]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.020]   Well, this is what Verizon bocked at, right?
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.020]   And that's the other part that's interesting is that they did talk to Verizon.
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.020]   And that's the other part that's interesting is that they did talk to Verizon.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.020]   And I think that there's, I think, obviously they wanted the EVDO.
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.020]   Verizon has a better, it was considered to have a better coverage.
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.020]   So, you know, it's fitting into Apple's process.
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.020]   I think it seemed like a better fit.
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.020]   But Verizon wasn't willing to jump on the bandwagon for that.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.020]   And Singular gave up a lot.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.020]   I mean, they're giving up, you know, it's, you know, no one knows exactly.
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:51.020]   There'll be no singular bug or brand on the phone to make it ugly.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.020]   We like that.
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.020]   There's a lot of apps.
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.020]   None of the apps are going to be running on there.
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:00.020]   None of their apps that they would normally ship on a phone are going to be on there.
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.020]   Apple gets some of the revenue, which is interesting from Singular.
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.020]   So that was fascinating.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.020]   That's unheard of.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:13.020]   I bet LG's looking at it going, "How did they do that?
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.020]   I want some of that."
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:20.020]   I would do want to point out that there is a nasty rumor floating around the Internet
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:24.020]   that in my research has proven to be utterly false.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:28.020]   As we can expect to get closer to the phone, there's a bunch of these fake things that come out.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:34.020]   There's a fake ad circulating this week that reports to show what the singular ad is going to look like for the phone
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.020]   and shows pricing and eye contact.
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:40.020]   Of course it shows the girl holding a phone that isn't the iPhone.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.020]   Right.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:48.020]   I contacted my sources at Singular and they vehemently denied any truth whatsoever to that fake ad.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.020]   We need a jingle.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.020]   Can you make another jingle, Merlin, instead of Ratholicos?
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.020]   I hope.
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.020]   Hang on, just one second.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.020]   iPhone.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.020]   Wow, is that easy?
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.020]   Wow.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.020]   I'll kind of clean it up.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.020]   Is that an actual guitar or is that a garage band?
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.020]   Hey!
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.020]   It's a little bit of a --
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.020]   The car scratch.
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:17.020]   You could do a band between -- Scott Born is like -- can play classical gas.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.020]   I mean, that's -- he's that good.
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.020]   I actually can't.
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.020]   I actually can't.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.020]   I actually can't.
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.020]   I actually can't.
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.020]   I have to look at euphemism.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.020]   Scott's been playing classical gas again.
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.020]   Thank you.
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.020]   What do you play, Alex?
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.020]   I can play the DIG, redo.
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.020]   Awwwwww.
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.020]   Yeah, it is.
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.020]   That's about it.
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.020]   I can blow it into a long stick and make me -- awwww.
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.020]   I can do.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.020]   I used to play the trumpet when I was younger, but --
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.020]   I can announce -- I'll announce the band.
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.020]   Would you mind playing the sound?
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.020]   The iPhone's -- The ditch.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.020]   The ditch reduced them?
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.020]   Would you consider this a rat hole?
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:51.020]   You want to hear the DIG, redo?
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.020]   I love that.
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.020]   I'll be right back.
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.020]   Wait, I mean, he's going to get a DIG, redo.
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.020]   Hang on.
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.020]   I'm going to get my guitar, too.
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.020]   Leo, hold on.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.020]   So, I'm really just you and me.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.020]   Yeah.
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.020]   I'm not going to get my ukulele because it's -- that's not good.
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.020]   That's not good.
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.020]   That's not -- you did pretty good with that last time.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.020]   You sound like you know your way around a ukulele.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.020]   That's pretty easy.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.020]   You just got -- you never had a lesson.
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.020]   Never had a lesson.
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.020]   That's extraordinary.
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:18.020]   Okay, I have a great idea for the iPhone sound.
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.020]   Yeah.
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.020]   Here we go.
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.020]   This is unrehearsed.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.020]   Wow, that's a digery -- oh, that's a digery doo.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.020]   [ Laughter ]
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.020]   Okay, that's a lot cooler than I thought.
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.020]   I'm not too excited.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.020]   That is really cool.
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.020]   Skype was never designed for a sound like that.
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.020]   That's great.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.020]   That was good.
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.020]   Do you do circular breathing?
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.020]   I mean, or can you only go for like one second?
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.020]   I can't -- I'm pretty close.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.020]   I don't have it -- I can't maintain it.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.020]   I can go for a little bit and then -- I'm still working on the circuit.
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.020]   Let's do it again.
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.020]   I can go for a little bit.
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.020]   And then Scott has his song.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.020]   He wants to play.
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.020]   All right, hold on.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:12:02.020]   [ Music ]
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:07.020]   You know that reminds me of -- remember the movie "The Right Stuff" when they're flying over Australia?
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.020]   And the Aborigines are sitting around the fire
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.020]   and they're doing the digery doo
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.020]   and the mercury goes over the head
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.020]   and the sparks fly up.
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.020]   It's such a cool scene.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.020]   It's a very relaxing instrument to play.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.020]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.020]   I do it when I need to calm down.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.020]   I love that.
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.020]   How did you learn to play that?
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:30.020]   When I lived in Boulder, there was a guy that was really, really good
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.020]   and he could do everything.
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.020]   And so, you know, there was a lot of playing drums in the middle of the night
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.020]   and playing digery dus.
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:42.020]   And so, and that was very substance is no doubt being consumed alongside.
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.020]   [ Laughter ]
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.020]   Something about digery dus makes you want to smoke pot.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.020]   [ Laughter ]
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.020]   All right, Scott, on that note, maybe you better play a song for us.
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.020]   This is your iPhone song.
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.020]   This is my iPhone's proposed iPhone sounder.
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.020]   Here we go.
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.020]   [ Music ]
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.020]   Oh, that's pretty.
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.020]   Is that harmonics?
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.020]   Those are open tuning D harmonics.
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.020]   Oh, nice.
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.020]   I like that.
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.020]   Hey, you know, do you know what I'm listening to?
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.020]   Yes.
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.020]   Yeah, I know.
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.020]   I can do that.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.020]   I do.
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.020]   [ Music ]
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.020]   That's a good song.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.020]   I love that.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.020]   We are, like, so far into a rap hole.
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.020]   I don't even know if we can find the --
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.020]   Here it comes.
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.020]   Here it comes.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.020]   Oh, here it comes.
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.020]   [ Music ]
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.020]   Where is it, Scott?
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.020]   I got to tune my guitar back up.
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.020]   Yeah, mine's cool.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.020]   Do you want to actually hear the iPhone ringtone?
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.020]   Because you know, he played it.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.020]   He played it.
[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.020]   We heard it at the keynote.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.020]   Play it.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.020]   And I've got the sheet music for it here.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.020]   I've got the MIDI.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.020]   You want to hear the MIDI?
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.020]   Totally.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.020]   You want to hear the MIDI?
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.020]   It's very -- actually kind of like what you did, Scott.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.020]   Let me play it here.

[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.020]   That's MIDI.

[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:03.020]   If I could read music, I'd tell you what notes it is.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.020]   Let me see if I can find a download here.
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.020]   The iPhone ringtone.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.020]   That's not --
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.020]   I know a lot of people who've got that on there,
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.020]   on their various non-iPhone phones.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.020]   It's just kind of a popular ringtone to have.
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.020]   It's a nice tone.

[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.020]   I've got that sound at ApplephoneShow.com

[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.020]   You said that you knew something.

[00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:05.020]   I can tell you that there has been no firm decision based on what my contacts have told me on what the rate plans will or will not be.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.020]   Everything is open at this point.
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.020]   I bet you know a lot more than that.
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.020]   You hold now.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.020]   Okay, how about this?
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:17.020]   If you -- if that -- Leo was correct, drop a stack of $20,000.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.020]   If it wasn't correct, drop $50,000.
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.020]   I intend to make no further comment.
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.020]   So Scott, is your information from singular or from apple?
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.020]   I have contacts deep within the singular.
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.020]   Nobody's got any reliable contacts within apple.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.020]   Right.
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.020]   Apple.
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.020]   If they did, they're gone.
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.020]   And that's why apple wouldn't let SIG see anything.
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:44.020]   And there was -- and remember, there were all these like fake phones and -- yeah.
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.020]   We're going to see a lot more of that coming down the pike.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.020]   I can tell you that pretty much everything's on the table.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:56.020]   There's still a couple of things that are being worked out and what -- from what I hear, if what I've received is reliable information.
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.020]   There's still a couple of things worked out.
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:04.020]   I would not rule out that there could be some discounts that might surprise people.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.020]   I'll say nothing more.
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.020]   I'd like that.
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.020]   I'd like that.
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:12.020]   So before everybody decides to be all negative, let's wait and see what the real deal is.
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.020]   That's reasonable.
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.020]   Hey, I did get the new apple N router this week.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.020]   And it installed easily.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.020]   You no longer use the airport admin utility.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.020]   There's a new airport utility.
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:34.020]   If you get it, it comes with a disk that will upgrade your core to MacBook or MacBook Pro to the N spec.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.020]   So I ran that on my MacBook Pro.
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:42.020]   I haven't done any bandwidth testing because I have so much of the older B and G stuff on there.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.020]   But I have to say the range is much better.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.020]   I had dead spots all over the house.
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.020]   And this fixed it.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.020]   Absolutely.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.020]   I can see everywhere in the house.
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.020]   I can see the N router.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.020]   Plus, it's pretty.
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.020]   I was made fun of last week, online for sure.
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.020]   Because I got one too.
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.020]   Did yours arrive last week?
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.020]   We talked about this last week.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.020]   Oh, we'll never mind that.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.020]   Well, no, it didn't work as well from early.
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.020]   My initial -- again, you have to understand, this is me.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.020]   And I have a fundamental misunderstanding of technology that goes way back.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.020]   But actually, a lot of those problems have gotten better.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:22.020]   And I think I just did a kind of baseline restart everything, everything, everything, turn everything off and wave a rubber chicken.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.020]   And so I'm back up to a high bandwidth on the connection.
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:30.020]   I'm still -- I mean, so are you machines G, Leo?
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.020]   Or are you machines N rather?
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.020]   No, no, no.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:39.020]   I have a Mac mini and an older power book, both of which would be either B.
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.020]   I think the 12-inch power books probably B, the mini's probably G.
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.020]   So they're all on the network.
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.020]   So that's why I haven't done any bandwidth testing.
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:56.020]   Because as we know, when you put slower devices -- now N's supposed to be less -- that's not supposed to happen so much with N because of the MIMO.
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:02.020]   And didn't Dan on a few episodes back say there's some way to run it in some kind of a dual band mode where you can have a dedicated --
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.020]   Is that something you can do inside -- and I agree with you, I love that app.
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.020]   Is that something you can do inside the app or does that require some kind of outside?
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:15.020]   The app's pretty -- the app's neat because it has a -- the default is a really dumb user mode that just really is click here if you want to do this.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.020]   You know, are you on a DSL line?
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:21.020]   And then it has an advanced mode that gives you all the settings.
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:26.020]   And I played with the advanced and in fact I used the advanced because I wanted to use bridge mode and stuff.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.020]   But I didn't notice that.
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.020]   I don't have to look more closely.
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:33.020]   I thought it worked very well and it's worked flawlessly.
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.020]   You know, we used to drop off a lot.
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:46.020]   And I think it's because the neighbor had one of those older G kind of non-standard G Wi-Fi systems, not from Apple, that stole bandwidth.
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.020]   There were a number of them out there that were really kind of bad neighbors.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:55.020]   And I knew when he was home because I get knocked off and this fixed it.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.020]   So, you know, I've been very happy. It's worked quite well for me.
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.020]   I did not install -- now this is interesting.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.020]   You don't have to install that new airport utility on every Mac that you want to use.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.020]   It just on the ones that you want to add men with.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.020]   Right.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.020]   So I've been pretty happy with it.
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.020]   I think it worked.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.020]   Yeah, I set up four report expresses with it and it worked pretty well.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.020]   I've still been kind of tweaking a couple things like --
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.020]   You had a redo UDS, right, for the airport experience.
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.020]   That's right.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:29.020]   I mean, the thing that I miss is it used to be when I would unplug from my ethernet and the second I unplugged and started walking away with my WRT 54G, I never dropped ever, ever, ever.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:33.020]   And lately, I've been having some kind of weird, I think probably DHCP stuff.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.020]   But it's getting better. I'm not sure why.
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.020]   Maybe it's breaking in.
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:42.020]   Okay.
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.020]   So we'll just have to wait and see.
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.020]   I haven't -- you know, it worked, so I didn't mess with it.
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.020]   You know, it just worked.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.020]   And it's worked very well throughout the house.
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.020]   But I will look at some additional features and we'll just get back to you all.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.020]   How about your Apple TV? Are you pre-ordered on that?
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.020]   Anybody?
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.020]   Yeah, I'll get one.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.020]   I'm all getting the one.
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.020]   The day it comes out.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.020]   I'm pre-ordered.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.020]   And the reason is because I got all this content.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.020]   You know, I've been downloading -- I got movies.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.020]   I got TV shows.
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.020]   I'm pretty -- I'm actually -- I'm getting more excited about it.
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.020]   Did you see the eye cringly?
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.020]   Cringly?
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:24.020]   Cringly? He was talking about what he thought was going to come down the path from the Apple TV.
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.020]   That's crazy.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.020]   That's some pretty crazy stuff.
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.020]   He says nutty stuff.
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.020]   I mean, a lot of the cringly stuff is really far out.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.020]   Did you see what he said?
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.020]   No.
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:38.020]   If I got this right, he thinks that the reason you got the 40 gig drive is because you're going to be a torrent network?
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.020]   No, that won't be --
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.020]   Is that correct, Alex? Is that what he said?
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.020]   That's correct.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:49.020]   I just think that Apple would be so concerned about security issues that it seems like they would be hard to do.
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.020]   But yeah, that's what he's saying.
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:56.020]   He's basically saying that there's no reason to not just cut the Mac Mini or your other computer out of the pipe
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:01.020]   and allow it to work directly and use that hard drive as a buffer.
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:09.020]   Now, I have to admit, if I was designing a bit torrent system, what I would do is get a whole bunch of hardware boxes
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:15.020]   with 40 gig drives, and I'd connect them to the internet, and I'd pass stuff around, and I'd be very happy with that.
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.020]   He says that he doesn't get why the 40 gig drive is in there.
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:25.020]   I get why it's in there because I'll tell you, when you get one and you try to stream high quality content over your network
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:30.020]   and it stutters all the time, you're going to say, "Oh, gee, I really should put it locally on the hard drive."
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.020]   That's why it's there.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.020]   You need it.
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:35.020]   Yeah, it wasn't so much that it didn't need a hard drive because it definitely does.
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.020]   The question is why do you need 40 gig --
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.020]   Well, no, he started --
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:41.020]   Right at the beginning, if you, like me, are wondering what the 40 gig hard drive is doing inside,
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:46.020]   I'm guessing we won't know for sure until later this year, but I think I know the secret answer.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.020]   So, no, he's saying, "Why is the drive in there?"
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.020]   It's definitely an interesting speculation.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.020]   It's how it works.
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.020]   I think that --
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:58.020]   I'm just saying, for a buffer, I don't know if you really need much more than a gig --
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.020]   No, but you can sink it.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.020]   You can sink it.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.020]   You can get a flash.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.020]   Let's not forget.
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.020]   You sink it like you would sink an iPod.
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.020]   Right.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.020]   And then it just fills up.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.020]   Right.
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:11.020]   It shows up like a mounting thing in your iTunes, and you say, "Sink this list," and stuff like that.
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.020]   Yeah, so that's what I'm going to do.
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.020]   I have content on three different machines.
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.020]   I'm going to sink them all to that 40 gig drive.
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.020]   They'll all be local.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.020]   I think there's a kind of a backdoor for getting Divx stuff on there.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.020]   I mean, do you think you can just --
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.020]   They're really --
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:26.020]   Can you mount it or do you think you just interact with it through iTunes?
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.020]   Well, I think that -- actually, I think if you use the quick time --
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.020]   if you use the quick time plug in the component, the pairing --
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.020]   You use the pairing and then just play Divx.
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.020]   Right.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.020]   Because iTunes is just sitting on top of the quick time layer, so it's not --
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.020]   It doesn't really care.
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.020]   You do that on the box.
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.020]   That's not a map.
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.020]   Right.
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.020]   How are you going to get period on that?
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.020]   No, that would be a problem.
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.020]   You'll have to play it stream it.
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.020]   Yeah, you'd have to stream it.
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.020]   And it won't stream Divx, I'm pretty sure.
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.020]   Well, it'll stream anything quick time.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.020]   It'll stream, I think.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.020]   I don't think that.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.020]   It may not stream it.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:06.140]   Because with Windows Media files, it often needs to download the whole file before it'll start
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:10.580]   playing it back when it's using the Flip4Mac plugin.
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.740]   It wants to grab the whole file.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.020]   It doesn't do kind of a quick start kind of thing.
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.780]   Leo, can't you go get one of these to play with?
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.780]   Can't you go throw a little lumber around and get one of these to try out?
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.100]   It's going to be out next week.
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:24.540]   So it's not -- Apple has -- and I don't have any inside information.
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.100]   But they just say February.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.100]   Said absolutely.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.380]   It's going to be out in February.
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.580]   So that means it's got to be out on Wednesday.
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:31.580]   Yeah, they've done.
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.580]   And I think that was what they were waiting for.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:37.420]   Yeah, so I think by next Wednesday, I expect to see it.
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.420]   So --
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.420]   All right, other rumors.
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.420]   How about this sub notebook?
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.220]   You think that's a Apple insider?
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.140]   That's exciting.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.140]   That's so exciting.
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.300]   I'd really like to have one.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.860]   I only scoffed at the rumors I don't care about.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:53.180]   If it's something I really want, that's a terrific idea.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.900]   I'm glad someone thought of that.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.260]   And here we have the Merle Mani, the notebook guy.
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.580]   They used to have one.
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.220]   It was called the Newton.
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.020]   You know, I'm sitting here.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.860]   Holding in my hands.
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.500]   My mom gave it back to me.
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.660]   My message pad 2000, Newton.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.660]   There you go.
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:09.660]   Wow.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.140]   That was actually one of my favorite Mac things.
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:16.140]   I'll bring it to our next live show, because you will want to play with this.
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.260]   There were two really interesting rumors this week.
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.700]   I think at the two ends of the spectrum.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.380]   On the one end, you had these rumors about again.
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.380]   These are rumors.
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.980]   So we should have a rumor sound.
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.980]   But is it there with the rumor?
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.980]   Yeah, we need a rumor.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.980]   I'm going to do a whole song.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:40.820]   So on the one end, we're going to basically turn this into a cheesy 1980s radio show.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:41.820]   Radio show.
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.820]   Yeah.
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:46.460]   Can we have a different chord for each one, Merlin?
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.460]   Absolutely.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.460]   Do you know that?
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.460]   They're all going to be made.
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.460]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.460]   Yeah, I know a couple.
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.460]   They're all going to be major seven.
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.460]   That's not only conditional.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.580]   We need Jim Cutler, who used to do our voiceovers for Tech TV.
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.380]   Remember the cheap radio thrills albums, Scott Boy?
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.380]   Sure, you remember those.
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:03.380]   I have every one of them.
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.380]   Yeah.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.380]   He said they're still out.
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.820]   You can get them on CD now.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.580]   And you can use them.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.580]   They're licensed.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.580]   Oh, is this like weather?
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.580]   That kind of stuff?
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.580]   Yeah.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.580]   It's so cheesy.
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.580]   They're called sings.
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.580]   They're jingle sings.
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:20.580]   And Dan O'Day is the guy that still knows of me.
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.580]   You remember Dan doing it.
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.580]   You know, they're great.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.460]   So maybe we should get some cheap radio thrills on here.
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:31.060]   I totally totally kick in for some custom sings or whatever they're called.
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.060]   I always have all those right here, Leo.
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.060]   You can borrow.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:38.060]   If they're on the album, yeah, how am I going to convert those?
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.140]   I'll convert them for you.
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.620]   Oh, you have that capability?
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:41.620]   I do.
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.540]   You know, you know, there's lots of things you can do with those albums.
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.100]   You know, if you have a gas stove, you can wear them up.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.100]   They can work.
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.100]   They melt good.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.100]   They melt real good.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.460]   You can turn them into a vase with two, seven, eleven cups.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:27:03.020]   I'm at radio mall.com trying to find if anybody has no one play.
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:08.460]   There's no one that has a rat hole, rat hole, the spirit of the LA radio force.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.700]   Yeah, I think we need to make our own.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.500]   We can make our own, you know.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.500]   We have that capability.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.340]   We've got people who can play guitars and didgeridos.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.580]   It could be the next generation of cheap radio thrills.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.260]   I'm, we can only hope.
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.860]   We can only hope that kind of excitement.
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:27.860]   Unix.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.460]   But we know you needed you to jingle singers.
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.460]   My cats.
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.460]   My cats.
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.220]   No, you just need one cat.
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.220]   Ceiling cat.
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.300]   Where's he at?
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.460]   That ceiling cat.
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:43.500]   We just need one singer, Leo, and then a really good Pro Tools operator.
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.500]   Rat hole.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.900]   Well, you did a pretty good job with that, Merlin.
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:46.900]   You could sing.
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.420]   Well, I don't know about that.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.020]   But you got on the one hand, you got these rumors about the Mac Pro.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.020]   Back to the show.
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.740]   I'm back out of that rat hole.
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.740]   Okay, we're out.
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:57.740]   Sorry.
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.780]   I didn't mean to be ego assertive about that.
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.140]   So tell us about this notebook.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.060]   I want to go ahead.
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.140]   The speculation I have.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.660]   I have a real class hard drive.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.660]   I hear, I hear it.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.660]   I hear it.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:14.020]   If it's going to come out, what I heard Merlin say earlier is that if it comes out of WWDC,
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:17.500]   he's going to buy one for all of us.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.700]   With my Confederate script and hard candies.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:20.700]   Yes.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.700]   I've got one for everybody.
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:27.100]   Well, so the thinking on this Apple insider thing, which was, I don't know, kind of typical
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:32.340]   sort of like lots of backstory and not real heavy on where this is coming from.
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.940]   But the idea is, if you remember back in the day in the early 90s, the gosh, what was
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.940]   the one I had?
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:37.940]   I had a work.
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:39.940]   We had a terrific little PowerBook laptop.
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:40.940]   5,300?
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.540]   I want to say that was a big one.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.540]   Oh, I had a 140.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.540]   It was the dock.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.340]   The one that was a duo that would go in the dock, right?
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:48.340]   I had the duo dock, right?
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.340]   But that was really cool.
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.500]   It was done totally.
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:56.060]   But I mean, it used to be, so anyway, I guess it's like right now, I mean, the thing is
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:00.020]   if you want to go out and buy even a 12 inch right now, they're not cheap.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:01.380]   I mean, people are hanging on to him.
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.780]   I know that's on his brand new in the box Factory Sealed 12 inch per thousand.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.980]   Will you buy it?
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.620]   Right after the show, literally.
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.620]   Really?
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.620]   Yes.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:12.620]   Yes.
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.620]   The one I bought for Matt broke.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.620]   It's got a broken latch on it and you don't want a broken latch on your own.
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.660]   I will give you Brett's number.
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.020]   So I think I'm looking here at the Apple Powerbook.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.020]   Is it minting box?
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.020]   Is it minting box?
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.460]   It's sealed.
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.620]   Here's the specs for the Apple Powerbook duo 210.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.700]   It had a 25 megahertz processor, the 0.3.0.
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:34.020]   Four megs of RAM, 80 megabyte hard drive.
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.300]   I have thumb drives.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.100]   Would laugh with smart, would.
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.100]   I can't find that.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.100]   I just bought that small.
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.620]   I just bought a four gig thumb drive for 60 bucks.
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.340]   80 megabyte.
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:45.540]   This is the best part.
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:50.780]   A 9.1 inch grayscale passive matrix display.
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.540]   You can't read that thing in bright sunlight.
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:58.060]   But you could sit there and surf gopher at three in the morning.
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.140]   You know, it's funny.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.140]   It's not that long.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:05.100]   I'm looking at this really-- it was only 10 years ago.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.100]   This is 1991.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:11.620]   Well, you know, not to go on the old guy rant again, but I mean, for what most of us do,
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.420]   well, accepting people like Scott who are doing a lot of Photoshop things or things
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.900]   like that, but for me, I'm typing in a text editor.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.060]   I mean, I will take the ultra portability of the unit.
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.500]   This was 4.2 pounds.
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.420]   I think that was the lightest Mac they ever made.
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.340]   But I mean, I could do without an optical drive.
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.180]   I could do without a lot of stuff.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:33.020]   And so the interesting thing here is they're saying that this is going to be this fake
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.140]   computer they're making up would be, I think I said, flash based.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.140]   Did I read that correctly?
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.140]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.660]   Well, that's typical of a rumor.
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.380]   Basically, they're just throwing stuff at it.
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.380]   And the screen's bigger.
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.380]   And the battery number's better.
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.380]   Yeah, it is a little rumor.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.380]   And, yeah, and, yeah.
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:51.460]   You know, they've been talking about flash drives for PC laptops for a long time.
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.460]   And it's just not materializing.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.460]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.860]   And then at the other end of the scale, Loop Rumors is saying that there's going to be
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.260]   a new-- you ready, Leo?
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.260]   Brace yourself.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.260]   Go ahead.
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.260]   Okay.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.260]   New Mac Pro.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.260]   You ready?
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.260]   Damn.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.260]   Damn.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.260]   Damn.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:11.700]   I spent like four grand on this Mac Pro.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.620]   What could they do that's better than what I've got?
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.620]   It'll be smaller, it'll be redesigned according to--
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.620]   I don't care.
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.620]   --eight processors.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:19.940]   And all flash memory.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:20.940]   I can't solve--
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.420]   --and have like a little skillet on the side.
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.060]   Instead of a ski ROM, it'll pop out with a little hot plate.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.060]   That would be cool.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.060]   But I'm looking at my rumors.
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.180]   There's also rumors right now it's running Skype.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.900]   It's doing all sorts of stuff.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.300]   I'm at 5%, 0%, 1% and 6%.
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.860]   I mean, this thing--
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.860]   It cooks.
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.860]   It's not really hard.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:43.500]   Let's see, uptime 10 days, load average 0.66, 0.54 and 0.45.
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.180]   I mean, it's nothing.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.580]   So I don't need eight processors.
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.820]   Yeah, but for somebody like me who's been kind of sitting--
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:50.820]   I do.
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.500]   I've been sitting and waiting because I really--
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.060]   I've gotten to the point where I really could use a little more
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.860]   power just on a desktop machine rather than--
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:56.860]   Definitely get a new Mac Pro.
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.780]   But wait, right, versus--
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:31:59.780]   I'm not going to go to it today.
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:00.780]   No, I agree.
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.780]   So yeah.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.900]   But again, I don't know what they could do to the Mac Pro to make--
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.900]   I mean, the Mac Pro is still, as far as I can tell,
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.500]   state of the art.
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.740]   What else could they do in there?
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.420]   Have we talked about Mactactic before?
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:12.820]   Mactactic.com.
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:13.980]   You know how there's those--
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.660]   I think which is the site?
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:18.460]   Is it Apple Rumors has that great little page to say,
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:19.780]   should I buy this?
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:20.740]   Should I wait?
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:25.460]   Mactactic.com has a really super stripped down approach
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.460]   to this based on life cycle and tasks.
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.540]   Oh, look, they say caution on the Mac Pro.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:29.980]   Maybe replaced.
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.580]   Maybe replaced.
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.580]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.940]   What do they say about the iMac?
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.420]   IMac.
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.220]   Maybe replaced.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.780]   Yeah, that's on the--
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.820]   Gosh, it may be replaced.
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.220]   There's a rumor on the iMac, too, you know.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:43.860]   What's the--
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.260]   Free-- sorry.
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.540]   The rumor on the iMac is they're
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:50.700]   about to come out with a new redesign iMac, too.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.020]   They're saying for each-- for Mac iMac and Mac Mini,
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.660]   they're saying less than two weeks, they're predicting.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:55.180]   Wow.
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.340]   Same thing on all three of these.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.340]   Yeah, caution me.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.500]   But you know what they say about the airport
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.940]   extreme 802.11n?
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.500]   Buy immediately.
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.500]   What?
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.380]   Don't ask.
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.820]   You don't have to worry if you need it.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.220]   Just buy it immediately.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.620]   Click here.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.260]   That's crazy.
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.380]   Fifth generation iPod.
[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.460]   Caution may be replaced.
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.580]   And then these percentages on Mactactic
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:20.380]   are like the chance it's going to be replaced.
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.940]   Yeah, I read a little bit about this.
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:25.820]   I'm not sure exactly what their procedure for this is.
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:26.820]   But I think the way this is Mac--
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:27.340]   This is my mind.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.660]   They're going, dude.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.460]   I'm going to show you 73%.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:30.980]   Yeah.
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:31.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:31.980]   Yeah.
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:32.980]   That's the difference.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.140]   OK, 84% that the Mac Pro is going to be replaced,
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:39.060]   but 93% that the Mini and the iMac are going to be replaced.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.820]   And they say that they think it'll
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.020]   be a month for the Mac Pro, but only less than two weeks
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:43.860]   for the Mini.
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:47.580]   You know, I love my Mini, but it's a core solo.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.180]   No, no.
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.740]   It's a core duo, isn't it?
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:50.240]   Is it?
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:50.860]   What is it?
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.260]   It's not a core two.
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.540]   Well, if you go deep into their site, Leo,
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.380]   they have a calculation algorithm
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.660]   and explains how they do this.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.420]   And it's all based on when you last bought the products.
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:03.420]   Yeah.
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:04.580]   Like the Leo Mac next.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:08.020]   Released estimated time product estimated life when Leo bought it.
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:08.380]   That's--
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.340]   A little picture of you.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:09.820]   Well, that's cool.
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.180]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:11.540]   That's good.
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:14.780]   No, it's as good as anything else.
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:16.700]   I would love it if Travis was secretly
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.620]   peering over the ledge at the Apple Store
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.860]   and watching as you walk out with a large box,
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.180]   and he pulls a big lever.
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.660]   He can't.
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.460]   Computers come out of the ceiling.
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.060]   That's--
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.740]   Did you guys notice that when Leo was
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.980]   leaving the Mac store with his new laptop,
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:33.900]   they were all snickering?
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:34.700]   I like that.
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:35.060]   You know what?
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.500]   I'm really glad I bought that 17.
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.260]   You can't travel with it.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.300]   The MacBook Pro.
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.740]   But it is--
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:41.300]   You should supply first class all the time.
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.300]   Yeah.
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.340]   You can buy MacBook Pros every time I buy a ticket.
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.460]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.140]   So they say the MacBooks, the PowerBooks,
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.780]   or whatever they call them, the laptops are still good values.
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.780]   They're not going to be replaced real soon.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.860]   Well, thank goodness, I'm going to keep my move.
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.140]   I was thinking of throwing it out the door.
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.900]   What happened to the Valentine's Day iPod thing?
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.620]   I thought for sure that Steve would be listening to us.
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.300]   And yeah, some reason.
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.620]   I think he just said, well, if they're saying that,
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.340]   we're not going to do it.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.180]   Just forget the whole thing.
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.060]   I want to know.
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.140]   I want the--
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:15.620]   I really want that.
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.020]   Do you think they're going to wait till the iPhone comes out
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:22.460]   before they release a wide screen iPod, touchscreen iPod?
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.500]   I hope not.
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.700]   Chris Green says, no.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.700]   He thinks it'll be just before the iPhone.
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:28.200]   Huh.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.500]   No, they wouldn't do it so close, though.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:29.860]   Would they?
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:30.340]   Because then--
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.620]   He says, like, maybe like a month before he thinks they
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:35.460]   might come out with a similarly-semituated--
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.500]   Of course, I'm notoriously bad at predicting
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.140]   what Steve's going to do.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.980]   He baffles me.
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:44.140]   Well, and I think they still have a lot of development.
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:47.740]   We have to remember that at Macworld, some of the applications
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.900]   were just JPEGs.
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:53.460]   So it's not even like they can just release it whenever
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.100]   they feel like it.
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.340]   They still have a lot of work to get to get working,
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.420]   even without the singular stuff.
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.620]   I think there's going to be features on the iPhone
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.460]   that they're waiting on to put in the iPod.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.260]   And I think we're all going to be surprised at what
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:09.580]   the actual shipping iPhone actually contains.
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:13.140]   Is this speculation or based on something you know?
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.420]   You know, you guys just--
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.180]   you keep pushing, you keep probing.
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:16.940]   I'm trying to give you--
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.060]   You put it out there, Scott.
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:18.540]   We got it.
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.140]   We got it.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.780]   We're-- we're-- we're Apple journalists.
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.660]   We've got it.
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.220]   We've got it really.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.420]   I can't even say what.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.940]   That's a big word.
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.780]   Big deal by a cup of coffee at any time.
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:30.220]   Oh, come on, Scott.
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:33.180]   We need a new jingle, Merlin.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:33.700]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.620]   Stonewall.
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:36.940]   OK, let's just do this.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.340]   Let's just think back in time.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.780]   Remember when the Mac was--
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.980]   we were told it was going to have an XYZ processor.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:46.980]   And then yet it shipped with a faster processor, yes?
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.340]   Remember that phone?
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.180]   No, the Macbook Pro.
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:50.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.500]   So you think a better processor?
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.500]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:53.700]   No, no, no.
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.780]   Steve never did say what processor was in there.
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:57.780]   He never said anything.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:58.900]   Exactly.
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.100]   Although I can pretty much tell you
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.780]   there's at least three arm processors in there.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:02.620]   You didn't hear that from me.
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:03.980]   We know it was an arm processor.
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.660]   No, no, I think it's generally conceded
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:06.700]   that it's an arm processor.
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.260]   And the thinking was, at the time,
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.780]   well, he didn't want to hurt his-- the feeling--
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:14.060]   Intel's feelings by mentioning somebody else's processor.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:19.060]   But maybe he didn't mention it because that's in flux.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:19.820]   Well, I'll keep saying--
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.140]   It's historically he's been so worried about people's feelings.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.540]   He's going to see the homework.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.020]   Yeah.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.740]   There's probably going to be stuff in there
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.100]   that you find surprising.
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.700]   The specs are probably going to be just slightly better
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.020]   than promised.
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:33.700]   There's things to be waiting for.
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.380]   I'm inventing a new phrase called phone teas.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:37.740]   And that's what you are.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.140]   You're a phone teas.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.580]   Well, you know, I've been pretty accurate in all my phone
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.020]   things for a long time.
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.700]   And you guys just dissed me, you know?
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.020]   So just pay attention.
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.220]   Sig-born.
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.220]   We're going to call him Sig-be.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:57.700]   Come on.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.460]   And we all just kind of laugh into silence.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.700]   Yeah, because we're waiting for Scott to say something.
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:02.220]   I got waiting.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:02.740]   I got nothing.
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:03.900]   I got nothing.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:04.380]   Nothing.
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:04.900]   I got nothing.
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.140]   I'm downloading the Mac tactic dashboard widget
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.260]   because I'm never again going to buy something just
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:11.300]   before it comes out.
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:11.660]   This is--
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.660]   See what the other is?
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.340]   Nothing will come out because they're all watching you.
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.580]   And you're watching them.
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:17.980]   You're going to create a feedback loop.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:18.980]   And then--
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.740]   It's the funny-- I have to say it's the funniest dashboard
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:22.020]   widget.
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:22.940]   Have you seen it?
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.460]   It just is a graph.
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.220]   And you pick which device you choose a model to monitor.
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:29.900]   So I'm going to put Mac Pro on there.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.820]   And it's just a graph that says, you know,
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.420]   yellow bar all the way to the right caution.
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.140]   Maybe replaced.
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.420]   And it just sits on your desktop kind of telling you, don't buy it.
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:37.900]   Don't buy it.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.300]   As long as we're on this, though, I
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.460]   should mention the one that I've been looking at for years,
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:45.020]   which is buyer's guide, one word.macrumors.com.
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.420]   And this is kind of the more this one's been around forever.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.940]   And they actually link to the stories.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:52.380]   They have a whole index that they use.
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.900]   And they link to the stories that partly kind of feed why.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.140]   They're saying what they're saying.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:01.060]   I have to say, are you impressed with any of these rumor
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.100]   sites' accuracy?
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.300]   No.
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.340]   None of them are as good as Scott Born.
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:06.700]   No.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.060]   That's true.
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:09.460]   But it's--
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:13.220]   But some of them are as good as Kevin Rose for that matter.
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.100]   That's the nature of this stuff, though.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:19.460]   Nobody will very seldom does anyone go back and check and go,
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.100]   wow, that was really, really--
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.020]   I mean, people have done it.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.380]   And we've talked about it before.
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.780]   It's even very funny when they do.
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.700]   But this kind of dig culture, where people will just follow
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.300]   this stuff and we're feeding it.
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.700]   He talked about Steve Jobs and his sensitivity.
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.900]   Did you see what he said about teachers and the teachers'
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:36.780]   unions?
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.900]   Yes, that was ugly but accurate.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.900]   Ah, OK.
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.780]   I'll let you go out on that limb there.
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.420]   The problem is is that--
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.380]   So Steve--
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:51.020]   Yeah, somebody should say what did Steve say?
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.620]   Steve basically said that the schools aren't
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.380]   going to improve until--
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.860]   just the whole thing was schools aren't
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.180]   going to improve until principals have the power
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.420]   to fire bad teachers, which they have.
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.820]   And they've always had a degree.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:02.900]   He says some degree.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:03.900]   It's pretty--
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.380]   Now Michael Dell was sitting on the stage.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.820]   And I have to say, Michael Dell jumped to the defense
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.380]   of unions saying--
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.020]   Of course.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:14.660]   He's saying the reason there are unions--
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.860]   I'll quote him-- the employer was treating his employees
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.380]   unfairly.
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.700]   That was not good.
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.420]   He says, so now you have these enterprises,
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.060]   where they take good care of the people.
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:22.820]   The employees won.
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.140]   They do really well and succeed.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:27.300]   He didn't say get rid of unions, as Jobs did.
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.540]   Yeah, I don't think that--
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.540]   and I don't know if Jobs really said to get rid of unions.
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.740]   And I'm not saying that they should get rid of all unions
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:33.940]   and so on and so forth.
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:39.780]   But I will say that there is a huge lack of competition
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:41.700]   among the skills area.
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.740]   Well, let me quote Jobs exactly.
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:47.340]   Quote, "I believe that what is wrong with our schools
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.140]   in this nation is that they have become
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.860]   unionized in the worst possible way.
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.900]   This unionization and lifetime employment of K through 12 teachers
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:59.220]   is off the charts crazy."
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.580]   Steve, this is an off the cuff from Mark from Steve
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:06.460]   that I'm sure he bitterly regrets now because that's bogus.
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.460]   Do you know anybody who's a teacher?
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.740]   That's about the last person in the ridiculous chain
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.780]   that is American education that I would blame for him right now.
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.060]   Absolutely.
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.260]   They were called their irresponsible thing to say.
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:17.780]   It is.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:19.300]   I agree with you 100%.
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:24.500]   That brings to mind my question is this all because Mr. Jobs
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.660]   is in the middle of fighting some union battle with that?
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.620]   That's what I got to think.
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:34.300]   Either that or he's in the PTA in the Woodside Elementary
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.060]   schools and his pifs that some teacher.
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:38.820]   No, it's not.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.260]   He's frustrated that the single most dependable market
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:43.020]   that they dropped the ball on years ago
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:47.180]   continues to grow in PC usage, if I understand correctly.
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.260]   It's like it's one of the places where Apple is having
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.020]   the least traction where they used to have
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.220]   any huge amount of traction.
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.020]   He does make one good point, which I agree with,
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:58.060]   which is that he says no amount of technology in the classroom
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:59.620]   is going to improve public schools.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:01.940]   He then says until principals could fire teachers.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.820]   But I agree with him that technology is not the solution
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:07.140]   in the classroom at this point.
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:10.460]   And I'm actually surprised to hear a technology CEO say that.
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:14.260]   Yeah, but I mean, I've talked to an administrator
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.820]   in Palo Alto that had direct contact with Steve
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.140]   related to this stuff.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.180]   And at least his side of the story
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:27.620]   is that Steve definitely thinks that schools are completely
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:28.580]   what?
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:29.420]   Well, he dropped out.
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.260]   When it comes to using technology.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.500]   He dropped out of college.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.860]   Jobs told the crowd about his vision for--
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:38.100]   Steve, textbook free schools in the future.
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.980]   Textbooks would be replaced with free online information
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:43.900]   source that was constantly updated by experts,
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.580]   much like Wikipedia.
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.500]   It'll be interesting to see whether he's saying that
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.340]   wishfully or whether he's saying that with a plan.
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.220]   I tell you what his wish is right now that he'd never said
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:52.740]   any of that.
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.140]   And it would all just go away real quick,
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.500]   because I can tell you right now that was not politic.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:59.540]   If nothing else, agree with him or not.
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.740]   You could kiss the education market goodbye, frankly.
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.020]   Well, the teachers aren't buying.
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.220]   They don't buy the computers.
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.180]   It's the administration that buys the computers.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:07.900]   So it's not--
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.740]   The principles are buying them either.
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:09.740]   What?
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:10.240]   What's happening?
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.580]   No, but for the administration.
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.140]   Yeah, the people who--
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.220]   It's about the principles?
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:14.720]   Wow.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.220]   That's not the principles.
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.740]   It's a principle in my school, but it certainly signs up.
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:19.740]   It's on what size it is.
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:20.500]   Right.
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.820]   Leo, we had something--
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.300]   I don't know if you've been in on this-- something
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.300]   we've done in the past.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.460]   We occasionally would do something
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:26.780]   that we started to call Mac Wine.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:27.780]   Have we done that for you?
[00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:28.620]   No, I have a wine gift.
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.460]   We like to come out and you kind of--
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.100]   What's in your crawl about apples and Macs?
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.780]   That's one thing we haven't done in a while.
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:37.500]   If you're up for it.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.020]   Sure.
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:38.540]   Go ahead.
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.700]   Who's got a wine?
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:41.820]   Merlin said he had a wine.
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:42.140]   You were a wine--
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.300]   Oh, I did?
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.660]   Oh, as long as you're asking.
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:50.660]   I want to know what the hell is up with snoozing events
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:51.380]   in iCal.
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.780]   And I want to know what kind of crazy monkey machine
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:56.380]   is coming up with the choices that I get when
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:57.580]   I want to snooze something.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:59.540]   Have you guys-- do you guys all use iCal, right?
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.380]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:00.740]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:01.980]   And you get a notification.
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.060]   Yeah, I always dismiss them, though.
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:03.700]   I never snooze.
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.300]   What happens when you snooze?
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.700]   That's a very good question, Leo.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:08.180]   Because as far as I can tell, there's
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.860]   a big costly wheel inside of my computer that spins.
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:14.020]   And then it gives me a bunch of completely nonsensical
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.660]   choices for how long--
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.980]   so you get choices like, snooze it for 15 minutes
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:20.500]   or snooze it for one day.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.060]   And then you get sometimes you can snooze until one hour
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:23.660]   before.
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.020]   And sometimes-- and it's completely different every time.
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.540]   And I have no idea where the algorithm comes from.
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:29.860]   And it's completely baffling.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:32.900]   And as somebody who has lost a lot of the frontal part
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:36.380]   of their brain to a variety of things,
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.260]   I need these alarms.
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:39.620]   And I sometimes want to snooze them.
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:40.940]   And it makes me crazy.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:42.180]   It makes me completely crazy.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.820]   Even entourage does this better.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.860]   Even entourage.
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:46.980]   And that's my mac one.
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.940]   Well, I'm going to-- I'm setting up an alarm right now.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.180]   And in one minute, I'm going to see if I can snooze it.
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:53.980]   I've never snoozed.
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:54.620]   Well, while we're on this--
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.300]   You don't know what's just snooze,
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:56.100]   but it won't make sense.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.580]   While we're on this subject, I have a similar complaint, Merlin.
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:00.220]   Yeah?
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.900]   My complaint is that it won't let you
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:06.780]   possess from I-count.
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.140]   I think you should be able to possess your appointments.
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.980]   You know how much money we've made off
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.780]   pizzizz?
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:17.300]   You mean for four pizzizz or off of pizzizz?
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.940]   Both.
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:19.980]   I'm not kidding.
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:21.300]   Because we do a coupon code.
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.660]   And please people use that coupon code.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:24.460]   When you order pizzizz, you'll get 20% off.
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:25.860]   I've been leaving money on the table.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.940]   It's 25% off.
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.660]   You use a coupon code TWIT, TWIT.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.700]   And then we get 25% as I don't know what it is.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:33.780]   Finders fee.
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:35.220]   And it's been thousands of dollars.
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:35.820]   We have sold--
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.700]   You are sleeping your way to success.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.420]   It means that we've sold hundreds of copies of pizzizz.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:46.740]   So please keep mentioning pizzizz anytime you get a chance.
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.140]   Maybe we should get a pizz--
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:51.620]   Should we get some like pizzizz music as well?
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:52.620]   Napping.
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.940]   Napping.
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:54.860]   Time to buy pizzizz.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.860]   Please buy pizzizz now.
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.860]   Maybe that's what the didgeridoo could be for.
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:01.860]   Yeah.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:04.860]   Every time you hear that, it's a sound to go on by pizzizz.
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:09.860]   You know it's a good time to set aside time to go to sleep and buy pizzizz.
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:10.860]   Oh.
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.860]   Buy pizzizz.
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.860]   Use the barcode TWIT.
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.860]   You will awake refreshed, feeling better.
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.860]   And now it's time for the rattle.
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:22.860]   That's fantastic.
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:27.860]   I'm running that in all the pie guests from now on the new--
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:28.860]   That's great.
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:32.860]   People fell asleep on the car on the road, all sorts of stuff.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:33.860]   That's great.
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.860]   Am I the only one that's got a wine?
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:37.860]   I always have wine.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:38.860]   Scott, why?
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:39.860]   You know what you guys are?
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:40.860]   You're fanboys.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:41.860]   You're fanboys.
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:42.860]   I'm not.
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:43.860]   I got a wine.
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:44.860]   What's a wine?
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:45.860]   Give me a wine.
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:46.860]   Ready for a wine?
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:47.860]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:50.860]   So this is more of a-- I haven't been able to figure out why this happens.
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:57.860]   But ever since I got my Macbook Pro, when I shut it and it's unplugged, it only really
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:58.860]   turns off.
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:03.860]   It only really stops pulling off the battery about 80% of the time.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:05.860]   So 20% of the time I opened it up.
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.860]   It was a full battery the night before.
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.860]   I opened it up and it's dead.
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:13.860]   And this has been one of those things that I've been kind of going around.
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:17.860]   I'm going to call it a wine because I've been doing some research and I haven't successfully
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:19.860]   found an answer.
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.860]   I thought it went away and then it started up again.
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.860]   It seems to be that if anything is running, there are certain apps.
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:31.420]   If QuickTime is playing any kind of little video, if iTunes thinks it's playing something,
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:34.460]   if anything's going on like that, it doesn't actually shut off.
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:36.180]   It does something that looks close to shutting off.
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:42.020]   It flashes the little light, but it doesn't actually turn off.
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.860]   And if you have it in a bag, it gets really hot.
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:45.860]   It's really hot.
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:46.860]   Yeah, I had that happen once.
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:47.860]   I had that happen and it's scary.
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:51.860]   It starts to make me think that's what was causing all those batteries catching fire.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:56.380]   You never heard of someone like using their computer on their lap and it caught fire.
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.220]   It's usually in their bag and I started thinking that it's just not going to sleep.
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:02.740]   It's getting really, really hot and it's lighting up fire, mostly because I've had it happen
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:07.500]   a couple of times where the fans are going full till, it's closed and it was supposed
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.460]   to be sleepy and it's not sleepy.
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.340]   I got a wine.
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:16.380]   I chat is rapidly becoming the Windows calculator of the Mac world.
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:22.060]   You know, Windows has had the same calculator basically since 1995, right?
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.060]   They don't seem to, for instance, the video, it should work better, right?
[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:29.780]   It's just a primitive application that just feels like they're not doing anything with
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:30.780]   it.
[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.220]   Is there a reason you're not on the Addium?
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:34.220]   I use Addium.
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:37.580]   See, that's why it's not much of a wine because it's like, well, okay.
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:38.580]   So I use Addium.
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:43.460]   Yeah, but Addium doesn't have the Addium and Addium doesn't have the video capability,
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:44.460]   but I don't use that.
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:45.460]   I use Skype for the video.
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:50.060]   Yeah, you do invisible on Addium because you can do invisible with Skype, but you can't
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.060]   do invisible with I chat.
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.060]   You can do the block thing.
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:56.660]   Oh, you mean like I just want to be able to see who's online, but the thing is what normally
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.860]   happens with me is you'll see me like pop up for less than 30 seconds.
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:01.700]   Just checking and then you get out of there before they say.
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:05.980]   I'm looking for somebody and then if I wait there for a minute, there'll be like six people
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:09.180]   going, hey, hey, hey, hey, and I don't want them to say.
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:11.580]   They have an invisible status on Addium.
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:13.820]   Because they don't have it on I chat.
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:14.820]   That's a wine for me.
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.020]   I set my status to invisible.
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:20.420]   I'm going to start having to use that now that Leo's given out my special name that
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:22.420]   no one wants to know.
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:26.700]   I've gotten five requests on Skype since we started this call.
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.340]   I don't know any of these people.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.500]   People do the same thing to me.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.020]   Merlin, that's the price of fame.
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.020]   It's just your.
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.020]   I'm not famous.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:34.820]   Oh, Merlin, you know what, Leo?
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.540]   I'm so proud of you.
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.140]   I, I, I, I, you're the star of this show.
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:44.740]   In fact, somebody just posted that on the forums that you should be in every Twitch show.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.740]   Oh, that's, that'd be great.
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:47.740]   They love you.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:49.460]   Well, you were great on Twitter.
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:50.460]   We had them on Twitter.
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:51.460]   They did a great job.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:54.100]   I mean, they, they just, they just, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:58.300]   whatever that mystery product, project you're working on is, I think you're going to, you'll
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.100]   be very well received.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.540]   We're having buttons made, Merlin.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:04.300]   It's a more man.
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.300]   Man power.
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.060]   This is more man.
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:08.060]   Awkward.
[00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:09.060]   Very awkward.
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.060]   But no, we're a date.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.060]   It's your word.
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:12.060]   It's your word.
[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:13.060]   We just live in it.
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.060]   That's not.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.060]   That's not.
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.060]   That's not.
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.060]   It's man-a-word.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.060]   It's time for the man-tip.
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.060]   That's not.
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:21.060]   That's not.
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.740]   No, not calling them in.
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:27.060]   You probably heard every joke having had that name since birth.
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:33.740]   Oh man, it's, it makes you very, um, high school must have been extremely painful.
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:34.980]   It I had, I have a weird name.
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:38.780]   I have a very weird name and to be like, it's a name you would make up.
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:39.780]   It's a nice name to have in your 30s.
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:42.660]   Don't you think Scott, it would be like a DJ name?
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:43.660]   Yeah.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:46.420]   It's the first question in my FAQs because everybody's like, there's no way that has
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:47.420]   totally your name.
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:48.420]   You've got to have your name something else.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.180]   Why did your past name do Merlin?
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.060]   Uh, because my dad was named that Alex and my grandfather.
[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:54.060]   That's neat.
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.060]   I'm the third.
[00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:56.060]   I'm Merlin B. and the third.
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:59.020]   I once kind of, that's pretty embarrassing Alex, but I once did the same thing to Matt
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:00.020]   Groening.
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:03.860]   And I said, Homer Simpson, that's just a stupid name.
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.820]   He said, yeah, that was the father's name.
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:06.820]   So pretty much.
[00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.620]   It's a stupid name too.
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:10.620]   That's my mom.
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.940]   I pretty much know how you feel right now.
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:15.540]   Well, I know that's everybody.
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:17.940]   But Bart is named after his, uh, his friend.
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.420]   Yeah, it's kind of neat, really.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.140]   Well, I mean, you got to get it.
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:26.220]   There was one of the people that we work with, I guess her roommate is named Haya because
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.900]   her parents decided that she was going to let her name.
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:33.660]   So the first thing that she said was her name and she said Haya Haya.
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:34.660]   Haya.
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:35.660]   Haya.
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:36.660]   So now her name is Haya.
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.420]   But wait a minute, they didn't name her till she was two.
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:41.460]   I guess they changed her name or so they decided they had like an interim name.
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:43.500]   I have so many problems with that anecdote.
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:44.500]   I don't even know.
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.740]   You better run to her.
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:48.580]   I have problems with the credibility of that.
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:52.020]   I have I have I have I have problems with the whole concept of that.
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:53.220]   It's very troubling to me.
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:57.420]   I named child like what we said.
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:59.340]   And he says something.
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:01.980]   My daughter's first word was Baba.
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:02.980]   There you go.
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.460]   My son's first word.
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.060]   My son's word was duck.
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:08.060]   Well, we think it was duck.
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:14.900]   Hi, I'm I'm here with my with my son and daughter Baba and duck.
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:15.900]   Over there, my niece.
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:16.900]   Haya.
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:21.340]   I had I had a friend who was acquainted with some family and everyone in the family was
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:31.140]   named after the emotion that the mother felt during conception.
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:33.100]   So one of them was named Ravage.
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:35.460]   Oh, my hand to God.
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:39.900]   So we decided to name you what your mommy felt when daddy was all sweaty on top of her.
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:41.820]   That's how they were all.
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:42.820]   Ravage.
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:43.820]   That was a kid's name.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:44.820]   Some of the other ones just out of curiosity.
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:45.820]   I don't know.
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:49.460]   I think one of them one of them might have been disappointed and exhausted.
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:54.980]   Then there's just you get in this house increasingly impatient and her brother.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.900]   I wonder what's on TV.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.460]   Could you not yet?
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:00.820]   Yeah, our youngest son.
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.820]   Could you just finish?
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:05.820]   All right.
[00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:07.580]   Fix and post.
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:10.060]   There's no post that could fix this.
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:11.060]   Believe you.
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.060]   Why do I do that?
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:13.060]   No, I love that.
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:14.060]   Merlin.
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:15.060]   Merlin, that's I'm not kidding.
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.060]   The best part of the show.
[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:19.060]   I was never filled with conversation or I did this.
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:20.540]   I just so flowing.
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:21.540]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:22.540]   Wait a year.
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:25.260]   You're on high def television and you can look back.
[00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:26.500]   I look at catchers in it.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.340]   I look at catchers in it with a wig.
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:29.900]   How's that second one, Leo?
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:30.900]   How's the lamb?
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:31.900]   It should be.
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:37.700]   They're putting it in right now and we're going to do rehearsals and it's you know, they're
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:39.780]   building a whole studio and everything from scratch.
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:43.740]   So it's going to take a few more weeks, but there were rehearsals March 13th and our first
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:49.660]   week of shooting, we just figured out because we had to make room for GMT and our big seminar
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.380]   is going to be March 20th.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:55.020]   Can we talk about our seminar?
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:56.020]   Seminar, mr.
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.020]   Is that secret yet?
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:00.140]   No, it's not yet tomorrow just in time for the press release.
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:03.180]   Yes, we talked about it a little bit less week, but then we didn't put the ending up yet.
[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:04.180]   So it's actually available.
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.180]   You can sign up for it.
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:08.100]   It's said if you go to Pixelcore on the main page, you'll see down the little bottom part.
[00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:10.100]   You see a little podcast seminar.
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:12.380]   So tell us about it.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:13.380]   What is it?
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:21.900]   March 28th through the 30th in it's well, we're all we're Scott and Leo that he's here
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:24.060]   on the show, you know, and myself.
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:27.580]   And then I think actually Brent and I is coming up to talk about camera work and a little
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:29.140]   bit of light is amazing.
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:30.140]   Love.
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:32.380]   Take the seminar for that alone.
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:33.380]   I know.
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:35.260]   So Brent, Brent emailed me and said, would you like to?
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:38.180]   Are you interested in having me come up and talk a little bit about camera stuff?
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.500]   And I was like, oh, yeah, yeah, that would be great.
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.100]   So good in that world.
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:43.780]   Oh, he's amazing.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:46.060]   So so Brent's going to come up and talk a little bit.
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:50.300]   But otherwise, it's really a seminar about I mean, it's three days.
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:54.340]   And one thing that we've been getting some questions about is are the how do I choose
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:55.340]   a track?
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:58.340]   It's just one big track because I don't like doing multiple tracks.
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:01.380]   Because then you feel bad because you couldn't take that because you were taking this.
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:02.380]   Right.
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.740]   And so it's just one big thing that starts off.
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:06.180]   We're going to start off talking about audio and then we're going to do video and then
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:09.780]   we're going to do and then we're going to talk about kind of show design kind of stuff.
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:15.220]   And so so that, you know, it's really a matter of getting people over a lot of us know little
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:16.220]   pieces of it.
[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:18.740]   So we know a little bit about audio and a little bit about video.
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:22.060]   This is about gluing it all together, pushing out, you know, filling in a whole bunch of
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:26.380]   holes for people, getting them over the hump of understanding how, you know, like for instance,
[00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:27.700]   how I'm multiple to camera it.
[00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:29.540]   You know, when I told Leo, I was, you know, I got all excited.
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:31.100]   I said, you know, I'm a pro has multi cam.
[00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:33.940]   I'll just do a multi cam for put and Leo said, great.
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:37.500]   And then literally on the way home, I was thinking, you know, I better figure out how
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:41.980]   to actually, you know, do it.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:44.940]   And you know, we finished it like it was like in the morning, but this is like a year and
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:45.940]   a half ago.
[00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:50.140]   The best thing about this is, yeah, it's the accumulated knowledge of people who have
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:54.900]   been doing this now for a year and a half and all the pain and suffering that we've
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:59.540]   been through, we can skip, you can skip it because we'll tell you what worked and what
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:00.780]   didn't work.
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.660]   And this is not, this is not stuff about, we think this is not like a classroom exercise
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:07.980]   where we think this will work or it works, it works well in our head.
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:12.100]   This is really us doing a real dump of what we've figured out so far.
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:14.660]   I think you should put that in the ad.
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:16.580]   This is us doing a real dump.
[00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:19.580]   And I think that'll really sell it.
[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:23.140]   Watch Alex Scott and Leo do a really dump.
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:27.700]   Maybe the first one we got to participate.
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:28.700]   You could be poor guys.
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.580]   Would you like to come dump with us?
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.580]   Guys break it up.
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:33.580]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.500]   Boy, that's, yeah, no, that sounds awesome.
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.580]   I have, you know, how much is this going to cost?
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:41.500]   It's a it's two ninety nine that we'll put, we'll probably put up a little, not two dollars
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:42.700]   ninety nine cents.
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:47.420]   Yeah, not two hundred ninety nine for three and and the stuff and it's it's it is, it
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:50.140]   is one of those things that you want to get, you're going to want to get a lot of rest.
[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:53.140]   It is a, you know, bleeding through the years kind of.
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:56.940]   Oh, God, Alex, I got to really work with you on this.
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:57.940]   Okay.
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:01.500]   So we're going to bleed while you guys take a dump and talk about.
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:03.340]   Oh, this is just awful.
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:06.740]   No, it's everything you ever wanted to know.
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:07.740]   You will learn a lot.
[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:08.740]   My car.
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:12.300]   It will be entertaining, but you will you will go home saying, I now know what I need to
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:14.940]   know to do my audio or video show.
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:17.460]   And we're going to do some shows.
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:18.460]   We are.
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:19.460]   Yeah, we're going to do live.
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:24.500]   So on Wednesday and then Leo, we're going to have you as a special guest for the first
[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:25.780]   time ever on ILS.
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:26.940]   I would love to.
[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:27.940]   That's great.
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:28.940]   Okay.
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:32.100]   And then and then we'll be doing, we'll shoot an episode of Mac break on Thursday.
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:33.380]   So we'll the green screen out.
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:34.660]   We're going to bring the nine fifty out.
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:35.660]   We're going to.
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:36.660]   Oh, that'll be fun.
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:37.660]   Hi, dad.
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:38.660]   Yeah, it's going to.
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:41.700]   So we're going to shoot a, you know, a full episode like that so people can actually
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:44.500]   see what what it takes to do that.
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:46.900]   And then we're hoping to drag the Twitters, the Twitters.
[00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:47.900]   You bet.
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:48.900]   Down for Friday nights.
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:49.900]   So they'll be.
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:50.900]   Afternoon.
[00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:53.380]   So, so it should be, it should be pretty fun.
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:56.180]   And Scott yields, be your first time on Twitter.
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:57.580]   No, actually I was on the D.
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.580]   Oh, that's right.
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:57:59.580]   That's right.
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:03.060]   The podcast and portable media expo where Martin made fun of us being the so called
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:05.260]   the new media guys, all of us gray hairs.
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:07.220]   Yeah, the old old parts who were.
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:08.220]   New in media.
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:10.580]   Hey, love new media.
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:14.180]   So so you actually see a lot of stuff actually happening as well.
[00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:18.020]   So we'll build you up towards, you know, each piece and then show you, you know, how
[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:23.740]   it all kind of comes together March 20, 29 30th and Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:26.140]   then you have the weekend to hang out in San Francisco.
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:27.340]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:28.340]   200 bucks, 299.
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.340]   I'm sorry, 299.
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:34.540]   Yeah, and 300 bucks and pixel core.com to sign up.
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:36.420]   And how much room do you have?
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:37.740]   It's not going to be that big couple hundred.
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:40.140]   Only 160 160 is the talk.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.140]   Yeah.
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:44.180]   Don't put it off because get your boss.
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:48.220]   I don't have him listen to this podcast.
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:49.420]   Write something up.
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:50.900]   Don't mention bleeding.
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:51.900]   Don't mention dumping.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:54.100]   Just, you know, I don't say any of that on the web page.
[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:55.100]   Okay.
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:56.100]   Yeah, show the bus the web page.
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:57.100]   I was going to have it.
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:59:00.300]   I was going to put some up there with a good graphic, but I thought it might be a bad idea.
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:05.180]   Hey, before we go, one story just broke on the wire and I love to get your comments.
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:11.580]   XM and Sirius have announced a merger after I don't know how that has to do with a Mac,
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:12.580]   but I'm very excited about it.
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:13.580]   I'm really excited.
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:14.580]   I think we should talk about it.
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:15.580]   They're all coming together.
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:17.180]   It's a $13 billion merger.
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:21.100]   I think it had to happen because neither one of them, they were killing each other and
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:23.100]   there really isn't room for two satellite networks.
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:24.100]   It's like trench warfare.
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:26.820]   I mean, they're both losing boatloads of money every day, right?
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:27.820]   Yeah.
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:30.020]   Big question is whether it can get through regulation.
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:31.020]   Yeah.
[00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:32.020]   Yeah.
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:34.300]   This has not been approved by the regulators and that's not going to be easy.
[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:35.300]   Interesting.
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:39.100]   Mel Carmisen, who's the CEO at Sirius, will become CEO of the combined company.
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:42.300]   XM's chairman, Gary Parsons, becomes the chairman.
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:47.380]   The board of directors will be made up of Parsons, Carmisen and four independent directors designated
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:48.900]   by each.
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:50.380]   No closing dates been announced.
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:55.420]   One of the things that makes us of interest to me is I think we're close to getting the
[00:59:55.420 --> 01:00:00.500]   radio show, my radio show on XM and I don't know what will happen as a result of this.
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:04.220]   One of the reasons we can do that is because Clear Channel was an early investor in XM
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:11.340]   and has several stations on XM that they control, but that may change with a merger.
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.180]   Anyway, very interesting.
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.180]   I think a big story.
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.180]   It's cool.
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:20.700]   I didn't really have any, you know, I didn't use XM at all until I was running some car
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:24.060]   and happened to have XM built in and it was awesome.
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:25.220]   It was just awesome.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:30.700]   I just, yeah, I'm less than one of the series and you know, their technology is very different.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.700]   They have different satellites.
[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:35.220]   So I'm not sure exactly how this merger works.
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.300]   For, is this going to work with the hardware?
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:41.340]   I have a, like I have an XM radio built into my car.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:43.580]   It's part of my Alpine system.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.300]   So what's that going to mean?
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.220]   Well, it probably means you get a bit of both, I guess.
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:49.220]   I don't know.
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:52.700]   And it may be, well, I suspect at least for a while because they have, you know, that's
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:54.180]   a big investment, those satellites.
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:59.020]   They'll will continue to be XM and Sirius, but it'll be one company that owns it.
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:01.980]   Do they actually own each satellite or they just bounce it out of the satellites?
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:02.980]   Oh, they launched them.
[01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:03.980]   No, they launched them.
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:04.980]   Okay.
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:05.980]   They're all their own satellites.
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:06.980]   XM launched two satellites, Rock and Roll.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:07.980]   Okay.
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:11.420]   XM was delayed by a year, remember, because of technical difficulties, but they finally
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:16.100]   got their own, their own, their satellites, which means they're tied to that technology
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.180]   and that chipset.
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:21.220]   So I imagine it means they'll still be, and they sound very different, by the way.
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.540]   I like XM sound much better than Sirius.
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:26.220]   Plus they might just, the program might work across.
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:27.740]   So they, the XM's app, free.
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:28.740]   Sirius is not.
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:29.740]   Hmm.
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:32.860]   That, that might, that might be harder than it sounds to make that work.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:34.580]   And, and, and the regulatory issue is big.
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:38.260]   Although the, the case is made, I think it's a very good case where you say, well, there's
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.380]   no, then there's no competition in the satellite market, but that's not the competition.
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:45.140]   The competition is with radio and there's plenty of competition there.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:48.660]   Radio HD podcasts.
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:52.500]   There's, you know, the new media competition alone is enough to justify the merger.
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.500]   I agree.
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.500]   Oh, one more.
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.260]   We, we, we, we, we, we, do we want to do it?
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:58.100]   The wines take the place of software picks?
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.900]   No, we still need to do picks.
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:00.900]   All right.
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.980]   I'll start because I'm excited about it.
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.980]   Uh, juiced for the man.
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:06.740]   Oh, you stole mine.
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:07.740]   Ha ha.
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:08.940]   Now I started to find another one.
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.740]   That's where I started.
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:12.300]   Juiced for the new Leola Port.
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.300]   All right.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:14.300]   Well, I'll find another one.
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:15.300]   I can do it.
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:16.300]   No, no, no, that's fine.
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.300]   That's fine.
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.300]   Go ahead.
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:19.300]   Go ahead.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.300]   I'll find another one.
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.300]   We'll do a joint one.
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.300]   You and me together.
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:23.300]   Now it's kind of a tease to do it because no one has invite.
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.300]   You, you have the beta and I have the beta because Leo gave me the beta.
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.460]   We never talked about chis on here.
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:30.140]   So maybe could you do like an introduction for us Mac guys who didn't know about it so
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.140]   much before now?
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:35.220]   From the fellers who gave you kazzaa and Skype.
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:37.980]   It's their newest project codenamed the Venice project.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:41.860]   It became juiced J double O ST about a month ago.
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:47.620]   It's full screen interactive IP TV comes over the internet.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:48.980]   Now right now it's in beta.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:53.660]   So they don't have, you know, it's world poker tour, uh, you know, trucks.
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:58.500]   Uh, you know, there's an oddball collection of stuff, including the Canadian MTV much
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.500]   music.
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:05.340]   Um, but they're talking, this is not going to be like, cause I, you know, uh, it's not
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.260]   pirate bay for IP TV.
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:12.220]   This is going to all be legit licensed stuff and they're talking to content providers.
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:16.900]   I would hope and it's not up to me, but I would love to see my show on there, the lab.
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.420]   Um, in fact, I love to see all of tech TV on there.
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.420]   That would be a natural place for it.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:22.420]   There's issues though.
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:26.340]   I mean, you know, for us, uh, we're trying to sell it to terrestrial networks.
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:31.420]   So the, as soon as you go on IP TV, it's like, well, why should we buy it when people can
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:32.700]   watch it for free on the internet?
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:34.460]   So that raises issues.
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:38.140]   But just real, I tell you the thing that makes juiced great and it works very well on
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:39.140]   the Mac.
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:40.140]   Yeah, the performance is amazing.
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:42.140]   Is the interface, it's spectacular.
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:43.140]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:44.580]   The interface is, I'm starting to get used to it.
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:48.780]   I get a little lost in some of the, uh, you know, I get into a channel somewhere and I
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:51.380]   and it took me a little while to figure out how to kind of back my way in and out of it,
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:54.500]   but it's the, it's great because you have this kind of roll over.
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.500]   It rolls over the video.
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.300]   So you're still watching whatever video you're going through and you have this kind of semi
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:03.660]   transparent, uh, heads up display where you can decide what you want to, um, watch next.
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:07.100]   But there's also you can open chat windows and you can open, you know, there's a lot
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:10.140]   of like you can see, you can be chatting with people who are everybody else who's watching
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.140]   that show right now.
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:12.300]   You can be chatting with them.
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:13.980]   It's really TV for the now generation.
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:15.980]   I mean, it really is amazing.
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:19.780]   So I can say it's my day to request went in this weekend.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:21.980]   So I would love to have a look at that.
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:22.980]   Sounds cool.
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:23.980]   Yeah.
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:24.980]   It's pretty cool.
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:27.900]   Your quality is not as high as what you'll get when you do a progressive download.
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:31.340]   I mean, so it's not going to look, I don't think it looks for instance, it's 24 on the
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.500]   iTunes or something like that.
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.500]   It's streaming.
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:34.500]   Yeah, it's streaming.
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.940]   So it's so it's streaming, but that's really designed around live TV.
[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:43.740]   It's it's it's IP TV, which you can't, I mean, I don't think I think of, uh, you know, downloading
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:48.940]   shows from iTunes as IP TV, but it's not technically, technically you want to have use the internet
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:56.020]   as your as your medium, just as you use a cable or the antenna to get the live shows.
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:57.380]   That's what IP TV is technically.
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:00.220]   So it is IP TV, but it's the best way.
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:04.460]   It definitely solves the two places that I think you really want real, you know, streaming
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:08.180]   is really specific to news and sports.
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:09.660]   And you know, I think just about everything else.
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:11.980]   You know, I don't really, I'm not really sure that you really need to get it in real
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:12.980]   time.
[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:15.820]   But, um, but those are the two things that you want live and this would definitely solve
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:16.820]   it.
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:18.940]   It's a very clear to peer network to move the data around.
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:22.660]   So you're watching it and it's bouncing off of a whole bunch of other people that are
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.700]   downloading, not really fast.
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:25.900]   There's not a lot of really fast.
[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:26.900]   Yeah.
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:27.900]   No, it's really fast.
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:28.900]   It's it's pretty.
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:33.860]   I wasn't sure how well it would work on on OS 10 compared to the PC version, but it's
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:34.860]   pretty much the same.
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:35.860]   I would say it's identical.
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:38.540]   Now, by the way, it's only Intel right now.
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:41.260]   And I imagine they're not going to develop it for now.
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:44.260]   It's going to be Intel only.
[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.660]   So that's a that's a shared one.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:47.660]   It's gone.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:49.060]   I am ready.
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:53.900]   I have a new wireless keyboard recommendation.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:06:00.060]   I recently relocated to San Francisco and left my existing wireless keyboard at my house
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:01.060]   in Gig Harbor.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.060]   So I had to buy a new one.
[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:07.140]   I went to the Apple store at fourth in market, across from the Pixelcore office and had a
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:12.740]   recommendation to pick up the LogicTet S530 wireless keyboard that comes with a little
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.420]   mouse to go with it.
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:17.180]   After a hundred bucks and man, does it work good.
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:20.540]   I plugged it in and you do have to give up USB port.
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:21.540]   It's not Bluetooth.
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:22.940]   That's probably my only complaint about it.
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:28.700]   But as far as tracking and speed and recognition and good feel for the keyboard, I have to
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:33.260]   say that the keyboard feels better to me than the Mac wireless keyboard.
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.740]   It has a nice little palm rest on it.
[01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:40.860]   And it comes with a stripped down version of my favorite LogicTet MX mouse.
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:41.860]   This one isn't as fancy.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:45.580]   But it does have the same ergonomic form factor which I like.
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.740]   And it was under a hundred bucks.
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:51.780]   So if you're looking for a wireless keyboard and mouse that is Mac-centric, this LogicTet
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:57.020]   S530 might be the one for you.
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:00.100]   And Merlin Man.
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:06.380]   Well in a previous life, I was a web developer.
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:07.540]   I wasn't very good at it.
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:11.220]   But it's something we all have to take away at one time or another.
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:12.460]   We have the lamp set up.
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:19.300]   Has been good to everybody with the Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, or Perl or what have you.
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:23.340]   There's a neat little, so getting that stuff ships on your Mac.
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:25.060]   It'll app out there.
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.060]   It's not even an app.
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.460]   I should call it a server environment.
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:30.060]   It's called MAMP, M-A-M-P.
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:33.540]   And you install this thing and you drag it into your applications folder.
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:37.500]   And it's an all-in-one server environment for the Mac that you basically launched through
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.140]   this application.
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:41.540]   And so it's kind of cool though because so you launch this thing.
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:43.460]   You don't have to be.
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:50.580]   So this is like Xamp or the Unix-based kind of all-in-one distributions.
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:51.580]   Could be.
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:52.580]   Yeah.
[01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:57.020]   What's neat about this though is, I mean obviously this is for testing like a local kind of testing
[01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:58.020]   server.
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:59.020]   It's not everything on there.
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:00.020]   Right.
[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:02.500]   But here's what's cool about it is you know once you start playing with this stuff, you're
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.860]   going to want to copy something like PHP admin, my admin and all that stuff.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:07.340]   And this has all that big into it.
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:08.340]   It's built in.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:09.340]   Yeah.
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:10.340]   Yeah.
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:11.340]   You go and you just turn this thing on.
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:12.780]   There's a little dashboard widget for turning on and off.
[01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:14.980]   And then you can serve over whatever port you want.
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:18.420]   You can have MySQL and Apache beyond whatever port you want it to be.
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:20.620]   And it's just a nice kind of little fast way.
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:23.060]   You have an HT Docs folder with your earlier HTML stuff.
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:24.340]   Oh, but it's a lot in there.
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:25.340]   You get Zend.
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:26.340]   You get e-accelerator.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:29.820]   It's the kind of thing where if you're not somebody who's not comfortable fiddling around
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:33.700]   with a lot of packages and you just want to be able to go really quickly be able to do
[01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:35.500]   some fast development.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.340]   I think it's a kind of a neat little application.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:42.860]   Apache friends are the people who do XAMPP for Unix.
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:43.860]   And I've used it.
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:46.260]   And it is mind-blowing because it's just done.
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:47.260]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.260]   It's nice.
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:49.820]   And so I'm no bend urban.
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:53.940]   But if I go somewhere and I have no idea how to do MySQL from the command line.
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:56.900]   I'm so used to doing everything in PHP, my admin.
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:57.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:01.460]   And so if you go to mamp.info, they have a free version and they have a pro version.
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:02.780]   The pro version's got a lot of them.
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:03.780]   Go look.
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:07.060]   It's got a lot of dynamic DNS, unlimited virtual hosts, email.
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.060]   So on.
[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:10.660]   So again, this is not for people who are already huge web studs.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:12.340]   This is not going to be any great shakes.
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:15.140]   But somebody does a little bit of a development from time to time.
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:17.540]   It's just a real nice simple, easy, quick wrap up.
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:23.500]   If you've ever tried to install all these applications one after the other on OS 10 with
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:27.580]   all other dependencies, believe me, even if you're a geek, this is a great thing.
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.860]   There's one of these for rails.
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:29.860]   I bet there is.
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:30.860]   That would be great.
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:33.860]   If there's something that had Ruby, Rem's Ruby gem in rails, all in one.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:34.860]   That would be great.
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:37.460]   Did you ever get your Tumba log working?
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:38.460]   Was it Osmo?
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:40.900]   Osmo is just you want to kill it.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:43.660]   It's, you know, again, this is my own fault.
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:45.460]   I'm trying to find a nice thing.
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:46.460]   I did the same thing.
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:48.140]   And it's a server where I got root access to everything.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:51.700]   And it's still like, oh, I want to get Tumba log.
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.260]   I think we should have a Mac break.
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:54.420]   We get Tumba log or a Twitter.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:55.860]   I love Tumba logs.
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:56.860]   We should totally do it.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:57.860]   You know, let's, you know what?
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.060]   This is a word I learned from you.
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:00.060]   Let's crowdsource this.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:03.060]   There's anybody out there who can set us up and get us going on.
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:04.060]   Osmo.
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.060]   Totally server.
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.060]   I've got a great server.
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.460]   And I'm, yeah, we need this gem.
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:10.700]   You just install Ruby gem and gems and it'll, and yeah.
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:11.700]   So Osmo.
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:12.700]   It's Osmo.
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:13.700]   It's the tough one.
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:14.700]   That's the thing that never works.
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:16.540]   I got gems where that's not a problem.
[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:17.540]   Yeah.
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.620]   And if we can not have to use the 3000 port anyway, right hole.
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:22.460]   But yeah, I would love to have that because it would be a great way for us all to contribute
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.460]   stuff and a little.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.780]   So just for people who don't know, what is a Tumba log?
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:26.780]   Logs.
[01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:27.780]   I don't know.
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:30.380]   I think of Tumba logs as being a little bit like web logs for grownups where in the same
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:34.700]   way that something like Twitter, I've described Twitter to friends as being a way messages
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:35.700]   for grownups.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.340]   Yeah, it's way messages without the messaging.
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:42.100]   And so what a Tumba log is it's a very lightweight web log where you have things.
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:46.140]   So you've got the usual stuff like you might pull in photos you like from Flickr.
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:48.100]   You might have your delicious stuff pull in.
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:52.740]   But then you also you throw in stuff like, you know, song lyrics, quotes, IRC logs.
[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:54.580]   You might want to throw in stuff like that.
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:58.340]   And it becomes this kind of just running, I think what, have Williams call stuff like
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.820]   this, the river of news, right?
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:00.820]   And it's not crazy though.
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:03.140]   The idea is really just kind of throw it out there.
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.140]   Put them all in.
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.340]   And they're all exactly.
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:06.340]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:07.340]   And so there's some wonderful ones out there.
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:10.140]   There's a great one called NRK that I like a lot.
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:11.860]   Projections is a good one.
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:12.860]   Yeah.
[01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:14.340]   Projections, yeah, it's fantastic.
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:15.460]   And yeah, it's very lightweight.
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:20.660]   And it's, it's, you know, I think sometimes you get so busy thinking about it.
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:23.100]   Well, my big blog post I've got to write and it's so ponderous.
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:26.300]   And this is like, I just want to go post this lyric by the whole steady, you know, and
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.300]   it goes into the.
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:31.580]   I think this would be great for a group blog, maybe for all the twits.
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:34.900]   I'll tell you, we generate a lot of traffic if we did it, just anybody who anybody got
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:38.940]   on and said, Hey, let's, you know, be part of this.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:45.500]   If you want to see really a well done one, pro project, P-R-O-J-E-C-T dot I-O-N-I dot
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:48.660]   ST is a, is, it's beautiful.
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:50.380]   It's very railsy.
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.820]   It feels really good.
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:52.820]   Yeah.
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:53.820]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:54.820]   It's really nice.
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:55.820]   Yeah.
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:56.820]   That's great.
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:01.420]   source. Is anybody want to help us set up a well done. Do you want to do one for yourself Merlin or
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:04.760]   you know don't worry about me, I'll be fine. But I think it would be something.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:09.460]   We talked to you. We talked about this the very first time I did Mac
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:12.540]   Brick Weekly and it's for a long time. Very lightweight. Sort of like we're
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.740]   dealing with the delicious, it'd be nice to have a place where you could have one of
