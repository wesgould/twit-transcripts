[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.300]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the latest news from Apple
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.300]   with some of the best people in the Apple Biz, Andy and Nokko.
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.300]   Of course, we're going to call him "anti" and Nokko today from the Chicago Suntimes.
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.300]   I have some hard butterscotch candies.
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.800]   He's got some sort of Raspberry Pi project on the floor there over to his left.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   I don't know what that is.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.800]   Oh, I've got a couple.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.300]   That was my...
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.800]   Every time when I'm in Toys R Us and I see a toy that can be activated by...
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   Sometimes they have those demo switches, like their lights and sounds like activates...
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.800]   They have a demo switch, like you press it, then the WALI toy will go through it.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   It's like little motions and stuff.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.800]   If I've got 20 or 30 bucks to spend, I will buy it because those are the easiest thing to wire up to an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   That's my Eve toy.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   I've already unplugged her, but...
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   She was cheap.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   No, no, it's easy again.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.800]   You can easily tap into those wires in the back.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   She's in demo mode like that.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   Try me mode.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   Then she goes like...
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   WALI.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   So I can either...
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   When I've got an Arduino project that lights up an LED to let people know that Bluetooth has been enabled or that...
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   Yes, the file job has been done.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   I can instead of having an LED fire up have just been in the other room and here.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   [phone ringing]
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   Oh, I guess I need to go and check the paper on the tray because...
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   It's not telling me that...
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   It's not "Toots the Magic Unicorn", but that's pretty awesome.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   I try not to encourage farting in the office.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   I have purchased "Toots the Magic Unicorn" for a great amount of money.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   Whenever... I think when people donate money, we're going to have it.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   What are your notifications?
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.800]   This is an Indico go.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   [laughter]
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   I came by the studio.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   On a Sunday.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   I fell for it.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.800]   I am such a sucker for Kickstarter's.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   I'm ready for Twitter.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   And so you can tie it up to your Twitter or I'll use it if this and that.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.800]   Just tell me what matters most to you and I'll do it.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   What a humiliating thing though.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   If they actually ship this and then you look at all the other Kickstarter projects that were like...
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.800]   This is a stationary drone that could be used for security and surveillance, did not ship.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.800]   But the farting magical unicorn shipped.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   I think it's that ship.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.800]   You actually got your money back for the...
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   You're gonna call it...
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.800]   We call that logistics management.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   That's Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Corner.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.800]   There's a lot about logistics.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   He manages big giant trunks of gear.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.800]   I've never seen such massive gear trunks.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.800]   Pelican cases.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.800]   Hello Alex.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.800]   Hello.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   Are you in... Where's your locale?
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   I'm just a little south but I was managing a stream this morning from here so I couldn't get out of the office.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   But I'm just down in the center phone.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.800]   Cool. I have a stream question for you but first let's also welcome...
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.800]   Renee Richie of iMore.com.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.800]   Hello Renee!
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.800]   Good morning Leo. I'm thrilled to be here.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   Now two out of the four of us, three out of the four of us have bicycles because you just got a bicycle.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   I did. I did. I was motivated by you and Andy.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   I had to join the club.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.800]   Yeah, I bicycled the work today.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   I have a bicycle but don't go nowhere.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   You don't have time for bicycling.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.800]   It's like a computer for the legs.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   I have a bicycle but if it went somewhere I couldn't watch TV while I was biking so I just have it just stay in the garage.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.800]   That's a nice play on the Steve Jobs.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   It's like the Apple computer.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   It's a computer for the mind.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.800]   Bicycle is a computer.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.800]   What?
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.800]   Renee, you got to explain to me what's going on.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.800]   James Pinkhouse. Is that his name?
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.800]   From Vellum.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.800]   Oh God.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.800]   Well, but he joins the Jim Dalrymple crew.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:44.800]   He wrote a blog post saying Apple has, Apple Music has deleted my Pinkstone.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.800]   I think his name has deleted my music.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   Pinkstone stole my music.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   He said, I think that's maybe a little bit inflammatory.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.800]   He claims he called a somebody named Amber who says the software is functioning.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.800]   We don't really know who Amber is.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   This is why I spent it called Wells Week last week erupted into fire and flame.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:16.800]   Well, I want to say that I would not rush to judgment on Mr. Pinkstone because this is very similar to what Jim Dalrymple reported.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   Yeah, so I mean the problem is that it is overly complicated.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.800]   It is trying to do too much.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   It is one of those apps that Apple decided to give an impossible job.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   By putting it from the announcement, we're going to put every one coherent thought around music, but they forgot the coherent part.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   So it's just all different types of music crammed into one interface in a way that is absolutely impenetrable to most people.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.800]   And what's going on here is you're saying it's user error or not.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.800]   Well, but I mean, Apple's not helping people here.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   So with Jim, he tried Apple Music.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.800]   He decided he didn't like it.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   So he flipped off the iCloud Music Library knowing Jim probably in several ways, flipping it off.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:01.800]   Assuming that would turn off Apple Music, but it also turned off iCloud iTunes Match, which Jim really liked and was the way that he was thinking his music between devices.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   So that music all disappeared.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   And the switch wasn't labeled in any way.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   It just said iCloud Music Library turned it off.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   Everything was gone.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   So that turns off match.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   It turns off everything.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.800]   They conflated the two because they built a version of Match into Apple Music.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.800]   And so the whole thing is very confusing.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.800]   So Jim went to Apple.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.800]   They flipped a switch back on.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.800]   I think almost all his music was back.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   So he was really happy about it.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   But you know, that's happening to Jim.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   Imagine what's happening to a lot of people.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   You're talking about Jim Dowrymple here.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.800]   Absolutely.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   From the loop.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.800]   And so Jim Dowrymple has said, now, okay, it's everything's okay.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   He's over it.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.800]   Okay, good.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   All right.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.800]   He still has frustration.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   He had a lot of frustrations, but that particular one.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   I haven't heard that part.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.800]   So let me read from James Pinkstone's blog post.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   And actually I'm going to read the salient paragraph.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   When I sign up for Apple Music, iTunes evaluated my massive collection of MP3s and WAV files,
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.800]   scanned the Apple database for what I consider matches, then this is the thing I'm curious about.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.800]   Then remove the original files from my internal hard drive.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.800]   Now, it's not been my experience that that's what happens.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.800]   But he's saying, because he's a composer, a lot of the WAV files are not stuff that was in Apple's database.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   But worse, he has, and I think this does happen, mismatched music.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:31.800]   He had a "Fountains of Wayne" song that there was a single of, but he had a rare early version of it.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.800]   And of course, match said, oh, no, it's the single.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.800]   Now what he's saying is that the original was removed from his internal hard drive
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.800]   and replaced with the single, which is not the same version.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   He also says he has a backup, so nothing to freak out about.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   This could be a real warning. I want to make sure people understand what's going on here.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.800]   It is super confusing, but what happens is, again, my belief is that Apple should simplify this
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   and they should realize that there are a bunch of people who have incredibly curated music collections
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.800]   and just stay away from them because they've been managing their music for years
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   and there's no reason to interfere with that.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   You can offer Apple Music as a separate service that doesn't sort of conflate with people's own collections
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.800]   and people like Jim might want 10 different versions of the same Megadeth song
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.800]   and be able to access them whenever they want.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   That's something totally different.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.800]   But here what happens is when they do the initial matching,
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   they take all the music that's on your primary computer.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   That's the computer that has your library that you start Apple Music on.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   And it checks those. And if it has a higher quality copy, it "replaces it with the version from Apple Music."
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.800]   But because Apple Music isn't your music, it's not music that you are matching and storing on the cloud,
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   it's music that you have access to everywhere. All of that is DRM.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   Because if you turn off iCloud Apple Music, you lose those things.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   Now, that should not touch anything on your primary computer.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.800]   So it's adding DRM?
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.800]   So, I'm explaining this poorly, but if you have...
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   Let's say you have MacBook number one and you have all your music on it
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   and you subscribe to Apple Music, you will have access to all those songs on Mac number two,
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.800]   even if you didn't transfer them.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.800]   That I understand.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.800]   You'll have access to Apple Music.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.800]   It's like DRM streaming copies.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.800]   But it's different with music than it is with Match because...
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.800]   Match is DRM free.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   Music has to somehow turn off those songs if you don't continue to subscribe.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   Absolutely. And Match is separate. Match you pay $25 for it and it will actually match your songs
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.800]   and let you download DRM free copies of those songs.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.800]   It's saying, "Okay, we know you own those, we verify them."
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.800]   Apple Music is just saying, "Okay, we don't have this in our catalog, but we see that you do.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   And it's also in the iTunes catalog, or we managed to upload it
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.800]   and we'll let you stream it everywhere."
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.800]   And because you have the ability to bookmark and "download" that music,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.800]   it's just putting shadow copies of what exists on the Apple Music Library.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.800]   And if you turn off Apple Music or you unsubscribe, all that vanishes.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   So you might think that Mac too has all your music on it, but it really has all Apple Music on it.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.800]   And then you turn that off, that's gone.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.800]   The problem occurs when people think, "Oh, great, everything's in Apple Music now.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   I don't need my local copies anymore. I can back their mind."
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   That's the big mistake.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.800]   Don't ever, ever do that.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   Then you deleting.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.800]   Now, here's a, it's serenity, by the right way, read a series of articles you spent a week on this.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   But the original article was saying, "No, they're not deleting your music."
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   But this is what Jason Snell tweeted her, and I think he says, "My theory is this dialog box is causing
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   I'm less understanding what happens next."
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:28.800]   And boy, if you read this dialog box, it reminds me of the dialog boxes I see in photos that are so confusing.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   And don't give you an option that makes sense.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   And I have lost photos and photos.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   Fortunately, I don't rely on photos for backup.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   Are you sure you wanted to delete this song?
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.800]   This will delete this song from your iCloud Music Library and from your other devices.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:48.800]   To keep this song in your library and on your other devices, you can remove this download instead.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.800]   And then it gives you three buttons.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.800]   Remove download, cancel, and the default is delete song.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.800]   And it's impenetrable.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   What the hell?
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   So what happens if I click delete song, it's going to delete it everywhere.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.800]   I'll move it to your trash.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.800]   So it doesn't delete anything.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   It will move it to your trash.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.800]   If you have a physical copy on your hard drive, it will move it to the trash.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.800]   Okay.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.800]   And that would include the original fountains of Wayne's song, for instance.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.800]   If that was your primary computer and it doesn't have a way of differentiating that file from anything else.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   What happens if I say remove download?
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   It doesn't delete anything on my hard drive.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.800]   No, it basically unchecks it and says no longer.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   Download.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   What they're using download to mean is cache.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.800]   Keep a local copy cached of the Apple Music file, which is a streaming music file.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.800]   And again, this is all way too complicated.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.800]   And you get, like with the new Apple TV and people using apps, you know, that stream their
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   own collections, they have the same sort of problem.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   It's the idea of streaming and your local content living together in harmony is beautiful, but
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   it's just not being realized.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.400]   And when it is being realized, it's done in such a confusing way that my preference would
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.800]   be for Apple to just never touch the data on your disk.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.800]   If they want, they can make some sort of unified view, like a synergy for music where they have
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   a data layer abstraction that's, you know, these are pointers.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.800]   This is pointing to your music.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.800]   This is pointing to Apple Music.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   We are never touching your music.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   It is kept in Apple Music Library.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   Sorry, in iTunes Library, this is kept in Apple Music Library.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   And we will never, ever, not ever touch this, but we will give you access to all these things.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.800]   But instead what they do is they sort of, again, in an effort to make it simple that ends up in
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   complexity, they just want you to think music is music everywhere.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.800]   And that sounds great on a PowerPoint, even if it's poorly presented.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.800]   But in actuality, it's turning into something really confusing for a lot of customers.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   Actually, in fact, I think you're confused because if you choose remove download, according
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.360]   to the Serenity, it will send the local fire, not delete song, remove download, will send
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.200]   the local file from your hard drive to your trash.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:44.880]   But the XML file will still have a reference so you can stream it, but you will have the
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.960]   original moved to the trash.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.960]   That's remove download.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.520]   What is delete?
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.120]   So you had it reversed too.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.040]   So I thought delete was the one that moves into the trash.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.040]   I know.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.040]   So there you go.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.040]   And Proteus in our chat room says, as a developer, this dialogue makes me very sad.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.640]   It is a very sad dialogue.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.040]   As long as the side is a more button in Apple Music.app.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.680]   This is why sometimes I think that you can make things easier by actually making them more
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.720]   complicated, that if Apple had separate apps for local music playing and then said, here
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.640]   is our service where you get all the free music, excuse me, all the music you can eat.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.600]   For just just as one subscription fee, and we'll keep this in a separate library safe
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.800]   from your iTunes library, known as having this sort of confusion.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:32.400]   This is why I don't think that Amazon's music app is perfection.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.440]   But I do like the fact that there is an AB switch.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.880]   If you flip this switch that's right front and center, you are looking at music that
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:44.840]   is actually stored on this device and actually stored in this local music library.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.280]   If you flip it the other way, you're looking at music that you're playing through and streaming
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.360]   through the cloud.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.480]   Which is I've never had confusion on that app about where my music is coming from and it
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.160]   has never screwed up my local library.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.600]   Or just don't use Apple Music, use some other service and then they won't be mixed together.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.640]   Well, that's not a solution I think that Apple would love to.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.640]   No, I know.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.000]   But as a user, that's a solution.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.120]   A lot of people say, well I've never had this problem because I'm not using Apple Music.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.520]   I mean, it solves the problem.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.880]   Well, I use that music all the time.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.160]   I don't have a library, so I don't have this problem either.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.840]   It's really trying to mix the new generation of streaming with the old generation of live.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.080]   And it's one of those rare cases where Apple has opinions on everything.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.000]   People are constantly upset that Apple doesn't give them more choice, that they make really
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.840]   hard choices for the consumer.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.680]   In this case, it just feels like total abdication.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.960]   They just said, people have all these different use cases.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.320]   We'll do our best to cater to all of them.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.320]   Good luck with that.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.120]   Instead of saying this is what you can do in Apple Music and this is what we think is
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.840]   the best way to handle your music today.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.560]   And I didn't even use the music match because I was too paranoid of letting Apple fiddle
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.560]   with my...
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.720]   There was a question mark I remember and I don't know if we ever satisfactorily answered
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:59.880]   it when Apple Music came out about how this interrelates with iTunes Match.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.400]   And I think that's the question never really was answered.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.560]   If you pay for it, you get the DRM free copy.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.560]   It's basically what it comes down to.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.240]   If you pay the extra $25, it will match your music and give you the DRM free copy and all
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.240]   of your devices.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.800]   Otherwise, it'll match your music, but it will do it through the streaming Apple Music
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.800]   library.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.920]   So if you have, so as I do, iTunes Match, and you sign up for Apple Music, does that
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.240]   turn match off?
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.480]   No, you have both.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.480]   And they basically...
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.120]   This is again why it's super confusing.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.240]   Maybe they should have just canceled the Match service or made it separate or not built.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.640]   Serenity had a really good article about how Apple should not have included Match in Apple
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.160]   Music because it makes it confusing because now you have the quote unquote DRM match
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.960]   for Apple Music and you have the non DRM match from the original.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.160]   It takes someone like Serenity this many articles and this long to explain this stuff to me
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.200]   shows that there's a lack of coherence at the foundations of this service.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:55.160]   And I think in a lot of ways, you could have your iTunes just not interact with Apple Music
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.160]   at all.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.360]   And just it is your collection of the stuff that you have.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:03.120]   Now you could say, "Hey, look at what I have in here and put it into Apple Music that's
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.240]   going to operate on my phone and maybe even a separate application."
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.680]   But the stuff that the physical stuff, I think in many ways, I agree that it should have
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:16.160]   been just left behind and left alone rather than trying to integrate it all.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.760]   And this is not the only thing that's been an issue.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:24.720]   I think that this whole integration has been an ongoing issue since they started the match
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.720]   process.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.200]   We've seen hits like this.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.440]   I think this isn't making it more.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.440]   To do it right would not be making it more complex, right?
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:38.600]   It would actually be kind of being true to what the old Unix philosophy is.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.480]   Do one thing and do one thing well.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.480]   I agree.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.240]   And then you have applications, pipe one to the other.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:50.360]   And so you would know what each application did and its effects would be discrete to that
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.360]   application.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.360]   There wouldn't be interaction between applications.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.600]   And use extensibility to bridge you from one to the other.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.600]   Right.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.320]   I think that that's the philosophy that we have in many ways drifted away from.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.600]   Even Linux is starting to drift away from it.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.720]   And it really makes a lot of sense.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.080]   I was looking back at some old stuff and looking at the icing, for instance, the icing cap,
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.480]   which I think is time to bring that app back.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:18.440]   It's time to really split up iTunes into four or five different apps, each with its own interface
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.800]   that's absolutely laser fine-tuned to the one task it's meant to do.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:30.240]   That one task being everything that's related to local music and media library management.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.760]   One app that's laser focused on giving the best store experience.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:40.960]   One app that's laser focused on simply moving media and other photos to phones and tablets
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.760]   and iCloud and other devices.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.040]   Again, we've had this redesign in iTunes for years.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.920]   And I still have that like I've got the mouse in my hand.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:58.520]   I'm always have that at least four seconds of when I'm trying to figure out how I want
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.000]   to shop for an iOS app.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.680]   Am I in the library now?
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.680]   And I get there.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.640]   But my general rule of thumb is that I'm an idiot the first two or three times I don't
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.640]   get something.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.600]   The fourth and subsequent times I don't get it.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.600]   That's just bad design.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.280]   Well, and the question is, is the average person actually interacting on their computer?
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.000]   I was trying to think of the last time I was listening to music off of my laptop.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.040]   And I couldn't remember when that was.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.240]   It might have been years.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.040]   How do you listen on your phone?
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.880]   My phone is like my phone is pretty much the only place I listen to my music.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.640]   I have really good speakers on my computer and I rarely listen.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.160]   I mean, I listen to it.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:48.760]   I pipe it to a speaker, you know, an external speaker or I listen to it on headphones.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.960]   I rarely listen to it actually coming out of the phone.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.560]   But I think that, you know, I don't, you know, the idea of I don't really use my computer
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.560]   anymore for that.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.000]   Yeah, but that's crazy because you want to be able to do whatever you're doing on computer
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   and not have it playing in the background either.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.720]   Well, but that's a sad trajectory.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.760]   I mean, we've been observing.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:14.280]   I've been observing where the 10 years ago, maybe my Macs and my Apple devices were just
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.800]   flat out great devices.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.640]   Then there came this evolution where they're great.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.520]   So what, but they're particularly great reserved.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:28.760]   The great experiences reserved for if you mostly are exclusively use Apple hardware
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.800]   and services working with each other.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.680]   And now it almost with Apple music, it's like, it's great.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:41.280]   So long as you're only using Macs with iOS devices and so long as you're only getting
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:47.760]   stuff from the Apple store ever and you don't try to bring in music files that did not originate
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.920]   from the iTunes store.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:54.120]   If it's we shouldn't overlook the fact that this is a it's Apple music, I think works
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.920]   great for people who are new out of the box users who are like that.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.320]   I mean, they're especially if you're 11, 12, 13 years old and you never steal music from
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.320]   anywhere.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:07.040]   And you just and you and you've and you decided that Apple music is a great place to get your
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.040]   music from.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.040]   But this is not playing the game at expert level.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.480]   This is playing the game at maybe moderate level, maybe easy level.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.240]   And that wouldn't be such a bad problem if not for the fact that there are other music
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:23.720]   services and there are other platforms that are playing the game at hard and even expert
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.520]   level and they're actually succeeding.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.120]   The question is, is what percentage of the users are expert level?
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.960]   I mean, I firmly believe that I'm not saying expert level users.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:38.120]   I'm talking about as a provider of a music service as the provider of an operating system
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.880]   as the provider of the hardware.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:45.360]   Do you want to do this so well that it just plain works or are you going to do it the
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:51.080]   easy way which is that, well, so long as people can easily sync music from from a Mac to an
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.920]   iPhone, actually even better.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.800]   So long as they never actually use the service on the Mac, they're just getting stuff strictly
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.760]   through Apple music and strictly through this phone, that's good enough.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.000]   So it's the people who are creating these services have to play the game at expert level.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.920]   The users, of course, have to be able to play at an easy level.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.480]   So I'm not saying these are experts who want to do this.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.480]   I guess I would.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.600]   The data that we don't have is how many people are accessing their music via their iOS device
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.760]   or their Mac.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.600]   And if Apple is looking at data that says that 99% or 98% of the people are accessing
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:27.200]   it through their iOS, we can see how we might not get a lot of love when it comes to that.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:32.760]   Again, I don't know if that's the case, but I'm just saying that we don't know.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.240]   But that's not that's not the ideal.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.240]   It's not aspirational.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.480]   We do not want to drive an Apple car that says we figure that most people when it's there
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.480]   are very few people who live in snowy times, snowy climates, and most of them will already
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.960]   have a four wheel drive vehicle.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:52.280]   So you know, it's really hard to create a traction system that actually can handle road
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.440]   salt, a body can handle road salt and a slippery road condition.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:03.280]   So we're just going to target our car towards people who don't drive on non dry roads.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.760]   When it's just eating, it's outside.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.760]   This is more accurate.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.640]   I mentioned earlier that iTunes has an impossible job.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.200]   And I think Eddy Q hinted at that when one of the interviews where someone pointed out
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.800]   that you've torn down all these apps, you've torn down Final Cut, you've torn down iMovie,
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.360]   you've torn down, you know, all these apps and built them up.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.200]   I work and people were super upset that they lost features, but now you have a modern code
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.040]   base to build on and why Veeze and on this with iTunes.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.600]   And he sort of hints at the fact that iTunes is cross platform supported by Windows.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.960]   There's still selling iPods that have to rely on sinking through iTunes and doing all
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.760]   this functionality and they're selling them now.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.520]   So they have to support these people.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:41.280]   And it becomes Apple's first real Windows problem where they have to support an entire
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:47.480]   very, very large ecosystem of people with a very, very different set of use cases.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.280]   And going back to it, there was a simpler version of Apple Music.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.600]   There was a much simpler version of Apple Music, but after it was iterated on, it was
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.600]   like, well, we need to add this.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.040]   We need to add this and it turned into the monstrosity we have now.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:03.040]   And Apple, at least according to Q, was working on managing this transitional wave from iTunes
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.040]   and towards the future.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.040]   That's why we built out the app.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:11.360]   The WWDC, the rumors that there'll be revamped iTunes or will it be a minor revamp?
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.080]   It'll be a meaty, so I guess it depends on what scale we grade these on.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:21.280]   It's going to be a redesign, but it's still part of this long migration where they need
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.920]   to actually get, like this is why they spun out a bunch of apps and made them separate
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:30.320]   on iOS and why they've done things like making the streaming services so that they could
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.880]   reduce dependency on that native application.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.560]   But I think it's still going to take a while.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:39.420]   I just don't think Apple is experienced in managing this huge legacy transition and it's
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:43.840]   showing, especially when you're dealing with the services team, which this is not Craig
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.680]   Federighi's work, making an app with a small group of people who only has one focus on
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.680]   this app.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.240]   This is everyone managing the expectations of content creators who want to make sure
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.320]   that there's billions and billions of dollars of transactions going through iTunes too.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:00.160]   And you've got to pay for that song, move that song onto the computer, move that song
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:05.680]   onto the iPod on Windows and have all of that managed in a fashion that doesn't break.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.520]   It is literally rebuilding the airplane while it is in the sky.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.960]   And I don't think Apple has done a particularly great job of it.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.000]   I obviously couldn't do a better one, but I think we'll continue to see the step-by-step
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.560]   improvements until they finally, like Apple.com when the new store went live, they'll flip
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.320]   a switch and we'll see a new version.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:27.080]   See, that's part of the difficulty that if Apple is going to evolve, they really have
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:33.080]   to figure out how they can solve problems like these because they've done an exemplary
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.080]   job, switching over to Mac for a sec.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:43.880]   They've done an exemplary job developing a computer that 8% of the world uses and loves.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:48.640]   They've never had experience trying to solve the problems of what if you have to make computers
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.840]   for everybody?
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:54.840]   What if you have to take care of people who don't have a thousand dollars to spend?
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:59.480]   And in the case of Apple Music, what if you have to take care of a community that is not
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:06.320]   going to simply throw away everything they own and switch over to all technology where
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.480]   you're the engineers who design everything front to back?
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:14.440]   So it really is like, it's not that they're dumb, it's not that they don't care, it's
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.920]   not that they're too focused on one core of their audiences that this is a skill they've
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.800]   never had a requirement to develop and now they really have to start developing it if
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.000]   they really want to.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:32.560]   If they want to become truly great with a capital G, they really have to start playing
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.040]   the game at expert level.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.080]   And there's some areas in which they really have had it easy.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:45.280]   I wonder if this is also an issue of a larger issue with more than just Apple, but of all
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:50.440]   technology companies of maturity and complexity.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:54.320]   Because we get farther and farther along and we expect more and more.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.280]   It just seems like they crapped themselves.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.280]   It's hard.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.280]   Changing is hard.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.280]   Most companies can't do it.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.280]   Legacy is the problem, right?
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.760]   And Apple has traditionally gotten just ditched legacy.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.080]   I mean, that's one of the things that was a huge challenge for Microsoft, you know, is
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.280]   to keep all this stuff working for many, many years and Apple would just go, yeah, we're
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.520]   not using that connector anymore.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.720]   Yeah, we're not going to use this.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.080]   Yeah, like, yeah, we're just going to throw that out.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:20.400]   And so Apple's traditional view has been just to throw it out and move everybody onto something
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.400]   else.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.040]   And I think this is a more complicated problem for them.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:28.600]   Also, it's harder to satisfy an audience that doesn't already love you.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.200]   They've a lot of the people, not exclusively, but a lot of the audience for Apple products
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:38.480]   have been people who have been drawn towards the company because they have a unique philosophy.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.920]   They have a unique design aesthetic.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.000]   They have a unique focus on the user.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.720]   That's not the same as the way that other companies focus on the user.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.760]   It's a different thing when you have a device you're putting next to three or four other
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.720]   devices in front of a person who is relatively indifferent to the Apple logo.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.040]   If they say that, look, while all I'm looking, again, we get back to cars, they're people
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.280]   who think that a certain maker model is the best car ever.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.720]   I know that the wiring is the electric are not very good.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.600]   I know that this is not going to last me 12 years.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.880]   It's going to last me maybe four or five years.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.440]   But boy, I like the sort of car.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.440]   So I'm coming.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.440]   I'm coming here because I love it.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.000]   I'm buying this new electric car from Tesla because I love electric cars and I love what
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Tesla is doing.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.960]   I don't care that the range right now is only 140 miles and it doesn't have 18 cup holders.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.920]   It's different when someone walks on that lot saying, "I've got $30,000 to spend in a car.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.680]   I've got four kids.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.520]   They've got 18 different week long activities."
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.480]   And we also like to go camping.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.360]   They're not going to love an Apple car because it's made by Apple.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.600]   They're going to love a car that can actually suit all of their needs.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:48.160]   And so sometimes when you have to start playing on that game, it's a lot harder to figure out
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.720]   how to make those people happy if they're not motivated to come to your logo to begin
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.720]   with.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.800]   All right.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.760]   We've pinpointed the problem.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.160]   Music is hard.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.160]   Music is hard.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.160]   I wonder though.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.480]   People care about it so much.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.960]   It doesn't.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.680]   I wonder why you can't just throw.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.080]   It's not that Apple doesn't have talent or brains or money.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.080]   Why can't you just sit down and solve it?
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.720]   I don't understand why you can't.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.600]   So it's easy when like, I don't want to say it's easy.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.400]   Like when we have these discussions, they have exactly the same discussions inside.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.760]   And then somebody will go, "Why don't we just stop porting iTunes to Windows?
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.320]   We'll give them a cloud interface and then they'll go, but we just updated the iPod
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.400]   line with fresh new colors and you can't sync that over a web browser.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.400]   Oh, okay.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   So why don't we do this?
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.400]   So it's a strategy tax?
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.880]   Well, I had a friend who went to, like he went to work for Apple and he left the company
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.000]   a few years later and he told me he arrived there on the first day and almost literally
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.400]   he said, "Okay, I'm here.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.880]   I'm going to fix all these things because I know what's wrong because I was on the Internet."
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.800]   And the guy took this box and he put it in front of him and he goes, "This is the first
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.800]   time we tried to fix it.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.720]   This is the second time we tried to fix it.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.720]   This is the third time."
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:56.640]   And these are the repercussions of all those things and they have to weigh those things.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:00.280]   And then sometimes they're picking between the best of worst choices.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.160]   Like, can't cut off all the Windows people, can't cut off all the iPods.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.320]   What we can do now is move this piece so that when we get this piece over, it'll be easier
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.320]   to do that.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.640]   And on the outside, we're like, "Ah, this is molasses."
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.200]   And they're going, "We're ruined as fast as we can, guy."
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.200]   Right.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   Tough.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.360]   It's a new problem when you've got 400 billion people that are...
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.360]   Right.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.360]   That's kind of what I mean is that...
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.200]   $5 million or whatever the revenue is flowing through.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.200]   It's easy when you're small and you can...
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   There's still on web objects for a lot of those.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.320]   I mean, everybody there would love to be off it, but 5 billion transactions going through
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.320]   those plans.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.320]   Hey, let's take a break.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.960]   Podcasting for one.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.840]   Apple, we need you to do a better job, say some podcasters.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.040]   Not me, but apparently according to the New York Times, some podcasters will talk.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.440]   It was still a little more about Apple Music.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.480]   Spotify says Apple Music's been good for us.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.000]   Our growth has quickened since Apple Music launched.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.040]   Apple Music now up to 13 million users according to the quarterly earnings report.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.240]   Spotify says, "We're growing too."
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.240]   Which makes sense.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.160]   It's raised awareness in general for the idea of this.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.560]   They didn't say whether it was free or paid customers that were growing.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.560]   It's more like...
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.720]   They have 100 million users, 59 countries, but no profit.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.720]   So...
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.400]   Well, the paid users are, I think, single digit millions still.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.400]   Interesting.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.640]   Single digit, you think?
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.840]   I think someone said that.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.560]   Someone said they might be around or even slightly less than what Apple Music is.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.560]   So it's less than Apple Music?
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.560]   Wow.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.200]   Well, when you have free, it's an easy option.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.200]   Right.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.200]   No, it says...
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.200]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.160]   This article in the writer says 30 million paying users on Spotify.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.160]   What do you want?
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.160]   Okay, I didn't see that.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.160]   30.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.200]   Apple won three.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.200]   But then there's...
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.760]   Pandora's going to start a streaming service.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.480]   There's title and DZR and Google Music and Amazon Music.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:56.280]   It's a very competitive niche and the music industry is really uncomfortable with it.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:00.720]   Spotify's raised a billion dollars in debt, convertible debt.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.480]   So, it's got to be tough right now.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.480]   Pretty million.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.440]   Apple, of course, has a 50% discount now for students.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.880]   That's good for 99 a month.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.160]   Family plan two.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.640]   They're being very aggressive.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:18.680]   And Apple's exclusive as long as you're talking about Apple Music, I'll wrap up the Apple Music
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:26.800]   segment with Drake has been Betty Betty Good for Drake five days, one million copies.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.880]   Sold.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.880]   It was only on Apple.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.880]   It was an exclusive.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.440]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.440]   Come back with more.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.200]   Renee Ritchie from iMore.com from Pixel Chore.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.200]   It's Alex Lindsey from the Chicago Sun Times, Andy and Naco.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.720]   And you're listening to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:49.760]   I showed it a brought to you by Quickin Loans and Rocket Mortgage.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:55.520]   Rocket is a good name because Rocket Mortgage is about speeding up the mortgage process.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.240]   When you buy a house, last time I bought a house a couple of years ago, oh man, it was
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.800]   painful.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.040]   Back and forth and lots of paperwork and faxes, faxes.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:11.240]   And then it took so long that we ended up, we had a vacation plan and we're on vacation
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.480]   on a cruise ship trying to find a fax machine.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.840]   It's crazy.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.800]   Rocket Mortgage, I wish it had been around then.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   It is now.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.560]   And if you're getting a mortgage, this is the way to do it.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:27.160]   They bring the mortgage approval process into the 21st century entirely online.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.720]   Fast, powerful and entirely online.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:35.320]   You take it all the complicated time consuming parts out of a mortgage application, out of
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.000]   the equation.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.560]   No paperwork, no stacks of old files.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.840]   You can share your bank statements, share your pay stubs with the click of a mouse.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.840]   Everything's online now.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.840]   Why not?
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.040]   Why print it out and fax it to them?
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.040]   That's nuts.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.960]   You'll get approved in minutes for a custom mortgage solution tailored to your unique financial
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.400]   situation.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:58.480]   And you can do all of it on your phone too or your tablet too.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   Very easy from the convenience of your couch.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.400]   And you know, if you're looking at houses, can I make a recommendation?
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.920]   That's something I learned.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.080]   Get pre-approved at Rocket Mortgage.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.840]   That way you're a much more attractive buyer.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.240]   And nowadays, at least in this area, it's pretty competitive.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:21.720]   If you're looking to refi, if you're looking to buy a home, Rocket Mortgage, go to quickenlones.com/macbreak.

[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.540]   number 30-30.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:38.940]   And we're very happy to have you welcome Rocket Mortgage to the Twit family.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.640]   Rocket Mortgage by Quick and Loans.

[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.640]   All right.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.640]   Moving on.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:45.640]   I don't know if you saw.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:46.640]   I was so excited.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.640]   I saw this Sunday Times.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:52.640]   Front page.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:55.000]   Below the fold, but front page.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.920]   Podcasts surge.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.280]   But producers fear Apple isn't listening.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:05.160]   And it went, "Oh, maybe we're lucky because we have a good relationship with Steve."
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.200]   I broke my head on my desk when I saw that article.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.520]   You're a podcaster.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.640]   We're all podcasters.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:17.760]   So according to this, I think by the way, Marco had a great takedown at Marco.org, Marco
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.560]   Arman, who makes a podcast app and is a podcaster himself.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.960]   And because he makes a podcast app, I think he's very connected to podcasters.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.160]   First of all, he said, "For some reason, when the New York media, especially the New
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.760]   York Times, talks about podcasting, what they really mean is NPR."
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:37.640]   What they, or the NPR spinoffs like a cereal and gimlet.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:43.160]   All these guys who came from all things, or this American life and planet-
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:47.200]   I think it's a major, major, major-based advertising companies.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:55.040]   In the Times, and the article is written by John Herman, he says that Apple had a meetup
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.040]   brought in the big podcasters.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.040]   Were any of you there?
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.040]   And just out of curious.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.040]   No.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.040]   No.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.040]   I'm going to podcaster to do that.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.040]   Steve Austin there.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.040]   That's what I want to know.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.160]   Probably is a misunderstanding because Apple talks to podcasters all the time, and we've
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.080]   been there.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:20.760]   But they say that the big podcasters that Apple brought in, interviews, this is the
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.760]   Times, interviews with over two dozen podcasters and people inside Apple reveal a variety of
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:25.760]   complaints.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.520]   The podcasters say they are relegated to wooing a single Apple employee for the best promotion.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.520]   That is true.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.320]   Not a problem, but that is true.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.880]   It's Steve that does it all right.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.880]   He loves Steve.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:41.360]   I mean, that's not so, I hate when they mention Apple employees because they never do it in
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.360]   context.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.560]   That's not unique to podcasts.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.000]   Apple as part of eddy cues organization, although the App Store ones have moved to Phil
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.320]   Shiller, they have editors and those, they've always had them for movies, it's for music,
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.200]   it's for podcasts, it's for apps, it's for iBooks.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.600]   They're human curators whose job it is to sift through all this stuff and sort of try
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.600]   to build themes.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.080]   And it's different in every country.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.840]   So Steve Wilson and James Bogg is boss or in the US, but every country has its own.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.840]   It's an editorial team.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.840]   It's the same thing.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.280]   And the absolute more is just one guy got transferred and I don't believe they've replaced
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.280]   him.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.560]   I mean, I guess the whole story lacks.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.560]   If you know Apple, you read this story, you just want to again, break your desk with your
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.560]   head.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:23.200]   But Marco makes a point and I think Marco really makes an excellent point.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:29.720]   Apple's actual role in podcasting, be careful what you wish for is don't, we don't want
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:33.480]   Apple to turn iTunes and the podcast apps into the App Store.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:39.440]   He says, trust me, you don't want that.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.720]   Podcasts are like blogs.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.720]   It's an open standard.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.720]   There are many different podcast platforms.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:52.040]   I don't think any of us want Apple to become a gatekeeper, to do metrics, to pry into our
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.440]   listeners lives and personal information.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:38:00.520]   I don't think Apple wants to do that, but to get analytics, to do monetization.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:08.120]   Marco says completely decentralized, free, fair, open and uncontrollable by any single entity.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.120]   And that's the way it is.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:15.520]   We don't want to turn it into what the web is turned into, which is an ad tech, written
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.480]   cesspool of advertising.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:24.400]   When I read the article, when I read about complaints that there's just one guy that
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:29.920]   we have to deal with, I was reading, we don't have the ability to leverage our really expensive
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:35.480]   marketing and publicity department to heavily lobby and/or pay to influence somebody to
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:41.160]   give us a better placement above other people.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:46.960]   It's kind of good that there is sort of a secret process by which certain shows get
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.080]   promoted and certain shows don't.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:55.960]   And it's isn't better to know that just some 12 year old kid who started a podcast that's
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:01.480]   just good, according to some certain human beings, gets to be right up their front center
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.320]   to find a new audience.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:11.120]   And the brand new Honey Nut Cheerios B podcast is getting 18 listeners and no promotion,
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:15.720]   despite how much money General Mills is putting into the promotion of it.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.720]   Like Laura, I just got a team.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.600]   Laura started what a year ago and there's one guy, a 30 minute show, and it just got
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.600]   picked up as a TV deal.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.160]   And it got heavily, it was one of the new podcasts of the year on iTunes.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.760]   And he's competing with the biggest producers.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.480]   I mean, I can understand because I used to work in analytics why a lot of companies want.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.680]   They want, they've been sort of, what's the right word, fattened up on this market of
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.280]   will give you exact numbers and you'll know who played and how many people this and then
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.400]   they can gain those systems.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.360]   They can bid and they can create these incredibly complex algorithms to do.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.480]   But that is usually good for giant aggregators that has seldom good for people and you sort
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.560]   of have to figure out what you want out of this.
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.800]   And we're gonna have to get back into the same complaint that we see with it with the
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.520]   app store, you know, people are like, well, but they do give us everything.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.000]   They didn't give us everything we asked for.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.920]   You know, they, you know, no, I don't want them to give us anything.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:05.040]   I mean, that's the whole thing is, is they mostly stay out of all the things that Apple
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.040]   does.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.040]   This is the thing they stay out of.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.680]   You know, they say they're not getting into it.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:12.520]   They're not taking it away from, you know, because, you know, I don't want them to take
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.520]   30%.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.080]   I don't want to have rules about what kind of advertisers I can run.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.040]   I don't want to have all of the things that would come with more how.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.600]   Yeah, Marco says, I'd be careful what you wish for.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.200]   Yeah, I don't want to have to not use naughty words.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.160]   If I choose to use naughty words, I don't want to have to not talk about topics that
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.160]   are gross.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:35.120]   I think that this is part of why Apple has, I think this is part of why Apple stayed away
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.000]   from it to allow people to do whatever they're going to do with it.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.160]   And you know, within a very wide set of rules, just stay out, you know, has just basically
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.120]   stayed out of the, out of the way of the podcasters.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.800]   And I think that they've created a, you know, a great platform that people are making money
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:50.800]   on that.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.400]   And maybe not everyone is, maybe it's not as easy as everyone would like it.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.440]   But you know, there is a way to climb up there.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.000]   Well, so there's, you know, it sounds like in this article, there's two things that
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.520]   the, whoever these people were that met with Apple wanted.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.520]   One was metrics.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.240]   Don't want that.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.960]   Apple's not the company to provide metrics.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:12.600]   And that's just not the way any or analytics about our audiences.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.980]   And Apple could, I guess, do that because a lot of people play back podcasts through
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:20.640]   iTunes, but it's not, it's not, it's no longer the vast majority.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.880]   They win anyway, because you, they, the podcast itself collects no data.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:27.260]   So they would have to link it with device data that they know about you, which is the
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.720]   last thing that Apple's ever want to do.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.180]   They've got to great measures to decouple those kinds of Apple.
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:35.920]   I just want to tell you, we don't want you to do that either.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.300]   We're not asking you to do that.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:41.380]   And then maybe, maybe have some sort of subscription service for podcasts.
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.980]   No, there's plenty of good ways to do that.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:45.740]   You don't need to do that with Apple.
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:50.140]   And finally, I guess, what they're saying is it should be easier for us to promote ourselves
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.380]   to Apple.
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:56.460]   And I think it's fine to have Steve decide what he likes and promote it.
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:57.540]   And that's fine.
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:05.340]   I don't, you know, the one thing I think has always bugged me is the, the top plate, the
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.140]   top podcast lists.
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:11.580]   Because I think people think that means the most subscribed to podcasts.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:14.500]   And it's not, never has been.
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:19.700]   It's the most subscribed to in iTunes this week list.
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.700]   It's like a billboard chart.
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:25.540]   And so it doesn't count total listens by any.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:30.700]   But I think in some ways it measures a certain trend of going towards something, ballistics,
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.180]   because otherwise it would be right now would be America.
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.900]   This American life would be number one all the time.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:40.980]   Well, it is all the time because they do a, yeah, because if they play a trick actually
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:44.480]   to get on number one on there, we don't, you know, I'm sure they have a lot of lists
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.500]   of listeners.
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.900]   But when we release a new podcast, it often goes to number one and it slowly goes back
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:50.900]   down.
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:51.900]   Does that mean people are unsubscribing?
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.860]   No, it means there are the, the ballistics are different.
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.140]   The vet, there are fewer new subscriptions.
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:02.140]   In fact, the largest older podcasts will, will not be on those lists because we don't
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:05.620]   get as many new subscribers because everybody subscribes.
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:10.540]   Anyway, I don't want to send, uh, whiny on this.
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:11.540]   I'm not.
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:12.540]   I'm very happy with how it works.
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:15.560]   Just remember apples, not the only player there's stitcher.
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.800]   And there's a guy at stitcher you call.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.020]   Yeah, there's, I mean, there's a, there's a lot of these.
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:25.380]   The super important thing is that the Apple, whatever system Apple has created, Apple has
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:30.260]   not created a system where you cannot have a successful and sustaining podcast.
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:34.520]   If you are not being helped by Apple with good placement and good positioning.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.800]   And that means that whatever system they've got is working really great.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   And there's a, and there's a, there's a concept, you know, of, of, you know, using Twitter,
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.400]   using Facebook, building a web page.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:48.800]   Yeah, you have to promote yourself fashion, the old fashion marketing that, you know,
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.040]   they don't have to hand it to you.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:53.400]   And there's a lot of tools out there to engage your audience.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.400]   Love this kid.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.120]   We're trying to get him on the new screen savers.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:02.000]   15 years old, he's building the main computer museum.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   He's 15.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.960]   He has 200 vintage Apple computers.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.240]   It's a Mac museum.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.240]   And it's beautifully done.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.360]   I mean, look, I don't know.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:10.360]   This is gorgeous.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.360]   Not Stephen Hackett.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.360]   That's important to realize.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.360]   This is a different person than Stephen.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.360]   Alex Jason.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.520]   And this is his basement, the nicest looking basement I've ever seen.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:25.360]   He's got all the different colored IMAX, including that weird hippie IMAX with the flowers on
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.360]   it.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.360]   Flower power.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.360]   What is this big server over here?
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.600]   Is that an X serve?
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.600]   No, no, no.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.800]   No, it's a printer.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:38.200]   It's a, no, it's, it's from, it's from the pre Steve days when they were making, uh, um,
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:44.280]   I forget the name of it, but they were basically taking like Mac LCs and stacking them and
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.600]   basically putting it in any box that could actually serve them.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.360]   That Dalmatian and IMAX still.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.560]   I love, is that what they call it?
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.560]   The Dalmatian and IMAX?
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.560]   That's, that's the spotted one.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.800]   Really, uh, really cool.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:00.840]   He started as a 10 year old and he traded in 2010.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:06.280]   He traded a mini bike and an electric snow blower for an IMAX G5.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:11.320]   And, uh, I guess he just got the bug 200 Apple machines.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:15.920]   He and his father Bill are now planning to display the collection known as Alex's apple
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:21.240]   orchard in a old Carnegie, one of those old Carnegie libraries in Fairfield's name.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.240]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.240]   Those are great old buildings.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:27.840]   It'll be called the main technology museum.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.880]   He has an apple one from 1976.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.680]   It still works with the original chips.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.920]   I'm wondering how he got all of that.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.920]   I mean, it's like, that's an expensive piece of.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.160]   I think because it's, it's, it's amazing.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:42.160]   Like there, there are people who have these old things and they never read.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:45.840]   They don't really love them anymore, but they don't want to just, they don't want
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:50.120]   to sell it to some millionaire idiot who's going to think it is cool.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.480]   Gario and Instagram and then forget about it.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:56.880]   But if you find that one person who will absolutely love it, particularly if it's a
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:00.280]   12 year old kid, that's the person that you send it to.
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:04.600]   It's like, I, I went through exactly the same thing when I was a kid where I was, I was
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:09.640]   also collecting old computers and a word which a friend of a friend, the
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.520]   restranger would find out there's this kid in Boston who is really, really
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.280]   interested in like inside gear.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:20.280]   And again, there's this thing that they, that were, was important to them about 15
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.240]   years ago, but not so much now.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.320]   And the idea that, well, here's someone who's actually going to really use it and appreciate
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.680]   it for what it is the same way that I appreciated it.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.720]   I'd be more than willing to give it to this person.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.240]   If this person can con his father into driving a hundred miles to come pick it up
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.680]   because no way at hell am I going to ship an insight 80 80.
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:43.160]   And if this person has a, you know, a nonprofit status and can handle it right off.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.680]   I think that was, I think that was long before that.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.280]   But the Apple one is hell of a score.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:52.960]   Cause when I was now, this is when I was his age or you know, a little younger than that,
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:47:01.080]   I saw an ad in the back of Bite magazine for a working Apple one for $1,200.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:07.400]   No, no, no, but I'm saying a 12 year old kid cannot get his hands on $1,200 or an old
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.360]   computer and no one was collecting old computers back then.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:14.920]   So that was, that was when it really was, do you have a truck and can you carry this
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:17.400]   jump out so we don't have to throw it away?
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.400]   That's what it was like.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.800]   All the stuff that I've gotten storage is mostly, I do have some quote valuable, unquote
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:27.000]   stuff, but that was because I've been going to the MIT flea market for like 15 or 20 years.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:37.440]   And back when I saw Apple, I saw Macintosh 128 go from $150 to $100 to $50 to I have
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.800]   30 of these for $5.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:41.000]   Just take as many as you want.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.240]   Well, you can go out more.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.680]   I've got them in storage.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:49.160]   According to the article, his first breakthrough was buying a collection of 50 Apple computers,
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.920]   a 26 foot long U haul for $2,000.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.440]   He'd save from mowing lawn.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.440]   So exactly.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:48:00.560]   Below that, Apple won a similar Apple one sold at auction last year for $900,000.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:04.000]   So this is a million, probably a million dollar collection at this point.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.120]   He buys from collectors from eBay.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.120]   It's really neat.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:14.840]   His collection of, his collection of one of a kinds like a clear plastic case, iMacs and
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:18.960]   stuff like that and clear plastic, clear plastic newtons.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.960]   That's the stuff that's, that's, that's really cool.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.640]   And it's very cool.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.920]   I'm worrying though that if, when people find out that his Apple one is worth that much
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:36.680]   money, I wonder where he's got it stored and if he's now scared of where he's got it.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.640]   Have you, I mean, that's fairly near to you.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:43.680]   Have you gone to visit the, the, no, but I think any, I think it was trip.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:48.520]   See, that's, that's a new Englander will look at that and say, wow, the kid, the kids sold
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.760]   a mini bike and a snowmish and a snow blow in Maine.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:56.360]   In Maine, that's like everything that you need the mini bike because there's nothing but
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.000]   like forest and dirt trails to have fun with.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.280]   And the snow blower is how you make $2,000 to spend on a collection of, of computers.
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.440]   He, that's a very, very special fan to, to sell those things.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:12.480]   It's sort of like saying I, I sold, we, we were dependent on one well for water and I sold
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:16.800]   my collection of buckets and, and all of our cookware.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.680]   It's like, yeah, that's a, those are key things for Maine.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.960]   Incidentally, Alex, to himself does not use an Apple computer.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.680]   He, he's, he has a home built PC.
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.520]   He just collects them.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:33.520]   It reminds me of Alex Gumpel over here who is a window, die hard windows user, our flow
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.640]   master, one of our engineering team.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.800]   And he collects old Mac stuff and he's got old Mac documents.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:43.680]   It was great because he had a shrink wrap copy of hypercar that we got Bill Atkinson,
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.840]   the sign for him.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.000]   So that was, that's kind of cool.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   So I think there are a lot of these around.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.040]   We're going to go visit the Obi-Wan.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.040]   What is it called?
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.280]   The Obi-Wan Museum, which is up the road of peace.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.280]   You must know about that.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.280]   I've heard about that.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.280]   I don't know anything about that.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.280]   It's a Star Wars memorabilia collection.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:05.240]   So it's a collection of just like every single merchant piece of Star Wars merchandise ever,
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.480]   including prototypes of stuff that never got sold.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:12.880]   And it's, it's not open to the public and suffer by appointment and he can, he does consulting
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.560]   and I've seen it show Obi-Wan.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.640]   We're going to, well, you'll watch the new screen savers.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.760]   I don't, I think it's this week we're going to do a story on it.
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:21.840]   They asked me if I wanted to go on.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.440]   I said, you know, you really should send one of our team that is like crazy about this
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.440]   stuff.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.200]   So I think Father Roberts is going to go.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:33.440]   I mean, I would go, but I think it'd be better to send somebody who's just like, wow, this
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.520]   is the best thing I've ever seen.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.720]   It's a little bit strange though.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:41.560]   I would, I would totally have to like wear astronaut diapers if I ever got to for the
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:42.560]   Lucasfilm.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:43.560]   That's who I want to send.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:50.160]   But, but, but it's, I'm really impressed by Rancho Obi-Wan, but I see all the videos of
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.160]   it.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:55.440]   It's like, okay, here's just racks and racks and racks of puzzles and games and toys.
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.400]   None of it was involved with the actual movie.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.120]   They were commercial stuff.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.520]   And I don't know.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:06.240]   It's like I could, I, I do own a set of, of original action figures because I think they're
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:09.720]   kind of cool, but I don't, I'm not sure how much, how much fun I would have to say.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:14.320]   So, well, here are the 18 different kinds of Millennium Falcon toys that they made.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.320]   Right.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.320]   Well, collect that.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.600]   I guess that's the point is that collectors are obsessive and it's obsessive.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.600]   Exactly.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.440]   They're particular, you know, they have a thing.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:23.440]   Right.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.440]   It's, it's very, very personal.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:29.680]   I have my own collections and some of them are, I almost have to really explain why I
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:34.960]   collect these things because it just seems weird if you see this rack of like little
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.720]   teacups and little like sauce, uh, uh, some sauce cups.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.120]   Well, not teacups.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.640]   I used to, I, I haven't done it.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:45.600]   I haven't done it in a while because, uh, it involved theft.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:50.720]   Uh, but, oh, there, oh, there are hotel teacups or something like that.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:55.360]   Well, it's, it's, I used to, I used to have this thing where like every time I would go
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:59.760]   on a trip, I would try to come home with like, like a little, little, little cannequin or
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:03.480]   a little thing that you put like, like a side order or whatever and have a little cup of
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:04.480]   sauce.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:06.480]   You might drizzle onto it.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:11.000]   It's like what my first trip to San Francisco where I had a wonderful dinner with like 12
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   friends.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.800]   It was such a good dinner that I just decided to take a little rice, a little rice cup with
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:17.000]   me just as memento of wonderful dinner.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   Exactly.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   And then I decided I was doing it like all the time, not, not, not like, again, not like,
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.200]   you know, a heist sort of thing.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.740]   And sometimes I would do, I, I shifted it from actually stealing this piece of table
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:34.520]   where to, I need to con the server into letting me take it, which added extra level of challenge
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:39.360]   and authenticity. And then there came a time where I guess, so I've got these boxes and
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.920]   boxes of things each with labels on them of here's where I had dinner here and here's
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:48.360]   from this, my trip to London on this time. And, and then I realized that I'm spending
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:53.520]   a lot of time trying to, again, try to, so we're trying to get servers to let me see
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:57.880]   exactly the clefta maniacs anonymous, the Schulman Center, we're going to make an appointment
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:02.280]   for you and, and we'll have you there in a moment.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.280]   I don't pull that up.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.280]   I stopped about 10 years ago.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:09.200]   I think that was Jason's editorial comment on it.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:12.720]   We all, we all have those sort of things for his heart. It's hard to explain. Comic collectors
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:18.760]   are the same way when he used to collect, uh, uh, original comic art and, uh, artist sketches.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.200]   I would spend a lot of time waiting in line to get a sketch from a certain artist and
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:26.160]   you swap portfolios, get to see, oh, you, you collect nothing but sketches of Mary Marvel.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:30.720]   Isn't that interesting? Or you collect nothing but sketches of characters with your, uh,
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:34.680]   who are holding your pet, uh, your, your pet parrot. And it's like, again, it's, it's hard
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:38.680]   to explain to an outsider why this is such a cool collection to you, but putting, putting
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:42.880]   things together in a way that makes sense to you is in itself, a active creation. I'm
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:46.880]   just looking at Renee's shot. I'm thinking, oh, you don't collect anything in particular
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:52.080]   Renee. Nothing. No, zero. This will not be donated to a museum when I pass away when it
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:57.480]   all falls on me and takes my life. What is that? Rock 'em, sock 'em robots on your, on your,
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:02.520]   oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, I've kept an American Iron Man fighting
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:08.960]   it out. Yeah. Did you see the movie? I did. Good. Uh, I really liked it, but I'm a huge
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:13.020]   fan of what the Russo brothers in particular have done with, the huge canvas that is a
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:17.000]   Marvel universe. You know what I saw last, uh, last night because it finally came out
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:23.920]   for Renee is, uh, Deadpool. Yeah. That is so inappropriate, but it was really good. It
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:29.040]   was really funny. It's like the movie movie I've ever seen. It is exactly what worked
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:31.640]   about that movie is that they made, they basically took the comic book and made it.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.720]   Yeah. People think, oh, people want Roger. No, no, no, that is just Deadpool put on a
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:40.320]   movie screen. Yeah. That's what my comic book loving, uh, nephew says, Mario says,
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:43.560]   oh, no, it's just exactly what was in the comic. And I guess this guy that they got,
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:49.680]   who I everybody knows, except I don't, uh, was every his name is, uh, uh, he's very,
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:56.240]   uh, appropriate casting for the guy. It's good. Now, now I'm, I'm so eager for, uh, for a
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:01.080]   Deadpool Harley Quinn team up movie. I can't, I can't even tell you that. That's good.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:04.320]   That's, you know what? That can be worth $12 of anybody's money. The tech angle in Deadpool
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:09.560]   for me was, uh, I thought that was interesting because it reminded me very much of the kind
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:15.040]   of humor I see in these YouTube videos where guys are wise cracking while they're playing
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:20.920]   video games. Uh, and maybe that came from the comics and got to YouTube, but I feel like
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:25.160]   this is a, this is a, uh, movie for the YouTube generation. For the first one, I've really
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:28.960]   seen that I think would appeal to the kids who they don't watch TV now. I'm watching
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:33.880]   my 13 year old. He doesn't watch TV. He watches these YouTube videos and he's chortling away
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:38.680]   as you know, these guys are kind of swearing and it's not just PewDiePie. There's a whole
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:45.320]   bunch of these making fun of the game and laughing and it's very much that same style.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:52.480]   Yeah. See that? Feel the love Valentine's Day Deadpool. The most, it is incredibly violent.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:56:01.240]   It's totally sexual, uh, not a Brian Reynolds. That's the guy. Um, anyway, I don't know how
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:04.560]   I got into that. Where do you go from there? Like I don't want to devolve the conversation,
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.280]   but again, it's one of those things where thanks to like the, the continual escalation
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:12.120]   of entertainment, it's getting faster paced and more irreverent is it just, you wonder
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:15.960]   where, where it can keep going. This is very little shock value left. He, the Ryan, this
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:19.640]   is going to be Ryan Reynolds breakout though, because he is Deadpool. I mean, this is,
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:25.280]   it'll make us forget Green Lantern. Thank God. And what is it? Two men and a girl or
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:34.160]   whatever? Yeah. Um, Apple has, uh, Apple supplier Foxconn is about to open a giant iPhone
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:43.240]   manufacturing plant, $10 billion, 1200 acre iPhone manufacturing plant in India. Uh, Foxconn
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:48.040]   is apparently aiming according to a nine to five Mac to open to 10 to 12 manufacturing
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:54.680]   facilities in India by 2020. Uh, makes sense because the Indian government looks a scance
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:58.440]   at companies that don't make products in India. And it's been hard for instance for Apple
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:03.840]   to get a retail store in there. It's hard for them to sell iPhones in India. Um, but I
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:07.880]   think if you're able to $10 billion plant to make iPhones, well, it happened in Brazil,
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:11.080]   right? I mean, that's, those are those famous brick country is the emerging markets. Brazil,
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.680]   Russia, India and China and China, the factories were already there. Russia's a very different
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   market. Brazil has huge import taxes. So Foxconn had to start off expanding into there.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:23.040]   Right. And India has very, very similar rules and they know they're trying to protect their
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:27.480]   markets and grow their economy. And so Foxconn is, if you can't, if you can't go, if you
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:30.880]   can't bring them to you, you go to them. And I, you know what, we reported last week that
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:36.240]   Apple has turned down on the, uh, to sell used iPhones at a low cost in India and they've
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:40.440]   been trying to open retail stores. Go ahead. I'm Sir Alex. No, no. And I think that usually
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:44.640]   what this is referred to as off offset agreements. So, you know, if we're going to, if we're
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:48.560]   going to allow things to be bought here, then we expect you to build a certain percentage
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:52.440]   of those there. Uh, this is very, very common in the defense industry to build parts of
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:57.520]   F 16s or something in, in South Africa for them to buy them. And so these offset, uh,
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:01.720]   agreements, um, are pushed more heavily in the emerging world typically because obviously
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:05.960]   they have a lot of people to employ. It'll be interesting to see whether, uh, Foxconn,
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:10.640]   you know, that this new factory is a next generation factory. We've heard a lot about
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:14.880]   Fox, Foxconn working on automation and so on and so forth. So, you know, there, there's
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:19.480]   maybe an opportunity for them to experiment with, uh, you know, what some of those manufacturing
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:24.240]   processes, uh, may look like, you know, still employ a lot of people. I mean, it's, it's
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:27.160]   going to employ a lot of people, but, uh, that's part of the use of it. So they're not
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:31.920]   going to go crazy, but I bet you, uh, it'll be a lot more modern than what they're, uh,
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:34.120]   even doing in, uh, in China.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:39.400]   It's a big, well, it's the number two market after China, right? And, uh, not being able
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:43.080]   to get in there. I mean, it's very big for new iPhones, but not being able to get in there
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:46.800]   with used iPhones in retail. Uh, they'd love to get that market.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:51.000]   I'm, and I'm sure that India understand, India understands that they have leverage.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.320]   And, uh, and this is the time to use that. If you're, you know, they, they definitely
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:57.680]   have an employ bill, employ, you know, they have a lot of people that are highly trained
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:02.600]   in India. Um, you know, and so, uh, this is something that, that, that they definitely
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.760]   are going to use that leverage. And I think it's in some ways appropriate, uh, to make
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:10.240]   sure that folks are doing that. There's not a cost benefit that would have you not do
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:15.480]   it in India, other than not building the factory, um, because the wages will be similar to, uh,
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:19.240]   to what they're already paying in China. So it's, it's a much easier thing to calculate.
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.160]   The market is so different. It's not as big as China and also the middle class is not
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.240]   as quick as percentage, I believe is China. So the market for new iPhones, uh, is not
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.680]   what, you know, what it is in China even. Uh, and so on. Yes. The second hand yet. Well,
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:34.000]   not yet, but arguably, you know, again, China's bigger and their middle class is growing faster.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:38.120]   So eventually it'll, it'll get there, but short term for Apple. Um, those use devices
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:44.480]   and getting those into stores is really important. What's going on? Try casters going crazy.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:50.520]   Alexander Hamilton. I really, I, I, anti, anti and not go. I felt, I felt like if the
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:53.720]   camera is going to be on B. Over there saying that, at least you're treated by someone.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:58.160]   You did. You were very thoughtful. Like, yes, exactly. Um, yeah, I was lagging there.
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:02.600]   I was like, I think he's pushing the button and nothing happening. Uh, let's take a break.
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:06.840]   You want to reboot the track, haster? Uh, not only gets that bad. Okay. And he's
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:11.040]   so big. So long. It's scary. It's been weird. I think we need to get a new hard drive in
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:15.360]   there or something. It's been a little sluggish up late. We've been rebooting it a lot. You
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:19.680]   know how these things are. These computers, they get old, but when you get an old device,
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.600]   what do you do? You sell it on Gazelle. You don't throw in the drawer. That's like throwing
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:30.180]   a hundred dollar bills in the pro. That is decades. Thank you. I'm going to use a
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:31.640]   micro phone. Thank you.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:37.280]   Gazelle's the place to sell your used devices, get cash for them and you can get a good price
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.280]   too. But you don't have to guess because you go to Gazelle right now and you'll get a
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:47.760]   quote and an old iPhone and iPads tablets from Samsung and Apple and, uh, and even Microsoft
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:53.640]   and Google, uh, even computers and displays. Gazelle buys and pays top dollar. But the
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:58.440]   nice thing is that quote is guaranteed for 30 days. You lock them in the minute you go
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.280]   there. That's a good idea because even 30 days, you're going to see the price dropping
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:06.720]   on almost all these devices. They just aren't getting more valuable. So if you think, even
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.880]   think you might want to get rid of your phone and get a new one or your tablet and get a
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:15.520]   new one, maybe you got a broken iPhone or iPad. They buy those two. Go to Gazelle.com
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:19.400]   right now and get a quote that's locked in for 30 days. You have 30 days to decide. They
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:24.920]   pay the postage. Uh, they will wipe your data if you can't or forget to. And then they'll
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:30.720]   send you a cash as well a check or PayPal credit if you want it faster or get those
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:36.720]   Amazon gift cards and they bump those up by 5%. It's a good deal. And look at that. If
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:40.000]   you're going to go there, you'll not only get paid, but you might want to look at the
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.600]   store where they sell used devices because you can get a $20 credit towards that used
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:50.160]   device by selling your old device on Gazelle. So this is a great opportunity to buy and
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:56.440]   to sell and buy at Gazelle.com. They take the best stuff, the creme de la creme slightly
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:05.200]   used, gently used iPhones, iPads, even the Samsung Galaxy phones. They inspect them.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:10.280]   30 point inspection, guaranteeing them for 30 days, they have a 30 day return policy.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:14.480]   They work on all the major carriers, but they are sold without a carrier contract. So that's
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:20.560]   nice. They even have financing now by a firm at Gazelle.com. You can do that. Check out.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:26.600]   You can get instantly approved for three, six or 12 months, easy monthly payments. Just
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:31.400]   select financing with a firm as you check out. They also have a 12 month warranty for
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:35.320]   cell phones and iPads you buy from Gazelle powered by Assurance Solutions. And it's
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:40.160]   a good warranty. It covers water damage, cracked screens, hardware defects and more.
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:51.040]   A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle.com to buy or to sell or both. You'll even get more money if you
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:58.200]   do both at Gazelle. Thank you so much for supporting Mac break weekly and helping to
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:04.000]   fund. I was talking to the other day, he sent a bunch of stuff to Gazelle. $1,200 worth
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.320]   of stuff to the Gazelle. Awesome. Yeah. I remember talking to one of our hosts who paid
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:13.000]   her rent one month from the stuff she sent to Gazelle. It's great. And she wound up with
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.520]   more space in the place that she was now renting. There you go. I don't know if I want
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:23.400]   to credit Tim Behren with anything because he's an analyst. He's been around for ages
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:27.880]   and ages. Not always exactly right, but he has an article in Time Magazine. The real
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:34.920]   reason Apple made the Apple Watch and it's credible. It's credible. It's on the first
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:41.640]   anniversary of the Apple Watch. The estimate of sales is 13 to 15 million, $2.2 to $3
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:49.120]   billion in revenue. So it's been a good year, but Tim's saying that it's because of Steve's
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:55.920]   illness. Jobs spent a lot of time obviously in the healthcare system seven years from
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:03.920]   the time he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2004, which was death in 2011. And
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:09.360]   he thought that the healthcare system could be improved. We've pointed to Tim Cook a lot
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.760]   for all of the stuff Apple's doing in healthcare, but really it's according to Behren. And I
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:20.880]   think he's probably accurate. It started with Steve Jobs. And that the Apple Watch really
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:27.080]   started as a health device as much as anything else. I guess that makes sense.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:31.200]   Yeah, I agree. Yeah. That's the point of the stuff that I was hearing during the development
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:36.240]   of the Apple Watch. That's why I was actually thinking that Apple was working more on something
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:41.120]   like a really, really good fitness band as opposed to a watch platform.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:47.320]   Where do we go with Apple Watch now one year in? Yeah, again, it's still it's to me, it's
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:52.760]   just one of those. It doesn't have a point of view. It's a very all it has to do is be
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:57.160]   a really cool watch and it's a really cool watch. It's not it's I'm not criticizing it.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.400]   I'm just saying that I just don't think it has a point of view. And that's it'll become
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:07.320]   something much bigger and better once Apple decides what its purpose is as opposed to
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.760]   yours one of those. See other people made one of these and I we've made one of these
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:14.480]   as well. Yeah. Enjoy. Well, and it's one of those that that
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:19.040]   sings well with your phone, which there's a lot of people that that's enough, right?
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:24.360]   Yeah, it really is. I mean, when you look at the whether it's Apple music or the Apple
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:29.040]   Maps or the the watch, you know, they really can they have a market that a built in market
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:32.960]   that's large enough that that they can simply just do something that works well with what
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:37.520]   they already have. And that's the advantage of the of having an ecosystem of, you know,
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.440]   there's a lot of people that just don't want to deal with the cross pollination of between
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:44.960]   devices where they don't feel like they're going to get the best one. So if you decide
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:50.360]   you want a smart watch, which, you know, and I've spent a lot of money on watches and but
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:53.960]   once you start using a smart watch and you have your updates and your phone calls and
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:58.080]   you see what's going on, be very hard for me to go back to a to regular watch. And so
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.440]   then then you're just making a decision about, you know, which watch is going to be what
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.800]   phone do I have and what's compatible and how does that work now? At some point, I think
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:09.600]   these watches become more self-sufficient. But but even then you're really dealing with
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.520]   managing, you know, how you want to interact with your ecosystem.
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:15.680]   Yeah, and there's going to be like right now we're dealing with a very small subset of
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:19.960]   things. And but in the future, a lot of technology, we're going to be tied to like identity,
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:25.200]   remote control, access to all this stuff around us. And now Apple has a platform that they
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:29.680]   can engage with that. I mean, before the show, I turned my Apple watch and I said, you know,
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:33.440]   to the virtual assistant, turn on the studio lights and low there were studio lights turned
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:38.800]   on. And I used them last time I was staying at a loft hotel to get into my room because
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.000]   they have this really fancy technology where if they detect metal distortion near the
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.280]   lock, it looks for a Bluetooth signal because then it can judge proximity and it unlocks
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:50.200]   your door for you that gives you both convenience and security. And that kind of stuff, I mean,
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:54.280]   right now it's very fringe, but you know, you go from fringe to widely adopted in the
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:58.480]   blink of an eye. And Apple uncharacteristically entered this in the early adopters market.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:02.000]   Usually they wait a decade and do it when it becomes sort of a mainstream technology.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.840]   So we'll be interesting to see how they navigate that, but I think absolutely getting this
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:09.040]   technology onto your wrist and looking at the health benefits and notification benefits,
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.660]   the identity benefits are going to be huge for them because the phone was sort of one
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:16.560]   big step that way. And the next logical step, even if it's nowhere near as big as the phone
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:20.320]   business is having that on your on your wrist or at least somewhere that's on you all the
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:24.960]   time. Yeah, but it's we're still in the we're still in the phase, I think, where it's sort
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:30.440]   of like the way that all phones were where it was hard for any one company to distinguish
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:34.880]   themselves because they were when you get down to it, they were offering here, it will
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:39.400]   place and receive phone calls, it will send and receive text messages. It will also send
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:43.680]   and receive multimedia messages. So it has a camera so you can send a snapshot and receive
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:48.920]   one. But there was no no no maker was having a really good time explaining to people that
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:52.960]   ours is doing something that's materially different from from anything the the rest of
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:58.400]   the makers are doing. And in the field of wearables right now, smart watches, it really
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:05.920]   is fitness tracking notifications, actionable notifications from your phone onto your wrist.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:12.000]   And being able to do simple controls and simple tap sort of commands. And really, I don't
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.800]   think that the Apple Watch has really distinguished itself over anything else like that. I know
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:21.760]   a lot of people like like Renee and like Alex who feel as though who would definitely go
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:25.880]   back to their house if they realized they left their Apple Watch at home. If in the unlikely
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:30.560]   event, they would even not take it take their Apple Watch with them. But I know in terms
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:36.600]   of people that I know who had Apple watches a year ago today or during the summer, I know
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:42.840]   equally as many if not more that it's in the rotation somewhere, but they can do without
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:50.400]   it because it was again, it was just for them, it was just one of those.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:55.480]   Speaking of ecosystems, rumor has it, according to nine to five Mac and Jordan Khan that Apple
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:03.200]   is going to have a home kit app, Stanola home kit app in iOS 10. Is it too little too late?
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:07.880]   They've had one internally for a while, you know, because they need one just to do a bunch
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:11.440]   of internal processes. They're kind of hoping that you wouldn't need it that it'd be simpler
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:15.640]   without it. But I think I use the whole map. It's a $10 app that a developer, third party
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:19.400]   developer made and it just makes it much easier to find and coordinate everything. And I think
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:22.520]   that's sort of like the health app that's something that would have behooved Apple to
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:25.200]   have last year, not the year before.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:29.440]   Yeah, so sometimes you really have to focus on how do people interact with something and
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:34.760]   how do people expect to work with something. And Siri is wonderful, but there is a level
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:38.640]   at which people are expecting to have a button to push. And there's a level at which a lot
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.840]   of people don't know what their what home kit can do unless you have a menu in front of
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:47.600]   them, unless you see a list of devices. Also, a lot of these devices aren't terribly reliable
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.360]   mine. Sometimes they will appear and disappear off the net, depending on what's going on.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:58.800]   And so I find myself being about making looking about as foolish as I would have 15 years
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:04.320]   ago saying, Hey, slow mo turn on the office lights. Slow mo turn on the office lights.
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:12.560]   Hey, slow mo office lights on red and slow mo. And there is sensitivity though, because
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:15.560]   I mean, a lot of vendors don't want Apple to sort of take over their apps for them. They
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:18.880]   wanted people to still go to their apps and not just go to some universal home app where
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.840]   they could do everything and never see whatever. I mean, they always put a bunch of junk in
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.960]   their app that maybe you don't want, but they really want in there. So all a lot of these
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.240]   things involved negotiations and Apple sort of say, look, that doesn't work. We tried to
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:31.760]   appease you and yeah, we're going to do it this way now.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.560]   Right. On top of stuff like that, you a lot of these devices, there are a lot the makers
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.320]   are a lot more clever about their own devices than Apple will ever be. For instance, the
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:46.520]   Amazon Echo just added integration with Google Calendar. And it really is I really that's
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:50.280]   one piece of junk mail that I have flagged in my mail server that no, no, no, I know
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:54.800]   this is bass mailing. I want to read that every time. Every time they say here's a
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.560]   here's new features we've added to your Amazon Echo. And now the fact that I can just simply
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:03.040]   bark out, please add this to my schedule or what's going on. What time is my next thing
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.840]   is at four o'clock or five o'clock without having done anything that it simply starts
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:12.160]   up. I would be it would be problematic if I had to wait for Apple to support that through
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.320]   Siri or for Apple to support that through another app. This is it's just like it's just
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:20.480]   like the watch. This is such a new technology and it's so in flux at this point. This is
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:24.800]   a this is a lump of clay that we're all still smacking at with our hands. And we don't know
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:28.520]   what the shape of it is yet. And in five years, it'll be easier to do this sort of thing that
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:33.880]   is utopian in scope for now. It's maybe a good idea to have separate apps on the phone and
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:38.880]   separate apps, web clients so that we can see what's out there on our network and make
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:46.480]   sure we know what each one can do today. It's just I feel like I keep waiting for the home
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:52.040]   automation thing to take off and it's so near. So many problems like they were people were
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:56.080]   complaining about Apple was being overly worried about security. But then we saw all the stories
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.240]   about how easy it was to attack people's NASA networks with all these unprotected Internet
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:03.800]   of Things devices on them. So it did take a while because people had to upgrade infrastructure.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.400]   They're routers and they had to upgrade the hubs that controlled all these things. And
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.320]   now we're getting to a point where it's mature and it's good technology and it's functional
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:14.280]   and it is secure so that by putting in those lights, you're not just giving everyone unfettered
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.600]   access to your house and you don't have to worry about someone remotely unlocking your
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:21.840]   doors and these were all legitimate concerns before. And again, Apple entered that market
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:25.760]   really early. There wasn't a decade of home automation stuff for them to look at and see
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.320]   all those are the problems we're going to solve for X, Y and Z. So they're they're figuring
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:33.280]   out along with all of us. But I think we will see over the next year, the next two or three
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:38.400]   years, especially this kind of stuff just ramp up as as people get rid of get over that
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:42.840]   initial hump. The first deployments are really, really, really hard, especially hard to get
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:46.320]   right. And once those happen, people can start replicating those things and then it goes
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:50.560]   to get more excited, more exciting as you can start linking more and more things together
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:54.760]   more easily. I don't want to say we need, you know, a visual building block system,
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:58.640]   hyper cards for home automation. But something like that will come out that makes it super
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:03.440]   accessible for everyone to sort of control every aspect of their home. One, a lot of
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:08.320]   us are a lot of us are excited about it. I mean, I'm extremely excited about home automation,
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:11.680]   office automation, all those things that kind of you, because you just feel like there's
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:16.120]   just this huge mess of things and you know that you shouldn't have to use your key and
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:20.600]   everything else. But I do think that that caution is warranted in this area. It only
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:26.840]   takes, you know, one bad robbery because someone was able to hack through your hue light to
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:30.080]   it, you know, someone figured out some backdoor that I go through this light and then I get
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.880]   to open the door and then bad things happen. And it only takes one of those before it sets
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.600]   you back by, you know, a decade. So I think that that's what I think everyone's afraid
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:42.120]   of. It's awfully nice that it's awfully nice that you can do this incrementally though.
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:45.920]   Like when he says, I mean, it's there's going to be a lot of fear about if someone had to
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:53.480]   spend $1,000 to upgrade their entire house for automation. But I mean, most of my light
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:58.480]   bulbs now are LED and it's not because I spend $500 to swap out all of my compact
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.840]   fluorescence. It's because every now and then when I needed a new light bulb, I would replace
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:07.280]   that bulb with LED and that bulb with LED. And then suddenly they're all there. I think
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:11.760]   that we're going to get to a point where adding a Wi-Fi chip is going to make a light LED
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.880]   light bulb just a little bit more expensive. And so people will say, well, if it's only
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:21.000]   cost $3 more to have this Wi-Fi enabled and it says here in the box, it'll work with both
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.200]   Google now and Siri. I got that. It's such a hassle to have to turn off that light every
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.720]   time I come into the house. I'll replace this one bulb with it. And then they'll replace
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:33.640]   another bulb with it. And then five years later, your Wi-Fi, you've got all you've got
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:37.880]   all these smart bulbs in your house. You happen to have upgraded your Wi-Fi router so that
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.680]   now it works with all this sort of stuff. And now all your phone supported as well. And
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:45.920]   that's when people are willing to spend the $80 for the extra magic box that will make
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:48.080]   thermostats work and stuff like that.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:55.200]   Speaking of Shlomo, creators of Shlomo have created a new application.
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:03.400]   Herschel. Herschel. We can say Viv until it comes out. Dad Kitlaus, who created, who
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:10.120]   created Siri and sold it to Apple, like five years ago, and Apple has really not improved
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:15.160]   Siri much. In fact, in some respects, it's dumbed Siri down from its original standalone
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:21.800]   app, have released or created a new app called Viv. You want to see a little of Viv at work
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:26.480]   and then I want to know if you think this is revolutionary. Viv understands longer compound
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.360]   sentences and, and I think this is most important, it's an open platform so it can do more because
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:36.800]   developers can make it integrate with their apps more easily. Here's Dag.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.840]   He needs a ride for six people from my office to Madison Square Garden. He needs a ride
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:45.120]   for six people from his office to Madison Square Garden. Viv, he's doing it on his phone.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.920]   Right. So our friends from Uber are going to help us out here. Viv does, by the way,
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:54.320]   not talk. At least didn't talk in this demo as far as I can tell.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:59.240]   I'm going to, when they do actually have voice output, I'm going to, since, and says that
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:03.520]   they pay Adrian Edbinson a lot of money to do his Viv character for the young ones.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:08.560]   Okay. I will get you a camera. Call me Stig.
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.960]   Right.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:18.080]   Viv is working with 1,800 flowers and weather underground in this case with Uber and it
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:25.360]   delivered Uber map and pricing and everything. And it's now actually calling the Uber app
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:29.440]   and finding a ride and tells him.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:34.920]   Right. Well, I'm sorry, Robert. I'm going to have to cancel this ride today, but hopefully
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:37.440]   we get a chance in the future.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.440]   For Robert.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.920]   We're going to cancel this. This is Tech Crunch disruption.
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:41.920]   This is afternoon.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:46.120]   Well, I was surprised. I guess I had the impression that they had bought the company that made
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.760]   Siri rather than bought the technology, but I guess Apple didn't have the money to buy.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:55.160]   No, they bought the, everyone went to Apple for a while and then Dag and some Siri engineers
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.160]   left to go make.
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.760]   Once they've invested, they've got it.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:02.560]   Thank you very much. We're going to do something. Apparently, their non-completes
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:05.840]   competes didn't last long enough to get out of business.
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:12.400]   Well, but I think probably you can do it not as a hiring thing, which is illegal, but
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.080]   as part of your contract, you could say, you know, we'll buy it, but you've got to
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.600]   promise not to make a competing technology.
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:20.200]   But also sometimes your stocks vested at a certain point and you wait around long enough
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.200]   for those thought.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.360]   Usually it's three years, you know, you'll get vested in three years and you can't make
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.800]   a similar project product for some time.
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:32.120]   It's been five years. I think it's reasonable to think that that timeframe ran out.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:36.080]   Now, I want to point out and I showed this yesterday on iOS today, there already is an
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:41.440]   app called Hound from the Soundhound folks. It does a lot of this stuff, but both of these
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:47.720]   are better than Siri and Google now and Cortana and, and it depends on your, it depends on
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:52.520]   the problems that you're trying to solve. Like in, in some ways, Amazon Echo blows Siri
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:56.640]   out of the water when he talking about how it handles queries, essentially by Americans,
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:00.560]   but then you look at Apple TV now and it's handling multilingual. So you can be in France
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:04.880]   and you can say Montlo Moile Beverly Hills cop and it not only will find there for you,
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:08.160]   but it'll recognize that you spoke French in the beginning and then switch to English
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:11.400]   for the title, which is incredibly, when you stop and think about how it's solved that
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.400]   problem. Yeah.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.360]   And Google's doing similar things with now, they're all sort of focusing on different
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:20.000]   areas of this technology and they're falling behind in some getting ahead in others. But
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.960]   I think all of them are doing a really good job in the areas that they're putting a lot
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:26.240]   of attention into and it's just, it's frustrating because you think all of them should be good
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:30.600]   in everything right away. But you know, there is a steady improvement in all of those voices
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.880]   in Silver Time. Yeah.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.040]   And we're really getting to a point. I mean, I think that where, I mean, I see this all
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.920]   the time where you're really running out of programmers. I mean, there are a certain number
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:48.000]   of people that know how to do this and it's not pumping the knowledge. You know, they
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.040]   are, there's a certain number of people that know how to do this and all of them have been
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:56.520]   hired. You know, and so you are not, you know, they all are. I mean, you know, like, if you
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:00.920]   have a specialty as, you know, you're not looking for work, you're deciding where you
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:05.800]   want to work at this point, you know, you know, especially in these kinds of AI areas.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:08.520]   So I think that a lot of them have, you know, they all have their groups of people. It's
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:13.400]   much like automation, automation with cars, you know, the home kit, you know, the internet
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:19.760]   of things and, you know, the AI stuff is just incredible demand. And so, and you can hire
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.040]   programmers, but it doesn't mean that you can hire programmers that really understand,
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:24.360]   you know, how this works.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:28.320]   And Siri just added Hebrew and other languages as well. And they've had Mandarin support.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:31.840]   And I believe Cantonese support for a while too. And adding each one of those things means
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:35.520]   solving for all the intricacies of those languages as well. And Google is doing similar
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:40.160]   things, which requires herculean amounts of effort at the same time.
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:44.040]   It does seem slow work. I do feel like though that having an API and opening yourselves
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:50.400]   up to other apps. So if you install VIV on an iPhone and then install another, say,
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:54.880]   the Uber app, it will add capabilities to VIV. I think that's a very good way to do
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:20:02.000]   that. And the fact that Echo supports so easy to add skills to, it has one problem,
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.200]   which is that you, as Annie said, you have to kind of keep an eye on what new skills
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:10.480]   there are and remember to use them. But it really is an open platform. I like the idea
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:14.400]   of an open platform. And that's one thing Siri and Google now are not.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.480]   Well, they've been flirting with an API for several years. I mean, you keep hearing it
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:21.360]   floated internally. And then for one reason or another, it doesn't get shipped. And I
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:24.280]   think one of the things here, and you can call it a problem if you want, is that Apple
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:29.040]   has this culture of API is that they want them to be rock solid. And they want to make
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.560]   sure that you can depend on them for years once they roll them out. It's not like, you
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:35.240]   know, some companies will just put an API and then iterate on it really quickly. And
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:38.120]   the developers would be like, Oh, I can no longer do this. I've got to change. This is
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:42.800]   terrible. But they get it deployed and they get it moving really quickly. Where Apple,
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.560]   it was sort of things like add this to my calendar. Okay, but you know, you've got fantastic
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:49.560]   how and you've got our calendar and you've got calendar five. And now we have a whole
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:53.880]   bunch of collisions and how do we elegantly handle that? And that apparently has been
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:57.520]   at least early on was a large part of the discussion around that wonder though. I think
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:01.160]   Apple might also be a little politically conflicted about API's. Remember, they were
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.120]   going to open up FaceTime never did. I don't think ever will.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.800]   They're not cussuding to oblivion though. I mean, that was an exception where Steve
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.680]   Jobs got on stage that we're going to make FaceTime open every engineer in the audience
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:14.000]   goes we are. We never heard this. Is that really true? And then they started working
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.600]   on it and they immediately got sued by, I forget, Victor next, Victor X. Oh, okay.
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:23.320]   And they were prevented from that. Yeah, I mean, that there's no face that if you look
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:26.800]   at FaceTime carefully, it is had a glacial evolution. There's no FaceTime conference
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:31.560]   call still. A lot of it has been mitigated by those ongoing lawsuits in Texas.
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:38.560]   It has been five years. You'd think they'd have a serie if they have they meant to have
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:42.880]   a serie API, they have it by now. It's around.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:48.840]   And then I, you know, again, just as Renee was kind of alluding to, I mean, an API is a
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:53.280]   very complicated thing. But five years, Alex, that's what I'm saying that they I think
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:57.560]   they probably decided not to do that. That's what I don't think it's going to be.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.920]   It's easy when you're a little company because an API lets you scale quickly because it allows
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:05.520]   you to work on your product. Once you're a big company, an API means that you now you'll
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.440]   have a instant group of people that are excited about it and an instant group of people that
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:12.360]   will get really upset if you start changing the hooks.
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:16.880]   Right. Well, look at, look at Twitter. I mean, they were open until they got big and
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:20.000]   then they said, never mind. Well, it means like, for example, you'll need to be able
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.080]   to set default apps, which is something that Apple is not letting people do right now.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:27.320]   Like if you want to look for something in plug, if you want serie to access, if you say,
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:30.840]   open this up in fantastical, that's easy. But if you just say, add this to my calendar,
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:34.200]   maybe the calendar database can handle that, but there might be situations where you want
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:38.200]   to do something specific app and you've got to be able to tell the computer to use one
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:42.000]   of the sorry, the iOS to use one app over another. And then how do you set that? And
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.240]   what do you, if you install a new app, does that do you know that that's going to overwrite
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:48.560]   and become your new default when you talk to Siri? So there's a, there's a bunch of things
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:53.120]   that need to be at least on an app in Apple's philosophy of API's that need to be fleshed
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.840]   out before you can deploy that as a stable.
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:58.440]   Well, okay, but the risk is then there's somebody else will do it. And that's what it
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:02.800]   is and others. I mean, is, you know, if you don't do it, you might have all sorts of
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:05.920]   excellent excuses why you're not doing it. But if you don't do it, somebody else is going
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:06.920]   to do it.
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:11.320]   There couldn't bad reasons to take any approach like that. Google now is doing a pretty good
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:16.920]   job of letting not finally, of letting third party apps get their cards into that interface.
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:20.600]   And tap that you're talking about or no, no, no, well, tap is another thing.
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:23.000]   Well, that's right. They opened it up to other apps, didn't they? Yeah, exactly. So
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.760]   first, first of all, get, I'll get things for my feedly, feedly feed appear in Google
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:31.800]   now because it's aware that I'm interested in this one topic. And it seems to work okay,
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:36.000]   but I don't know exactly how many goats they had to slay in order to make that work as
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.320]   well as it does. But yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's always good for consumers when there
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:46.760]   are so many competing platforms out there because whenever someone, whenever like someone
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:51.960]   ends up in, if Apple were ever so silly as to say, well, but you don't understand is the
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:57.360]   difficulty of having a system like that that is open and then, but then you could just sort
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:02.600]   of like wait for the spokesmen start talking and say, yeah, Google now can do it and Alexa
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:06.360]   can do it. So they've solved the problems. You're saying that you're not as clever as
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.120]   those people microphone.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:16.000]   Let's see, what else anything else before we take a break and come back with your picks
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.160]   of the week? We don't have to talk about encryption for the first time in months. That's
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.160]   nice.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:30.480]   Whoa, we encrypted it so well, we can't get to it to talk about. I think we can move on.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.440]   You know, I don't like to do all the rumors on the iPhone seven until we're getting a
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.440]   little closer. There, there's still pretty much rumors.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:40.680]   Every, it seems like every single device that's been rumored, rumored about, you could make
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:46.880]   the case that such a device is built and is functioning and is being considered. It's
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:52.920]   not until like June or July or even August that you start to say whatever is being talked
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:56.320]   about might actually be the thing that's on a container ship at this point somewhere in
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:57.320]   the ocean.
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.800]   But aren't you people? I mean, I looked at these rumors and I was so bored. I mean, they're
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:03.840]   not it's just it's the same thing. It's a phone again. It's not a triangle. It's not shaped
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:09.040]   like a slice of pizza. I mean, I wish Apple would innovate again. No wonder they're doomed.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:13.440]   I want a circular phone. I do want to start a poor whole phone. It will match my Android
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.840]   Wear watch. Oh, it's it's it's there are some interesting things happening. They just
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:22.440]   a Motorola is going to be announcing. Excuse me, Lenovo Moto is going to be announcing the
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:28.440]   next generation of the Moto X first week of June and they did a little X. No, no, it's
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:33.080]   a it's a it's they did a cute little sneak on Mother's Day with pictures of what it looks
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:38.800]   like. And it looks like they've decided that the back plate is going to be either completely
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:44.000]   decorative or it will attach to a bank of pogo pins that are actually on the back of the
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:50.000]   phone itself so that if you wanted to do something as simple as a battery pack or as complex as
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.040]   a much better camera or a network interface, that's something that could be done. Whether
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:26:01.520]   there's a market for that, I don't know. But it could be interesting. Yeah. Oh, and the
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:06.200]   chat rooms telling me that Canadian banks are finally supporting Apple Pay. It's truly
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:12.920]   I added my I knew I knew that because I've seen Renee's Instagram. It kind of threw me
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:17.200]   to see a picture of Renee's Apple watch. It did not have a gate gate information on it.
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:21.600]   Yeah, no, you get great. Well, my bank of course, the bank that my credit card is with isn't
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:25.920]   supported yet because they're there in the coming days. So five of the big banks added
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:32.600]   it. There's still three that are coming BMO TD and forget the last one haven't haven't
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:36.680]   added yet, but they did tweet saying they will. But otherwise we have credit card debit card
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:41.240]   and master card support at five of the larger banks, including Royal Bank, which is really
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:47.880]   exciting. We'll ask Steve Gibson. He's coming up on security now. Opera has announced that
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:55.600]   they have launched a VPN app for iOS Opera VPN. But I remember that a couple of weeks ago,
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:00.560]   Opera announced that their browser would also have a built in VPN. And then Steve said that's
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:05.720]   not really a VPN and doesn't give you the same protections that a VPN would give you.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:11.280]   So I'll have to ask him about this. But it's interesting. It's a it's free, right? It's
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:17.200]   a free VPN. Of course, it's being opera is now being acquired by a consortium of Chinese
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:27.040]   firms. So that's why you might want to inquire is exactly what is it? They did buy a VPN
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:34.320]   company surf easy in the spring. And it might be that this is related to that. And as far
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:38.760]   as I can tell, it's it's free, right? I don't free and unlimited. There's no limit to the
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:44.840]   amount of bandwidth you can use. So I'm gonna wait till Steve tells me it's a it's a it's
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:49.080]   a real VPN. And then I'll let you know. Let's take a break when we come back your picks
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:54.880]   of the week, gentlemen, queue them up. First, I want to tell you why I'm looking so dapper
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:28:00.440]   today. It's trunk. trunk club. Actually, we just sent my trunk back. We saved it. Let's
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:05.440]   see what I showed you my trunk a couple of weeks ago. We saved the polo shirt, a couple
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:11.480]   of slacks and nice chinos and then dress slacks, pair of shoes, I think, and all those swim
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:16.640]   trunks that love some nice. So here's the here's what trunk club is. It's so great.
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:21.760]   And I tell you as geeks, I think we can use this. I don't I'm not a big shopper. I don't
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:26.320]   like shopping for clothes. And maybe you do, but you don't have the time to do it. And
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:29.560]   then there are those of you like me who just really don't want to set foot in a store.
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:35.320]   But wouldn't it be nice for either one of those types to have your own personal stylist
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:41.080]   who would bring the clothes to you would know your measurements, your likes, your dislikes,
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:46.200]   what you're trying to accomplish with your look and then bring the clothes to you. That's
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:49.080]   what trunk club is. It's something I always wanted. I was so pleased when they launched
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:56.600]   this, your personal stylist will talk to you, then put up on a website, some suggestions
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:00.560]   that you'll get to say, yay or nay to from they're picking from 80 top brands. I mean,
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:06.840]   these are really big brands. Then you get your your trunk. It comes in the mail. At
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:11.360]   all of this, by the way, you have paid nothing for this is all free. You go through the
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:16.240]   clothes, try them on, see which ones you like, which ones you don't send them back. And
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:19.560]   it's only when your trunk arrives that they bill you for anything you keep. If you keep
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:24.800]   nothing, you pay nothing. And by the way, they have club houses in Dallas, New York,
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:29.840]   Los Angeles, Chicago and DC. So you can go there and work with your stylist in person
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:34.720]   as well. Now, this is not a subscription service. They will never send you a trunk unless you
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:41.120]   ask for one shipping is always free. You have 10 days to try on the clothes and decide what
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:45.840]   you want to keep and want to send back. Up grade, you I think you remember when I started
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:52.640]   using trunk club, my style got upgraded significantly. Upgrade your style. Premium clothes, expert
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:56.600]   advice, absolutely no work. And by the way, for men and women now, this is something I
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:00.760]   think Lisa had something to do with this she begged them. Please, I want to do trunk club
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:06.400]   too. She too has her own personal stylist at trunk club. Trunk club is backed by Nordstrom,
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:11.760]   by the way. I don't know if you knew that. But that's why they have such great quality
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:17.720]   of clothing and great customer service to everything Nordies is famous for comes to
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:23.320]   your door trunk club.com slash Mac break. They send you all this. If you talk to the
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:27.480]   stylist, it's all free until you keep something and then you then you pay for what you keep
[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:35.200]   and just for what you keep it. It's great. Trunk club.com slash Mac break. I just sent
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:38.160]   my trunk back row and show it to you. But I'm getting I'm getting a new one next time.
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:46.600]   I'll show you my new stuff. It's kind of fun. Andy, you're not go. I have a tip and a pick.
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:51.240]   I've been doing extensive home and office cleaning, which meant that I got out of my
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:58.600]   closet. The my iPod high five and pulled out of a drawer, a Chromecast audio that I hadn't
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:04.640]   been using. And if I haven't been using the iPod high five because everything I do, I
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:10.240]   do streaming to. But here, Chromecast, Chromecast audio cost $35. It's an audio only version
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:14.880]   of Chromecast. You plug it into your iPod high five and you wind up with a really good
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:21.360]   speaker that work will will will stream from not just every Google app, but a lot of third
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:27.360]   party apps on iOS as well. And on the iPad. And it reminded me that the iPod high five
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:31.800]   is a really good speaker and it's too good to just be in a closet. So if you've got one
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:35.680]   in a closet somewhere that you're not doing anything with, by all means, haul it out for
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:41.480]   $35. You can turn it into something that will be your best kitchen speaker ever. The
[01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:48.560]   other my but my software pick is an app that I used a couple days ago called find any file.
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:57.000]   It's on a temple dot org TMPL dot org. And it's sort of like a standalone app share
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.680]   where so you use it for free if you want to pay for it six bucks. And it's sort of like
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:05.600]   imagine what spotlight would be if it were a standalone app and did not search within
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:10.640]   files. So it's for a very specific kind of purpose when you really just want to let
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:15.720]   you get your hands on a certain file. It's a lot faster and a lot more direct I think
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:20.000]   than spotlight because it's not going to contaminate your search results with text files
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:25.320]   that happen to contain that certain word. And it was also it's also a little bit more
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:31.560]   direct and obvious to me. When it finds search results, there's never any doubt as to where
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:37.520]   that file is. I will also search for hidden files. It will do it will let you save searches.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:41.040]   You don't have to remember what spotlight search language is like because you can actually
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:46.360]   just just like you're doing a smart playlist on iTunes. Say please I want the name to be
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:51.400]   this. I want to start with this. I want it to be larger than this but smaller than that.
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:55.360]   Even after all these years, I really have to go to a help page to remember what keywords
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:33:01.120]   to use to just construct that phrase and spotlight to find a file that I want. Because oftentimes
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:04.160]   I'm just looking for what are the files that are clogging up my hard drive. Show me all
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:10.040]   video files that are greater than a greater than a gigabyte or greater than 512 megabytes.
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:14.560]   And for some reason it's a lot I find it's a lot quicker to get this done with this app.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:19.520]   I actually wound up downloading and paying for it because there was a third party app that
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:23.400]   I had installed that for some reason was still throwing up dialogues. There was some sort
[01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:27.440]   of a text or some sort of a system things after I deleted the application that was still
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:31.880]   causing it to send me notifications. And the only way it was one of those things where
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:38.120]   I needed to delete it with extreme prejudice and anger in fury. And that involved basically
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:43.480]   please show me every file of every kind hidden or unhidden that was created by this that
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:47.840]   has the signature of this of this publisher. And so it found me all of these files that
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:51.600]   have been left behind after I had deleted the I thought I deleted the app and then only
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:55.680]   after forced deleting all that stuff, which was a snap inside the app was able to get
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:59.440]   it done. If it was this were a $30 utility, I'd say, well, okay, just do spotlight because
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:03.280]   there's just so much overlap for us. Again, it's share where so you can try it out for
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:08.840]   free pretty much forever. But for six bucks, it really fills in a gap that I think has
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:12.960]   been for me personally has been existing with the search on the Mac for awhile. I just like
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:17.480]   to be able to tab over to a standalone app that does nothing but find files by file name
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:21.680]   for me, no matter where they are, let me do things, do actions upon them in a way that
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:27.960]   to me is more natural than spotlight as good as spotlight is. Nice. Great couple of great
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:32.800]   tips. Thank you, Andy. Let's go to Renee Richie or the other tip of the week.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:37.000]   All right. So I'm going to try this. So my tip is a combination actually I've been experimenting
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.400]   with Facebook live and to spare my normal followers because my account is private. I created
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:45.320]   a page called the Renee Richie to try it on. So I've been doing that. I'm going to do
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:49.360]   that now. But I got I went to the Apple store and I got this sort of scyde cam thing because
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:54.320]   there's nothing worse than janky, you know, shaky video when you're doing something. So
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:57.680]   I can I can press a button and it turns to me and I can explain to everybody watching
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:02.080]   that I'm on Mac break now and I'm showing this robot arm and it feels like the first
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:05.640]   Iron Man movie where it's not entirely under your control. And then I can just sort of
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:10.340]   clip to knock all these things down. But I can move this around and it works really
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:14.960]   well to keep things just totally steady as I'm doing it. And I've done a whole tour of
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.880]   my studio with it. It's got a button on it. We hold it up so you can see more of it.
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:24.120]   It's kind of we have the video if we can I don't know if we can switch to it on my
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:30.920]   on my Mac here. It's very it's kind of weirdly smooth because of the gimbal. And you've got
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:33.840]   three different settings for it. So you can lock it on one of the accesses and just let
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:38.040]   it go on the other axis or you can keep it in this mode which just sort of wants to keep
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:42.760]   it totally steady no matter where you're going with it. And it's really great if you want
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:46.960]   to move around and do things because again I don't watch a lot of Facebook video because
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:50.880]   it's sort of horrible and it's so shaky. I can't really look at it. And with this it's
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:56.840]   just rock steady and it looks stabilized. It looks like that that thing. Are you still
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:00.760]   there? Oh yeah. The video is frozen a little bit. The video is lagging a little bit. But
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:05.440]   it's great because I can I could we did a whole bunch of product demos with it. And
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:09.400]   it's just rock solid no matter how much you're moving around or holding things. And it does
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:12.960]   take two rechargeable batteries. And the first time I did it, it would go the opposite. It's
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:16.880]   got a little joystick on it so I can tilt it and make it move in different directions
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:20.480]   while I'm holding it. And you can reverse the direction on that like a flight stick. And
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:24.480]   I did that by accident and just going the wrong direction. And I sort of did say that
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:28.280]   I was going to get a dunce cap and get demoted to fire Marshall. But after that I got the
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:31.760]   hang of it and now it works really really well. And more and more people are doing sort of
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:37.840]   this live video stuff or just using their phones for photography for video in general.
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:42.720]   And this is much as the optical image stabilization and the new cinema stabilization works great.
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:46.040]   This just if you're moving around and you want those steady shots, it looks really,
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:51.760]   really nice. 300 bucks. 300 bucks. These are always expensive. So don't that doesn't
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:55.920]   that sounds like a lot. But that this is a complicated thing to do. But Facebook Facebook
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:59.920]   video is free. Yes. So it's a Facebook live story. Facebook live is free. Yeah. Very
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:05.360]   nice. And it's a lot of fun. Yeah. Like a hit finish and it's done. Hey. I don't know
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:10.920]   why it froze in my end. That's not unusual. However, is it you're going to keep this
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:15.960]   the Renee Richie account live or I think so because I my Facebook account is private
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:18.440]   and I don't want to change that. I don't want to make it a public account because I use
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:23.120]   it mostly for real world. So you should have a page. Yeah. And this way I'm just going
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:26.600]   to leave the page there and then I'll do a whole bunch. I sort of I've gotten to the
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:30.040]   point where I want to do some of the editorials, especially those things that make you right
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:35.880]   just like furious in video form. Yes. YouTube is. And you can rent. Yeah. No, totally. And
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:38.960]   I think it's more dynamic and you can get feedback from the audience and answer questions
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:42.360]   and stuff. And I like that. And it seems like it's more of a frontier while YouTube
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:47.120]   has become more stabilized and more entrenched maybe. And this just it seems really interesting
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:51.800]   to me. Yeah, it looks pretty sweet. I can actually because you stopped it, I can now
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:57.520]   go back and watch it from the beginning, which is a little disorienting. But it's really
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:03.320]   smooth. That's nice. Yeah. I'm a big fan of it. And again, it's like remember, like
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:07.720]   back in the day, I'm streaming live from with kick on my Nokia N95. And it's sort of
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:13.560]   taken us years to get back to it. Come a long way, baby. That's the QIK program. Not the
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:20.360]   kick messenger KIK Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week. So it's kind of part pick part
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:27.160]   part tip. So I travel a lot. I know people have heard that every once in a while. And so
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:31.840]   so I have a problem that you get into another country and you have your adapter here. And
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:37.360]   then you have this plug. And then you don't have the adapter. You can't figure out what
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:43.560]   to do. So one of the things I carry around that is not very expensive is this cable.
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:48.800]   Now this cable. See, so it's, I'm so very pointed there. There is a in technically this
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:54.680]   is a C14 to a figure eight C seven. It's six inches. So it doesn't take up a lot of room.
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:39:00.600]   Now the reason that this is useful is because in your power adapter here, if you pull up
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:07.120]   if you pull off the power, what you're actually looking at there is a figure eight input there
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:11.160]   or a male, technically a male figure eight. So you can take this little, this little adapter
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:22.240]   here and plug it in like that. Now if you I've been known to take this and actually plug
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:28.360]   my TV to plug the TV from the hotel room into my travel adapter because that works too.
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:35.480]   Well, it comes with so a lot of a lot of a lot of TV's when you're in a hotel, this
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:39.880]   little figure eight C seven, you steal it. And so if you can't figure out, well, if you
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:43.320]   don't have an adapter, right, you don't have an adapter for it, you can plug your computer
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.920]   in, you got to do something about that. So you pull it out of the back of the TV and you
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:49.680]   can, you can shove it into your, into your adapter and it'll work just fine because the
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:53.640]   adapter will handle up, you know, 110 to 240. So it'll do it anywhere in the world. It'll
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:56.840]   work as long as you have a TV with a, with a figure eight. Now the reason that this one's
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:01.560]   useful, this little C 15 is because pretty much every piece of computer equipment that
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:07.160]   has a power supply uses this C 14, this C 13 is the female, which is what we normally
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:11.720]   have, but this is the other side of that. So if you have a, you know, this is what we
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:14.920]   plug into the back of our, you know, a lot of our power supplies and everything else in
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:20.760]   our computers. And this is of course with a regular US plug, but you can go almost anywhere.
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:27.960]   And here is a, this is a European, you know, European plug. And same thing, these C 13s
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:31.880]   are everywhere. You know, a lot of times you can find them in the hotel room. If not,
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:35.160]   you can go to a hardware store and get them. So anyway, so if you have, if you're somewhere
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:39.560]   where you're not where tourists are and you need to get something to convert the power that you
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:44.120]   have that you want to get the, you know, the European or the, or the South African or the,
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:47.720]   you know, the, whatever you can, there you go. That's actually the one I got.
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:53.720]   Four bucks. Really? Four dollars. And these five 12 says that's called a kettle lead to a radio lead.
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:41:01.000]   Yes, I would call it a C 14 to a C seven. Yeah. So it does look like a kettle. And I guess I
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.600]   can see it. Yeah, call it a radio. This one's one point, this one's 1.5 feet. And I suggest the
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:10.280]   six inch one, the six inch one, there's another one that six inches, which will save you like 40
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:14.760]   cents, which is, you know, well, well, but the most important thing is that it becomes something
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:17.880]   you can throw in your bag. You don't need a long one. You don't want a long one, actually.
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:22.360]   Exactly. This, this just converts anything, you know, you don't want it. There are ones that are
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:26.360]   a hard adapter. So there are, you know, these two pieces like stuck together like this,
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:31.080]   the stick out. You don't want that because that's that adds a lot of stress to your, you know, to
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:36.280]   your connection. So the a little bit of three inch or, you know, just just three inches here of,
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:42.760]   of cable will not put stress on your, on your connection within your power supply. And so,
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:46.520]   so anyway, I, I suggest this one, but you can throw it in your bag. And it's not a big deal.
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:52.440]   There it is. Yeah. See, I saved you 20 cents. So, wow, so impressed. But you'd be surprised.
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:56.280]   Care Alex, don't you? How, you know, you know, this is kind of guy. But you,
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:00.440]   you'd be surprised at how often time you get stuck somewhere. And, you know, especially
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:06.120]   because I do a lot of production, literally every piece of equipment has, has this C 13.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:10.040]   And I just need to, if I need to plug something in, and also the connection,
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:15.160]   the connection to this will be a lot better. I mean, the connection from a cable like this
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:20.440]   into that converter will be a lot better than the weird thing that you bought at the travel store
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:23.640]   that's going to plug in, that's going to fall out and all those other fun things. So, it's
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:27.160]   a better connection. By the way, that's one 3500th of an Alex who saved us.
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:28.600]   There you go. Yeah.
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:31.080]   There you go. I'd give everybody a break.
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:38.600]   And somebody's saying this pick is like 0.2, Alex's 0.02, Alex's.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:45.000]   Don't worry. The next time I'm on, I'll, I'll make up. I'll make up. I'll make it.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.240]   I'll, I'll get you something. Because I got a hundred dollar pick.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:51.320]   Actually, we talked about it. I finally got it. This is the Logitech base,
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:59.000]   which is one of the first accessories that uses the Pogo plug on the iPad Pro to charge and hold.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:06.040]   It's a stand. I have it right here for the iPad Pro. Now, one thing I know, I, I guess I knew,
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:10.200]   and I kind of wish that it made a little bit more flexible in terms of angle. This is it.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:14.920]   It's nice. It's well made. It's aluminum. The base of it is sticky. So, your iPad's not going
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:18.840]   to go anywhere. And notice on the back, you plug it into a lightning cable cable. Not included.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:24.200]   And on the front, instead of a cable connector, you've got a light, those Pogo pins from the,
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:29.480]   the smart connector. So if you have an iPad Pro of either size, because it's a work with either
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:33.560]   size, you don't have to think about it. It's just got a magnet and it just attaches. And there it
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:40.200]   is. And now it's charging. So I think that's a really nice with the, you know, maybe like the
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:45.720]   bedside stand or something like that. But the angle is fixed and it's a fairly shallow angle.
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:51.400]   So I just would raise that. So a hundred bucks. I ordered it when we talked about it. What was it
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:56.120]   two weeks ago? And it just came yesterday. It looks like a great nightstand. It's what it really is
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:01.960]   is a nightstand, I think, you know, or if you were watching TV or whatever, something like that.
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:07.080]   But, you know, as long as you understand that that's a fixed angle,
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:11.560]   that's that's kind of a nice thing to have. And I guess it's an okay angle for me sitting here.
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:15.320]   It's certainly good enough to use like this. I don't know if you'd want to draw, maybe you would,
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:19.960]   maybe be okay. It feels a little shallower than I would have hoped. I don't know about drawing.
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:23.560]   The great thing if you're using it with an external keyboard,
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:28.520]   maybe not, maybe don't try to pull it off, I suppose. It's very, well, no, it's, you know,
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:32.600]   it's got, it's got magnets. So it's very easy. You don't have to like fuss with it to get it to.
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:35.640]   Basically, it's like a wireless charger is what it's like.
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:38.440]   It'll be super easy where the smart connector goes in the short term,
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:42.680]   because right now it's only really being used for the keyboard and now for this. But if Apple,
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:46.200]   as they tend to do, propagates us across their technologies and all sorts of battery packs and
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:49.480]   other things like Andy mentioned with Motorola will be super super super super super. There was a
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:53.960]   rumor that this would be the, it might be the iPhone would have these Pogo plugs. And by the way,
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:58.680]   there's, you could, in theory, there's more you could put data and stuff over these, right? I mean,
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:04.520]   I think, I think, I think, I'm thinking about things like nurses workstations and monitors.
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:08.360]   There are next to patients, bed stands where you could just walk in with your tablet,
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:11.800]   put it in there. It collects all the data. So you're interface all the software. Then when you
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:15.480]   take it off, off again, you're taking all the data with me. Yeah. Will it hold the
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:20.840]   phone? Well, hold what? Will it hold it in portrait mode? I've obviously won't charge, but it would
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:26.760]   hold it. Yeah. That's cool. Just, yeah, I was thinking of using these for iOS today, actually.
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:31.160]   That's nice. Yeah. I wonder what the limits is. Like, could you make a full dock out of that?
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:34.760]   Could the data connection support ethernet and, you know, several other things I want?
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:40.440]   Well, that would be really cool. But just even basic, you basically get two lightning connectors,
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:45.160]   you know, if it is able to handle the same data that the lightning. Oh, yeah. I could, for instance,
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:49.480]   charge my pencil while I'm doing this or, or, or have ethernet going out that side and then have
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:54.120]   something else going out the other, you know, the headset when they're 2.5 jackets. Yeah.
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:58.120]   Well, let's see, man. I mean, I didn't even try this, but I presume there's no reason this wouldn't
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:02.840]   be live. Do you have one of these, Renee? No, Daniel Bader reviewed it for us. He got the
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:05.800]   release. I remember you, I remember you told us about it. Yeah, he liked it a lot. Yeah.
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:09.560]   He called it the closest thing to wireless charging you get for your head. Yeah. As
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:15.000]   close as you're going to get on an iPhone or an iPad. It doesn't, I don't, is it seeing the?
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.400]   Oh, it's, it's pairing. It's just taking its time. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:25.320]   It's in the widgets. The widgets, not notifications. Yeah, there it is. Oh, it's so low. I'm,
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:28.440]   glad I'm charging it. Okay. There you go, everybody.
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:37.000]   Mac Break Weekly. Thank you, Renee, Richie. I'mor.com. Always great to have you on the show.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.200]   Can I tease something, Leo? You have doubled your podcast output.
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:44.840]   We're trying. So we're launching a new show. We had, we actually have a staff on I'mor now,
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:48.360]   which is something that's rented. You and I are not used to. It was to two of us for a long time.
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:52.040]   But now we have a lot of great people and it's too much for one show. So we're going to have two
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:56.920]   shows. One is, well, I'll share the name now. We haven't announced it yet, but it's called Apple Talk.
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:02.280]   And it's with Michael Gartenberg, Trinity Caldwell and myself. First guest on the first show is John
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:06.760]   Gruber. And we're talking about the iPhone business. So it's going to be deep industry analysis sort of
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:11.720]   and deep dives, almost always single topic focused. And then the I'mor show, we're going to have
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:15.720]   Michael Sargent and Georgia Dow anchor that and Trinity and I will guest in with some other people.
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:21.240]   And that's going to be more pop and fun and apps and accessories and all that kind of stuff.
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:26.520]   Good. You can go to I'mor.com and look in the podcast section under the hamburger menu
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:31.720]   and see all the shows, although the talk, Apple talk is not there yet.
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:37.080]   No, it should be soon. You got to do one first. Yeah. Well, the first one is in the
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:41.480]   can. It's just we haven't put it live yet. Excellent. Thank you, Renee. Thank you.
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:46.760]   And and the Enoco Chicago Sun times. What are you working on these days?
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:53.560]   Two pieces in the hopper one anticipation of Google I/O the other one stuff that I feel like I got
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:48:01.240]   to wrap up before before WWDC. I'm going to be one of those people who does an Apple watch after
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:06.040]   one year piece. And so that should be hitting about next week or so. Are you coming out for
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:11.080]   Google I/O? No, okay. You want to you could join us on our life coverage if you felt I would love
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:17.160]   to join you for life coverage. All right, we'll make a date. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you also to
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:20.680]   Alex Lindsey. He's at the Pixel Corp. But here's the thing to do with Alex.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:24.600]   You follow him on the Twitter because that's how you'll know what he's up to.
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:29.240]   A-L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A-Y. Right. Yep. That's the best way to do it.
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:34.600]   Mostly silly, but every once in a while, we're doing something. If we've got something I can show,
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:38.280]   I pop it up there. That's usually the safest place to go. Excellent.
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:43.880]   Thank you all for joining us. We do Mac Break Weekly on Tuesdays 11 a.m. Pacific. That's 2 p.m.
