[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Time for Mac Break Weekly to show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Ah, I was exhausting week last week.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   It's going to calm down a little bit this week.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   There's nothing to say.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce you to Andy Inako, the Chicago Sun Times,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   and the Celestial Waste of Band with C-W-O-B.com, wearing his exclusive Pixar cap.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Yes, it really should say on the back that, "Hey, this pet proves I know someone who works at Pixar."
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Right?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I got this at the company store that no one can go to.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Also, welcoming Renee Ritchie from the new I'm More Yellow.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   See, I'm wearing the invisible hat from Pixar.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   It's so exclusive.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   It's from the new Petal Balls.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   It's really comfortable.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   No, no, the ultimate one is just like a green ping-pong ball on your forehead
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   because they're just going to motion track you and put in the right hat later.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   But the problem is when everybody has one, nobody has one.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   [LAUGHING]
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And then, "Oh, look, look, oh, hey, look, it's Alex.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Lindsey, he's at the beautiful--
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I prefer the Pixar visor that you can't see.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   He probably worked at Pixar.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I'm still rendering it.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Oh, yeah, I did the specular highlights on the cowboy's hat.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   He's using a Mac Pro so the rendering will be done sometime next year.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Were you here last weekend?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Yeah, you were Alex.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I was.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You got to comment on that all.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   The Fuffa-Rav.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   What's nice is the transcript from that event was released by--
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Who did that?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Was it--
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Matthew Pansarino.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Pansarino from TechCrunch did that.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   So that's nice.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   So we can actually see what everybody said at the event last week.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   But I think unless you guys have some additional thoughts, we don't need to go back into it.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   But here we are a week later from this.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And this had just broken when we started the show last week.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   This briefing with the five.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   With that hair.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And now seeing that Apple screwed up the Mac Pro.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Any additional thoughts now that you've read the transcript?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Well, I just know that I've waited a week and I haven't seen a new Mac Pro yet.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   So I'm a little low.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Not this year.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   One down or 53 to go.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Exactly.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Could be even more.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And I don't know what you guys thought about this post.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   But there was a post from-- and I don't know him or how good his sources are.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   But there was a post from-- was it OSX News?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Carson, I don't-- you're showing my screen as if I know where I'm going.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I think it was in which he talks about his sources saying, you know, probably not even
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   2018.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Probably 2019 because his sources say they started just weeks before the briefing last week.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Like they just literally started.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   So-- and I guess anyone who's worked on a project knows it doesn't work.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   They have multiple versions of things all the time.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   There's always multiple prototypes.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And all of those are in the air because they never know when an exact-- like the eye of Sauron is going to turn on them and say,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   "What do you have in the pipeline?"
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Right.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   So they have a lot of this stuff ready.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And my understanding is meetings on the stuff have been going on at least intensely since late last year.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   So it might be that, you know, this was one option.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   And as of early this year, it is the option.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   That could have been what changed.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   But they've had things like modular Mac Pros.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I wouldn't take that as a literal.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   This is by the way, I'll give him that now because I found the site.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   It's OS News and it's Tom Holwerta.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And he says, just from his sources now, based on his sources, he also says that, you know,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   what happened-- and this is the interesting paragraph-- is, why did Apple do a 180?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Well, after the announcement of the new MacBook Pro with Touchbars,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   orders for refurbished old MacBook Pros supposedly went through the roof.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And after the initial batch of reviews came out, they shot up even higher.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   This response to the new MacBook Pro with Touchbar took Apple completely by surprise,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   combined with the problems surrounding the LG display and the constant negativity
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   from professional app users or Apple users, the company decided to double down on professional users.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Does that make-- is that credible?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   It made different people win arguments.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   So like, there's arguments all the time.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   No, it did.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Like, some people were arguing that we have to make our own displays.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   We absolutely cannot see this territory.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And other people are like, "This is what you were saying last year, right?"
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And when things like that happen, they can get turned around on one review or one journalist
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   or one-- like, any queue turned them around on iPad Mini.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And that happens all the time.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So the LG display is fine.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   It's like, "Oh crap, we can't leave this to LG.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Get dust off that display. Get it going again."
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   So this to me reads like they got some information and inferred a lot because the Touchbar,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Apple, absolutely believed everybody, or at least people-- a lot of people thought
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   that people were just going to love it.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   They were going to see it.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   They were going to love it as much as people at Apple did.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And that turned out not to be true.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   And that caused them to reassess things.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   But each of those things do not add up to this.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Okay. Good. That's why I brought it up.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   So you can--
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   It's just anecdotal.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   That's which means it's not necessarily not true, but you take it for, okay.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Someone told me something and this is how we interpreted it.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   You know why I bought it?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   It's sad and credible because, you know, I, in fact, traded in my Touchbar,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   for the function key version.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Not the old one.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   It's a refocus.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Yeah, so I thought you were going to say the functional version.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Well, it's just not off the mark.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   It's not so bad.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And I'm actually really happy.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   It's the 13 and it's got function keys.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   It's from October.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   I know it's not as fast as the 15-inch that I bought with Touchbar.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   But for me, it's more functional to use it.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Well, I know for us, we have, we have a couple retinas.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And for us, you know, they're all on lease and we have to figure out
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   what to update them to.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   And I have a feeling we're just going to update them to the last version.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   I don't think we're going to jump to the, I might have one or two of the ones
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   with the, with the, you know, with the bar.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   But yeah, it's just, they just don't serve our purpose.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Laptop magazine survey.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Mac, Apple has fallen to one, two, three, four, five, six, the place.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Fifth place, tied for fifth place in the best and worst laptop brands.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   That's not good.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Now that's laptop magazine and, you know, most of these other ones are windows
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   machines.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And actually, though, I would say, you know, number one's Lenovo,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   number two, Asus, then Dell HP, surprisingly, but I agree.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Acer, I agree with this, then Apple, MSI Razer, Samsung and Microsoft.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And this is based on, they do include reviews.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   What was Apple last year?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   It was number one.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Right.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   That's a big drop.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Apple was one Asus and Dell.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Let's see, I don't know where, but it's a drop.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   See, here's the, actually, this is the graph that you want.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And I'm kind of surprised that the Razer is as far down as it is.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   We just, we just got a Razer in the office for some other stuff that we're doing
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   and it is amazing.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Apple was in second place, 2013, second place, 2004.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Is this Apple?
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   No, that's, I can't, I can't read this.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   I can't, I can't read this graph.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   No, that's Lenovo.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Sorry.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Apple, here it was.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Apple was first place for four years running.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   That was the red triangle and then boom.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Dropped 5.5 places.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   That's got to be on the touch bar, right?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   We're reviews.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Well, and off the lack of peripheral connections.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   I think it's, I think one of the things that really hit them was the peripheral
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   connections.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   See, I put poos then.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   I don't think that's, it's not that, it's not that things are bad.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   What's happening with a lot of this stuff is that it's super divisive.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.500]   It's like Apple used to put out products that 80% of their users could use and now they're
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:54.000]   putting out products that 50% like and 50% hate and that's a very different position.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Or maybe it's better to say they're putting out products that aren't for 80%.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   It's for 20% here, you know, 15% there, 50% there.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   And I was just reading Horace Deggio was saying how much he loves the touch bar because now
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.200]   he can give presentations without messing with the screen and Neil Seibert has an in defense
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.800]   of the touch bar thing up today.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.000]   And people, other people are saying this is the worst thing Apple has ever done.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And so it's not that everyone thinks it's terrible.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.080]   It's that it is another, listen, a long line of recent products that are divisive.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.000]   It's very much like the Apple watch, isn't it?
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Well, it's like, no.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.720]   It's like, you hate the new keyboard, some people like it, some people hate the new touchpad,
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.720]   some people like it.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.720]   It's very divisive.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:32.680]   Well, it's divisive, but it's not, it's divisiveness is good when it's a product like the iPad versus
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.520]   a product like the iPad, excuse me, like the MacBook Air.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:42.160]   It's not a good thing when you for really no intelligible reason are alienating a whole
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.680]   bunch of people to throw in a feature that's again, you're absolutely right that some people
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.760]   love and some people hate.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.760]   It's defending the decision that, okay, but why did you have to put in this piece of crap
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.760]   keyboard?
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:02.240]   Why did you have to add the touch bar, but also take away mechanical function keys?
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:09.760]   Why did you have to put in all USB C and not put in even one legacy USB three port and
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.760]   given that you're getting two grand, sometimes three four grand for this device out of people,
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.680]   these people have a right to say that I'm, I want something that works for me.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.280]   I don't want something that makes for a good keynote.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.080]   I don't want something that makes you, makes you really excited about design.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.040]   I want something that is actually going to give me value for money.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:33.520]   So I don't think that's playing the game at a very, very, at the NFL level, if you're
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.560]   saying that, well, we decided to throw out three things that people like to put in one
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:42.160]   thing that half the people are going to like, which is a game I thought they played with
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160]   the MacBook Pro.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.680]   I think that for me, it really should be the MacBook executive as opposed to the MacBook
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.920]   Pro, you know, as a pro user.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.640]   Oh, that's an interesting designation.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.080]   The people who I think think that it's great are not people who are really trying to put
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.760]   a bunch of connect, a bunch of stuff to it and make it, make it, you know, work with
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.320]   a lot of different inputs.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.960]   I think that executives, I think a lot of people who designed it are thinking, well,
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.960]   this is great.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.080]   It's convenient and you don't need that many peripherals, but people like me will use
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.360]   all of those dongles all the time.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.440]   You know, and that's, that's really annoying.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.440]   My own complaints go away if you call it the MacBook Air Pro as opposed to the MacBook
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.640]   Pro.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.360]   If you, if you did, if they did what they did with the MacBook, nothing, which is we are
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:29.280]   putting this rather radical design alongside everything else we make.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.200]   We're not going to say that you don't, if you want a MacBook Air, now you have to have
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.600]   this instead because we're not going to sell the other thing anymore.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.200]   So if they just said that we're going to have a new class of MacBook Air because we, our
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.400]   research has shown there are a lot of people who are consumer-ish in Seoul, but occasionally
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   do pro like things.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.400]   Great.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.680]   But we're also going to give you the thing that's a bait out of milk crates, lash together
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.360]   and has, has, has faucets for the, for the liquid cooling system that's going to be
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.720]   required for all the horsepower that's going to be in this machine that gets 40 minutes
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.360]   of battery life because it is really that powerful pro users.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.280]   Well, I think that they had just replaced, if they had replaced the, the right side with,
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.400]   with USB-C and left the left side alone, I think all of the complaints would have gone
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.400]   away.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.400]   And we just been, oh, wow, USB-C.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.400]   It's about the connection.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.400]   The connection would have gone away.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.840]   But, and I think that might be a little misguided because, I mean, the future is USB-C.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.980]   All laptops, you know, are going to be coming out with USB-C now and, I mean, I guess,
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.340]   I mean, it's, yeah, I mean, it's just that the future isn't here yet.
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.300]   You know, you know, and so the thing is, is that, you know, and, and Apple needed to
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:33.320]   figure out how to build all those cables and really work with folks on it rather than just
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.320]   stick it out there.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.540]   I mean, yeah, the, the, the, you know, the future, of course, is not having headphones,
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:43.360]   but, but I bought five of these and I'm down to two, like, keep on losing them.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.220]   And I do not, you know, I bought five as well.
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.740]   And I am down to two as well.
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.500]   He's holding up the lightning to headphone jack.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.500]   Connecting.
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.500]   Yeah.
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.100]   And so, so the thing is, is that the, you know, the, this is like this constant issue,
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.860]   the, the, the state of, you know, there's not enough of the wireless, you know, Apple's
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:05.500]   AirPods out there and the state of the Bluetooth headphones are, you know, horrible.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.900]   You know, I mean, like, you know, I tried most of them and none of them, you know, they
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.100]   all break up at some point.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.140]   And it's not the same audio quality.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:16.580]   And so, so the thing is, is a lot of people that really want to have a solid connection
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.860]   all the time, you know, still want a wired connection.
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.820]   And it's just, it's every time I can't find the connector, I feel like an idiot.
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.500]   Just a offbeat question.
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:30.060]   Did they remember they dropped the cost of dongles by half?
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.700]   They said just for the end of the year 2016.
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.940]   And then they said, is it, is it still half off?
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.940]   It's still pretty cheap.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:37.940]   I think it recently just ended.
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:38.940]   I think it ended.
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.940]   Okay.
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.220]   So a USB C to USB type A is $19.
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.860]   That's not bad.
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.340]   Thunderbolt three to thumber about $250.
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.100]   Yeah, you know what, they didn't go up all the way back, but they went.
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:56.020]   So USB C to the multi port adapter, 70 bucks.
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.740]   They are kind of coming back, aren't they?
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:58.740]   But not, yeah.
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.220]   But for me, it's not, it's not the price.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:06.700]   It's, it is the having a computer in my backpack and saying that, yeah, that I didn't, I didn't
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:13.300]   foresee that I would need my, an ethernet connector or USB, a USB 2 point, whatever a connector
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.840]   or I thought, like, just, it's just like you, you, you losing those, those headphone
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.840]   donals.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.180]   It's like, I really have to buy them in just batches and batches and batches because at
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:28.340]   some point I've got eight minutes to leave my office to make my train on time.
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.980]   And so I said, I shouldn't do this, but I know that I've got the right adapter in my
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:32.980]   backpack.
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.060]   I'll just steal it from there and put it in my laptop bag.
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:40.020]   And now it's not in the, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it just keep coming back to
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.720]   the idea of why do you have to take things away?
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.340]   Why can you not simply add?
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:51.660]   It was the, we won't talk about the new Samsung phone, but I couldn't help but think that.
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:56.240]   So after all the speech about how, oh, and look all the space will get back to put new
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.240]   great things in here.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:03.040]   If we just take out that awful headphone jack that nobody wants to use, say, okay, so again,
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.120]   they, the, the new Galaxy phone has a huge screen where there was no bezel left on it.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:13.160]   So all the elect, the entire face of this thing is going to be displacing place, places
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.940]   underneath it that they could hide other components.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.080]   They've also added a whole bunch of other stuff that the iPhone doesn't have, including
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.860]   a card reader and it has USB C and it still has a headphone jack.
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:27.900]   So somehow they figured out how to just add cool stuff without removing cool stuff.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:34.400]   And it just keeps that, that the way that they launched that device in September, Apple,
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.580]   it just, it's just looking dumber and dumber.
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.980]   I wish they, I wish they just like we could make whatever we want.
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.580]   We've decided that this is our way forward and we know the people, well, people follow
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.580]   us.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.780]   Well, and I think that the thing is that they could have just had the AirPods launch and
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:52.980]   then have people think about how great those are and spend a year getting supply up and
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.900]   making sure that it worked and, you know, trying to get, you know, other folks using
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.620]   the new, the new platform and so on and so forth without taking the headset away.
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.580]   I know that there's some pressure on that, but for instance, we, we sit there and talk
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:09.140]   to people who are doing high end pot, high end Facebook lives to, with their phone and
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.740]   we have to tell them, you know, if you really want to get the highest quality, you have
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.460]   to actually use a success.
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.900]   You know, and that is like, and that's kind of a hard thing for them to understand.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.540]   They're like, well, I got the seven and I'm like, mmm, really?
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.540]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.220]   Because the, if you want the highest quality, you're going to want an ethernet connection
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.700]   to your phone and you're going to want to basically pipe XLR through a converter into
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.020]   the head zone, into the headphone jack.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.260]   And so, you know, if you, so if you really want to squeeze the most out of your phone
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:39.100]   to do something, you know, great with your phone, you are not going to use a seven.
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:45.020]   Nine to five Mac does have an article actually coincidentally published today saying with
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.900]   a list of less expensive alternatives to Apple's USB-C dongles that they think are
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.900]   pretty good.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:55.940]   You have to be careful with USB-C as we learned from Benson Leong at Google back when Google
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:01.740]   was, you know, like the only people using USB-C because improperly made cables, cables
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.820]   that aren't up to spec and damage your device.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.900]   Oh, and here's some really, you know what?
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.540]   I've been, all the bad news I've been telling you, this is some good news.
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.900]   Macs are now compatible with the new Titan XP from Nvidia.
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.900]   This is really great.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.660]   Oh, it's the Cheesegrater Mac.
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.060]   Oh, what is it?
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.660]   What is the thing called the external?
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.260]   I got a couple of those laying around.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.340]   I got to go find them.
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.340]   Is that silly?
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.340]   I have the last Cheesegrater Mac.
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.580]   I already upgraded the video card.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.180]   I put as much RAM and as I could.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.140]   Would it be silly to put a Titan in there?
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:39.620]   I mean, I think it mostly depends on whether your purposes are going to be.
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.620]   It's a four-year-old because they're going to be cuter.
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.300]   Mostly depends on whether you're using how much GPU you're using.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.300]   Okay.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:51.900]   It's not going to be bandwidth hampered by the bus or I guess it's PCI Express.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.900]   It's not going to be so that's fine, right?
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.900]   It's not.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:57.900]   I can't imagine.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.740]   I don't think you'd use it as a general purpose thing.
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.700]   I think if you did it, you'd be using an application that is extremely heavy.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.700]   I'll be honest.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.620]   I use my Cheesegrater as a Windows machine for gaming.
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:11.580]   I think you probably find that it was a pretty good gaming machine.
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.860]   Makes me want to get some...
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:14.860]   It is right now.
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:15.860]   They're stacked up somewhere.
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.860]   They're like stacked up somewhere.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:17.860]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.180]   It's only $1,200 kids.
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.380]   Limit two per customer.
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.180]   Why would you...
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.340]   Oh, shucks.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.340]   Only two?
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.340]   I want to put four in.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.340]   What's the other one?
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.340]   The titanium.
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.900]   You don't need to get the XP, Titan XP.
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.060]   This is the new Pascal platform.
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.900]   That's why some people might be interested in it.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:41.900]   I can't remember.
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:42.900]   It's not even a 980.
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.980]   I haven't the Cheesegrater.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.860]   It's before that.
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.100]   But it's fine.
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.300]   I don't use it so much as the kid uses it.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:55.580]   But he plays all the tough games on it and it works just fine.
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.580]   I...
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.740]   Apple, just release.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.540]   Just take update the Cheesegrater.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.020]   Just update the Cheesegrater.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.660]   That would have been great.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.660]   You could choose this one.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:05.660]   We're re-releasing the Cheesegrater.
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.580]   I mean, the only reason they're not doing it is because it'd be embarrassing.
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.580]   That's all.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:16.660]   I do think that as a pro user that would probably buy a lot of these machines, I think that
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:22.620]   if Apple really spent its time thinking about building an actual pro machine, one that looks
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:28.380]   awesome on your desk, you can stand it up with a stand, but it's 19 inches long so
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:34.300]   that you can actually two you or three you, that you can slide it into a rack mount.
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.100]   And then all the components slide right in.
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:41.020]   You can put your graphics cards and slide them in and just slide them all in and it's
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.100]   all nice and easy to pull things out.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.100]   So it's very Apple.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.100]   It's very shiny.
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.700]   It's very easy to use.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.700]   It just works.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:48.860]   All of those things.
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:53.580]   But think about the users that are actually using those because I know a lot of people
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:58.180]   that would, if they did that format, that are pro users that would go crazy and buy
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.580]   lots and lots and lots of them.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.700]   I'm just intrigued by the idea of, Apple's engineers are, you know, absolutely top of
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.420]   the list and their creativity is also top of the list.
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.100]   And I think that it would be a really interesting challenge for them to be thrown sort of an
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:16.460]   Apollo sort of project for the new Mac Pro and say that, okay, here is the deadline.
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:22.100]   You're going to ship a new Mac Pro on February 12th of 2018.
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.700]   You may waste anything but time.
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.040]   And that is your hard deadline.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.660]   And so if it gets them to say that, well, tell you what, if we actually just recycle
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:34.300]   the cheese grater design that we work, we can modify the tooling.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.820]   We know how we know the thermal, the thermal operations of it.
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.660]   And also we know that we can rack this stuff.
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.660]   Okay.
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:40.660]   So we got the case designed.
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.660]   Okay.
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.660]   GPU.
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.660]   What if we were to simply support regular, regular off the shelf and video GP?
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.300]   That's another eight months that we can take off the schedule.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:52.900]   It would be an interesting challenge for them to sort of met to fit to say that, no, you're
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.100]   not allowed to have customs, custom chips for everything.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:02.660]   No, you're not allowed to run this through 18 different design cycles to figure out what
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.620]   the chamfer angle on this should be.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.860]   It's like, it's a box along with its right angles.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.260]   I just want to put their coffee on it.
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.260]   Okay.
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.700]   Maybe put some weather sealing underneath that seam in case they spill their coffee.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.800]   That's fine.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:19.220]   You forget that the iPod was the first iPod was a crash project that was done in a lot
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.580]   less than one year.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.620]   And a lot of reasons why they were able to do it is because they said, okay, here's
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.780]   a company that has a software.
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:25.780]   We need great.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.780]   We'll buy it.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.780]   We'll use it.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.780]   Okay.
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.780]   Here's an operating system.
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:30.780]   Great.
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.780]   We'll buy that and use it.
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.420]   And that's how they got the all they needed to make is the stuff that was inherently Apple.
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:38.660]   The stuff that made it a music player was largely off the shelf.
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.920]   April 7th was the deadline from the Turkish crime family.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.080]   Did Apple pay them off?
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.080]   Or what?
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.080]   We'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.080]   And you're not go.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.920]   Renee Richie, Alex Lindsay, it's Mac Break Weekly.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:56.560]   Our show today brought to you by a new sponsor that makes a product or a website really free
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.240]   website that solves a problem.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.760]   People call me about all the time.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.080]   It's often small business owners saying, well, you know, I need, I need some network
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.640]   security or I need an account.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.900]   I need an accounting system or I need and where can I, where can I, how do you know,
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.700]   and the thing is what you first do usually is you Google it, but then you get just this
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.300]   kind of list of stuff and you don't know how useful it is.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:26.980]   So let me tell you about Captera, the smart way to find business software in 400 plus
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:27.980]   categories.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:32.820]   Let's say, let's say you're, you know, you work for a doctor and the doctor said, hey,
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.540]   look, you got to find me some medical practice management software.
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.820]   I'm tired of doing this all on paper.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:38.820]   And where do you go?
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.840]   Do you just Google medical practice management or go to Captera?
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:50.660]   You've got all of the products listed with verified reviews, product ratings.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:54.780]   So you can look at them all one by one links right to the website and you can even drill
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.780]   down.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.780]   Do you need, does that have to be HIPAA compliant?
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.380]   Do you want, is it multi physician?
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.820]   Do you want to be able to do billing as well?
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:06.780]   And then you can filter the results and come up with solutions that give you exactly what
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.580]   you're looking for.
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:12.300]   And then when you look at it, you can see the reviews.
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.940]   You can see, you can see how it works.
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:19.940]   You get all of the information by going right to the software.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.740]   You can even have a comparison chart and get three or four together.
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:27.620]   Look at this nice interface and let's press compare now.
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.380]   This is Captera and it's free to you.

[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.380]   You don't even register.
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.980]   Do you see a register button here?
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.980]   No.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.320]   They don't want information about you.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.180]   That's fine.
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:01.020]   It's just a free resource that will make it easier for you to make the right software
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.020]   decision.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.780]   200,000 ratings and reviews.

[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:23.820]   It is free.
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.980]   And there's no sign up.
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.980]   This is awesome.
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.780]   I finally have a resource I could point people to saying, I don't know about accounting software,
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.980]   but you go to captera.com/twit and find out more.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.980]   We thank them for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:43.060]   The Turkish crime family, the best hacker group name in the world.
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.060]   They're probably from North London, which means they're not from England.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.060]   Yeah, they're from England.
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.060]   They're not a family.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.060]   Oi!
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.060]   Oi!
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.860]   I'm going to Turkish crime family.
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:52.860]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:53.860]   You can't compete as well.
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.180]   I always end up competing on the side.
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.180]   I always end up competing on the side.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.180]   Mary Poppins.
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.060]   Anyway, April 7th, they said they had more than half a billion now.
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.740]   They went up to like 637 million iCloud accounts.
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:09.820]   And they said, if Apple, if you don't pay us, we're going to wipe phones and wipe Macs.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.180]   And I haven't heard any word about wiped phones and wiped Macs.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:18.380]   And so the question is, was this all BS?
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.380]   Or did Apple pay?
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:23.300]   The Turkish crime family said Apple paid.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:31.940]   They told SC Magazine in the UK that they got a Bitcoin payment of $400,000.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.660]   It was something was paid and it was 401 Bitcoin.
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:41.860]   Early in the evening of April 7th, it was from an obfuscated Bitcoin ID.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.300]   Was it Tim?
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.300]   We have no proof that it was Tim.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.900]   We have no proof it was Tim or Apple.
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.860]   But wow, that's kind of interesting.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:56.460]   It sounds like maybe Apple after downplaying this all actually paid the Turkish crime family,
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.460]   which would not be a good precedent.
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.820]   Would you pay because you pay them and then they're just going to release it?
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.420]   You have no terrible precedent.
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:02.420]   Terrible precedent.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.820]   It has to be fine.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:04.820]   I doubt it.
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:05.820]   I doubt it too.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.620]   But also they really stuck their neck out saying that Apple stuck their neck out saying
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.820]   that we're not going to, you know, this is not how we do business.
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:17.740]   So they would have had the ability to just on the shnide saying, you know what?
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.660]   We check one of the sofas and one of the lounges.
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.620]   We found $630,000.
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.260]   So we pay the $400,000 and bought pizza for everybody.
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.580]   We can consider the case closed.
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:29.420]   But again, once you go and say that we're definitely not going to do that, yeah, you
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.260]   better not do that.
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.860]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.780]   A number of people pointed out, well, one, you know, if you really wanted to prove you
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.700]   could do it, what do they do in James Bond movies, right?
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:45.740]   If you as a supervillain want to prove that you could blow up the world, you do a little
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.300]   demo.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.900]   They could have white to phone or two, right?
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:53.260]   And said, oh, so what happens is coincidentally the Turkish crime family is throwing a big
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.260]   party that night.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:28:00.820]   The book puts on a tuxedo and they rent a car and they get a vacation to that party.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.260]   No, it's a class is Tim.
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.260]   I was.
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.260]   Shake a not stirred.
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.260]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:09.060]   And he infiltrates it and Johnny does some kung fu and gets the list and they that's how
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.060]   it works.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.060]   Right.
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:16.420]   So a Turkish crime family spokesman told SC Magazine the funds might take a while to
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.420]   transfer.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.020]   No funds had appeared in the wallet that they proposed.
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:29.180]   However, they did post a payment of 401.731 bitcoins in the early evening of April 7th.
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:33.380]   So where did that come from?
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.140]   Did Apple pay the politicians?
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.140]   Politicians terrified.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.500]   They're going to actually release this.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.300]   Maybe.
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.660]   I don't know.
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:45.380]   Everything we wanted to ban turns out we did it and it's in iCloud and we're to prepare
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.380]   for it.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.380]   We're terrified now.
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:52.580]   Great article by Troy Hunt who is a Microsoft regional director and MVP.
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.140]   Here's where the Apple account hackers are.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:59.060]   Here's where the Apple accounts that hackers are threatening to what came from.
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:09.780]   And he's talking about the dump that Zach Whitaker and ZD net got of sample data and going
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.100]   through.
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.380]   It's actually really fun to read how this did.
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.980]   By the way, the top 10 passwords in this data.
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:22.620]   Number one, football 95 with 2,345 accounts.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:27.900]   Disney one and 800 was 1270 accounts.
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.540]   Blank was 841 accounts.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.300]   I love people and their passwords.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.140]   123456 was 773 accounts.
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.860]   You know, these people could be wiped.
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.900]   I mean, really, if your password is 11111.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:43.220]   They're not rank as high as I thought it was 344.
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.980]   People had the word password as their password.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:46.980]   Yeah.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.620]   It's said that's when Leo it said type password.
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:54.980]   One of the best ways to get somebody to choose a better password is just to simply email them
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:58.660]   or text them a link to that doc that says here is in 2017.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.460]   Here's what the 100 most common passwords as reported by system administrators were.
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.860]   And you don't have to shame them.
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:08.100]   But if your password is on this list, realize that you're not.
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:12.620]   If I have this access to this list and you have access to this list, the bad people also
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.740]   have access to this list.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.780]   It's really funny when I was setting up my iPhone after updating, I wiped an iPhone
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.780]   and set it up as new and it asked me for a pin code and I was in a rush just to get
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:21.780]   screenshots.
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:22.780]   So I just typed in 11111.
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:23.780]   It goes, I'm sorry.
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.780]   That's a commonly used pin code.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.420]   I'm like, I just need to make screenshots.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.420]   2222.
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.420]   Sorry.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.460]   That's a commonly used and it started to become a stressful situation for me to find something
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.780]   that I just lose for screenshots.
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:33.780]   Were you ready?
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:34.780]   Yes.
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.100]   So it's not going to stay that way.
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.100]   I just had a document.
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.100]   I don't know what I'm saying.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.660]   That's where the phone says.
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.300]   I think that you all sorry.
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.300]   Time out.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:47.100]   I'll let you read Troy's article and follow his logic.
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:52.100]   But the conclusion is the the it's he says it seems most likely the list of Apple accounts
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.820]   wouldn't isn't in fact hundreds of millions.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.620]   It's instead less than 53,000.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:00.780]   He has good logic behind this and it's predominantly compromised.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:01.780]   A vote.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.460]   Evanie accounts and a small handful of others.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.620]   But so that's interesting.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:13.140]   You know, once you put it through the put it through his funnel, you know, it's a it's
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.140]   a much smaller number.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:20.460]   Nevertheless, I mean, even if it were 53,000 people, Apple would, I think, be concerned
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.660]   about this.
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:23.660]   I don't know.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.940]   Anyway, there's the Turkish crime family, by the way.
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.900]   Good looking fella.
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:29.980]   Good looking fella.
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.460]   Probably not the Turkish crime family.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.460]   I should point out.
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.460]   There you go.
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:34.460]   That's a much better.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.500]   That's a that's a much better Turkish crime.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.020]   We're looking at their Twitter Twitter.
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.020]   Profust interesting article.
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.020]   Huh?
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.980]   Maybe they're going for the double bluff.
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.980]   It could be.
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.980]   We don't know.
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:46.980]   We don't know.
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:47.980]   They did claim to get payment.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:52.020]   They they had a blockchain link.
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:56.460]   They say you can't prove it's Apple because they used a tumbler to obfuscate it.
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:00.780]   Yeah, I just don't know because you you pay them and then they'll release it like you
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.980]   have no guarantee they're not going to release it anyway or maybe they have another 500,000
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.580]   next week that they didn't tell you about it and they want double the money.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:10.540]   It doesn't seem like a guy named Jonathan Levin, who is a co-founder of chain analysis
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:17.140]   in the digital currency entrepreneur says that in fact that Bitcoin exchange was a internal
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:25.340]   treasury move of Bitcoin at a Korean Bitcoin exchange, not not it didn't match the amount.
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.100]   But you know, these guys, it's really the gang that couldn't shoot straight, I think.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.140]   So if you're if you're right, you don't let us know.
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.020]   Did your iCloud account get wiped?
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.020]   Did your Apple device get wiped?
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.020]   Let us know.
[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:41.060]   Maybe go three people in Belgium, Mr. LePorque.
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.060]   We got good.
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:45.820]   Don't make me use this weapon, Mr. Cook.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.460]   Set her cool parrot against them.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:49.460]   He's Belgium.
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:53.940]   He's got a national issue better than sending the way who's the pink Panther guy against
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:54.940]   them.
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.940]   You only have twice.
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:56.940]   Inspector Cluso.
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:57.940]   Cluso.
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:01.180]   This is your Bitcoin bet.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:07.140]   Under the new proposed Trump tax plan, Apple could repatriate, of course this is a city bank
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:15.700]   analysis, could repatriate its $230 billion of overseas money and see its profits jump
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.780]   by 16%.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:23.700]   Actually, business insider saw the city report.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:30.220]   The plan includes reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%, which I'm all for.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.420]   That would really help me.
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.420]   Thank you.
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.060]   Repatriate to Leo.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:39.740]   Yeah, I could finally get all of that Bitcoin I've got overseas, get my $50 back.
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.100]   Well, it's only a half a Bitcoin.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.500]   No, I'm sorry, a tenth of a Bitcoin.
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.580]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.900]   One half of one tenth of a Bitcoin.
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.060]   Along with your talking, the less money you have, Leo stops.
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.060]   Oh, I know.
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.300]   Well, Bitcoin, you never.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.300]   It's very volatile.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:34:01.140]   The tax on the repatriated money in the Trump plan would be 10%.
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.140]   But it would be very good.
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.140]   Our logo weekend?
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.140]   Two more, a lot go weekends.
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.140]   Two more, a lot go weekends.
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.820]   That's a little easier to understand when you put it that way.
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.980]   No, it'd be quite a few more, a lot of weekends because this is 200, $10 million.
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:12.980]   That's $30 million.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.980]   That's $7 million.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.780]   But the revenue, yeah.
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.780]   Yeah.
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.220]   It could pay for six months of the president's travel.
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:20.220]   More, a lot going.
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:29.140]   Proposal would, according to Cliff, city analyst, Jim Suva and a C.A. merchant, probably be used
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:33.540]   as I and I am ignorant and I do not work as an analyst for Citibank.
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:38.820]   But even I thought Apple would just use it for the stock buyback program.
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:43.140]   They say that would add 10% to their earnings per share.
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.460]   Lower domestic rate would also improve earnings per share by 6%.
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:51.860]   So, when I think that that would give them the opportunity if they wanted to to, now they've
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.380]   gotten really good rates on their loans.
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.940]   So it may or may not mean that they're going to be able to buy back.
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.660]   Well, they first pay those off, really, right?
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.140]   You don't need to pay them off, maybe.
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:02.460]   It depends on the percentage, you know, what they're paying, but there's a high probability
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:06.860]   they'd pay those down, which I don't know what the total number is right now, but it's
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:07.860]   not.
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:08.860]   Right.
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:13.300]   They were borrowing to do the buybacks because they didn't have the money in the US.
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.020]   So they were borrowing against this overseas money effectively.
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:19.700]   It's about, I think right now it's about $80 billion or $100 billion somewhere in that
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:20.700]   range.
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:24.580]   So you could imagine them bringing back $200 and X amount and using half of it just to
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:25.580]   pay down those.
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:29.220]   But I think that that was a calculation that Apple was making for quite some time was that
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:35.420]   eventually, you know, some president is going to want to get that money back because it's
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:40.700]   it is an opportunity for the government to also generate a lot of revenue pretty quickly.
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.740]   Has Apple ever said anything about this?
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:51.140]   I think given Tim Cook's kind of reluctance to support Trump, I think he might not.
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.140]   They've talked about it.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.140]   I don't know if they've talked about it recently.
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.980]   They might not want to say, Hey, we love this new tax.
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.500]   They've talked about draconian draconian tax laws.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.500]   They don't.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.500]   Oh, no, I know they don't like it.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.180]   So I think I know they want to repatriate, but have they specifically addressed this proposal?
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.500]   I don't think so.
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.500]   Not yet.
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.500]   But a lot of us can see.
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.500]   They have an earnings call coming up.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.500]   Oh.
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:16.420]   And the total number I think is the people are kicking around as a if all the corporations
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:20.740]   take advantage of this because really when you look at it from a corporations perspective,
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:25.700]   they, you know, the Republicans may lose control of House and or Senate, most likely
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:30.420]   likely this, quite possibly the Senate in two years.
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:35.540]   And so if this law goes into a into effect, you know, the concern may be that we have
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:40.220]   somewhere between one and three years to take advantage of you.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:44.400]   You imagine a lot of corporations pulling a lot of cash back into the United States to
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:49.140]   take advantage of that holiday right now, especially if there's a time on that holiday.
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.140]   It may also be something that they say, well, it's only good this year.
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:58.420]   Well, that could bring as much as $1.5 trillion back into the into the country and a tax benefit
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.700]   of the United States of 150 million.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:04.780]   So it's it's not, you know, it's not a small amount of money.
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:09.380]   That's not as much as it would be if they repatriated at current corporate tax.
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.380]   But they're not going to, but they'll never do that.
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.220]   You know, like, like that, they would it would be it would be it would be nice if that
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.060]   pie in the sky was something that I could actually eat, but I'll take the one that I
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.300]   can actually, you know, enjoy.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.980]   So I think that's one of the five that I'll take.
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:28.020]   It's also an opportunity to, you know, for these, you know, obviously they bring all
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:32.100]   that money back in some of them are going to pay down debts, but it also could mean,
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:36.500]   you know, more, you know, more investment in a variety of things they might do in the
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.940]   United States because now the money's the money's here, not over there.
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.340]   It's expensive to use.
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.100]   So there's a there's a lot of options there.
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.220]   I think that overall it's a it's a really good.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:51.180]   It would be one of the it'd be a good move, you know, for the country.
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:56.700]   Meanwhile I have to pay every penny of tax on anything I've got make overseas.
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.700]   It's tax time.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:58.700]   You obviously this right now.
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.620]   You obviously just haven't structured that very.
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.620]   Apparently need to be.
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:02.620]   It could be worse.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:05.020]   It could be Canadian tax season for you.
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.580]   Oh, you guys already paid, right?
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.340]   No, I think April is May 1st this year.
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.340]   Oh, you get later.
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.340]   You get a later date.
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.340]   We're April 18th.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:14.580]   Yeah, we're a little bit late.
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.740]   But they take a lot more money.
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.100]   So it works out.
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:20.420]   But you do you get more do you think for that money or is it not?
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.420]   We do.
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:24.740]   I mean, we obviously like we get I forget what it is now, but tuition at universities is
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.620]   very low comparatively and there's Medicare and stuff.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.620]   But we also have these monstrous civil service.
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.860]   I think we have more civil service people in Quebec than you have in California.
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:33.860]   Wow.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:34.860]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.140]   And your population is less than California.
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.380]   Sell them if you give a government money.
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.260]   Does it not figure out how to use more than it has?
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.260]   Why you're sounding like a Republican.
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.580]   What is the one that services?
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:45.580]   What is it in Canada?
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:46.580]   Are you a wig?
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:49.060]   Uh, conservative, conservative party of Canada.
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.380]   No, I love giving the government money.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.340]   I just want to see exactly what I'm getting from.
[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.340]   Yeah, I know.
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.340]   As much as you want.
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.340]   Good luck.
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:56.580]   I want to see where it goes.
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.940]   Yeah, I would love to say to tell the state and government and federal government what
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.180]   to do with my tax money.
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.500]   But they seem to want to do with that money.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.500]   My taxes went up.
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.500]   A garbage collection went to once a week.
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.500]   I don't understand.
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.660]   I'd love to tell them that.
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.740]   I'm very I'm hyper aware of it because you know we pay actually we actually paid our
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:12.740]   taxes.
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:18.580]   We paid it a couple of weeks ago, but I'm hyper aware of how much how much it costs.
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.580]   But you know what?
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:24.620]   I'm glad to do it because I like living in this country and I want to I know that that's
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:25.780]   part of the deal.
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.860]   It's kind of they go together.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.980]   I kind of I just view it as rent.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.980]   It's rent.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:31.980]   You know, it's the rent for being in the country.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:35.180]   And it's part of I think it's our it's our civil contract.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.340]   It's part of our deal.
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.340]   Yeah.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.340]   Right.
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.700]   That you know I've been very fortunate.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:46.260]   And so it's fair that they they take almost half of what I make and and I agree with you
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.260]   Renee.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.180]   I'd love to see it used more effectively, but it but you know it goes into appropriate
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.780]   things for the most part.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.780]   I think for me when I think of it as rent and I just think of it.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:55.780]   This is the cost of being here.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:58.340]   It I stop I stop worrying about what they're doing with it.
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.620]   I don't worry about what my landlord does with the rent.
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:01.620]   Right.
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:02.620]   I pay.
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:03.620]   Well, I'm worried because you're not our landlord.
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:04.620]   It's their us the government.
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.100]   Well, you would if your roof was an independent entity.
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.620]   The government is supposed to be us.
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:08.620]   Right.
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:12.380]   It's not supposed to be some you know, some family.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.380]   Qualcomm fires back.
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.700]   I need that for a long time.
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:22.460]   We say and who say in who day and Qualcomm fires back at the apple suit seeks damages of
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:23.460]   it of its own.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:29.860]   So apple was sued Qualcomm for a billion dollars in January saying Qualcomm overcharged for
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.500]   use of its technology.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:36.700]   It should have been what do you call those fame fan friend and non discriminatory fair.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.980]   Very nice Renee friend friend.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:39.980]   You're my best friend.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:40.980]   That's real.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.900]   Fair and reasonable and non discriminatory.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:51.220]   The US FTC sued Qualcomm at the same time charging a violated antitrust law.
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:41:03.620]   And they're rejecting iPhone, the iPhone makers claims and launching their own countersuit.
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:09.020]   Saying apple breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm.
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:12.860]   It interfered with agreements that Qualcomm had with the contract manufacturers who built
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.260]   Apple's iPads and phones.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:20.380]   Encouraged various government regulatory agencies around the world to launching queries
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:24.420]   against Qualcomm by misrepresenting facts and false statements.
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.460]   They tapped they told us.
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.860]   Yeah, and I love this.
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.500]   This is my favorite one.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:35.980]   They also said apple throttled the Qualcomm modem chip in the iPhone seven, which we know
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.340]   they did and apple has said they did.
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.780]   While misleading people on the performance difference between its modem and rival chip
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:46.620]   from Intel and then threatened Qualcomm to try to prevent it from making its own performance
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:47.620]   claims.
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:54.300]   It's known that the iPhone seven has both Intel and Qualcomm chips in it radio chips in it.
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:42:01.100]   And that because the Intel chip misunderperformed, they throttle the Qualcomm chip.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.220]   So I wouldn't feel bad because I have one with the Intel chip in it.
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:08.540]   So I'm not going to feel bad when your LTE data is coming in so much faster.
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:12.480]   Just so Intel bought Infineon, which was the original modem manufacturer for iPhone Apple
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.500]   switched from Infineon to Qualcomm, Intel bought Infineon and they've been pitching Apple ever
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.500]   since then.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.500]   Got it.
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.060]   So there you go.
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:25.740]   So this is one of those things that in about five or six years on Mac break weekly will
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.460]   be reporting the results of these lawsuits.
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:33.860]   I have little sympathy for for Qualcomm because if you start talking about the industry, very
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.900]   few people are happy with their business practices and it does seem from country to
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:39.700]   country that I don't know if predatory is the right word.
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:44.580]   They're definitely there's a fragrance of early Intel Microsoft market dominant control
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:45.660]   there.
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:48.980]   And they you you want you don't want to pay the amount.
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:54.460]   So just for people to Qualcomm owns L T CTM CDMA technology, right?
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.540]   And you got to get CDMA right?
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:01.300]   Yeah, but like only in America, mostly only Verizon and Sprint is a few in China use CDMA,
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:06.380]   but everyone in the world has to pay a huge additive licensing fee because Qualcomm is
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.300]   only making those chips with CDMA on them.
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.180]   They call them world phones, but it's the entire world is basically paying a Qualcomm
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.860]   tax and they've been having huge profits for years off all of this.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:18.740]   So yeah, take, take, fix that please.
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:19.740]   Government.
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:22.540]   Uh, no, I think you're not far wrong.
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.580]   Qualcomm is almost as virtually a monopoly in the United States.
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:32.460]   The new Samsung Galaxy S8 in the US will have a Qualcomm chip, not a Samsung Exynos chip,
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.380]   even though those excellency, I mean, they make their own silicon that could be a huge
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.260]   competitive advantage for them, but they can't take advantage of it fully because they have
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.060]   to hedge with Qualcomm because of all this.
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:48.060]   So, yes, licensing stuff.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.060]   Let's Samsung be Samsung.
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.860]   I never thought I'd heard that from you.
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:52.860]   I love that.
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:57.780]   No, but I think it's increasingly becoming a differentiator and it's becoming a power
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:01.100]   like if you can program exactly for your own silicon, you have huge advantages.
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:04.700]   It's a big advantage for that because half their phone has to run on Qualcomm so they
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:07.740]   can't take full advantage of their own silicon and that's not fair.
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:10.660]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:14.700]   Couldn't Apple design its own chips and just stop buying it from Qualcomm?
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.260]   I mean, are we going to do a segment on Apple making?
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:21.340]   Because there's a lot of them that may be sued by Qualcomm for infringements.
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:22.340]   Right.
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.340]   Yeah.
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:24.340]   So they'd have to license it.
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:25.340]   They'd have to license it.
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:26.340]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:29.220]   Although I wouldn't be surprised if Apple had a very big alphabet of Apple W's Apple
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:30.220]   M's Apple.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.220]   Yeah.
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:32.220]   Yeah.
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:33.220]   Apple modems.
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:36.220]   I don't think are far away.
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:39.620]   I wonder if we want to get into the rumor section.
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:44.700]   Let's take a break and then get into the rumor section of the show.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:54.540]   We do actually have some concrete news like there's new versions of iOS 10.3.2, Mac OS
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.340]   10.12.5.
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.620]   These are all beta's watch OS 3.2.2.
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:44:59.620]   TVOS 10.1.
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.260]   Oh, and an interesting thing.
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.980]   This 9 to 5 Mac caught this.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.940]   Today, Apple is no longer signing.
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:12.660]   They've done this in the past, older versions of iOS, which means you can't downgrade.
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:13.660]   Right?
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:17.620]   I mean, yeah, but this is totally normal.
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:18.620]   It's just, yeah.
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:19.620]   They do.
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:20.620]   They do.
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.420]   This is the past, but what 9 to 5 is pointing out is that means APFS, you're stuck with
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:24.420]   it.
[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:28.780]   Downgrading from iOS is a completely managed environment and downgrading to a previous
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:30.780]   version is never going to be a long-term solution for anything.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:31.780]   Right.
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.820]   So, there's no difficulty to maintain an older operating system on the live.
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.460]   There were also, we should point out, security.
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:43.220]   Lots of iOS 10.3 and 3.1 were littered with security flaws, so downgrading it would be
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.060]   a very risky thing to do in general.
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:46.460]   So this Apple always does this, right?
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:52.580]   They stop signing it, which means you can't legitimately downgrade.
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.100]   Can you get around the signing?
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:55.100]   You'd have to jailbreak?
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.100]   What would you do?
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.100]   Yeah.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.580]   Yeah, I don't think there's a jailbreak in that version.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:00.580]   Okay.
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:01.580]   Yeah.
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:02.580]   All right.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.580]   Don't do it.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.780]   If you're a super-level pro, I mean, you're very specific.
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:08.780]   No, it's not.
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:12.180]   The only people who would ever want to sideload an earlier version of the operating system
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:16.580]   under those circumstances are the people who would be more happy to break it themselves.
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:17.580]   Right.
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.580]   This isn't a thing.
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:20.580]   Good.
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:22.820]   Our show today brought to you by ZipRecruiter.
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:28.460]   If you're the hiring person, the hirerer in chief at your company, whether you're the sole
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:32.340]   proprietor and you need some help or you're a big business and you're the HR person,
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.340]   you got to know it.
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:34.540]   By now you know about ZipRecruiter, right?
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:37.300]   I hope you're using ZipRecruiter.
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:40.020]   The biggest companies in the world are using ZipRecruiter.
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:44.540]   Many of the Fortune 100, thousands of small businesses, medium-sized businesses too.
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:49.300]   ZipRecruiter makes it easy to do the hiring.
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:50.660]   It's the easiest way to do it.
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:56.500]   It's also the best way because when you're hiring, you want to find that person.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.980]   There may be five people to be perfect.
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.900]   Maybe there's a hundred, but maybe there's just one.
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:06.660]   The thing is you need to know what job board is that person haunting?
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:11.100]   Where can I get to that person and convince them to apply for the job so I can hire the
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.700]   most amazing person?
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:17.220]   Well, I guess you could do it by hand and go to all the job boards.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:18.220]   There's hundreds.
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:23.660]   Or you can go to ziprecruiter.com, post to 200+ job boards and Twitter and Facebook
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.980]   with one click of the mouse.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.460]   And better than that, not only are you reaching the broadest possible audience, there's no
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.580]   better way to reach the broadest possible audience.
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:34.580]   I can't remember what?
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:39.260]   60 million resumes in their own, current resumes in their own database so you can match to
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.260]   those instantly.
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:43.340]   You'll start getting applications immediately and they won't be calling you.
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.340]   I love this.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.380]   They won't be coming into your inbox.
[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:49.500]   That's sometimes the worst part about being in the hiring position is that you get all
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:50.900]   this mail.
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:54.900]   No, every applicant is funneled into the ziprecruiter interface.
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.460]   They reformat the resumes.
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.260]   Their uniform makes it easy.
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:02.540]   You can screen them automatically with your own questions, multiple choice.
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.940]   Yes, no.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:09.460]   Even essay questions, you know, really narrow it down and then rank the remainers and find
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:14.340]   the right person fast in any city, in any industry, anywhere in the US.
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:17.340]   No more juggling emails, no more calls to your office.
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:19.340]   This is the way to hire.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:26.300]   But if you go to ziprecruiter.com/twit, ziprecruiter.com/twit, you can read all the testimonials, you can
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:30.060]   see how it works and then you can try it.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:37.140]   Farie, ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.660]   This really is the best way to do your hires.
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:40.660]   How we do it?
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:43.620]   And I tell you what, once you use ziprecruiter, you'll never go back.
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:47.580]   This is like easy peasy lemon squeezy.
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:50.180]   I did not coin that phrase.
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:55.020]   Ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:49:00.020]   Andy Inako Chicago Sun Times from I'm More Yellow, the new Pokemon flavor.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.020]   It's Renee Ricciou.
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:05.780]   How's it going with the new redesign?
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.580]   Everybody, everything going well?
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:10.460]   Yeah, I mean, we weren't, we had a much more ambitious plan.
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:14.380]   We were going to launch much more of it and much earlier than we did, but we ended up
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:16.820]   having just the header part go out for now and that's solid.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:17.820]   So fingers crossed, we're going to get a lot more.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:18.820]   You know what's nice though?
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:20.540]   You also are launching the new app.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:22.340]   Oh yeah, let me pick a week.
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:23.340]   I love it.
[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:24.340]   Okay, I won't, I won't.
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.100]   I have all the details.
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.300]   I won't spoil it.
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.500]   But the new I'm More Yellow.
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:34.860]   And Alex Lindsey, who's right now at Sweetbriar College in beautiful Virginia.
[00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:39.660]   I am, I've taken over, I don't know if you know Aaron Mailer, but Aaron's the CTO and
[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:40.660]   so we were.
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:41.660]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:42.660]   I mean, he means here.
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:43.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.500]   So he runs, he runs all the IT or really all the systems here.
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:54.300]   You know, makes this place work and it's pretty, as far as a college, it runs amazingly smooth
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.740]   because Aaron is fanatical.
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:59.220]   So anyway, so we're talking about a bunch of stuff here and heaven meetings and he's,
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:00.220]   he's got quite the office.
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:02.420]   He's everything from a, from a Newton.
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:03.420]   Here you go.
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:04.980]   Oh, I've got two of those.
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:05.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:10.060]   Yeah, Newton, but then he also has the switch, which is, or the, isn't the switch.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.060]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:15.020]   The new, the new, which turned out to be much better than I expected than Nintendo.
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:17.820]   I can't stop playing it.
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:18.820]   I know.
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:21.900]   I only played for a couple of minutes and I was like, okay, this is, and I looked at
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.740]   him and I was like, so he's a really back, they're really back ordered, aren't they?
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:28.300]   And he's like, yeah, yeah, they're really awesome.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.580]   But, but there's also like, you know, the background, he's showed me that he's got, he's
[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:37.820]   got a, that, that led is a NASA, like, like old, old NASA with the little light holes in
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:41.460]   the back to turn on, on and off the characters.
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:42.460]   And it's so anyway.
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:43.460]   Wow.
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:44.460]   It's the same.
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.900]   It's a lot of people who used to do a twiip, right?
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:47.900]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:49.900]   No, it's Aaron, Aaron, mailer from Twiip.
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:50.900]   Yeah.
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:51.900]   Nice.
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:52.900]   So that, yeah.
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.380]   So anyway, so I, I have, I definitely will.
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:51:03.820]   We were buddies a few years ago, long time ago, former, so you're a pixel coirler, core,
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:04.980]   pixel corerer.
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.220]   You don't call yourself pixel cores.
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:10.420]   No, we don't really have a name for it.
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.420]   How about pixels?
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:12.420]   There's a pixel.
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:14.420]   So it talks of pixels or pixels.
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:16.980]   And we're like, oh, I was like, mmm.
[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:17.980]   No, it's good.
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:19.980]   All the pixies pixel core.
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:20.980]   The band for that.
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:21.980]   Pixel core.
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:22.980]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.660]   So anyway, great to, great to have you as well.
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:29.220]   I like when the whole gang is here.
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:32.220]   We've seen more of you lately, which is nice.
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:37.380]   Anything to say about the betas, uh, 10.3.2, 10.12.5.
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:42.380]   Are we going to get, when are we going to get APFS, the new Apple file system?
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.900]   We got it for mobile.
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.140]   When are we going to get it for desktop?
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:47.900]   It is a bigger job on desktop.
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:48.900]   Oh, yes.
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.500]   iOS is such a controlled environment.
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:54.580]   And if you look at Apple managed to update the whole file system of hundreds of millions
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:56.220]   of people pretty much without incident.
[00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:57.220]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:04.060]   By the way, kudos because the last update you got on your iPhone, your iPad, is it
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.220]   also on the Apple TV?
[00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:08.020]   Yes, I believe so.
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:11.340]   And the Apple Watch, I don't know what that if that even has a file system.
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:12.340]   It's on everything.
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:18.260]   So at all the iOS side, you got a new file system.
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:19.420]   And you didn't even know it.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:23.660]   I mean, that's, and I know it's not user facing, but internally it is fully file.
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:26.460]   Like you can't see it, but it is internally to the full file system.
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:27.460]   It's huge.
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:32.300]   No, this is, no, uh, this is, uh, you know, HFS plus, which Apple's been using for three
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:39.800]   decades is, was, is antiquated and, uh, and, uh, APFS is by all accounts and I'm not a
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:46.260]   file system expert, although I am a file system junkie as by all accounts, a very good cow
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:50.860]   file system, copy and write file system, uh, which has been one, like it's missing compression
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:54.060]   and a few other things that nerds really want, but for a gen one, it's pretty good.
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:59.460]   It ain't ZFS yet, but it's, uh, it's headed that way, which is awesome.
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:00.460]   Yeah.
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:03.860]   And much needed and it makes, it's better for SSDs.
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:07.180]   That's one of the reasons I'm curious when we're going to get this on OS 10 because it
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.920]   is better for SSDs, right?
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:15.400]   It's a, it's, it's part of a whole new way of new operating systems that were really,
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:19.920]   it's, Apple wasn't alone in having operating systems that were optimized for floppies,
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:23.520]   uh, because that's basically the code base that's being built upon them, built upon them,
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:27.560]   built upon, they were just sort of last two that since they, since they didn't, they,
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:32.280]   I think they backed out of talks about being part of ZFS a while ago because they had their
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:33.360]   eyes on other things.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.680]   They, they didn't think that ZFS was going to do for them.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:41.380]   Uh, it's, it's not just a being able to work, work more natively with the internet, more,
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:46.380]   more natively with servers, more and more efficiently with the, with flash storage, but
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:50.920]   it's also the idea of let's wire in stuff so that things like versioning, things like
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:54.900]   tracking, things like backups, things like just wrapping and mirroring, those things are,
[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:58.960]   you sort of get it for free within the operating system, as opposed to I need to put on this
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:05.360]   entire extension just to bolt this thing onto again, this 1986 air cooled engine on the
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:10.840]   back of a VW that was never intended by, by man or God to ever do the sort of stuff.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.720]   I've been watching this last stuff we're going to get for free in the next few years.
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.080]   I am a file system junkie.
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:19.520]   I read those Reddit debates, you know, all BTR F is terrible.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:21.520]   ZFS.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.440]   It's so funny.
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:27.240]   But Linux has been making this transition for like decades.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.120]   It feels a really long time.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:32.720]   Uh, this is, but it's a lot easier to do if you own the OS and everything.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:36.560]   Now I'm curious because, uh, and we never did talk about this, but a number of people
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:46.000]   reported with the upgrade to the new iOS, a massive, uh, increase in free space gigabytes.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   I wonder, I have, I have this wonder in the back, but I can't prove this.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.040]   But you know how like that other cruft builds up and it's like it's movies that didn't get
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.160]   a lot of cash when you were streaming.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:00.080]   And I wonder if changing the file system was enough to just kick, call that debris lose.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.400]   It makes sense that you show us that you cash.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:05.920]   Yeah, it makes sense that you would flush the cash if you could put a new file system
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.920]   on there.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.000]   So maybe it doesn't have anything to do with APFS.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   It has everything to do with just upgrading the file system.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   It's not really yet.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   That was one of the important.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.560]   I'll also, also realize that this is, this really is like replacing the area, the, the
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:23.360]   broom size area rug in your living room.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:27.600]   But when you create a new file system, you can't just simply slip, shake out the old
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.840]   one, slip in the new one.
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:29.840]   It really is.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:34.440]   We got what they did was they took, they essentially moved all of your files into the, into the
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.440]   yard.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.440]   There is, there is.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:38.240]   They moved it back in.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.160]   Some of this could be the efficiencies.
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:44.640]   APFS does support clones.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:49.720]   So if you had, in the past, you've had to have, if you had identical files, but they
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:55.240]   were owned by different apps, you'd have double the file usage and the cloning allows,
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:57.800]   it's like linking or aliases.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:02.760]   It allows you to have a copy that doesn't take up additional space.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:08.240]   That could be one of the, I mean, there could be some benefit just from this new file system.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:11.440]   I don't know how much duplication there is on all of this.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.680]   I don't know yet.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:17.040]   I've been, I'm trying to find out exactly what the, what features are implemented today
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.120]   in the new, a new operating system.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.760]   Excuse me, the new file system.
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:24.520]   And I don't know which, oh, there are all these features that are included in the engineering
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:27.280]   of it, but there are a lot of features that have not been turned on yet.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.520]   I don't know whether that would be, that would be a knock on effect of some of the built in
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:33.600]   features that are, that we're going to be getting, but I don't know if that's flipped
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:34.600]   on yet.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:38.280]   So, but yeah, it's, it, but it does give you an idea of all the stuff that is good that
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.640]   happens just because you have a modern file system.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:42.640]   Oh, I'm, I'm really thrilled.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.880]   And I am looking forward to getting it on, on the desktop.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.280]   Somebody in the, some wag in the chatroom said, Oh, good news.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:52.880]   APFS comes with a new Mac Pro.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:55.400]   You couldn't even guy, couldn't even people couldn't even laugh.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.400]   There was no painful.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.400]   It's like, yeah.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:03.640]   It's just because there is so much more, it's just such a more chaotic environment that
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.480]   getting people transferring their Macs over.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:06.480]   I understand.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:11.440]   I mean, like I said, in every other case where people are moving file systems, it's a horrible
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.440]   thing.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.560]   And it might be opt in at first.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:19.680]   It's actually quite remarkable that Apple was able to do this on iOS completely transparently.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.920]   It's like, you know, take it.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:26.200]   It's like that trick, a part of the trick of whipping the table cloth out from under the
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:30.840]   China on the table, but it's even better than putting a new table cloth in.
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:31.840]   Yes.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:32.840]   That's just to really try that.
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:35.680]   And it's in that's what's over there.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:37.680]   That's impressive.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:40.520]   In a broader sense, this is something that I really respect Apple for.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:44.520]   There are times where, you know, there, there is rotten, there are rotten members underneath
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:45.520]   there.
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.480]   There's electrical, loose electrical wiring.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:51.320]   It's really is going to cheese people off and bum people out and inconvenience people to
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:54.400]   have to move everything out of the house to fix this thing.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.120]   But they will do that.
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:58:00.040]   And sometimes when it comes to a radical redesign of hardware or software, it's like,
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:05.240]   I know, I know it's going to stink to have this new connector, but or to switch over
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:10.960]   to this new, this new way of accessing files, but trust us.
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:15.200]   But when you get over like how inconvenienced you have been by the switch, you will then
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:20.320]   realize how much life sucks less because we did all this work.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:24.920]   I mean, okay, so and we've said enough bad things about Apple.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.800]   So I agree with you, Andy, we should always when Apple does something right, we should
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:28.800]   always point out.
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:32.520]   And this is why we use Apple products as things like this.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:37.200]   And that's why I didn't mind the type C connectors on the new laptop so much because I want
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.160]   to be, you know, I want to be using Thunderbolt 3.
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:44.960]   I want to be using type C. And I just wish we could get them to abandoned lightning.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:48.200]   I know people will be mad at me for this, but I wish we could get them to abandoned lightning
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.800]   port because I love type C everywhere.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:53.520]   Yeah, you know, that would be really cool.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:57.360]   Okay, for all the complaining I had for the laptop, it's just the timing and the exclusivity
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.880]   on the laptop, but I definitely agree.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:02.200]   I mean, I think that I already had all the dongles because of the MacBook and because
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.200]   of other phones.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.120]   I already had all the dongles.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:06.120]   Wait for type C mini.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.120]   I do.
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.120]   Ah, no.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:09.120]   I do.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:13.320]   I do like the lightning connector better than the type C, but I'm fine with moving to type
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:14.320]   C.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:15.920]   What's the difference from your point of view?
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.920]   It's just easier to put.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.920]   I mean, when you put it in, it's just smaller.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:19.920]   Just physical.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.920]   It's small.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:21.920]   It's all physical.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.920]   The smaller it just pops in.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.920]   So I think that it I think it's nicer.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:27.280]   I can I can tighten screws with it.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:28.280]   You know, the little little.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.280]   That's why you like it.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.280]   But it does.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.280]   Like you can use it as a screwdriver.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:35.240]   I had a I had a pan this morning over the weekend.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:39.280]   I had a pan that wasn't, you know, the handle got loose and I turned out that the lightning
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.640]   connector right in there just just pranked it right out.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.200]   I can't do that with the C.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.200]   Okay.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.400]   That is a really crap reason for sticking with lightning.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:51.560]   But you're not saying that there's a technical benefit.
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:55.000]   It seems like they're very similarly similar to I don't think there's a technical benefit.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.320]   I think it's just it's just a form is just a little smaller.
[00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:01.160]   And I think I if you know, I think it pops in easier Apple can do what they want with
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.160]   it.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.800]   It's like the biggest benefit they have if they want to change something they can just
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.800]   change it.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:08.040]   Some might say the biggest benefit is the license fees that Apple can charge to people
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.040]   want to use it.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.840]   If you look at their their numbers though, I mean, it's not a big deal to what no, it's
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.840]   really not for them.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:14.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:15.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:19.640]   I'm sure I agree that that's the it cost them like 100 million times more to chamfer an
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.800]   edge that they don't need to chamfer.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.800]   Get from the MFL.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:23.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.800]   We'd be perfectly fine without that chamfer.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.320]   It's going to cost us hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.320]   But I want that chamfer.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.360]   I, you know, and I applaud them and I want to see every laptop manufacturer do this for
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.400]   not only abandoning the proprietary laptop power connector.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.440]   I know everybody's mad about MagSafe and they could still do it.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:42.680]   I guess a type C MagSafe of some kind, but but the fact that I can use anything to charge
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.400]   my Mac book is free.
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.400]   Any side from any port.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.680]   I've been going left and right back and forth like I'm in college and I'm left right curious
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.680]   about charging.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.160]   Oh, were you left right curious in college?
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.160]   Okay.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.560]   Well, no, it was just because previously like in the in the coffee shop I go to, the seating
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.320]   is arranged in a way that I always had to turn around to charge the thing because it just
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.800]   wouldn't quite run one plus.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:03.800]   It's nice to have been.
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:04.800]   Now I just plug in the other side.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.080]   And it's like, whoa, everything is beautiful.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:14.840]   I, you know, it would be possible for them to stay proprietary.
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.840]   HP did that.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.240]   They made a laptop, which I love.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:24.200]   They're a HP Spectre 13T uses type C charging has three type C ports, even has Thunderbolt
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:28.320]   3, but you have to use the HP power adapter.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:33.160]   They're obviously checking to see if you're using their proprietary power adapter, even
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.160]   though it's a non-proprietary port and it drives me nuts.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:41.600]   The other type C laptop I have will, you know, we'll take anybody's type C connector.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.240]   That's just that's just not flat out obnoxious.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.240]   Exactly.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.240]   We said the same.
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.240]   I don't know if the sync work, but we said the same word at the same time.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.240]   No, I know what you're going to say.
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.240]   I could read your mind.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.760]   Hey, have you played anybody played with clips?
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.240]   We tried to play with it yesterday.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.240]   I was today.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.240]   Such a cool lab.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.240]   You like it.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.240]   All right.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.240]   I had it for, I had it for a week before launch.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.880]   I got a lot of stuff.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.000]   So it is the new Apple video app.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.200]   They mentioned it at the event and that came out finally on Monday.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:17.280]   The problem I have with it is it's kind of a me too app in terms of filters and capabilities
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.080]   designed to say, oh, don't use Instagram.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.000]   Don't use Facebook.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.280]   Don't use Snapchat.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:28.720]   Use ours and then save it and export it and share it over to those apps.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:32.800]   The only thing that's different to me and correct me if I'm wrong Andy because you obviously
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.800]   like it.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:39.120]   The only thing I can see that's different is this auto dictation system.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.120]   That's a nice feature.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:44.040]   I don't use it because for some reason I can't get it to work the way that I would like.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.040]   Well, you can't edit this.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.560]   So if it makes a mistake, you can edit it.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.120]   You can tap on it and you can edit it.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120]   Oh, OK.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.120]   Because I couldn't figure that.
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.120]   That's the other thing.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.120]   I couldn't figure out a lot of how this stuff works.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.120]   I have a guide Leo.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.120]   I have an ultimate guide for you.
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.120]   Oh, good.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.880]   I'm going to read it.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:03.400]   But I just I really like the way that they've this is this is what I imagine as a classic
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.920]   like really classic thing that Apple does really, really well.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.600]   The idea of I don't even think of it as like a Snapchat or an Instagram sort of thing.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:16.160]   I think of it as a personal version of iMovie where it's even when I was just playing around
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:21.320]   with it, I found it a lot easier to tell the story with with this app than with iMovie
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.960]   because if I'm doing iMovie, I'm thinking that, OK, so let's let's shoot lots of stuff
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.280]   and let's figure out how it's going to cut together.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:32.640]   Whereas if I'm using this app, I find myself saying, OK, here is the box.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:33.640]   Hold down the button.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:34.640]   Here is the box.
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:35.640]   It just came in the mail today.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.640]   Release the button.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:37.640]   Take the box into the office.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.120]   Put it on the office.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.120]   Hold down the button.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:45.120]   I think this is the new Heathkit vacuum tube clock that I ordered on eBay the other day.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.120]   Release the button.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.120]   Open it up.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.120]   Take the clock out.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.120]   OK, yeah.
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.880]   Here's put down the button and then basically with no muscle, no fuss and not having to overthink
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:57.320]   things in four minutes, you have created a three and a half minute video with narration
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.960]   that you can then post somewhere.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:03.280]   And it isn't an incredibly unique app.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:09.200]   I will grant you that, but it's there are lots of apps that do that almost right and
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.400]   this is an app that does that exactly right.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.600]   So this is a really, really wonderful app.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.600]   All right.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:18.800]   Interesting because I will retract my pan.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.040]   There's two things that are interesting about it.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.880]   One that I really like and one that I don't like as much, but they basically created this.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.880]   This was a video team.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.080]   It wasn't any social team at Apple.
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.920]   And the thing that they made memories and they said that people really like memories.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.760]   A lot of people used it, but they just couldn't tweak it very much.
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.760]   And that was by design.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:36.880]   It was meant to be for people whose only feature was a play button.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.080]   But I movie was too much for them.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.840]   If they tried to move into the I movie, they were just lost.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.840]   So they wanted to make something in between.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.120]   And it's almost like that famous Randy Oubilos thing where I went on vacation.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.080]   I just want to edit together my footage and share it.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.080]   And it's just too long.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:51.600]   It's too hard to do that.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:55.760]   And this is for, it's not to replace Instagram or Snapchat, but it's for that generation.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.080]   It's for people who just quickly want to make a short video or a clip.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.640]   And they don't want to necessarily do it on Instagram because then it's an Instagram
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.640]   or do it in Snapchat.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:06.000]   And if you look a lot of people today, they do Instagram.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.480]   They try to save it to Snapchat and it doesn't look good.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:12.520]   So they just wanted to exactly what Andy said to make I movie for the modern generation.
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:16.560]   The only problem I have with it is now I feel a little bit of stress to make things better.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:20.320]   In Instagram and Snapchat, I just pulled the button down and let go and I'm done.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.320]   But now there's scenes and it feels like sometimes it's too much work and I don't want
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.320]   to invest in it.
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.200]   And I'd rather just press the button to take one photo.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.560]   But I gave it to my God kids.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.080]   They're eight years old and 11 years old to play with.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.080]   And they loved it.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.520]   They were using iMovie for iOS, but it was too much for them.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.520]   So they would just use the trailers.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:39.760]   And they love trailers, but everything was the same trailer.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:43.120]   And with this, they made movies of their dog and of their action figures.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.720]   And they just love it because they could quickly put together scenes.
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:49.360]   And then iMessage to me because my face would pop up right away as a...
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:53.400]   The live titling will automatically find names you put in it or do face detection based
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.280]   on your photo album and identify those people for sharing.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:58.000]   So all you have to do is press the share button.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   That's pretty cool.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.240]   And then send it to them if you want it.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.480]   There's no manual for it, right?
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.640]   I have to read your article.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.640]   How did you...
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:06.640]   There's a question mark button.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.240]   So no joke.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.240]   This is a big tip.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:13.600]   I turn on accessibility and I turn on voice over and then I press every button and it starts
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.600]   telling you what they are.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.600]   And I start writing based on that.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.440]   Where is the question mark button?
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.440]   If you go to the...
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.360]   Oh, I see it up a right hand corner there.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.360]   Okay.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.360]   So that's the manual.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.360]   Clips help.
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.360]   All right.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.720]   I should have read this before we talked about it yesterday because I didn't know for instance
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.440]   you could edit the text and now I can.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:34.080]   And now that you've got a review, I've got the place to go.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:36.760]   It really is editing that sets it apart.
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:40.400]   I mean, when it's the way I described it, it doesn't sound that different from Instagram
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.840]   where again, you can just record and burst at a time.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.560]   But the idea that every time I'm holding down a burst, I'm creating a separate clip
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:52.480]   that can then be individually moved around or deleted whenever you think something or
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.960]   as is the case of...
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:58.120]   I haven't actually posted anything yet because there's something that I did create one thing
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.880]   with the idea of posting it when it was finished.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.280]   I still need to shoot one thing in Boston when I go into town tomorrow.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:08.080]   So I can actually say, okay, well, I should finish it by when I'm standing right there.
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.400]   I'll just help finish it.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:13.680]   You don't think with Instagram, you think of it as I'm standing here.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:17.000]   I'm going to do this all in 30 seconds and then go away.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.360]   I'm not going to have much control over what does it.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:25.680]   It gives me just as much control over it as I would like to again, redo a boo-boo without
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.440]   having to redo everything.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.440]   Okay.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.440]   Well, my boo-boo was...
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:34.080]   Sound-troll is it that they got Hans Zimmer to come and write music for this and it will
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.160]   perfectly time itself to the length of your movie.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.160]   Did they do that?
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.800]   Yeah, Hans Zimmer is one of the soundtracks available to you.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:40.800]   Holy cow.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:46.920]   I just want the part of the Hanfora Lactobra soundtrack where the sub is going for its
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.800]   first like maiden voyage.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.800]   One ping, Mr. Naco.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.800]   Just one.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:08:00.200]   So I made the mistake of not pressing start a new clip and everything I shoot is now all
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.160]   part of the first clip.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.160]   So that's...
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.320]   It just feels like it wasn't that intuitive.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.840]   Yeah, the projects are undiscoverable.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.000]   It's a downward carrot instead of just being the word "projects" which is what Apple would
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   normally do.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.200]   There's some design decisions here that are definitely questions.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.200]   I guess when you...
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.200]   That's a B1.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.200]   Right.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.280]   And once you get used to it, it's not a big deal.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:20.280]   Like it...
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:23.440]   What drives me nuts is if you want to do something, you can't be in the existing clip.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:25.120]   You have to like go back to the live camera.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.280]   Then I see my face all of a sudden.
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:27.280]   It's always disturbing.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:28.280]   I can add something.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.280]   It's always disturbing.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.280]   I just want to be wherever...
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.200]   I want to add stuff from wherever I am in the app.
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:35.120]   Like if I've already selected a previous clip, just keep those same ad buttons there.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.120]   Don't take them away.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.120]   Right.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:40.120]   All right.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:44.960]   I've already improved my previous attempts by editing the text because I love the dictation
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:48.440]   and how it places it each on each frame and it's clever.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:55.280]   But I also have this problem that it doesn't get it perfect.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.280]   But now that I can edit it, although...
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.280]   What is that?
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.400]   Do you timing?
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:01.400]   It tries to track it.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:05.800]   So they said the best thing to do was eat non-C8.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.800]   No, I don't want to do that.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.280]   No, it's goofy.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:10.360]   Because then you sound like...
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.560]   It's audio and text.
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:15.640]   Although a lot of people just turn the audio off apparently, which I didn't know, but that's
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.320]   a thing where you just have some...
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:18.320]   Silence.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.320]   And it looks like you're talking.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.320]   Oh!
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.280]   Yeah, that's a big thing on Facebook.
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:25.240]   And the reason they started doing that is because Facebook autoplayed the video, but they
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.960]   wouldn't autoplay the audio.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:33.120]   So Algis 0, AJ+ and others, this was last year, started just putting captions on there.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.120]   So even if you just...
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.120]   Like it's amazing.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.120]   We went from Silenceills to Dreyys.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.120]   Right.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.120]   That was real good.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.280]   That was talking to the talkies and now socialies.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.360]   Good for Alex's business.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.360]   I like that.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.440]   Yeah, it was great.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.440]   It was great.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:47.440]   I was like...
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:49.600]   Because a lot of people are scanning past it and they're deciding whether they're going
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.040]   to click on it and listen to it later.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.280]   And so having that stuff burned in is definitely makes it easier.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.280]   It's a little bit of a murm...
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.760]   If you have stuff down there, obviously.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:02.800]   But a lot of people are fine with that.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.280]   And a lot of people actually like to watch it.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:09.360]   What's interesting is you see a lot of behavior where people are actually just watching the
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.600]   text and they're not interested in actually pushing it because they're somewhat public.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.600]   In bed, with their sleeping partner.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:14.600]   They're sleeping hard now.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.600]   They're only turning it on.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.600]   Really?
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:17.600]   That's exactly right.
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.600]   That's exactly right.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.600]   I don't want to wake anybody up.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:25.680]   Now if they only could come up with a phone that doesn't have any light, I'd be sad.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.280]   Oled with a night theme.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.280]   Would that help?
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.280]   Hey, speaking of Oleds.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:31.520]   Now this is an update on a story we've reported before.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:40.880]   But now according to rumor, we are up to Apple contracting for 92 million Samsung curved
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:41.880]   OLED displays.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:44.280]   That's two for Leo, one for Andy.
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:46.480]   One for Alex.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.920]   That's a lot.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:53.040]   And that wouldn't cover all the iPhones sold in 2017, but it'd come up.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.640]   Good portion of the way.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.800]   How the 7S and 7S Plus as well.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.480]   So this is a third phone.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.760]   You wouldn't need to do the...
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:00.760]   That's right.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:05.000]   This is the high end iPhone next.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.840]   Unless something changes.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.320]   The rumor again is all rumors.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.000]   Do you remember when Samsung did the Galaxy Edge and people were like, "Why did you make
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   this phone?"
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.880]   And they were like, "Well, we're testing the market, but the truth is it's hard to do
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.080]   high yield for a lot of the new technologies."
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.920]   Well, this is now because Samsung's done it.
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:21.920]   This is the...
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.640]   The Galaxy has been doing it for a few years.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.360]   They started with the S6.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.080]   They did it on the S7.
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.080]   And they're going to do it on the S8.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.640]   And now there's no more edge.
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:30.640]   Right.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:31.640]   All of the edge.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.320]   It's just there's standard screen.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.600]   But now they have to make enough screens for them and for Apple.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.760]   Apparently they've figured out how to do that.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.400]   I can't wait.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:46.400]   I'll get it on the 21st, the new S8 Plus.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:50.560]   And it doesn't go all the way around like the S7 did, but it's...
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.560]   But it's nice.
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:55.000]   It really, you know, hold it, trying out the S8.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.880]   It really changed my mind about the idea because it's not so much that it's a curved
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.880]   screen.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:06.120]   But as it's the only way to have absolutely no lines on the left and the right whatsoever.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:11.320]   And it's oddly soothing and pleasant to have soothing.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.000]   You know, I didn't have...
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.640]   I didn't think positively or negatively about the idea of, "Okay, fine, fine, fine.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.360]   No bezel, no bezel, whatever."
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.520]   But it's really, really quite slick.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:24.640]   So I mentioned I'm really keen to see what Apple has to do with it.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:29.840]   You'll also notice that when Samsung introduced it as the edge phone, they really was...
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:34.600]   We are declaring that this phone with a curved screen is a freak of nature.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.200]   We are not suggesting that it is a real phone.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:41.360]   But they also said, "Well, then look, if you've got it just sitting on the table, the
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.280]   edges also are active OLEDs."
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:44.280]   So that was to show you...
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.320]   And so now they realize that it's enough...
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.320]   It's enough exactly.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:50.880]   We play with it, people didn't like it.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.920]   It was a gimmick.
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:54.640]   So now it's just there to give you the visual effect.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:13:01.440]   Again, that's when you're getting $600, $900 for a phone, people really do respond to,
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.320]   "Oh my God, that is so cool."
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:08.720]   I keep calling the Tiffany of the Cartier effect, where now every major manufacturer,
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:14.000]   Apple, Samsung, everybody else, they're trying to make, again, the Cartier jewelry, the Cartier
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.920]   cigarette box, or the Cartier compact that in the 1920s and 30s would cost thousands of
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:23.800]   dollars and you just enjoy taking out of your pocket or your purse and putting it on your
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:27.160]   dresser at the end of the day and taking it off at the beginning of the next day.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.080]   They kind of got the world ready for it.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:32.400]   The iPhone 7 is curvy.
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.160]   The screen doesn't go across the bezel, but it still got the curviness.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.160]   It disappears, right?
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.240]   It makes a logic...
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:41.480]   It's a precursor.
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:43.960]   It's like John the Baptist.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:47.120]   It's preparing us for "He Who Is To Come."
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.120]   Oh.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.120]   Back to the iPod.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:53.160]   I'm not talking about the Marvel universe here.
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.160]   I did.
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:55.160]   Excuse me.
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:14:04.080]   John, were you one of those kids that went to church but went to the went to friendly,
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.800]   got an ice cream or something, and then on the way back grabbed a misallet so that we
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.080]   could prove your mom you went.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.080]   I went, Mom.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.080]   See?
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.440]   Pay no attention to the ice cream breath.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.520]   John the Baptist is not a Marvel character.
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.520]   He liked his head.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.520]   That was the whole thing.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.800]   Okay, good.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:29.160]   Here is my clips video and you'll note it's somewhat influenced by BBC's Planet Earth 2,
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.240]   which I've been binge watching.
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:38.520]   Here you see, feel a stomesticus.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.840]   The common household cat.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:51.080]   A seemingly quiet beast, but when he sees a bird, beware.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.080]   I like that.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.080]   Couldn't have done it without clips.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.880]   Do you have mine there, Leo, from the review?
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:58.080]   No, let me see.
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.080]   I do.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.080]   Mine is sillier.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.080]   Yours is even better.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.080]   All right, let's see here.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.080]   No, it's sillier.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.480]   I know it's the Instagram one because it looks, it looks blank.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.480]   I don't know why that is.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.400]   Let me see if I can play it.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.040]   Here we go.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.040]   Don't call Hulk Bruce.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:16.120]   Meanwhile, oh, hulks reaching into.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:20.080]   I like that because you took real action and you cartoonized it.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.680]   That's the Hans Zimmer track, by the way.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.680]   Oh, I like it.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.400]   It's good.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.560]   I just was using a little layer in Copeland I have lying around.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.560]   Nice.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.560]   Copeland.
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:32.560]   How do you have to download it?
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.720]   If you're trying to use Apple Music, the one tip is you have to download the track in
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:37.640]   Apple Music first or it won't appear there.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.400]   Oh, that's why it's on your device.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.720]   You have to hit the little download button.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:45.320]   This is why we love iMore because, I mean, when a new thing comes out like this, you guys
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.320]   work so hard to--
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.320]   I fail repeatedly so that you don't have to.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:53.480]   And we tried to show it on iOS today and I'm embarrassed to say, you know, I said things
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:56.320]   like, well, I'll see how you can edit this text.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.320]   So this is nice.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:02.440]   This is really the article to read if you want to start playing with clips.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.400]   97 million OLED screens.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.640]   That's kind of amazing, isn't it?
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.320]   What a number that is.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.560]   That's amazing.
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:10.560]   And that's a rumor.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:13.280]   That's not for sure, but it does kind of follow on a previous--
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.240]   Every phone they sell will have one.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:16.240]   Right, exactly.
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:17.240]   So that's a question.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.240]   Is it going to be--
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.240]   No, sorry.
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.880]   I think iPhone 8, they sell-- every phone with an OLED screen will have an OLED screen.
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:23.880]   I was trying to be--
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:25.600]   Well, you really narrow that down.
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.440]   Incredible logic there.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.760]   All tautologies are tautologies.
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:32.520]   Do we think there'll be two sizes and three phones?
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.920]   That's the rumor.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:39.320]   The rumor is there'll be a conventional iPhone 7 and 7S for people who just want a new phone.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.840]   Like they had a 6S or they had a 6S and they just need to upgrade and they don't want anything
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.920]   edgy or like, you know, expensive.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.720]   And then they'll-- because a lot of the new technology they're putting in this, including
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:52.040]   like distance charging, if it works, or a lot of the other stuff is expensive, you can't
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.760]   just make the new iPhone much more expensive again.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:57.080]   They're going to have this sitting on top where people who are willing to pay a premium
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.440]   to get sort of tomorrow's or next year's iPhone today.
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.440]   Yeah.
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:04.840]   And I definitely think that there's a lot of constraints that we see with phone production
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:08.880]   that is very much based on, well, we can't afford to-- you know, we've got to fit it inside
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:09.880]   some bucket.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.880]   So I think I can-- as a user, I'm actually kind of looking forward to seeing what happens
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:17.360]   when the engineers aren't quite as constrained over price.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.360]   We just size.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.120]   This is kind of odd.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:24.240]   I don't know exactly how this will play out.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:30.920]   I've not seen this happen before, but apparently Apple has partnered with Saturday Night Live
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:35.160]   for a humorous commercial starring cast members from the show.
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:40.760]   Apparently, SNL had done a similar deal with Verizon earlier.
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:44.920]   It's unclear what Apple's plans are for its advertisement accordion 95 Mac.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:50.080]   Today's report claims that the Verizon and Apple ads will be different, but specifics
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.080]   are unclear.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.080]   Apple has--
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.080]   Can it please be spicy?
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:54.080]   Can it please be?
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.320]   You bought a new MacBook and everybody was happy and nobody was sad.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.040]   Can we just be-- Kathy?
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:03.920]   It's kind of ironic because, you know, SNL is famous for its fake ads.
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.120]   Now it's going to do real fake ads or fake real ads or real real ads.
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:13.680]   I'm going to get my brain-- it's a real fake ad or is it a fake real ad?
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:16.880]   So that's smart of Apple.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.040]   I mean, that's hip, right?
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:19.040]   Or is it?
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.800]   Maybe it's hip for me because I'm old.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:21.800]   I don't know.
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.600]   Is Saturday Night Live hip the young people?
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.600]   I think they've had a renaissance.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:26.600]   They have.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.600]   Trump was elected.
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:31.440]   So they've definitely-- the last big push was Palin.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.720]   So now that Trump has given him a new run for it.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.880]   So are these ads only going to appear on Saturday Night Live?
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:40.880]   Will they appear elsewhere?
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:43.600]   Should they get their own Apple music show?
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:50.920]   The cost of a 30 second ad in Saturday Night Live, thanks to its new Trump-ish-- the Trump
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:55.760]   bump ratings, 30 seconds, $110,000.
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.160]   How repatriation money, Leo.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:00.320]   Trump is actually going to be paying for the ads that go on the show that makes money.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:03.360]   That's up from $76,900.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:07.760]   So the show makes about $115 million in advertising revenue each year.
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.920]   This is from Variety.
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:15.480]   You could buy an ad on Saturday Night Live for a mere 110,000.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:16.480]   Should we--
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.480]   Yep.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.480]   Well, it depends.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:25.320]   Oftentimes your ad can come at the-- right after a sketch the people turned off three
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.320]   medits into because--
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.320]   No, no, no.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.320]   So--
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.520]   They're obviously-- it's kind of-- it's starting at Live.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:37.640]   Every time they don't do something live, it's almost always wonderful.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.400]   So it's like they're good at the film stuff.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:46.200]   You saw that their take on the Pepsi-- on the Kylie Jenner Pepsi ad became like news
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.200]   because--
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.200]   Wasn't that awesome?
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:52.800]   And it wasn't only funny, but it was also just perfectly done, perfectly acted.
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:59.680]   And also it gave the actors the ability to actually make eye contact with each other and
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:02.160]   where their eyes are supposed to go instead of--
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.160]   Reading the prompter.
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.880]   Instead of the classic start at Live, well, Daphne--
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:13.600]   I don't know if you're ever going to make the team that way.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.920]   It's not the first time that they've done ads.
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:21.000]   David Spade did an ad for 1-800 collect in the mid 90s.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   That wasn't on Saturday Night Live.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000]   Exactly.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   That was just--
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000]   Well, yeah, cast members have done ads.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   How about the podcasting?
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   Huh.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   Interesting.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.400]   When I see Audible ads on Saturday Night Live, then I'll know.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.240]   Alec Baldwin comes out in costume.
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.240]   Audible.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.240]   Audible.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.240]   Audible.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:47.360]   If you used an iPhone and social media before 2013, you may be due a tiny payout, according
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.360]   to ZDNet.
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.360]   What?
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:52.600]   What are you going to do with your 11 cents?
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:53.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:59.400]   Eight social media firms, including Twitter and Instagram, have agreed to pay $5.3 million
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:07.960]   to settle a lawsuit over their use of Apple's Find My Friends feature in iOS.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:12.040]   Their apps used Apple's Find Friends and didn't tell users the contact list would be uploaded
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.560]   to the company's servers.
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:20.080]   Instagram, 4-square-kick, Goala, food spotting, Yelp, Twitter, and path.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:22.040]   I used all of those.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.040]   Contact the use--
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.040]   All of them.
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.040]   I used all of them.
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:28.680]   So are going to get $0.44?
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:32.640]   Apple and LinkedIn are the only remaining defendants among the 18 firms originally accused
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:37.120]   of the privacy violation everybody else settled out.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.560]   Given the number of people who downloaded these apps, it's likely the settlement will
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:43.200]   result in a very small payment for each individual.
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:45.440]   So look for that postcard.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.440]   Have you ever gotten those postcards?
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.440]   Have you ever got those postcards?
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.440]   Have you ever got those postcards?
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:53.280]   You ever got those postcards that say, "Hey, we won our class action lawsuit and you're
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:55.480]   entitled to a free pop chart?"
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:56.480]   Two dollars.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.800]   I've got them a $5 off address down in general.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:00.440]   It's always useless.
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:04.160]   I got a couple of bags of pop chips for free.
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.160]   I don't even bother.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.160]   It's not-- to me, it's like--
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.160]   I don't bother.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.160]   Never do.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:09.160]   Yeah.
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.160]   Never do.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.160]   So the other shoes dropped.
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:17.040]   Remember we mentioned that Jonathan Zadarski, the fabulous security researcher, was snapped
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.920]   up by Apple to be on their security team.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:23.240]   You might wonder, though, what happened to Zadarski's app?
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.960]   Well the little flocker who could purchase it.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:33.840]   I tried little flocker, but like little snitch, it got so busy.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:39.200]   You had to prove so many things that I just took it off.
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:43.600]   But I think what will happen-- a very good company bought it, F-Secure.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:47.200]   We've talked to a Mika Hoponin who's their head of security there.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.200]   They're really credible.
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:49.720]   They've been around for a very long time.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:55.600]   They're going to build it into a new product, I presume, for the Mac called X-fence.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:06.120]   Little flocker monitored apps that attempted to access confidential files and system resources.
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:11.320]   So in doing that would block, for instance, ransomware and would also protect your privacy.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.600]   But you keep getting these pop-ups.
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:13.600]   Here's one.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.680]   Microsoft Word, little flocker detected an attempt to read the following file and then
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:19.800]   you could deny or allow it.
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:24.000]   And just like little snitch, you could say, do it this time until I quit, until I restart
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.440]   or forever.
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:30.600]   And basically, I think the problem with programs like this, you get inundated with these announcements.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:36.560]   At some point, you go, forever, allow, allow, allow, allow, allow.
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:37.560]   Right.
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:38.560]   Dialog fatigue.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:39.960]   Yeah, Dialog fatigue.
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:46.960]   However, if, you know, I still recommend little snitch, if you're worried and a little flocker,
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:50.160]   and I'd be very interested to see how they package this in a more consumer-friendly way
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.160]   at F-Secure.
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.160]   So look for Z-fence.
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.960]   I don't know when they're going to release that.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:02.440]   I think we can wrap it up and get you picked for the week.
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:06.640]   I don't see anything else of import here.
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.880]   Not a great week.
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:08.880]   Well, good enough.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.000]   You must stay on the air until that Mac comes out.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000]   That's it.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   It's going to fill a muster.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.640]   Have you seen this?
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:17.280]   This is a great new YouTube channel.
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:21.000]   The unofficial Apple hard drive, subtitled, God help my hard drive.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.800]   I mean, unofficial Apple archive.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:25.320]   God help my hard drive.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.880]   It is loaded.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:36.240]   If you're an Apple fan, as I'm sure you all are, with old Apple ads, videos, this is really
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:38.880]   a treasure trove.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:44.600]   Steve Jobs talking about the blue box story, Apple's Power Mac commercial.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.640]   Which one should we, there's so many good ones here?
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:49.080]   I don't know where to start.
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.920]   Do you have a favorite you'd like to see again?
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.520]   Which of the crazy ones?
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:56.640]   That would be fun to see again.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:57.840]   Let me see if that's here.
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.320]   You want to watch it?
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:00.320]   Oh, you know what?
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:01.320]   This is the bet.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:04.400]   So there's a Richard Dreyfus version, which is the one that aired on TV.
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:09.720]   But famously, Steve Jobs went into the voice booth to record it originally.
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:18.720]   So this is, here's to the crazy ones with Mr. Jobs doing the narration.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:21.280]   Here's to the crazy ones.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:30.960]   The misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes, the ones
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:33.680]   who see things differently.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:39.360]   They're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:45.400]   You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:49.120]   About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.600]   Because they change things.
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:55.240]   They push the human race forward.
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:00.520]   While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:02.520]   This is all a great mission to take.
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:08.280]   Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.280]   who do.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:14.480]   That's hard not to get shows when you see that right here.
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:17.040]   Yeah, that's just again a brilliant mission statement.
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.560]   And one that I hope that we keep seeing over and over again.
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:30.760]   If you do get info on the text edit and look at the sample document, the opening text of
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.240]   that is actually part of the icon.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:35.760]   That's how important the user was.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:40.880]   I wonder how much they, I would love at some time to see how much they paid to license
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:41.880]   all those.
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:44.360]   Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein.
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:48.160]   That must have been a hugely expensive commercial for the licenses.
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:50.560]   Yeah, that must have been a hugely expensive campaign.
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:54.840]   Because remember they also reproduced, they had a series of posters that were just brilliant.
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.080]   Where they, obviously they had to get rights to all these classic photos to put them on
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.080]   billboards to give them away.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:08.080]   There was a, and these agreements can be really draconian.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:09.080]   So I'm not surprised.
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:13.640]   There was a party at MacFarled Expo while this campaign was going.
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:17.840]   And I think it was dance development who did a recent do retrospect.
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:22.600]   They printed a series of fake, the theme of the party was drink different.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:27.240]   And so they had like, they made a whole series of like drink different posters in that style
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:32.000]   with like celebrities, like with alcohol.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.440]   And I kept my eye on this.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:35.600]   It was just decorations for the party.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:39.560]   And I kept my eye on this on the Marilyn Monroe, beautiful photo of Marilyn Monroe just like
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:40.560]   sipping champagne.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.560]   Like I, that's going home with me.
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.560]   I'm just going home.
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:45.720]   I don't care if it costs me my career.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:47.520]   That that poster is going home.
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:52.720]   And so after hinting at it and then suggesting it and just buttering everybody up, I could
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:55.920]   possibly have still no, no, we had to license all those photos.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:01.280]   And part of that is that we, the deal is not complete until we send that we send them video
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:04.440]   of us cutting up these posters into tiny, tiny bits.
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:05.440]   Wow.
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:09.080]   So it probably cost, it probably cost Apple a lot to get that got those rights.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:12.520]   They, you can't use those without paying the estate.
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.160]   Oh, you pay, you pay them.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:16.960]   But not only that, but they weren't asking for something little.
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:18.680]   They were saying we want the right to reproduce.
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.920]   We want the right to use them in advertising.
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:23.560]   And that's just like guess, guess what?
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:28.960]   At the agency pizza for everybody and then a check for everybody for $500,000.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:33.160]   And then I am out of here with a steal.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.640]   But maybe one of the great certainly top 10 ads of all time.
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:40.840]   And by the way, not the only Apple on that ad on that list, including 1984.
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:46.560]   And actually, if you go to this YouTube channel, there's a lot of classics.
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:47.800]   Some really great stuff.
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:50.400]   I want to watch them all because I remember them all.
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:53.920]   The unofficial Apple archive, God help my hard drive.
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:55.480]   It's on YouTube.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:59.640]   Let's take a break and we'll come back with your picks of the week or show today.
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:00.640]   I brought you by.
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:01.640]   Before you, yeah.
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:03.920]   Sorry, I was going to say, did you see the, the, they're suing tie?
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:04.920]   What is it?
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:09.480]   Swatch or one of the companies for click, click different, we're using a variation of the
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:10.480]   campaign.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:13.240]   Oh, I didn't see that in their watch commercials.
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:14.240]   So that's interesting.
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.080]   Can you own the word different?
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:17.840]   I think it was tick different or talk.
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.320]   So close, right?
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.320]   This morning.
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:22.320]   Apologies for interesting.
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.400]   Apple, of course, there it is.
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.240]   Swatch is provocative.
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:31.240]   Tick different campaign has riled Apple up.
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:33.680]   God, I don't know.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.640]   Could you really win a suit on that?
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:36.640]   It's a differently.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:38.320]   Yeah, that's the other thing.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:39.320]   It's ungrammatical.
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:40.320]   We know that.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:41.320]   Yeah.
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:44.040]   But that, but that also actually makes Apple's case a little bit stronger saying that no,
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:45.480]   they, this is ungrammatical.
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.480]   This was a flare that we added.
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:51.080]   It'll end with, it'll end with somebody saying, how much do we write to?
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.760]   How big a check do we write to make this go away?
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:53.760]   Come on.
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:58.440]   Apparently, Apple first went to the Swiss Federal Institute of intellectual property
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.440]   or SVIP.
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:00.880]   Oh, wouldn't you?
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:03.200]   And that didn't work.
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:07.600]   So now they've gone to the Swiss Federal Administrative Court.
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.760]   Swatch.
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:15.480]   So in its defense, Swatch says, the similarity is purely coincidental and a nod to the slogan,
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:20.120]   always different, always new, which they used in the 1980s.
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:21.120]   Hmm.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.680]   That's an interesting thing.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:29.560]   And we're ending net neutrality so the consumers are no longer confused by privacy policies.
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.560]   Right.
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:39.080]   According to Swiss publication, Watson, Apple has to prove its claim by showing the court
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:45.520]   that more than 50% of local consumers associate, think different with the Apple brand.
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:48.520]   You know, they haven't used, think different in 15 years.
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:52.160]   So that might be a little tricky.
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.160]   Interesting.
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:58.760]   UK intellectual property office denied Apple rights to the name I watch after Swatch complained
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:02.000]   it was too similar to its I swatch trademark.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.640]   That's a long time to get revenge.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:05.600]   They've been putting this up for a while.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:09.680]   Apple believes that revenge is a dish best served cold.
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:14.560]   Show you are show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:19.280]   If you're in the market for a new house or you're, you have a house and maybe think about
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:22.880]   refying, you can't really, I don't know, maybe some of you can write a check for a new
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:26.080]   house, but most of us have to get a mortgage.
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:29.880]   Our house took us a month, a month to get the mortgage.
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:32.400]   We thought, oh, this will, you know, how long could this take?
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.400]   We had a vacation plan.
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:39.760]   We ended up being, we were faxing documents from a cruise ship because it took so long.
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.640]   That's before Rocket Mortgage came along.
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:45.800]   Rocket Mortgage is from quick and loans, one of the best lenders ever.
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.800]   These guys are great.
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.720]   And, you know, you don't take my word for it.
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:53.320]   Look at all those JD power customer satisfaction awards.
[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:57.880]   So when it comes to the big decision of choosing a mortgage lender, you want to work with someone.

[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.480]   We love you guys.
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:08.000]   Equal housing, lender licenses in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org number 30.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.120]   30quickandloans.com/macbreak.
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:13.200]   We thank them for making Mac break weekly possible.
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:14.440]   Andy, you're not going to go.
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:17.000]   Let's kick things off with your pick of the week.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000]   I got a quick one, but a good one.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:25.680]   We were talking last week about how I use my iPad and how much I like it even above my
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:28.040]   MacBook because it's so easy to just focus on.
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:31.520]   I just need the big-- I just need the big window pane for the stuff I'm working on and
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:33.920]   a little window pane for the fact checking.
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:39.440]   And so I've been using different window managers, but I recently switched to one called Magnet.
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:43.520]   Specifically because after taking a look at these things, it does a really, really good
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:48.600]   job of letting me approximate that kind of setup where I don't want to look at this screen
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:52.360]   as though it's a collection of windows, even if it's a collection of nicely tiled windows.
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:56.160]   I really want to see it as a case of here is the main thing I want to be looking at.
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:59.440]   And here is a supplemental thing that I just want to keep an eye on.
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:05.320]   And they recently-- it's amazing how much something could be improved with a simple change.
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:09.720]   They added support for thirds, which for me was what cracked it for me.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.960]   And that change just came a few weeks ago.
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:15.840]   So it's really, really easy for me to set up a two thirds, one third display.
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:20.480]   And it works just by dragging windows into hot corners of the screen or hot sections.
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:25.840]   Just by grabbing the title bar and dragging it to the edge, it becomes half the size of
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:26.840]   the screen.
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:33.160]   By dragging it to the bottom, it becomes a third that's in the middle of the screen.
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:36.520]   It just becomes second nature that this is how I want my desktops laid out.
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:39.320]   And this is what I want to do with that window.
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:41.520]   And on top of all that, it's only 99 cents.
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:48.680]   It is-- I know how your eyeball should roll when-- oh, it's on sale for 99 cents, because
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:53.680]   oftentimes things are on sale for like 18 months for 99 cents or whatever.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:55.360]   But I did pay full price for it.
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:58.520]   And now it was-- should grand defy that it is actually 99 cents now.
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:01.920]   So for a buck, download it, take a look at it.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:02.920]   It's definitely worth the wait.
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:05.440]   It has made my MacBook look more productive.
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:06.440]   Nice.
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:07.440]   Yeah.
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:08.440]   Isn't it funny?
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:12.440]   The early days of windowing, there was this massive battle.
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:16.880]   I mean, it was a fight, a flame war, between people who supported that kind of window style,
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:20.240]   which they call tiling, because they're like tiles, and overlapping windows.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:22.680]   And the overlapping windows won.
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:24.240]   But maybe not forever, right?
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:25.240]   We're going back to tiling.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:29.840]   But I'll remember the first version of Windows had a tiling system because they knew that
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:33.080]   Apple was going to be steamed.
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:34.960]   That they were creating a windowed graphical.
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:39.080]   So their first step was, we're going to do a tiled version so that we can say, oh, no,
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:41.080]   no, no, our windows don't overlap.
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:42.080]   Also, though--
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:43.240]   Your regulations consider similar.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:46.680]   Overlapping is much more processor intensive.
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:48.680]   Tiling is a lot easier to do.
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.920]   Because you got to do that calculation with every single scroll.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:53.920]   Here's what's-- here's the part that's hidden.
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:54.920]   Here's the part that's hidden.
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:56.880]   You got to have a region that's displayed and not displayed.
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:01.400]   Plus, when you-- if people start dragging windows at, that's nightmare.
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:04.800]   So it is always easier to do a tiling interface programming wise.
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:05.800]   Absolutely.
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:09.200]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, what do you got for us?
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:15.600]   So over the weekend, I decided to-- I'm constantly kind of going through and I had someone suggested
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:19.240]   that I look at the masters.
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.240]   And the masters--
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:21.240]   The masters class tournament?
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.240]   The iOS and Apple TV.
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:23.240]   Oh.
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:24.240]   Well, the iOS and Apple TV app.
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:25.240]   Oh.
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:26.240]   And they're amazing.
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:27.240]   What are they?
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:33.680]   You know, the-- well, so they-- you know, basically, whether you're watching on iOS or
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:37.560]   Apple TV, you know, that basically gives you a lot of data.
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.200]   So you can get full screen.
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.440]   If you're watching-- you can-- we're able to watch the event live.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:44.320]   So you can watch the-- the-- the golf live if you-- if you want to.
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:46.600]   But you can also see replays.
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.240]   There's all kinds of video.
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:49.240]   It breaks it out.
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:52.400]   You can double click on it and it opens up and it shows you stats, like especially on
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:56.040]   the Apple TV, it shows you stats as well as what you're doing live because you don't
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:00.040]   really need to see it the whole-- you know, and-- and I think that eventually if we ever
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:06.120]   get a 4K version of the Apple TV or whatever somewhere down-- you know, somewhere in 2018
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:11.560]   with the Mac Pro, the-- that I think that, you know, you can see where you could have
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:14.640]   a lot of heads up, you know, data.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:18.360]   And even on a-- at 1080p, it's very compelling.
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:21.640]   You know, you can still see what you need to see in a quarter screen and then see a whole
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:22.880]   bunch of other things as well.
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:26.280]   So I think that-- one of the things I think is interesting is that this is the first time
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:31.600]   I've really seen an app do something where I'd rather watch the app than the TV.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.360]   You know, like, you know, so a lot of times these apps have been great about sending us
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:35.360]  --
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:36.360]   It is cool.
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:37.360]   --content, you know.
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.800]   There's plenty of time to watch both.
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:43.800]   And you know, the-- and I will say that MLB does a pretty good job of baseball as well.
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:47.320]   Also, plenty of time to watch both.
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:51.960]   But I think that there is-- I think that these are pointing towards something that's
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:56.600]   coming which are these kind of-- these displays where we're going to get to see a lot more
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:59.120]   information than a full screen-- than you're just basic full screen.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.280]   I'm just going to watch it passively.
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.560]   I'm going to get a lot of data.
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:04.680]   I think what we're going to see is the next step of this is more interaction where people
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:07.400]   are actually able to type things in and so on and so forth.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:12.880]   So I think it's just a really good example of the future of a lot of sporting events,
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:17.240]   you know, being able to get a lot more information than what you necessarily want to watch on
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:18.240]   broadcast.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:21.280]   So they can still give you the feed that you're going to watch, but they can also send you
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:24.520]   all that information that you only get to see when they do lower thirds or they cut to
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:25.520]   the full screen.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:30.200]   And all of that I think is going to be something that a lot of people get into over time.
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:34.560]   So anyway, it's an interesting app to check out, to see what I think is probably-- you
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:38.800]   know, for a lot of different coverage, probably the future of using up-- how do you use up
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:41.120]   4K without actually using 4K source material?
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:44.240]   Of course, now that the message is over, does this--
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:45.240]   There's lots of replays there.
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:46.240]   There's still stuff.
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:47.240]   Okay.
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:48.240]   Yeah, yeah, you can see a lot of replays.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:50.240]   You can't see the live, but you can definitely see a lot of the--
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:51.240]   There's nothing left.
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:55.920]   But I imagine we'll see more of this from, you know, as those things pop up again.
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:56.920]   Cool.
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:59.480]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, imore.com.
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.480]   We already know what you're going to plug.
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:03.640]   Yeah, so totally self-serving.
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:05.680]   I apologize, but it's a lot of fun to work on.
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:09.600]   And Mac Break is like where I can share some of the inside baseball stories behind this.
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:13.920]   So a couple of years ago at WWDC, I met a gentleman named Chris Harris, who had then
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:16.960]   worked for the company that made a lot of the BBC-related apps.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:20.200]   And he had just made Wonders of the Universe, which was a gorgeous-- I think a word was
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:22.200]   a winning app at the time.
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:25.720]   And if you've never met Chris, he is like Tigger, if Tigger drank a lot of Jolt Kola.
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:26.720]   That was dear.
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:28.160]   You don't believe he sleeps.
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:33.200]   And he's very, very British, very, very proper, but incredibly bright, incredibly creative.
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.440]   He was doing all sorts of location-based apps before they became mainstream, just a really
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:37.640]   smart guy.
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:41.360]   We started-- we continued the conversation at Ull in a WWDC this year.
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:42.640]   And finally, we got serious about it.
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:47.320]   And he built an entirely new iPhone and iPad app for us, an iOS app for us.
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:49.080]   And yes, it is beautifully yellow.
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:51.160]   So I'm going to tap on this.
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:55.280]   And it doesn't have all the features of the old app yet, because it's a brand new engine.
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.280]   Everything about it is new.
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:01.320]   It's built on the tapjet technology that he uses for a lot of different types of apps.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:02.880]   But it has featured stories.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:05.840]   It has all the different categories that I'm more is now covering.
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:09.120]   If I tap on this, you get all the different guides, which have been really popular because
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:12.800]   there's so much confusion as to what to buy and when to buy it.
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:15.720]   And it has, of course, all the help articles.
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:18.160]   And we're adding features all the time.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:22.360]   So we have a very aggressively pull this back a bit so you can see a very aggressive update
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:23.600]   schedule for this.
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.760]   But it's just-- I like it because it's very liquid.
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:30.120]   It just-- he formats things so nicely and they flow so nicely and they pop up and move
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:31.120]   around so nicely.
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:32.880]   So you can read all the articles there.
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:35.840]   Some people have been a little bit confused because they see highlights.
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:37.520]   There's a button underneath that says see everything.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:40.800]   And you can just tap that and get everything in that category.
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.600]   So the main pages are more just the latest from each of the categories.
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:47.360]   But you tap "see all" and you'll see everything.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.360]   And you can tweak the size of the fonts and everything.
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.200]   You just need to read bigger.
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:52.200]   So we're super happy.
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:56.280]   And this is iPhone and iPad available now in the App Store.
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:58.440]   If you're using the old version, it's an update to that app.
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:00.040]   So you don't have to go find anything new.
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:03.120]   It'll just update for you in place.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:05.760]   And we're all super, super excited about it.
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:07.800]   Very nice of the big next moves.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:12.440]   Read more about it at imore.com.
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:14.760]   Listen to their podcasts too, including Apple Talk.
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:15.760]   We're nazing them.
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:16.760]   What?
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.560]   Because it confused people.
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:19.880]   We're moving a few things around.
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:22.160]   And we changed the name of Apple Talk because Marko Michael
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:26.040]   Gartenberg and myself, and we wanted to talk about more than just Apple.
[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:28.960]   So the name of the show now-- again, the feed is the same.
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:30.240]   So it surprised some people.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.960]   Is next 10 words, which is obviously another West Wing, rather
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:34.080]   than the guilty of that.
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:36.120]   Oh, what's the reference?
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:38.640]   So in the debates, Bartlett comes out.
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:42.040]   And the whole show, they were worried about what the 10 word answer was going to be.
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:43.200]   Your taxes are too high.
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:44.440]   I'm going to lower them.
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:49.240]   And then the guy finally says it, and Bartlett says, I'll tell you what it is.
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:50.280]   That's the 10 word answer.
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:51.200]   That's the tip of the sword.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:53.120]   But life is seldom a 10 word answer.
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:54.200]   What are your next 10 words?
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:55.880]   What are the 10 words out of that?
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:57.920]   I've been president of the United States for a long time,
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.080]   and seldom are things nuanced.
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:01.120]   And when it are, it usually involves a body count.
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:04.000]   If you can give me an answer, I'll drop out right now.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.080]   So what we're trying to go below the sound--
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:07.160]   Sorry, more than the sound count.
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:09.120]   That is a great quote.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.400]   Renee, is that by any chance one of your favorite West Wing quotes of all time?
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:15.360]   Because all of them-- I didn't see you staring at it,
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.200]   living toward cue card or anything.
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:18.760]   That was my brain record.
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:19.760]   Of course, nothing.
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:22.080]   So anyway, the first guest is Nile Patel from The Verge.
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:24.600]   And we talk about the Apple Map Pro announcements.
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:26.600]   And Michael has some interesting guests.
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:32.160]   He had last week, he had Hope Scott-- sorry, Lisa Hope, King from Cheddar TV on.
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:33.680]   And just he's picking some really interesting quotes.
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:35.080]   Nice.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:35.360]   Great.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:38.640]   Well, you find all the podcasts that I'm more under the hamburger menu
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:40.120]   at the bottom there, podcasts.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:40.720]   And there's--
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.880]   New Yellow Hamburger menu.
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:43.480]   New Yellow Hamburger menu.
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:44.520]   Go check it out.
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:45.120]   Get excited.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:46.080]   Cheese burger menu.
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:46.920]   It's a cheeseburger.
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:47.480]   You're right.
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:49.120]   Or poutine burger.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:49.560]   Poutine burger.
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:51.920]   With mustard.
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:55.760]   If you want more anti-annoco, there's places you can go.
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:57.320]   There's treatments for that.
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:57.920]   Go to CW--
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:58.760]   I'll tell you where to go.
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:00.400]   I'll tell you where to go.
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:01.640]   CWOB.com.
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:07.200]   And of course, the Chicago Sun-Times, where he's a regular contributor
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:08.400]   in the technology section.
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:11.040]   What are you working on these days?
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:14.120]   Actually, doing a lot of 360 video stuff,
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:19.120]   I've been starting to be semi-regular on Boston WGBH
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:21.080]   public radio talk about technology.
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:23.080]   So we're going to be doing three--
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:25.960]   if things go well in the Boston Public Library's Wi-Fi
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:30.560]   is up to the task, I'm going to be doing full 360-degree streaming
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:32.200]   video on YouTube or Facebook.
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:33.000]   Wow.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.160]   Well, during the half hour, they'll be on the show.
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:36.000]   That's great.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.520]   For to that.
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:39.840]   Is WGBH in the Boston Public Library?
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:40.920]   Why aren't you--
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:43.240]   No, they-- oh, my goodness.
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:46.480]   I have to set my own conversational shot clock thing.
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:49.080]   You're not allowed to talk for 30 minutes about this.
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:51.080]   There are two halves of the Boston Public Library,
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:54.880]   the gorgeous jewel box that was built in 1893,
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.920]   and then the addition, the Johnson Building, that
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:58.560]   was added in 1970.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:03.440]   That was done in brutalist style, which basically,
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:05.040]   if you go to that section of the library,
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:07.160]   it looked like the place that you would
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:10.440]   go to beg for the life of your dissident father who
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:13.960]   disappeared after saying something unpleasant about the Commissar.
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:14.640]   That's how--
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:15.640]   Wow.
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:19.240]   But then they finally, a few years ago, totally reinvented.
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:21.000]   It totally redesigned it, opened it up.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000]   And one of the things they did was
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.240]   they turned the whole first floor into sort of like an Apple
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:27.920]   store where anybody can walk in, there's great Wi-Fi,
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:32.240]   there's a big cafe, and WGBH decided, well, why don't we
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:34.000]   just actually build a studio there?
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.280]   So it's not all-- it's one of their studios.
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:37.440]   It's not like their main thing.
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:40.120]   But it means that if you're coming in for lunch or whatever,
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:44.160]   you might be watching and listening to a bunch of people
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:46.560]   talking about issues of the day anytime of the day or night.
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:48.680]   So it's really-- it turned from a place
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:53.840]   that I would just would never walk into a place where it's almost--
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:58.240]   OK, if I'm heading on Boyleson Street from that direction,
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:00.760]   I will not walk past the Johnson Building
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:04.640]   to enter via the cool jewel box entrance.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:07.480]   I will now actually enter through the Johnson Building
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:10.480]   because that new cafe has really good cookies and stuff.
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:12.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:14.480]   And you kept it under three.
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:15.000]   That's good.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.040]   Nice job.
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:20.240]   Alex Lindsey, as always, the best place to find out what Alex is
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:23.000]   up to is your Twitter account, right?
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:23.480]   Yep.
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:24.480]   Absolutely.
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:25.480]   Yeah.
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.280]   He didn't shave for his photo for that one.
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:29.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.360]   That's how you'll look at the--
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:32.120]   I think my sister took it-- my sister took it
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:34.000]   where we're in the backyard having a barbecue, I think.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.040]   And I just decided--
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:36.760]   That's a grizzled field reporter photo
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:37.760]   they use for the Pulitzer's.
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:38.640]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:39.160]   Exactly.
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:41.000]   That's the men lay, Alex Lindsey.
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.760]   A-L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:46.280]   What does Alex Lindsey say?
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:49.360]   Well, you'll find out at Alex Lindsey.
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:50.640]   Thank you all for being here.

[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:56.640]   That would be about 2 PM Eastern time.
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:59.440]   1,800 UTC, give or take.
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:00.040]   Stop by.

[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:11.840]   on-demand versions, not only at our web--
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:13.760]   everything we do, not only at our website, in this case,

[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:21.240]   But also wherever you subscribe to your favorite shows
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:24.720]   on the big bad internet.
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:25.600]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:26.520]   It's great to have you.
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:27.320]   Come back again.
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:28.400]   Let's do this all again.
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:32.400]   But for now, it's back to work because break time is over.
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:35.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
