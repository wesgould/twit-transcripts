[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   The Double Album.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Mac Break Weekly is brought to you by Audible.com.

[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   And by listeners like you. Thanks for your donations.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Let us begin this show. Whatever it might be, whatever it may turn out to be.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly with the largest cast ever assembled.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   A cast so big, we had to fill a stadium.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Starting, I'm going to do this in Skype order, which means totally randomly.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Andy Ennaco from the Chicago Times, "Suntimes" or "Tuntimes" or "Fun Times".
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Unfortunately, the guy who is supposed to register the "Suntimes" domain let it lapse.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   So we had to register something similar.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   So update your bookmarks.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   It's now "Tuntimes.com".
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I think "Suntimes.com" goes to some sort of like organic nut in the Berry Farm.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   He's joking, kids.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I should just warn everybody as we probably should have done last week before the FSK CY incident,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   that anything you hear on this show you should not do.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   You should not believe it is all a hoax.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Merlin Mann, Mr. FSCK-FY. Hello, Merlin Mann.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I got a note from a friend who literally turned his Mac into a Bologna.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   He's FSCK.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And now he has a large piece of deli meat.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   My Bologna, he has a first name, it's FSCK-FY.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Thank you, Merlin.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Merlin's at 43folders.com.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Also here is Scott Born from the Born Ultimatum, the Born Supremacy,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   but more importantly, Padango, GirlsGongiq.TV and the ApplephoneShow.com.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Hello, Scott Born.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I am so excited to show all about Geezer.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Finally, I get to shine.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   No, no, no.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Weez-weezer.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Weezer?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Weezer?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Who is we?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   It's Weezer.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I thought it was all about Geezer's old guys.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I thought it was time for me to really get to shine.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Never mind.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   What's all this about Geezer's?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Alex Lindsay.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Alex Lindsay's also here from the Pixel Core, but I want...
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Hello.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Oh, see now your T1 sounds great.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Oh, doesn't seem to...
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   We just need to...
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   We wired it.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   We're not even...
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   But our biggest, most exciting person here on the panel, I am so thrilled to welcome.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   The drummer from Weezer, Mr. Patrick Wilson.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Patrick, hello, welcome.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   How's everyone?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Doesn't he sound warm?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It's that two...
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   That's the proximity effect on the mic here.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And the tube amp.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You're actually going through a tube amp?
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I'm actually going through an...
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   A vintage channel strip out of a quad-eight console with transformers, so that's why it's
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   so smooth.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Wow.

[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   It's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   It's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   It's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   It's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   It's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   It's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   It's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   It's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   It's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   It's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   It's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   I think that's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I think that's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I think that's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I think that's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I think that's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I think that's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   I think that's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I think that's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I think that's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   I think that's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   I think that's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   I think that's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   I think that's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   I think that's a little bit of a cool thing.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Did you guys see that?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   No, what did he say?
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   He's like, "Oh, they're not really being on the up and up."
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   He was just kind of complaining about how he's more OG than they are.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Because they did a CD as well.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I think because you can't download from the in Rainbows site anymore, can you?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Now, they're going to have CDs out. Maybe they pulled it back.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   What is he saying it's essentially a publicity ploy on their part.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   It's interesting because I started thinking about this.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   We'll be out of our contract after the next record.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   I'm like, "Man, is anyone going to care?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Is it going to seem so played out that, "Oh, yeah, here's our record.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Go give us whatever you like for it."
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Or is it still going to be exciting?
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Maybe he's feeling a little bit of that.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Hold on. I'm doing something actually cooler than Radiohead.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   But he was number two.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Yeah, or it's just like a kind of a getting past the novel aspect of the free price.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Would you be able to convince the rest of the band to leave the label and go it on your own?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   You know, it's...
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   I'm not asking because I want to put you in a difficult position with Gefan.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I'm not asking you if that's your plan.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I'm just saying what their reaction would be to something like that.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   I don't know because I'm like the guy who's always coming up with the hair-rain scheme.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Like, "Hey, let's do this." So, probably if I suggested that almost guarantees it won't happen.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   But I think we'll have a million options in front of us once that time comes.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   But let me... I have to say, there's a reason that record companies were around in the first place.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   It's because they work as sort of like ideally as an aggregator.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Like, "Hey, we know what's smart or we know what's good.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Here, check it out. We believe in this."
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I mean, obviously that balance has been kind of shredded because, you know, as time goes on,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   the quality is more like a lowest common denominator, in my opinion.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And when you started... I mean, even in the '90s, when you started, it still was so expensive to make a record.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   You couldn't do it. You could use that for track, but you couldn't really do a bang-up job by yourself, right?
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Well, here's the irony. That record, the blue record, which to this day sells more than the other records every week,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   costs $120,000 to make.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Is that including a K6?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Yeah, Rick Ocacic was... He was with us on that.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Now, every single record we've made after that has cost exponentially greater.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   We probably just dropped a million bucks making a record.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   And that's why I went like, "Come on, guys, let's get back to basics here."
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   My idea is, let's go live to two-track. Let's plug everything into the console.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   And that was "Stay of the Artbag" in my day.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Dude, I mean, listen to kind of blue. Listen to take five.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Those records are amazing.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   How do I go with 40-42 takes or whatever, but man, you can't get any better sound than that.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Well, here's news for you, though. Never mind by Nirvana.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   You think... I mean, Butch Figg made him do Smells Like Teen Spirit like 60 times.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Wow.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   And that's with all the technology.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Wow.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   So you still have to do it.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   You still have to do it.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   You don't have to do punches as much, though, right? As a drummer.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   You get... You don't have to...
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   You start. You still... You lead off.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Well, what we try and do is get like what I kind of call the "pure take," which is us interacting.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Honestly.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   And then with the idea of keeping the drums.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And if anything else is magic, they'll keep it.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   But mostly you'll just go back and fix mistakes.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   On my end, I like to keep it so that the drums are the bedrock and I don't really go back and fix anything.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I think that's...
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Because when you start opening up a Pro Tools session and you start moving kicks and snares around,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   suddenly just cut it to the grid.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   You know, make dance music out of it because you can't...
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Seriously, it just turns into, you know, nickel bag or something.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   And props the nickel bag for being, you know, gazillionaires and being successful.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   But I don't want our records to sound like that.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Patrick, how do you feel about stuff like your songs appearing in GarageBand?
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   I mean...
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   In RockBand.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Yeah, I think it's great.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   That's where I have to confess.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   I'm not as musically hip as most people.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   I'm still listening to the latest, you know, three-dog night record.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   But I found your music there and really enjoyed it.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   And I wonder how many people like me, you know, get exposed to you through something like a video game,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   which has been selling like hotcakes.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   And how does the record company play into those kinds of deals?
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Because those are the kind of licensing deals that a lot of musicians wouldn't have the business ability to negotiate.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   I'm just curious what you think about all that.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Well, I think in general, video game people kind of look at what they do as doing you a favor in some ways.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Like, hey, you know, if you want to get a song into a video game, it's just like a soundtrack.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   There's not a ton of money for the bands, but I think it's invaluable because that's what kids do, man.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   I play games.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   I mean, that's what's...
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   That's one of the main reasons why CD sales are down because, I mean, sure, there's all kinds of other reasons.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   But people got things to do and one of them's play video games.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Right.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   I was amazed.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   My brother makes me these, you know, mix CDs.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   And I can't...
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   You know, I was like, where do you ever hear this on the radio?
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   He doesn't hear any of it on the radio.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   He hears it on skiing videos.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Oh, in terms of things.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   And so he finds the music from those things and then he listens to those.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   And then he takes the best of that and sends us mixed stuff.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   And it's really fresh and the stuff that I would have never heard.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   I would have never found any other way than him putting it in front of us.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   I love it.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   I think it's great.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Any way that you can reach people and turn them on to music is great.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Do you make a lot of money with your live performances?
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   We make the majority of our pie that comes from merchandise and performances.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   I mean, I'm sure you guys have discussed ad nauseam how the typical band deal for a band
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   deal for a label is not very equitable.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Well, have you...
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Has that brought up the question of why don't we release some singles or some songs for
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   free just strictly because it builds up to make more money through those avenues?
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   And basically indirect income from the music.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   It's interesting because two records ago, we basically sort of wrote the record with fans.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   We were mad at the label and we were like, all right, F them.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   We're going to work with fans directly, almost like a giant focus group.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   And in some ways that was really interesting, but in other ways, I think it removes the
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   layer of mystery that I think is, for us, more important than pure transparency.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   You think of Led Zeppelin and those guys never did interviews.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   They never did anything.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   You never even saw pictures of them.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   So for us, that's kind of like where we're heading on it.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   You're going into hiding?
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Not really.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   We're just trying to find a balance.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Who cares if...
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Oh, what if I was on Twitter, dude?
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   I don't even know what Twitter is, but I know that you guys are into it.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   And it's like, what is it?
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Like, I'm going to the bathroom.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Oh, I'm...
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   You know what?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   I love it because Devorag is always harsh enough Twitter.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   That guy rules.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   I thought on the last one I got him on there, but I see he hasn't signed up.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Obviously, just, you know...
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   That's a common misconception, Pat.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   The thing is, once you're on the can, that's when the Twitter Twittering gets really good.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   That's when it gets exciting.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   That's where you build a fan base.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   That's where actually Merlin does all his Twittering from.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   It's true.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   I'm pretty upfront about that.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Am I missing an opportunity here?
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Like, you are.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Can I just say about your leaving money on the table?
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Money on the table?
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   I think actually...
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   The first person who, like you, who gets on Twitter, first actual celebrity as opposed
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.520]   to faux celebrities will get a lot of attention, especially if you, instead of Twittering things
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.640]   like I'm having a hamburger right now, actually talk about your process.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.640]   I think that's...
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.840]   What it is is a mini blog.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.840]   It's a microblog.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.840]   A microblog.
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.400]   Which makes it easy because you only get 140 characters.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.480]   So it's not like you have to sit down and write something.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.480]   But you can say...
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.680]   Like, I could be at the DMV and be like, "Wow, DMV is really slow.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.680]   This stinks later."
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.680]   Awesome.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.680]   I could.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.640]   Are you going to discuss the new Zilgen symbols you're thinking of purchase?
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.440]   That would be interesting, right?
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.080]   Or why you prefer Zilgen over some other kind?
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.080]   That would be of interest.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.080]   Really?
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.080]   Oh yeah.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.880]   People who are in the drums would be all over that.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.280]   They're like, "Wow, this dude plays in a band and here's what he thinks and that's the
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.520]   way you build fan base and that's the way these things..."
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.520]   It's content.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.520]   I'm okay.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.280]   Even in 140 characters, it's about...
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.280]   It's about content.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.800]   It's about saying something that people are interested in.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.160]   For Merlin, his content is humor.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.320]   He was very funny.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.880]   I try to put in interesting links and stuff that I'm doing that's unusual.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:10.920]   They had Tom Petty or somebody from his retinue during the Super Bowl on Twitter briefly.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.720]   It was a lot of stupid stuff like, "Well, we're sitting backstage ready to go out."
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:21.080]   But it could have been something really interesting had somebody sat down and actually said something.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.840]   People just really like to interact, which is what makes it so much fun.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:29.280]   I did one of those lame "Here's what I'm doing today" sort of tweets where I was just
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.080]   saying, "Gee, I don't know whether I should go shopping for a few pairs of casual pants
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:39.240]   or gouge my eyes out with a rusty spoon and got lots of tweets and reply from fellow dudes
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.160]   who knew exactly what I was talking about, but also what some people say.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.160]   Oh, a fan.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.520]   You should order your pants from the internet.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.520]   I bought these people.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.440]   People who didn't get it, but still got it.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.440]   I'm now wearing a pair of internet pants and they're fabulous.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:59.080]   They have that enhanced padded seat to help with extra time spent sitting and special
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.000]   boobs connected to it.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.800]   They're built in stadium pals now, which is great.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:09.360]   The crotch is specially cut for the massive balls you have to have to take part in most
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.640]   of the internet discussions.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.200]   You guys, I've seen, remember, is a Carl that does your website?
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.200]   Does he still do that?
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.200]   Absolutely.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.400]   I remember you guys being in front of the stuff a really long time ago.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.760]   I guess that start as a, it seems like you guys have been pretty connected with your fans
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.760]   from early on.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.440]   I just remember that being a really great, one of the first comprehensive sites I remember
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.840]   that was actually kind of sanctioned by the band.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.320]   This is before my space in any of that.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.880]   You guys were out there putting up the lyric stuff and encouraging a lot of engagement.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.440]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.560]   I think there's a huge opportunity.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.440]   I just don't know what the hell it is.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.440]   Nobody does.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.440]   I know.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.840]   So let me start, I could Twitter that.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   That's the beauty of it.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.840]   Nobody does.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.840]   That's the point.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.840]   You know what though?
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.640]   Part of it though is that you're providing, and this is an interesting diversion, but you're
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.920]   providing a certain kind of existential spackle between records for one thing, between records
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:06.160]   and tours, is unless you're the Smiths and you can put out another version of this charming
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.680]   man every couple months, you don't have product necessarily that you're going to put out
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.680]   all the time, but you're keeping this conversation going with the people who are really engaged
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.680]   with what you do.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.960]   And so even if you do that in a fairly unmet initially pimp in Twitter for this, but I think
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.880]   it's interesting to watch artists who even on a kind of high level, somebody like John
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.660]   Hodgman with his blog, like people are Colton for that matter who are out there like kind
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.960]   of actively staying in touch with people even when they don't have something to pimp.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.240]   And to me, that's the long game for this is engaged.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.880]   The unfortunate thing still at this point is the people you're reaching are a very narrow
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.440]   niche of people.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.280]   I mean, I think eventually it's going to become a larger slice, right?
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.280]   They're not all narrow.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.280]   So I'm a pretty wide.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:50.120]   They got a coach, a coach boy room, internet, internet users, a group, by the way, Sagan,
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:55.120]   we lost that Scott president of the four is on we challenge internet user.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.000]   So some of the sorry.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.640]   But I think that, you know, what we saw with with what nine inch nails did was was taking
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.720]   full advantage of a very, very narrow group, very niche group.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:13.560]   You know, there's only 2,500 people who wanted to pay $300 or whatever for for it worked.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.560]   Yeah, it worked.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.280]   And it was direct, you know, but it is something that, you know, they've been, they've been
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:23.160]   kind of building up for a long time, putting up entire songs in garage bands so that you
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.800]   can look at how I mean that.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.040]   I love that, by the way, that was a master's course in mixing.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.960]   Patrick, you, you, you, I mean, you guys do use my space.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.000]   Do you find that of value to you?
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.040]   I think rivers, rivers out of all of us values that sort of interaction the most.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.000]   He's got a Myspace blog and whatnot.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.560]   And I have a site too, but I've been so slack and updating it that because I get sick of
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.560]   me.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.000]   I'm like, who the hell is going to want to do what I have to say?
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.560]   I'm just going, what am I going to like rant about something that I'm going to go read
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.520]   it two weeks from I go like, shut up.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.000]   You see, you got to get over that.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   I think I've revised that.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   I'm going to revise it.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.320]   I'm going to get on Twitter.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.320]   You got to get over that, Patrick.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:08.400]   You got to kind of start to think that everything you say is a pearl and it'll be able to fit
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.400]   right in with everybody else.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.400]   Fantastic.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.720]   Well, for ever is is the front guy though, right?
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.640]   It makes sense the front guy would kind of you're sitting in the back.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.120]   Well, that's true, but we're sort of switching it up.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.120]   And I'm like, I have a tone.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.960]   I have a song on the next record, Scott and Brian do.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.960]   And I think rivers wants less.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:31.800]   Front man responsibility because all along he has and I don't think he's been that comfortable
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.800]   with the role.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.640]   Sounds like none of you are.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.520]   Sounds like none of you want to be in front.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.240]   Well, that's all changed here today.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.240]   Thanks to you guys.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.680]   We're putting you right up front.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:46.320]   You did a Kelly Keighy night ranger thing where you put your set up like page sideways.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.160]   Dude, that's so current.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.960]   Pat, do you even use fingerless gloves at all or?
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.960]   You rule.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.680]   I'm picturing sister Christian right now.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.920]   He's saying it.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.920]   Kelly sang it.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.920]   That's right.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.000]   He's saying it like a man too.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.160]   And that's back when men were men, even if their hair was big and chest hair.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:10.360]   You weren't afraid to dress like a space man or a surgeon in a hard.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:14.960]   I think the kids today, they're all about the slouchy jeans and this belt.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.360]   I don't want to go all Bill Cosby on you, but I'm just saying get out there.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.360]   We don't live it.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.360]   Wear it.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.360]   Dude, Bill Cosby all the way.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.360]   Here's what I don't want to see.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.640]   Oh, can you get your black hair out of out of your face and stop moping?
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.320]   That's what I want to say.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.440]   I thought you were emo, Patrick.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.440]   That's what I thought too.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.840]   But then I met emo people and I'm like, I guess I'm not emo.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.680]   Then you should go to live journal.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.520]   That's where that's the case you went into live.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.960]   Dude, I had Facebook.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.960]   I had a Myspace and I just realized, what am I doing?
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.040]   Maybe I'm too old.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.040]   Maybe I'm just fast.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.200]   Rettyping in all lower case.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.200]   That helps.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   I do.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.040]   No punctuation.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.320]   It bugs me.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.520]   It bugs me that I want to have correct punctuation.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.080]   I know on the same way.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.080]   Why do that?
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.080]   And I am.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.800]   Like almost like I'm using a quill pen.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.480]   Like everything is, you know, perfect grammar as much as I can.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.000]   My kids mock me for that.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Literally.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   I'm not making it up.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.480]   They say, why are you putting commas in there?
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.720]   You know what you might also do as Leo, tell them about you stream.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.840]   That's the one that he might be interested in.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.840]   I don't know.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.960]   Are you in the studio often, Patrick?
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.960]   Every day.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:20.960]   See, that's another thing you could do.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.480]   We're starting to do more of that, which is streaming.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.360]   He's going to love this.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.320]   He's going to really be excited about this one.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.440]   Love this streaming live video of what you do as you do it.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.640]   Like Justin TV.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.120]   Like Justin TV, exactly.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.440]   Oh man, I'll be tuning a snare for two hours.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.120]   I think, you know, I think you'd have a thousand people wrapped watching that just saying,
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.120]   wow.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.120]   Do you guys read it?
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.400]   I doeroo by William D.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.880]   Yes, it's that exactly.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.880]   It sounds like that.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:53.080]   I doeroo is about a synthetic, uh, teen idol, right?
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:59.680]   And it's like kind of like, I guess the, the underlying theme is the sort of like the sentient
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.560]   ability of something like that.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.560]   Right.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.120]   Do you feel like an idol or sometimes?
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.120]   No, no.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.120]   Good.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.120]   Good.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.920]   I know, I know, I know Merlin does.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.320]   Oh, you kidding me?
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.320]   Huh?
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.320]   Now just search an audible to see if I do.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.240]   Aru is up there because it'd be such a good pick.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.760]   You know, I want to see, I'm, I'm a huge fan of William Gibson and like Neil Stevenson.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.560]   I want to see movies made out of those things, but then I said thank you.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.240]   Well, it will jack them up and it won't be right.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:31.400]   You know, I have a bootleg copy that Corey Doctorow gave me of, uh, William Gibson reading
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.400]   Noremancer.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.400]   Oh, man.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.080]   And it is not available anymore.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:41.480]   It was available at one time and apparently, um, uh, Gibson is, I said, that was a lot of
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.480]   work.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.400]   I would really like that to come back out somewhere.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.400]   I read the whole darn book.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.400]   He's good at it too.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.600]   That's a good example though, Leo.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.680]   This is actually, I think this happens.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.680]   I don't think it's any secret.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.320]   Those people like David Allen putting out, you know, CDs, there's, there's no, there's
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.480]   this disconnect between the production of the thing.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.000]   So like you could go and you could be weezer or you could be David Allen or you could be,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   uh, uh, Gibson.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Can I be weezer?
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   You could be weezer.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Okay.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   And I'll be the beezer.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.640]   But you could go out and make, you could go out and make something that's really, really
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.640]   awesome.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:14.000]   And then the whole way of getting that into a channel where it sells in a way that is,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.560]   you think reasonable is like this whole other game.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.120]   And that's, you know, I think we used to always think of that process as being very,
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.240]   you know, kind of carved from the same stone.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.160]   But I mean, do you sense that at all Patrick?
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.800]   Do you feel like, you know, you do wish you had different options for like controlling
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:34.280]   that stuff, you know, before it lands in the notional, you know, tower records or whatever?
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:39.760]   You know, I think the biggest thing we've learned is you really can't control very much.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.200]   You can, it's just, you just do what you do and things fall where, let the ships fall
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:50.040]   where they may and, you know, if people are into you, they are as it's, um, I feel like
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:55.200]   our lives are so complex, like thinking about, I get sick of thinking about stuff.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.400]   Like, oh, we got to go talk to Spin Magazine.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.920]   Oh, well, be careful.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.160]   Don't say what you said last time.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.720]   And like, you know, at that, I just want to say what I want to say.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:09.320]   You get sick of marketing per se or of having to worry about what you say.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:15.440]   What I don't like is when you can tell that the interviewer is, is at least uninterested
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.840]   and at worst.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.840]   Hostile.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.840]   Right.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.840]   You want to be earnest.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.840]   Right.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.040]   And then, but you can tell, like, I mean, we've been burned so many times.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:28.240]   Like, believe me, we've stepped in it on our own accord a million times, but I think
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.920]   when you said you were bigger than Jesus, that was really a mistake.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.720]   I just want to say.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   Well, I can't tell you how many times like I started to get the idea like, you know what?
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.440]   I'm going to start taping these interviews.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.880]   And I'm going to put it up and people can, let's, let's compare and contrast.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.440]   I come, it has nothing to do with what we've done.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.440]   I've done that before.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.440]   I've totally done that before.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.520]   You think that that's actually the power of things like Twitter and MySpace and all these
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:56.120]   things, your blog, whatever that you can bypass and you can disintermediate, you can bypass
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.160]   the middleman and go directly to your audience.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.360]   And frankly, that's all the audience wants.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.280]   They don't want to listen to some snotty spin columnist.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.720]   They want to hear what you have to say.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.520]   Oh, there goes that cover.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.880]   I mean, rolling stone.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.160]   Hey, let me, you want to hear a little bit of the, like the first couple of sentences
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.040]   of Nuremancer read by William Gibson just just, just, just to wet your whistle stuff.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.040]   You cannot get.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.640]   I probably shouldn't play this.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.640]   This is a friend.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.040]   I'll be, this is a friend.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.440]   I don't know where I, I don't know where this came from.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.440]   There's some music.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.440]   I don't know.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.440]   I don't know what to put that there.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.440]   There's an orchestra.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.640]   Apparently there's an orchestra tuning up.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.840]   I don't know what that has to do with Nuremancer.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.840]   Skip.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.840]   Come on.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.840]   Bill, talk.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.840]   So that's not the next man.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.840]   This is ridiculous.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.840]   Maybe it's that Gromancer.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:49.520]   It's not the next man.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.520]   That's the wrong cut.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:54.520]   As he shouldered his way around.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.520]   Here he comes.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.080]   Door of the chat.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:02.600]   It's like my body's developed this massive drug deficiency.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.560]   It was a sprawl voice and a sprawl joke.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.360]   He's got, he's got a Texas accent.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.360]   It's great.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.160]   What are you laughing at?
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.640]   You know, this is being recorded that other people are going to suppose to listening
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.640]   to it.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.240]   Yeah, does it remind anybody else of Harrison?
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.240]   Okay.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.240]   Okay.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:23.280]   First of all, do you sure that the unit is plugged in after your service?
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.280]   Sorry, God.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.280]   Your story.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.560]   Sir, I need the tracking number before I can give you help.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.320]   What is the tracking number?
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.120]   Oh, I am not an India.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.320]   I am located in a call center in Iowa.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.520]   This is not going to help you get your, get your chemo up and running.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.720]   Maybe that's why they pulled it out.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.520]   Maybe it isn't very good.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.520]   Are you, are you, is that what you're saying?
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.160]   It's just, you're used to like Neil Gaiman.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.880]   You're used to like all these really good.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.440]   Sometimes authors should not read their own material.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.440]   I think you're probably right on that one.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:58.160]   I listened to Steve Martin and that was great, wasn't it?
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.160]   So great.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.160]   It was a great book.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.160]   But see, that's a little different because that's him talk.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.160]   It's a memoir.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.760]   So he's talking about his life.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.720]   And I, you know, I found it interesting.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.480]   I'm, I'm very interested in one of the reasons I ask you all these silly questions, Patrick,
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.360]   is I'm very interested in what happens.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:22.880]   And this, his book is very good for this, uh, born standing up in that transition between
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.080]   when you're doing what you, what you dig in your art and then suddenly, and then fame.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.160]   And it's a very, and you know, he, he's uncomfortable with it.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.240]   It changed his life in a way that he didn't like and it changed his art in the way he didn't
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.240]   like.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.240]   And it's very interesting to hear that transition.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.640]   So I'm always very interested in that.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.400]   Never having had that experience.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.400]   What?
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.400]   Leo Lapord is not famous.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.320]   He's one of his famous as weezer, baby.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.760]   Dude, you're like syndicated.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:50.080]   So you did the, you did that W on the back of the, uh, the, out of the logo, didn't you?
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.080]   You did that, didn't you?
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.080]   I did do it.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.080]   I was ripping Van Halen off.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.080]   This is like 1991.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   It's like a, yeah.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.080]   It's totally ripped it off.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.080]   And, uh, there you go.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.080]   Now, now other people think, well, is that water burger?
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.080]   What?
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.080]   It looks just like water.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.080]   I like it.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.080]   I so miss water burger.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.080]   I see.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.080]   I like that.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.080]   I like that.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.080]   I like that.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.080]   I like that.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.280]   just water burger? I see only thing. I'm not the only thing. I was one thing I miss about
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:18.080]   living in the south is what a burger? Oh, man. I could. I have William Gibson reading water
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:24.120]   burger. Would you like that? Now, Patrick, do you do a. To bring this back on. Please.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:29.120]   Thank you, Alex. Hey, hold on. Wait. Is that a rat hole? Yes. Oh, this guy listens to
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:39.480]   the show? Yeah. So the, you know, you say logic. I'm subscribe to mark break, weekly
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:46.760]   sweat, say cranky geeks and left, right and center. I don't know. I think it's like
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:51.080]   drink center. That's NPR. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's actually great. I have heard that.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:33:00.560]   Yes. Yeah. Wow. Are you are you using you're using logic to mix stuff down? I'm using
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:06.520]   it compositionally and as a mix as a mix thing. So that's kind of your main your main software
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:15.520]   for that for the problems or what? Well, no, we're like the band uses pro tools, which
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:21.760]   you loathe appropriate. I don't like it. And I know it's great for like that type of the
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:28.440]   way your mind works. Like I think the particularly like engineering type person loves pro tools.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:34.880]   But for some reason, I mean, I've tried everything. No, window, cubies, you name attraction. And
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:39.600]   for me, I just can't get anything done in pro tools. And plus I think, you know, there
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:44.920]   might be something wrong with you get a ton of tracks and the mix bus gets kind of choked
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:51.520]   sounding. But that's very esoteric. So and did you find that that it was a you find
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.200]   that a steep learning curve to a lot of people who come from pro tools find that logic is
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.480]   a hard one to get them around. It's just so different at all. In fact, I have a hard
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.480]   time with pro tools and I must have, I must have tried it forever. And I mean, I have
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:08.360]   an inbox sitting right here just because we'll get a session and I'll open it up. First thing
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.000]   I do is consolidate and export it to logic. Interesting.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.160]   Draw us a picture of your setup in there. This is this is your home studio. Yeah, like
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:24.280]   basically I have just it's one room like a like about a 10 foot ceiling to about 10
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:32.960]   feet by 16. Just tiny little room. But dudes, I just do so the favor and go to Costco and
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:40.200]   get the Vizio 42 inch LCD 1080p because I'm rocking it out of the MacBook and you can't
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.880]   you can't believe for 900 bucks. You have such a ridiculously good you're driving a
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:51.000]   42 inch display out of your back book and I'm using the MacBook display. It's awesome.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.560]   And you're using that for logic. I'm sorry, MacBook Pro. MacBook Pro. Yeah. Well, it's
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.400]   not using the native. Maybe it is. Well, I don't know what the native resolution of
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:05.640]   that. Oh, it's it's one to one picks on that. That's awesome. Is it is it a 1080p monitor?
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:11.720]   Yeah. Wow, that's cool. I was. That's your second monitor for 900 bucks. I got that on
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:19.680]   the wall. Apple wants twice that for a 30. I almost bought a Mac Pro today, but I held
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:25.840]   off. Which you do. Yeah. Wait, a Leo buys one. Wait, a live one. I'm about to buy one.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.720]   That's almost sure that that something's going to change. Well, isn't that where's that site
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:35.120]   that says when's a good time to buy a Mac? They're like, do buy it. Oh, yeah. What was
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:39.600]   that rumor? I forgot about that the we haven't looked at that in a while. I ignored it. I
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.240]   bought it on Monday. I bought mine on the fire. The fires guide. There's one good one that
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:48.920]   fires guy dot Mac rumors dot com. Okay. That's exactly it. Yeah. Yeah. So you're going to
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:56.920]   buy a Mac Pro, Leo? No, I'm not. No, I'm fine. I'll buy one. Yeah. No, I'm not. I'm not
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:01.560]   this since in their peer pressure trying to put their their alternative lifestyles on
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:09.480]   you, Leo. Don't just. No, I think I may buy a Mac Pro. That's what I meant. One of the
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:14.800]   eight ways. Yeah. I'm close to buying one of those because for string for the streaming
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.920]   video of the project that we want to do, I think I want to put it on a pretty heavy duty
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:22.160]   machine. So I think that's what I'll get. So I'll let you know that'll be that'll be in
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:28.200]   the next month or so. Well, I've got that. I've got, like I said, I run logic on that.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:33.840]   I got some good mics and preamps. What kind of mics do you use for your? You might I
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:38.160]   present my key drumming, like in the drum. Well, actually, you know, I have a V drums kit,
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.760]   which will. Yeah, it's like a rolling kit, but I don't use the internal sounds. I just
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:51.120]   record the MIDI and then I use like a reason drum kits 2.0 is astonishingly good sounding.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.280]   And what are you recording the special goodness with? Are you doing that yourself?
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:02.080]   That's I'm probably going to do that all old school and probably use tape to wow and
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:07.440]   a four track. No, no, that'll be like a big two inch machine with a giant console, like
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:13.760]   little lights up on stuff. That's all. It's ready. Eight track or 16 32. How many tracks?
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:20.120]   That would be a 24 track. That's good. You can get it. I got a tape spliker if you need
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.360]   to borrow it. That's a big that's a two inch tape. That's a big that's a big that's a
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:28.280]   big block. You're going to cut that way. And they smell good. How much so really you
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:33.320]   can buy those now cheap. They're around used, I presume. Yeah, there's studios. I mean,
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:38.200]   you can't believe it. Every studio I walk in, you know, 15 years ago, there's a $80,000
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:44.840]   machine now it's like get it out of here. Wow. Wow. That is tempting. It is until you
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:52.240]   realize that you can't buy tape. That's true. You get it. I got it's about 200 bucks a real
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:58.080]   that's 15 minutes of taped. Oh, forget that. At 30. It's mind you. Well, that's the thing.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:03.000]   It's very satisfying when those things are spinning at 30. It just feels like you're
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.240]   really doing some work there. I'll tell you something. There's something to be said about
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:17.480]   putting music into an A.D. converter until you absolutely have to. I'm not one of those
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:22.080]   guys who's like, you know, I'm like, dude, it's your way. Because we've shot stuff out
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:28.480]   all over the place. And I think digital stuff can sound really, really good. But you know,
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:34.280]   if it makes you excited to use tape, it's cool. I would do it. It doesn't sound any worse,
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:40.920]   I guess. It. Some people say the high end is a little smoother because it kind of rolls
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:47.040]   off. Right. But the real, the real trick with digital recording, especially Pro Tools,
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:51.840]   is don't record anything hotter than minus 12 is a little bit of a technical rat home
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:55.640]   for you. Wait a minute. Let me I have the theme now. We'll play that theme so you.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:12.960]   Play this one.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:21.960]   Just good to have it back. That's nice. Oh, we missed it. Paul said that in general, the
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:27.240]   entire thing is synthetic. Not there's not even the voices fake. The minus 12 minus 12.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:33.720]   That's a drop down on it. Yellow is the new red. Everything down right now. Well, that's
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:37.760]   one of the big differences on tape. You don't just you don't clip you distort and sometimes
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:41.840]   that's an effect people want. Right. Well, yeah, I mean, if you hit if you hit tape,
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:46.680]   just right, it gives you just enough of a like a compression that it makes things real
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:51.880]   pleasing. And also a lot of the gear that you use like a console like a really good old
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:58.240]   console has huge headroom like with digital like if you clip a converter, it's kind of
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:05.520]   un it's an unpleasing sound. But if you clip a desk like a big console, it just kind of
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.760]   makes it more exciting sounding. We went from tape to digital. Now we're going from digital
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:14.120]   back to tape and then we also have a digital that makes it sound like tape. So what's next?
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.800]   Dude, I have it all and every day asked me something. I'm doing something different.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:26.360]   Like I just put Ubuntu studio on an Athlon. And that was right after I put some some dudes
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:32.880]   OS 10 rip on there. I put that on there and that was like whatever. I'm not doing that.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:37.360]   And then and then I got to go buy this four track. I'm like, sweet four check analog.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.960]   I got nothing. This is great. You're a big fat geek, Patrick Wilson. That's true, man.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:47.560]   That's the worst. I'm trying to not be. But I can't why why stop it? Because I'll tell
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:52.520]   you why it makes me a mile wide and an inch deep. Wait a minute. I'm gonna have to think
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:57.560]   about this for a while. That's pretty deep right there. Do not not specialize in exactly
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:06.600]   do you feel like you're an audio dell'etant? Well, musicians, especially I think do the
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.080]   best stuff I ever recorded was on a four track because I didn't I wasn't thinking about
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:15.160]   all I got to get my latency right on my plugging. It's like, let's just plug the mic in and
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:19.200]   record the dance on me like a like a task. Like with ping ponging that kind of four
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:27.680]   sticks. I got a meringue. What? That's sexy. It's got me. I used to I used to balance the
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.840]   living crap out of stuff. It was awful. It was just where you do three to one. Are you
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:36.280]   on a cassette or real to real? Oh, yeah. Back in the day, this I put out put out like five
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:41.440]   people bought them. But like, yeah, I mean, I would just I would just sit there with a
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:47.200]   big old mott liquor and a task and bounce bounce bounce. Whose idea was it to put buddy
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:54.440]   Holly on Windows 95? That was the labels idea and they didn't even ask us. I remember at
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:59.480]   the time we were like, what the hell you're doing? And then and then we sort of realized,
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.480]   oh, that went out to I don't know a billion people. I think a lot. I think it's the first
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:09.240]   time I saw a weezer video. I'm sure it was. That's why the blue record sells more than
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:14.960]   the other ones. It might be because of Windows 95. Don't underestimate the value of that.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:19.640]   I love Windows 95. Are you kidding me? That was one of my favorite laptops I had. I had
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:24.240]   a Dell 233. I think was awesome. Were you pissed off that they went to Brian, you know,
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:29.720]   to record the startup sounds for Vista? You could have done that, man. Or no, it was
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:34.240]   it Robert Fripp? No, he never was. He was a nah. Fripp did Vista and you know, did.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:38.280]   I think we know did 95. Oh, no, of course. I'm sorry. Yeah, he did the yeah, that's
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:44.280]   that's correct. I was not at no, I can honestly say I wasn't mad. I think you should start
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:52.560]   up with a drum solo. So cool. That would be cool. Patrick, what's what's the process
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:56.840]   when you guys start working on music videos? Like, how do you get started? Or do you does
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.320]   a director come in and say I have an idea for your video? Or do you guys have a sense of
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:05.400]   how you want it to be shown? How does that how does that work? Well, first we say, don't
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:12.480]   call me. I'm not doing anything. And then someone convinces you you have to go do it.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.920]   And then you spend a lot of money and make a pile of junk. And then someone comes in
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:22.240]   and fixes it for five bucks. And then you're like, that's a good video. How did it work
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:28.320]   with Spike Joe? Let me tell you something. If you can find on YouTube, we did a version
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:39.040]   of We Are All On Drugs that was all we did was we recut a video from an 80s metal band.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.960]   And we put our music on it kind of like that St. Saunders guy ever seen them like you like
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:50.880]   on on YouTube. It's like clapped in shreds and any of the shreds. Yeah, that's so funny.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:58.560]   That's the official one or the unofficial one? The unofficial one.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:07.840]   Because there's one that's the official one. The official one.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:11.360]   That's the stone that says fear the Reaper and no one escapes his evil power. That's exactly
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:16.680]   right. So look for We Are All On Drugs first version. Well, I have I have one here, but
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.720]   it's got a big disclaimer. This is an unofficial video of Weezers We Are All On Drugs.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:27.200]   All material is copyrighted that one. Maybe. I think this might be a this might be a users
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:33.120]   remix of this. It might be you know what? I'm not even sure if it got out. I was sure it got
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.160]   out. But my point was is Oh, here it is first version. Yeah, we spent
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:46.560]   no one escapes. Oh, this is awesome. They've said that these budgets have really dropped back
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.600]   or they are they what's a bunch of physical video.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:56.800]   Dude, they're they're they don't have any money. It's amazing how weird it's getting.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:02.640]   20 cents. Yeah, like 15 cents basically. This is like this. This is a good video. I'm sorry.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:07.600]   I'm watching this. How great. I like the torches and whether you're in a lake,
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:15.920]   what is it? Mad Max? It's not even us. Who is this? I forget the name of the band. It was like
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:20.480]   man awards. You took somebody else's tell me else's video and you put your music behind it.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:25.760]   It wasn't even us. Like a friend of our managers did it. He was like, check this out. This is awesome.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:36.000]   I like that. So that's we are All On Drugs first version from Mega Man 035. It's the only version
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.560]   if you ask me. That's the one. Kind of sucks. I mean, this is I it's drives me crazy. I know this
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.680]   isn't you. But if you get an ear with those big shots at Universal that you're always having
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:49.760]   crepes with, what is the deal with not letting them embed videos? Like you can't embed anything
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:55.840]   from Universal on YouTube. They're not alone. They're not alone. In fact, CNN just started making
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.760]   a big or no MSNBC just started making a big deal about you can embed their videos finally.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:04.880]   Nobody lets you embed video. But just funny, why would you put it on? I mean, I like to say it's
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:09.440]   like it's like some executive like some chief marketing officer read the first paragraph of
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:13.360]   an in-flight magazine story about the internet and then stopped. It's like the whole point of
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.200]   it is letting people spread it. Right. Right. I mean, it's just not getting it.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:23.920]   Let's segue then into like the whole idea of lock and stuff down versus, you know,
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:30.080]   fighting human nature. I mean, I just don't get it. But so now what you have some interest
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:37.280]   though in people paying you for your work. I do. But it just seems like
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:45.360]   it seems like more and more your your work is an advertisement for you. You know,
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:49.760]   like the recording is an advertisement for the idea of you. I hate to say that.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.560]   You don't do you like that or dislike that?
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:01.120]   I like it because I'm still thrilled that anyone gives a rat's ass what I'm doing.
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:05.520]   I think it's awesome. Like, dude, you want to download my song? Go ahead.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:10.320]   Right. I want you to listen to it. I want it to get burned into your brain so that you come see us play.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:15.120]   And you get paid and you get paid then by the concert ticket or the merchandising.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:22.880]   Yeah. I mean, I want to get paid for recordings because it is it's a lot of work, at least for us.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:26.240]   It's like a strong massive struggle to make ourselves happy.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:31.040]   What do you think about what Billy Bragg just said when be with a bebo selling?
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:34.560]   We deserve a cut of that because we may be both on that.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:40.960]   I just posted on an engineer's website about that. I don't think he has a leg to stand on
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:47.520]   personally because the terms were clear when he he agreed to it. He was like, hey, I'm going to
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:54.240]   put myself on bebo to get some exposure. That's the end of the deal. And no one is stopping
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:48:01.600]   someone else from creating a bebo that is more equitable towards the content producers. So,
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.160]   for me, it's like too bad.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:08.320]   Well, and are you really getting hurt if you are making most of your money with merchandising
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:14.880]   and touring anyway? I mean, how much money, what percentage are you really losing from that
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:22.480]   and like I said, the record sales, there's money in publishing, but there's not so much
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:28.640]   money in the sales of the records anymore. And there never really was. I mean, even like
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:33.760]   Michael Jackson, I don't think was ever getting, he wasn't doing joint ventures, I don't think.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:40.000]   He was still on the short end of the stick regarding who made the dough was Quincy Jones.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.720]   I mean, you isn't writing where all the money is.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.280]   And producers. There's a lot of money in writing and licensing.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.440]   Yeah. But I mean, he wrote, he co-wrote a lot.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.840]   Most not all of thriller and got the production credit. So he probably got points.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.400]   Well, why do you think Michael Jackson bought the Beatles put catalog?
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.280]   Yeah. That's what the most of the money is.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:04.800]   But what do you think Patrick, when I mean, I understand that there's a more open attitude
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:09.760]   towards sharing copyrighted work with the idea that there's promotional involvement there.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:14.720]   And you might benefit some other way. How do you feel when someone actually takes your music
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:20.240]   and wraps it in some manner where they profit by it and you don't?
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.280]   But pisses me off.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:26.400]   So there is a line that people can cross is what I'm getting at.
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.320]   Yeah. I think you're right. And maybe I was a little harsh on Billy Bragg because I don't want
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:33.280]   to be pedantic about the terms of that agreement.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:39.200]   I get what he's saying, like, hey, you built this off my partially my bag. But I kind of made
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:43.360]   a funny argument. Like, what if people listened to went to Bebo and listened to Billy Bragg and
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.880]   they were like, well, this stinks. I'm never coming back to Bebo.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:50.400]   Does that mean he owes him money? Does he have to owe them money?
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.640]   That assumption they always had these these incredibly, I mean, I don't know,
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.560]   this details of this particular thing. But so often when they come up with these crazy numbers
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:02.720]   about lost revenue on sales, it's based on the idea that, yeah, it's based on the
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.760]   everybody would have bought that Britney Spears record, which is not accurate.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.720]   And the thing about that video, the thing about the universal thing that drives me nuts, though,
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:13.360]   is it's a video for a song like the video for Buddy Holly cannot be embedded.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:17.600]   Why? And to me, that's like saying like you have to pass a nickel for this press release or
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.520]   you're not allowed to make a Xerox copy of crazy. It's not, you know,
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:25.360]   is part of that due to the fact that they might have union crews that are working on that video
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:30.320]   that would insist on getting a cut or whatever? No, no, those people have nothing to do with those
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:36.320]   deals, at least in our, in our respect. I agree with the honest, I don't want to see you just let it
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.080]   go. It's an advertisement. It's like get people thinking about you.
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:46.880]   Yeah, I mean, MTV played that thing in high rotation nonstop. Why not keep it going by? I mean,
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:51.280]   it was smart to put it on the windows 95 disc. Why not keep it going? Let people
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:55.520]   embed it. Any, any artists will tell you that like the only earn back, you're not going to earn
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:59.280]   back after, I mean, probably probably at the time the Pinkerton came out. I mean, obviously,
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:02.720]   the blue record had done well, but isn't it fair to say that you really start earning on
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:07.040]   back catalog? Once you get three or four records, that's when you start really seeing some doubt.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:13.200]   Well, you got to recoup. And then generally your next record is a, it's a tiered deal. So you
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:19.120]   probably make more on each successive record. So, but they're all crossed, meaning that you have to
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:24.720]   pay back any debts from the previous, from the new, you know, I'm saying it's called a cross
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:29.680]   collateralization. Basically, it's funny accounting so they can keep as much as possible of what you
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:36.720]   may do. What do you think of the Steve Albeni article? Do you think that's still true?
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:41.600]   What did Steve Albeni say before we? I'm sorry. Steve Albeni, you tell Patrick.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:46.960]   You go, you know more than I do. Well, no, just that Steve Albeni put out this very famous essay
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:51.120]   that almost everybody has a strong opinion about called the problem with music. And he's, I think
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:56.640]   he's mostly reacting to the post grunge boom. And basically, he does what he considers to be
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:01.520]   really strong math on what happens to the average, like a band that you like that gets signed.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:06.400]   And the numbers are unbelievably awful. Yeah, well, here's the thing though, you don't have to be a
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:12.160]   douchebag and do everything that he says that people do in that. It's like, right? Yeah, go spend
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:17.120]   $2,000 on the drum doctor to come make your drum sunk. You know, you got to do this and that.
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:21.440]   You don't have to do any of that stuff. I mean, like you say, like JL house rock hello,
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:25.920]   put people in a room with a microphone and be rad. That's how you do rad. What I really want
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:30.720]   to know is though, how much of being a credible band, I mean, being able to do,
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:35.040]   take the taking the sound that's inside your head and put it onto a really good, you know,
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:41.520]   make a good recording of it and also get it out in front of people. How much of that is reliant on
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:46.160]   having people who know how to market and know how to get your, know how to get your thing,
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:50.160]   get stuff on tour, know how to mix things. You're telling me that even the earlier you were saying
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:55.360]   that even the first, the cheapest record that you made cost $120,000. And I think that's something
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:00.080]   that sort of gets lost that someone, somehow someone needs to come up with 120 grand or even
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:05.680]   let cut that in half, make it a budget. Not a whole lot of garage bands have 50, $60,000 to produce
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.240]   a really good sounding record that'll help them make money on tour.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:13.840]   Well, you don't, you don't really, in some ways, you don't need that anymore because so much of
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:19.520]   the expense of that first record was on things that you can go to guitar center and buy or like
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:26.400]   nothing. But what you do need to spend money on is people who are really smart with their ears
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:34.160]   and know how to produce. You can put a, you can give someone all the best gear in the world
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:38.320]   and it can sound like junk and you could, like you say, you could record on a four track and it
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:44.400]   could be amazing sounding. So I mean, like Beck's loser, that was a huge song and it was done on an
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:50.320]   eight track, a half inch eight track. I mean, it's, it's, it's not even a big deal anymore.
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:56.960]   How much does the officer impact your, your final product? A producer? Yeah, the producer
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:05.040]   sitting in the, in the studio with you working on the, well, at our level, it's, we want, we want
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:13.040]   a producer to, to extract out of us things that we didn't even know we could do. I think a lot of
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:16.720]   bands go through the, like they'll get big on their first record and they'll be like, no, no,
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:21.280]   no, that's not what we wanted. We're going to do this our way and then they have a sophomore slump.
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:25.680]   Well, that was the, like the perfect example is like the posies, you know, when they, their first
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:31.440]   album was, you know, the record company kind of produced it. And the second album, they, I think
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.880]   they did a lot, they had a lot more control and that was one of the big problems that they just
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:41.280]   didn't have. They had a hard time moving the next one. It's true. I mean, it's, it's, it's a very
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:47.520]   complex subject because bands are, you know, people get famous and they go, what the hell just happened?
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:53.520]   Oh, almost because of this and then they're wrong and then you grow. It's, it's so ridiculous what
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:59.600]   happens to you when you become successful. Did you find, did you find in the first album that you
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:04.320]   had to give up a lot more control than you do now? It was a record company really pressing down to
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:09.760]   make sure that they get some, they get certain, a certain sound. No, that's the irony. Like they
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:14.240]   didn't even care about it. So you're like, ah, whatever. Here's 100, here's 100 grand. Get on my
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:19.840]   face. Go get a haircut. And like, it was so that kind of like left it to ourselves, us and Rick,
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:23.440]   you know, they probably just figured, well, Rick, Rick's there. It'll be fine. Now, do they bring
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:28.000]   Rick in? Talk about Rick O'Kasek of the cars, right? Yeah. Well, here's how it works. You, you
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.240]   signed to the label because you make friends with an A&R guy. This is how it used to work.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:37.920]   And then he's your guy. He's your bud. He's the dude who shows up on Friday at the marketing
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:43.040]   meeting to pimp you to the company. Like, just because you get money doesn't mean you can get
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:48.000]   them in just in what you're doing. Right. And that was the irony because I think we just
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   happened to come along at a point where they had nothing else going on and like, oh, let's put
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:58.240]   on done on them. See if we can get that on the radio and then boom, it's massive. Right. I was
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:03.200]   pointing that first, that first broke big on our college rock station. I mean, in the same way
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:07.600]   that like, God, there's so many bands around that time, like Sloan and well, then it broke very big,
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:12.720]   but there are all these bands that like, it's kind of, even like Nirvana, definitely first caught on
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:16.080]   on our college station. So they were doing a heck of a job with marketing you guys.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:20.240]   What happens now though? I mean, who breaks? I'll tell you now. I'll tell you what.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:27.360]   They go, what do you, what should we do? Help us. You're young and hip and we're wearing white
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:33.680]   pants and we don't know. I mean, obviously we're going to service our music to radio still because
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:37.200]   we're still played a lot on radio, like special alternative.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:42.000]   And you hope that you can get a top 40 song and.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.440]   Other than that, what are you going to do? Do you find it still important to work through the,
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:56.560]   like, work up slowly through the CMJ ranks before you go to a pop station? Do you find that that's
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:02.720]   important to keep tell us is an old record promo man talking right now? Sorry, I used to work for
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:09.840]   Sunny. So the college music, the college music journal, do you pay a lot of attention to those
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:14.640]   to those stations still or are you mostly working with AR and
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.920]   alternative commercial alternative rock?
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:26.640]   Like I said, like as far as like how we service our music to those outlets, that's the late,
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.520]   for me, that's the late problem. That's the late problem.
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:35.200]   Like you just make the music and. But does it hire people to help us do that? But mostly we're
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:40.800]   just trying to make like at this point for us, we have a pretty decent fan base. So we can just
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:46.160]   put out as long as it's decent, right? It'll have a mode of come of success. Like look at,
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:50.240]   look at in rainbows by radio head. There's not a single on that thing, but it's awesome.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:54.560]   So what so if you're a young band starting out that doesn't have that built in audience,
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:59.920]   I mean, just radio going to help you probably not. Where do you can't get on the radio?
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:04.720]   So what do you go? What do you do? How do you how do you get started? What would your advice be to
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:17.600]   somebody? First thing, Google, the KLF manifesto, which is KLF was a British thing that was like
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:22.960]   late 80s or like 90s. And they wrote an amazing book called the KLF. I think it's called the
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:31.520]   Manifesto. And it's an amazing read about it's if I had read this, I would have saved myself 15 years
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:38.960]   of failure, like personal failure. But it's an incredible read about what's really important
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:43.840]   about if you want to reach people. And basically it comes down to forget everything and just write
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:48.960]   a good tune. Just write a good tune. It's kind of everything else will fall in line.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:52.080]   It's kind of what Google says. Just do good. It's absolutely true. Yeah.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:59.440]   Don't go out and figure out how to use Pro Tools. Don't do this. Don't do that. Write a song.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:05.280]   Write a song that makes people want to cry and then you're good. Do you think excellence will rise?
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:08.880]   I mean, there are a lot of people writing songs, a lot of people writing blogs. There'll be a lot
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:13.520]   of people doing podcast. I mean, there's more content than ever before. I'm with you. I think
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:20.640]   it will rise. I think if something is undeniably great, everybody wants it. That's just all there is to
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:26.880]   so make it great. Just be great. Be great. And even if nobody listens, at least you'll know you were
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:32.640]   great. Well, that's the thing. People, there is a huge appetite out there. I mean, I'm with you.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:37.360]   Like, I think there's too many things. There's so much out there that it confuses people. Like,
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:41.600]   I was confused when I used to go to record stores. Like, Oh, what did I want? And now I just get on
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:47.440]   the internet. Now you don't know anything. You can't find anything. But, but you know,
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:51.760]   if something is seriously awesome, it's going to come up.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:58.640]   I think theater's sturgeon said 20% of everything is great. So if you have more stuff, you got more
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:03.120]   great stuff. Well, that's another thing too. Keep writing songs. Just keep doing it.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:10.240]   Like most bands, I think like a huge mistake bands make is the obsess over this one track
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:15.520]   and like they keep redoing it and redoing it. Walk away. If it's not happening, like bang, bang,
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:21.360]   put it inside and work on it later. Like when something, when it occurs to you, you know, you can
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:26.480]   help it just move on. It's true. It's true. Like, it's true of any kind of creative enterprise that
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:30.000]   you don't get good by spending all your time on that one thing you think is your masterpiece.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.600]   You get good by by failing often and learning from that. And the more that you can produce
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:39.200]   something, it's almost like throwing darts in the dark. The more likely you already hit something
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.760]   if you're just constantly working, working, working. And if you look at people, at least for me,
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:49.040]   the bands that I like a lot, especially in whatever alternative world, they're on a pretty
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.760]   regular schedule. You look at somebody like the mountain goats and they're putting out an
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:55.840]   album a year and then touring behind it. And they're building building building with every
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:00.960]   record. They're a workman. They're not out there expecting somebody to, so from Atlantic records,
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:04.800]   to drive up with a limousine and Led Zeppelin in the back, they understand they're going to have
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.960]   to just work really hard inside of a model that's emerging very quickly. And the ones who are
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.680]   making it are working. They're not sitting around and whining. They're figuring out how to engage
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.200]   with their fans and then go out and like and mousse some shirts. That's what they're doing.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:21.200]   It's a cliche, but like if I see someone on a stage and I can tell that that person is in love
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.640]   with what they're doing, like and it's pouring out of them, that's just complete and it's totally
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:32.320]   infectious. That's what I want to see. That's what I want to see. By the way, I overstated
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:37.280]   Sturgeon's Law. It's 90% of everything is crap. I was going to say, boy, I think that's a little
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.080]   and I'm citing the Pareto crap principle. That was the Pareto principle,
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:48.800]   80/20 principle instead of the 90/10 principle. We're going to take it. Go ahead.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.760]   No, no, no. One thought from Patrick Wilson. Oh, I want to get into what you guys think about
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:02:01.920]   the logistics of filtering and what kind of pressure can be put on ISPs and what's,
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.120]   you know, like isn't there something happening in France, like some legislation?
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.480]   Yeah, it's kind of a mess right now because Comcast has admitted to using Sandvine to
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:15.440]   literally break BitTorrent seeds. And I think that that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:21.280]   There's only one candidate that I know of that supports net neutrality. I think that
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.360]   that's one thing to do is when your vote, if you're a US citizen and you're voting in the election
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:29.440]   in November is to consider which candidates support net neutrality and make sure that they
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.600]   even know what it is. Let's say which one asks which candidate, which candidate sat down and
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.400]   talk with Larry Lessick about this stuff. There's only one.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.920]   That's right. We won't say any names. I want you to do some research.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.160]   We don't want letters. People remain nameless.
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:48.240]   It's not Republican. It ain't John McCain.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:54.880]   Yeah, there we go. Let's say who it is. We actually talked, we've been talking a lot about the
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:01.520]   filtering within, you know, within, at this week in media. So another little podcast that we do.
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:08.400]   And a lot of it is, instead of fighting it, one of the big things that we're starting to see
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:13.920]   Verizon talk about and we don't know how much PR it is, is actually experimenting with using
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:19.760]   the servers at the ISPs to actually be able to become more efficient. If they're not,
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:27.440]   what was very inefficient for the ISPs is to be sending for detourance. Someone's pulling a torrent
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.000]   and they're grabbing, they're grabbing bits from people all over the world.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.880]   And that's expensive and inefficient for the ISPs because they do have a point where they have to
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:43.280]   go back and forth between each other. If you're pulling a torrent down of whatever you're
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:48.000]   torrenting and it goes, oh, by the way, I can see that there are a whole bunch of seeds that are within
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.200]   the ISP, within the servers that are here or more local and I feed them to each other.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:59.680]   The user gets a, their measurement was up to three or four times, up to six times faster.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:06.080]   They get a much faster download as well as it costing a lot less for the ISP. And the thing
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:10.320]   about that is, is that this is what they could be doing instead of sitting there and trying to
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:16.720]   cut everyone off by the knees. Well, of course. But like my point is how real, like, what is the
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:23.200]   mechanism that's going to force people's hands? Like, does a label go to Verizon say,
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:28.400]   look, either you figure this out or we're going to sue you. We're going to take you to court.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:34.160]   Like, where is that line that inertia gets moved out of the way?
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:40.080]   Verizon has to, I think what Alex is talking about is probably the only solution because
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:47.760]   Verizon's issue is not merely the word about the MCA notices from the record labels over allowing
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.560]   sharing. They're also worried about the hit the network takes, which is not insignificant.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:58.160]   You get a four or five guys sitting there downloading, you know, 18 copies of the Titanic and it's
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.360]   it's going to kill the bandwidth for everybody else. And I think that's not an unreasonable thing
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.800]   for them to say, we kind of manage this somehow. I mean, that's, I think that's really what they're
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.240]   trying to do. I don't think that they're trying to make a political statement. I think they just
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:13.760]   trying to manage their bandwidth consumption and that is the Verizon's P4P solution is one way to
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.000]   do that is to say, okay, this is what our users are going to be doing. Let's figure out a way to do
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.160]   it so it doesn't kill everybody else. Well, I think also that we have to start thinking about the
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.080]   the price structures of a lot of content and so on so forth. I mean, if we made,
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:30.560]   you know, I think that if we, I mean, I'm not saying this is ever going to happen, but if we
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.720]   made DVDs, for instance, if we made a DVD quality, not anything higher, just DVD quality,
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:40.080]   if you could buy that buy it, not rent it for $3.99 or $4.99, almost all of that. But
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:44.720]   and you made it bit tornado. And it was easy. And you know, it was, you could, you know,
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:48.720]   no DRM or whatever, people, people would just stop. They just buy it because it'd be too easy. It'd
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:54.960]   be too hard to go through all the trouble to go out and find the movies when they could just
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.600]   get a pristine copy of it from. That's true for 12 year olds.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:04.160]   Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think we're 12 right now. You think they'd spend $3.99 for whatever fricking
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:07.440]   Horton hears a who or whatever. They're not, they're not spending $14.99 on it. I mean,
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:10.400]   the thing is, they're not spending anything right now. You're not losing them. You're losing,
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:15.040]   I think you're losing the folks that are 18 and above. I think those are the folks that are that
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:20.560]   you're losing to some degree because they don't want to pay $15 or $20 for a piece of plastic
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:26.000]   that costs $0.44. And so the thing is, is getting it down. It's always, I mean,
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.160]   that's what iTunes did. I mean, the reason iTunes is sold whatever $4 billion plus songs
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:35.600]   is because it's easier to download it from iTunes than it is to go find it on
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:41.440]   LimeWire or on X-Torton or whatever you're going to find it on. And so the thing is,
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:46.560]   is that iTunes made it easy. I wanted to hear a song. I think this is an Alex thing.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:51.360]   I think it's an Alex thing. I think people who are raised, I think it's profound to me to talk to
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:57.040]   somebody who's under 20 because it's mind blowing to me how incredibly different their idea of this
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.960]   stuff is for mine. Like you and me, Alex, like personally, I love going to Amazon now. I still
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:06.080]   love iTunes, but I love going to Amazon. It's super fast. I can buy a record. It's there. I do it all
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:10.320]   the time, almost every day to be honest. Don't tell my wife that. But like, I just, I'm not sold
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:14.640]   on people, college age and under ever buying any of this stuff again. I just don't think it's
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:22.960]   going to happen. You know what? I think they will because at some point your conscience will get to
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:29.840]   you. It will. I mean, you will start saying like, you know what, I download all this crap and I
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:34.880]   don't even listen to it. I want to go find something I'm into. What event would cause someone who's
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.920]   never bought a record? And if you go talk to people who are under 20 and they will tell you they have
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.880]   never purchased media in their life. And go, I'm curious. So what is the event in Patrick that you
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:47.520]   think would make them have that flash of conscience? Is it engagement with the artist?
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:54.960]   Let me ask you how big of music fans are those people really? Like, are they casual music fans?
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:01.360]   Because it's my experience that that's why the record industry has taken such a big hit is because
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:09.120]   they used to be able, they sort of had a captive audience because people that weren't that into
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:14.080]   music would see something and be like, oh, I like that and go buy it. But they mean that.
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:18.800]   The analogy is that people who, so at this release for me, I'm 41, which I happened to mention every
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:23.520]   week now as part of the drinking game. But you know, so for me, like for me, I think the analogy for
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:30.880]   me in 1984 or 85 was that radio was basically P2P's. I would never in a million years think of
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:36.800]   listening to 98 rocked and having to pay for it. But if I wanted to like find out about Husker
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:42.720]   Dew, I had to get in a car and drive to Tampa and spend $5.99 on Zen Arcade, drive it home and
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:46.720]   listen to it on the record player and tape it. Right? That was that. So what that is is I forget the
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.880]   psychological term for this, but it's a very high level of engagement. You had to actually drive to
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:55.040]   another town. You couldn't go to Camelot to get Husker Dew. And so like to me, I had a very high
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.320]   level of engagement and then I'd seek them out and I'd go buy the shirt and I'd read about them in
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:03.520]   magazines. So I mean, I'm just saying for myself, absolutely, I will absolutely I will buy every
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:06.960]   Mountain Ghost record that comes out. I will buy every Sloan record that comes out. The bands that
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:11.760]   I really love and support, I will absolutely always buy. I'm just not sold at it's not a moral or
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:17.040]   an ethical issue. It's more of what was reality like when you were a kid, when you first learned
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:22.400]   about music. That's when this habit starts for the reason why that's the reason why the
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:26.400]   generation that my dad didn't understand the idea of why are you ripping stuff? Why do you think it's
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.360]   a God-given right that you can rip music? You can rip DVDs? Because when I grew up, it was assumed
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:36.160]   that we had everyone had a tape player. Everybody had unprotected music. Everybody was copying things
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:41.040]   for their own personal use and sharing them in a limited way. However, the origin of that music
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:45.440]   was always going into a store and buying it. So that's why I feel as though the ability to
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:50.720]   duplicate and edit music is always is a God-given right. Similarly, the kids growing up today,
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:55.040]   they grew up in a world in which if you wanted a piece of music, you can just go out and download
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:58.800]   it. There wasn't an ethical thing attached to it. That's just the way they grew up.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:04.480]   So that connection between an exchange of money and getting the music, that connection never really
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:09.440]   formed. I think that's why more and more bands and publishers and everybody are going to have to
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.080]   find a new way of getting money out of their pockets.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:18.080]   And I think that there was a lost opportunity when the record industry ran Napster into the
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:23.600]   ground. I think that you had a 70 million people. You had 70 million people who were sitting there.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:30.160]   And if you asked them to pay, if you had asked me to pay $6.95 a month or $9.95 a month,
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:34.320]   they're probably even $19.95 a month for what I was getting, which is more than...
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:39.440]   Because I never got anything that was commercially available. The stuff that I was searching for
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.640]   were like acoustic version of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then you'd find somebody's whatever.
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:51.120]   The thing is that just having that and just paying for access to it and then saying,
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:55.360]   we're going to take 75% of that money and we're going to give it back to whoever the
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:11:01.040]   copyright holders are. It would have made more money than just about anything else we could have.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:06.160]   The bigger problem is that lost opportunity to once again, make sure that the kids who are
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:13.920]   getting into music in 1993, 1994, 1995, again, so get that Pavlobly response that music comes after
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:20.000]   I pay money to somebody. And because they basically made Napster, because they made their own pay
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.400]   services completely irrelevant until iTunes came along, they just lost that opportunity for
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.200]   six or seven years. I think that that's going to be a big important gap.
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:33.120]   Well, have they really though? What if iTunes, like you guys were talking about last week,
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:39.200]   what if they say, "Okay, you got to pay an extra $10?" I think it's a huge opportunity.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:46.160]   I think that's the way to bring that back in. I think iTunes has to go to subscription.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:51.200]   But the cool thing about the P2P stuff was like you said, the goofy thing you've never heard of,
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:55.840]   "Dude, I just ripped this Vince Garaldi Christmas special off of mine. I'll check it out."
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:00.720]   Did you guys ever release your cover of "Just What I Needed?" That's never been officially released,
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:05.920]   has it? Did we cover that? Yeah, totally. You did it during the sessions for the Blue Record.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:13.600]   You are such a nerd. No, we did. Who was that engineer? Damn, Berlin, is this a question for your
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.120]   alternative music, Zine, that you're photocopying at Kinko's next tomorrow?
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:22.560]   Was it a different car? It was from the first car's record. No, I remember now. I remember
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:26.480]   actually being in the room with Rick while we were playing it, and I was so stoked.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:31.920]   That's a great example. I have so much theoretically. I have so much of your stuff that's
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.960]   never been released. Let me just prove that you actually played it, and it's in fact still on the
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:42.640]   internet. Let me just disclaim it quickly. The car's version just kills.
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:45.440]   Yeah, our version is classic. That whole record is so good.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.600]   Dude, nobody makes records like that. No, every song is hit. Every fricking song is a
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.040]   single on that record. It's insane. It's a monster. Okay.
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.840]   Roy Thomas Baker, you should get Roy Thomas Baker to do your next record. Nope.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:03.200]   Why not? Well, because he doesn't sound... None of the old guy... Dude, believe me, we've had
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:06.960]   this conversation. Let's go get... We listened to "Highway to Hell." Let's go get "Mutt Lang."
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:10.080]   Have you heard "Mutt Lang"? That sounds like a giant plane.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:15.600]   That's why we don't get "Mutt Lang." I was like "Luskel Ball at age 73 now."
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:22.880]   I can help you make a record. No problem. I said you just but I did.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:29.520]   I'm estranged. You're moving in stereo. All right. Let's take a break. We're going to come back
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:34.400]   with your picks. I don't know if Patrick, you prepared a pick, but if you did, and I don't mean
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.360]   a guitar pick. I mean a software, hardware, or website pick. You kind of gave us a Vizio. That
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:44.800]   was pretty good. That could be it. I'm getting one. Yeah. Dude, Andy's already... I'm going to
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:47.520]   tell you something. I'm going to give you the money back guarantee. You know what that is?
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:55.600]   You don't like it? I'm buying it. He likes it that much. And only at $0.50 of the dollar, too.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:00.720]   You can bankrupt Weezer. Everybody, go out. You've got $1,000 with a credit.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:06.320]   I'm thinking of getting one for all the computers here. Just have a whole bunch of these 42-inch
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:12.000]   10 nipis. You know, we actually talked to Vizio about being a sponsor. So maybe they're listening.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.680]   It's Chris. I'm telling you guys, we could help you guys. I do want to mention Audible.com,
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:20.960]   which is an actual sponsor, an actual paying sponsor. I probably should stick with those.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:26.640]   Audible is doing some really cool things right now. There's still the brackets in their first
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:34.800]   annual tournament of audio books. Only four remain. Catch 22, world without end, the road,
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:38.800]   and pillars of the earth. So you might want to check out those brackets. If you're following
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:44.800]   March Madness, forget basketball. It's March audio book madness. Audible.com/macbreak. You can
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:50.240]   also get a free book. And yes, there are William Gibson novels on Audible, not Edouro. But Spook
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:53.840]   Country is latest is on there. And we've recommended that before pattern recognition,
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:15:02.160]   which is excellent. I love the idea of somebody who is so hypersensitive to branding that she
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:08.000]   can pick out the next big thing just because it makes her queasy. It's a great concept. It's a
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.080]   wonderful book. His stuff is very good. And he doesn't read a single one of these, by the way,
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:20.720]   just to reassure you. Then I said, so if you want to get an Audible book,
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:25.200]   I do recommend William Gibson's stuff. It's great. Somebody sent me an email, just a short
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.600]   email saying, listening is not reading. I don't care what you say. It is reading.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:34.800]   Every word is there. You actually experience the book in a visceral way that you might not
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.680]   when you read it. I just think it's the best way to get it. Somebody who's like geeked out on
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:45.280]   your podcast goes listening is not reading. Can you believe that? That takes the Andy and
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:51.360]   Akosized pants for that's an internet where it takes internet pants to make a comment like.
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:56.880]   Unbelievable. I said, I think it is. And I left it at that. In any event, it is reading. And it's
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.680]   a great way to read whether you're in the car or in the gym. There are lots of times when you
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:05.040]   can't hold a book, but you can listen and get a lot of reading done. It's how I get all my reading done.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:10.640]   Highly recommend pattern recognition by William Gibson. Get it free by going to audible.com/macbreak
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:16.560]   right now. I know you want to be filling up your iPod with Weezer music. And of course,
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:21.760]   I highly recommend that. But just leave a little space, just 100 megabytes for a book.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:28.320]   And you'll be very glad you did. Audible.com/macbreak. Now time for our Mac break picks. You want to
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.360]   hang with that that Visio pick Patrick or do you have anything else?
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:37.520]   I'm going to go back and reference the manual by the KLF. You can purchase it on
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:44.800]   Amazon. It's called the manual. The manual. And it's KLF, which is the copyright liberation
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:53.040]   front, right? I think so. And basically it's sort of a how to book on it. If you follow their
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:59.520]   instructions exactly, they guarantee that you will have a number one hit in Britain.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:06.800]   And it's probably a little dated and a little bit topical. But I can't tell you how
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:13.680]   eye-opening it was for me to sort of internalize what they're talking about. If you're into writing
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:19.600]   songs. Oh, they were the time lords. They're a band. Yeah. They were a bunch of different
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:24.160]   things like, you know, like, did you still assess here? You have to take ecstasy and have a
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:30.160]   role in 808. Is that still true? It is not true. The first thing that one of the things in there,
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:34.960]   like, and when you're in the studio, they say, don't take any drugs and fire anybody who is
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:39.760]   is taking drugs. They say, don't be on dope, but do be on the door. Firstly, you must be skinting on
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:44.800]   the dull. Anybody would have proper job. No dull or tied up with a full-time education will not
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:48.560]   have the time to devote to see it through. Nick Van Dyke, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:56.960]   It's a lovely holiday with Mary. Being on a dull gives you a clearer perspective on how much
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:02.640]   of society is run. It is the dick Van Dyke. No one in Britain talks like that.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.720]   Hello, Gavin. Hello, Gavin. Well, you like to touch the enemy coat?
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:12.640]   Then the London Five Times I have never been dancing chimney sweeps. I'll fly the book every
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:17.840]   time I go. Oh, and Bob's your uncle. Bob's your uncle, Jim Chimney, churro.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:25.120]   So there it is. That's the time lords. The manual. Now you sound like a mornical cane.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:29.280]   I would have a number one the easy way that time lords highly recommended.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:36.480]   That's a good that's a good pick. And that is on Amazon. That's correct. Excellent. And you know,
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:43.360]   it's funny. I'm looking at the Wikipedia entry apparently in the liner photographs of the Chumba
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.080]   Wumba album readymaids. Bob Wiley is seen to be reading a copy of the manual.
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:54.400]   hysterical. There you go. And I'm not going to have you a pick for us.
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:59.680]   I indeed do. I am actually I'm going my pick for the week is going to be my internet pants.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:06.640]   I was I was I was delighted and surprised by how well like letting the internet
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:15.680]   recommend pants worked out because they recommended a a a spare pants that is designed for either
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:21.280]   like police police detectives or people in the military or people who fancy themselves that they
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.800]   could be police detectives or people in the military if they didn't wear 380 pounds.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:35.040]   They it is called the 511 tactical pant. That again the tactical pant. It's not the number of
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.440]   number of nacho chips you can fit in the pockets. It's not like it's not like comical guys prescription
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:44.880]   pants but it's very very close. Did you get the tack light pro pants? Well, I was gonna say see
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.640]   they make two different varieties. They make the tactical pants and the tack light pro.
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:52.560]   The tactical pants are made of 100% cotton. So they're like they're a little bit thicker. They're
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:57.440]   good. That's a way to go all or winter for summer wait. They just came out the tack light pro which
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.440]   is cotton poly. It's a little bit lighter. But the cool thing about them is that they are
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:08.560]   let's just say that they are tailored for people who's they're designed for people who squat in
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:13.680]   alleyways waiting to shoot at drug. It looks like some have built in knee pads. Yeah, exactly. I mean
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:16.320]   that's what I'm saying is they're cut kind of roomy which means that if you spend most of your
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:20.880]   time sitting in an office chair speaking into a microphone or doing typing. They're also fit
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:25.600]   very very roomy for your lifestyle. They're reinforced to the seat. They're reinforced at the knees.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:32.160]   They have a liberal amount of pouches and pockets but not so much that store detectives will follow
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:36.640]   you around when you go into the mall thinking they're there to shoplift. They have an iPhone
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:42.080]   iPhone pocket. There is I was gonna say there is a pocket that is that is the perfect size for an
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:46.480]   iPhone or a taser depending on your you don't have it in the case. Well, actually see that's
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:50.880]   that's the interesting thing. These aren't like fake tactical pants. I was I was I put them on
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.720]   the they arrived yesterday and I tried them on and I said, well, geez, well, that's great. That's
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:59.200]   perfect position for an iPhone. I wonder why they put it on the left leg instead of the right leg.
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:03.920]   And then I realized that Oh, because it's actually it's sized for a spare ammo clip.
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:08.720]   Because the right leg has your gun on it because because no because you're holding your gun in
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:13.120]   your right hand and you're desperately thumbing the relief to get the extra clip for these.
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:19.600]   Exactly. But it's it's there. So many really nice little details. I'll call out one extra one.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:25.760]   The back pockets. I've never understood why on so many pants, the pockets are designed so that
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:31.280]   you can sort of get into them with your if you have to sort of angle your hand as if you're going
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:35.520]   down your spine to get at them. The back pockets and these pants are angled so that you can just
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:40.320]   basically reach in from the side. It's sort of like it's sort of like front pockets on the back.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:47.120]   So it's very, very easy to like dig in and get at the set of car keys or that sort of or anything
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:50.720]   you might be storing in there. They're really, really comfortable, really, really, they're affordable.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:54.480]   They're only like 50 bucks. I don't think pants should cost more than 50 bucks. If I spent more
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:58.320]   than 50 bucks on pants, my dad would be saying, what do you think? You remember the osmons of
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:04.960]   something? Take those pants back. As a matter of fact, I like them so much that like that later that
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:11.200]   day I did buy a pair of the summerweight tactical pants and available available in charcoal,
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:16.800]   gray, green, fire, navy, khaki, loadin, and twerp. If you're taking the dressing advice from anybody
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.800]   on the Mac Week panel, I think you're really Mac break panel. You really actually have sunk to a
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:25.280]   new low, but these do look nice. I might get some of these. Are these pants to a wedding and they
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:28.960]   will think, yep, there's a guy who listens to Mac break weekly or something even less. I wear
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:34.160]   Scott Evest pants. I'm wearing them right now, but these would be a good alternative.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:39.120]   Hey, guess what? I'm getting on Twitter. How do I get people to listen to me?
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:43.680]   Patrick, what's your login name on Twitter? Well, I will. Patrick,
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:48.720]   score Wilson underscore. Oh, we have to help him with that. Come on, you love it.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:55.680]   What do you think, Merlin? Will that work? You know, I'm going to add you. Here you go. I'll
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:58.720]   follow you. You need an icon in there, buddy. Get something sexy. Show a little.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:03.680]   Well, I'm following you, my friend. I'm following him too.
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:09.040]   You got to first. I'm just Twittering people to follow you and now that I will follow you.
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.440]   Okay. It's got two followers right now. Merlin and me. Oh, wait a minute.
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:18.720]   How can I do better than that? You got to update Patrick. Say something. You got to say something.
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:20.240]   You got to still setting it up.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:29.280]   One back. We got Patrick Wilson to Twitter and we're not talking the Broadway actor, Patrick Wilson.
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:33.120]   No, we're talking the Macho Manley, Patrick Wilson. The writer with the music man.
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:37.520]   The guy, the guy who met Tom Bosley. There you go.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:43.200]   Yeah, that was at the actual Happy Day set or was that a simulacrum?
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.920]   No, no. You should Twitter about that. Don't tell me put that at your first Twitter.
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:54.560]   I've already updated. Oh, he's updating, man. This is exciting. Oh, this is exciting.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:24:01.040]   You know, in about 19 more people, I'll have 13,000 followers. Look at that. Patrick Wilson,
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:10.560]   I'm on Mac break weekly. Is another one. What? Twitter. Welcome. Was good. Was good. I'm on the
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:15.280]   toilet right now would be good. You are listening to people typing and reading things or sitting
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:24.080]   on them on a quick weekly. Can I put this on my iPhone? Yes, you can.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:32.480]   Tim broke on one for bra. M dot M dot Twitter dot com, I believe. Yes. Is that right? Twitter mobile?
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:37.760]   There's also the application I could use. Yeah, there's a really good one.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:44.000]   Well, Bobby Anderson makes that one. Twitter, or us and Twitter, licious Twitter. I'll get it
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.680]   for you here. Oh, I thought I was. Twitter.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:55.680]   Twitter, Rina. Twitter, Ella. Bad. There you have a jailbroken phone. No, no, we all love it.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:00.000]   Scott born passed out a long time ago. It's okay. I'm not kidding. He's gone. I don't know
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.760]   what happened to him. I think after we go a little longer than an hour and a half, he actually,
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:09.680]   he actually falls over in a faint. Oh, dude, I got to be followers. Yeah. Yeah, you're gonna,
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:14.400]   you're gonna be huge, man, but you now have to say like important things. Well, the cool thing is
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:18.560]   that like the band name Weezer, it almost sounds like an internet service already.
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:23.120]   So you probably could get better capital just for that. Happy days. Whole 70s 50s.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:26.800]   I'll give 10% to anybody who hooks that deal up.
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:38.080]   Let's see. Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick. We did Andy's Pants at myinternetpants.com.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:43.680]   Mr. Merlin, man. I'm sorry. Did I ever give the URL? I don't think you did. Thanks.
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:47.360]   It is actually you can you can they're available from a bunch of different people, but the main
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:53.120]   site is 511tactical.com. They have tactical shirts, tactical belts, anything that could be
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:26:00.960]   proximity to an explosion they can sell to you. Merlin, man. All right, I'm gonna go
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:04.320]   far outside my usual area. And I know a lot of people are gonna make fun of me for this
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:08.240]   because it's just when an old man I am, but I bought a flip video camera. You did.
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:12.160]   I'm very, very excited about it. It arrived this morning and I've been playing with it all morning.
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:18.800]   Flip video camera. It's the size of if you smoked like more 100s. It's about the size of the pack of
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:25.920]   because you know when you smoke a long brown cigarette, ladies, it looks like a pack of mores
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:32.720]   and it's a it's a crazy like most reduced subset. So Jason Freed has written about this. David Pogue
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:36.800]   has written about this. He just wrote about it. He said, I don't know why I haven't reviewed this
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:41.200]   mostly because Geeks looked down their noses at this camera. Oh, it's crazy. He loved it. If you've
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:46.320]   got if you so like we've got. Have is using one now even. I mean, it's like the new A-list thing.
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:50.320]   Here's the thing like once you understand the model for this, well, first of all, let me explain
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:54.880]   it has basically a red button on it. It's got that's not entirely true, but to record,
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:58.640]   you just hit the red button and it starts recording to stop hit stop. There's no adjustments.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:02.480]   There's no nothing you can play. You can trash videos and that's it. It's got a flip out.
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:06.800]   USB thing. Let me flip it out. Can you hear that? There you go. Flip out USB thing. It plugs right
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:11.840]   in. There's a little app that pulls them off, pulls off AVIs and you're good to go. But if you're
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.280]   me, like I've got, you know, Alex, you know, like the camera we bought to do the Merlin Show,
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:21.040]   we got that tricked out HD. HD 20? Yeah, HD 20, which is this great HD camera. But like,
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:24.400]   if I want to shoot the kid laughing, what, I'm going to go get it. I'm going to make sure that
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:27.840]   it's queued up to the right place. I'm going to pop out the screen. No, I grabbed this thing
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:31.360]   with size of a pack of mores. I hit it and I start recording. You press the red button.
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:38.480]   For incredibly casual, easy video, this is looking very fun. It's not too bad. I think it's
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:43.920]   6, I want to say 640. It's like good TV quality. Oh, actually, and you should talk about this if
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:48.480]   you used it. I got the ultra, which is the 60 minute version. I will say two or three things
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:52.880]   about it. I love the flip video camera. I reviewed it like back in the fall. And for the same reason,
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:55.920]   it was a bit out in like a year earlier and I just ignored it because it looked like a toy.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.280]   As a matter of fact, if you've been into drugstore and you bought one of those single use quote,
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:04.080]   unquote video cameras, it's that exact same camera only with USB so you don't have to take it anywhere.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:08.400]   But it has two things that I just absolutely adore about it. Number one, it runs off of
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:13.680]   double A batteries, which gives you two big reasons why you'll be able to use this instead of that
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:19.520]   $1,000 HD camera. I have forgot, I put fresh batteries in it, fresh alkaline and it's just on
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:24.720]   the desk. I pick it up a month later and it's still good to go. It doesn't like decay. The charge
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:29.200]   doesn't decay. I don't have to keep it plugged in anywhere. Also, if I'm out on the road and I do
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:32.880]   went up with a flat battery or if it suddenly occurs to me today that, oh, wow, I should take
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:37.440]   the flip video camera, I don't have to think four hours in advance to make sure it gets plugged in.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:41.920]   Even if the batteries are dead, I stop off at a pharmacy and it's good to go. But the other
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:48.240]   cool thing about it is I use it so many times when I need, when there are places where I just can't
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:53.520]   fit in a regular video camera, there are times when I do want to do those, those cool like reality
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:59.280]   show, dashboard camera sort of things. It's absolutely flat. It's about like one inch thick. So you can
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:04.240]   easily just paste some Velcro to the back of it, stick it into the corner of the car and you're
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.240]   good in shooting. Have you done anything? Is there anything we could see on the web?
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:13.040]   Actually, if you go to Kung Fu Grip on my blog, I put up a single video so far. It's really stupid.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:17.600]   But at least we can see what it looks like though. Yeah, Kung Fu Grip, except GRI PPE. It's
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:22.560]   like if GIJO had the flu. Is that the native file or did you recompress it? Is it flash?
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.920]   I just, I took it out, I uploaded it to Vimeo and that's it.
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:29.360]   Okay, so it is in red and coated in flash. Yeah, you can see how I look like a catcher's
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:35.600]   mitt. But I also picked up the Flip tripod, which is basically similar in some ways to like not
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:39.680]   a gorilla pod exactly, but it's like just a little, what he called articulated, what he
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:45.760]   called those little legs with a little rubber feet and... It's like bendy bendy bendy legs.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:49.360]   Alex, you're always able to bring in that technical angle when it comes to it.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:52.240]   Yeah, yeah, that's just me. He's here for it. That's his job.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:56.080]   Okay, so anyway, yes. This is silly and it's toy-like. It almost reminds me of like,
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:00.960]   remember that awesome Fisher Price Pixel vision like back in the 80s? It's like, except useful.
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:05.040]   Like it's the size of this is awesome. I see myself using this a lot. I see this as something,
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:08.720]   I got the case in the tripod. So this, to me, this is something I throw in a backpack and when the
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.920]   baby does something funny, I can record it. Or when my wife does something funny, I can record it.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:19.280]   So it's one fifth of an Alex, $140 available on Amazon at all. And it's fun. Flip video.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:25.920]   Yeah, I, when I have like my nieces and nephews over, they're not allowed to play with a $1000 HD camera.
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:30.080]   Yeah, right. But they are, I happily hand them the flip video and we, and
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:34.480]   ports an iMovie, we can do editing, we can do cool stuff. I would say that it gets used at least
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:42.400]   as often as the really good expensive camera. Very cool. Got one. Huh? I have a flip. What do you
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:48.880]   use it for? I hand it to my three-year-old. You have a newborn too, right? Yeah, three months.
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:52.400]   Just slept through the night, first night, last year. Yeah, congratulations.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:56.880]   All right, goes crazy. He's a mirtel and I both know that one. Yeah, we have, we have, we're,
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:04.320]   so how old's your child? Are you talking to me? Yeah, Patrick. Three months and three,
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:07.680]   isn't one, is a three-year-old as well. Wow, our grouping's pretty tight. The three of us.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:12.400]   I'm, um, show, Shara's just trying to, what was in the air on that weekend that caused all of you to
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:17.760]   just say, come on, let's get a bottle of Dubin A and let's go warm up. The one evening in February,
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:21.920]   we all decided to warm up the tube amp. What, what, I would say nothing on TV.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:25.760]   February. Lost is a repeat. What do you want to do?
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:34.240]   And, uh, yes, we're going to have three new-ish parents. Yeah, that's all good. Do you use a flip to
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:41.520]   take baby pictures? No, no. I'll tell you what though. I'm going to buy one of those, um,
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:47.200]   those goofy little Casios that are awesome on Amazon for like a 129 bucks.
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:51.600]   I have a sick DSLR, but what am I going to do with that walk around that like a tourist?
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:55.520]   Yeah, I do it. Especially if you're carrying a baby Bjorn or a sling or something, you're going
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:59.040]   to carry a DSLR around your neck, you know? Yeah, that's, that's what I got the G9 for. It's a
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:04.400]   little expensive, you know, a little bit more on the expensive side, um, but, um, it's a great,
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:09.840]   it shoots raw. And so, um, and I can put it in my front pocket, although the Lumenix is really good.
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:13.840]   Well, sorry, it's raw like that big deal over like- Well, here's the best. Here's the deals.
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:17.360]   Is that you're taking photos, if you're taking photos in you and you're shooting and suddenly
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:22.000]   you accidentally shot outside instead of inside, the big thing is that all the color correction is
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.560]   done later. So you can get that blue cast or yellow cast out of it later without any damage to the,
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:30.880]   to the actual image. And, um, like- The big difference with-
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:36.880]   Go ahead. I was going to say the biggest difference with raw is that JPG has a limited color palette.
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.920]   With the bra, you're getting stuff right off the image sensor. And so you have a much,
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:43.440]   much, much bigger box of crayons. It's the difference between when you get the picture home,
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:48.640]   having a face that's partially in shadow and not really being able to do anything with it.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:53.680]   If it's a raw picture, there's enough color information that's been recorded off of that shadow
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:57.520]   area that you can pull all those shadows out completely, pull out all these details that are
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:02.160]   buried. Uh, once you spend a day shooting raw and seeing what you can do with it, you will go out
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:06.240]   and buy an eight, an eight gigabyte card or 16 gigabyte card they're going to need to start shooting
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:11.760]   a raw rock. I mean, essentially, if you're shooting in JPEG, it's kind of like you're recording audio,
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:20.000]   in 128, uh, 128 bit, uh, uh, MP3. Yeah. And you're going to do all your mastering on that.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000]   That's when I picture the symbols are going to sound washy.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.760]   Exactly. Exactly. Except in just thinking individually. This has been a really illustrative
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:34.880]   show for me because now I know what, like my cousins and my friends think when I'm talking to
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:38.560]   them about my technology, I'm like, wow, washy. I'm going to use that. I don't know what-
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:39.200]   Washy.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:43.600]   He was so technical. I got washy. You know what I mean? Like symbols, like, if you, if you have,
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:49.920]   like, some of my early encodes are like, like, flanging up on it. I'm playing on my own
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:53.600]   ignorance, not that it's, you're using a term that that's hard to understand. I'm just saying
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:57.680]   that their terms, I know that I associate with music and I know that people who are smart about
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:04.320]   music use them, but I'm like, wow, I can, I can, wow. What I'm saying is we rarely talk to anybody,
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:09.200]   but geeks. So when they use words outside of our own narrow sphere, we get excited.
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:14.080]   Who's the worst at that is audio file people. They're like, oh, the balloon.
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:17.920]   God, it's going to be in flack. Really, we feel like to have the integrity of this. I've done
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:22.880]   this taping basically through this order that I've held over my head and it's got to be 50
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:28.480]   bajillion by flack file. Here's the worst. Let me guess. You get, let me guess. You're using
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:33.520]   the Rants and French interconnects on that tube. Okay, fine. Oxygen free. I've got, I've got some
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:36.160]   that are made in Brazil. We can fix this. Don't we'll ever record it.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:38.320]   Tapers.
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:43.440]   Are you a flat guy? Patrick, you big flat guy.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:51.120]   You know what, man? I'm going all vinyl. I went through a giant period of news group
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:56.320]   downloading like, whoa, flat, glossless, whatever. Oh, man. And now you know what? I could care less.
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.840]   I never listened.
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:58.640]   And you know what I do?
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:01.840]   Part of the part that's hilarious is the source quality. So awful. These guys are really
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:06.240]   obsessed with these like totally lossless formats for something that like just sounds like ass.
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:10.960]   It's unbelievable. I think I don't care because I didn't buy it. That's why I don't care.
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:14.400]   Ah, that's true. I think it's true. When you get a concert ticket for free, do you go? No.
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:17.440]   If you pay a hundred bucks for it, you're going to show up.
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:21.760]   Do you buy the heavy as a 40 gram or whatever it's called? Do you buy like the heavy records?
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:28.480]   Artisan. I don't have any records yet. He's planning to go vinyl.
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.840]   You just made a decision.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:31.280]   First, yes, you got a turntable.
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:37.840]   My car old that you mentioned earlier has 12,000 records. Yeah. Hey, so it's 12,000.
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:44.480]   And I made a list of like 2000 releases that I wanted. I'm like, here, go find these and make
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:50.080]   sure they're on open. And then I realized I was going to be incredibly expensive and I gave it up.
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:51.600]   Have you discussed this with your family at all?
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:56.800]   Dude, out here in the studio, it's like I'm in the cave.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:01.280]   She knew the stuff that I was buying and like, she doesn't know.
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:06.400]   She does same thing. Like, hey, what's that on your finger? Oh, I'm just a little.
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:11.280]   This is where Twitter is going to get you. Like, why you bought an original daydream nation for
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:17.200]   $10,000? Sorry. That's what Twitter is all about. Keeping spouses together since 2005.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:21.760]   Let's see. I have a quick pick. Have I done Pucka before?
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:25.760]   I don't think it's a delicious. Delicious. Yeah.
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:28.960]   No, I don't think so. I love Pucka. I realized I'm using it all.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:33.680]   Well, it's Pucka. I can tell you because I'm going to play it for you.
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:34.240]   Okay.
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:37.440]   This is they actually put on their website because of people like you,
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:40.160]   Merlin, they actually put the pronunciation on their website.
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:42.960]   I'm getting a cautionary tale. Pucka. Pucka.
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:45.360]   You're it? Pucka. I do. Pucka.
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:49.680]   That should be a lesson in marketing. If you have to, if you have a recording of how your
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:52.880]   trade name is pronounced, pick another trade. For a long time when you installed Linux,
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:57.760]   it would come with one sound file that would say, "My name is Linus Torvalds and I pronounced
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:04.240]   Linux. I know that just so you know how to pronounce it." But your first name was Linus,
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:09.840]   you would be really obsessed with pronunciation too. I pronounce Linus. That just cracks me up.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:13.520]   Anyway, Linux is a big lie. Don't do it. The cake is alive.
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:15.520]   Now we're going to get mail.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:19.280]   So you know up, kid. I'm running up. He said he got a lossless, lossless mail.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:23.680]   He was going to put always 10 on his AMD Athlon and instead he decided to put a bunto. Then that's a man.
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:28.640]   Dude, I had it on. I had always 10 on and then I was like, "I can't get that."
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.960]   It was kind of washy. I couldn't get it working.
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:34.080]   Oh, it's things. You got to have a Mac to use OS 10.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:38.320]   We're done in Walee, I think. Walee. Walee. It's in Walee. If you've done it in Walee.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:44.480]   Pucka. Pucka. Pucka is a little tiny file. I don't know why they shouldn't charge for it,
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:48.160]   but they do. It's code sorcery workshop. I don't mind paying the money. They're so cool. Fifteen
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:54.240]   dollars. What it is, is a little application that you can put a bookmark in your web page that will
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:38:00.720]   automatically post to Delicious. So what I do is if I'm on a page that I'm going to add to Delicious
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:05.760]   for this show or Twitter or any of the other shows, I select the text I want to save. I press the
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:13.920]   Pucka. No, I can't say it. Pucka button on my browser and works in any browser.
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:19.120]   And then this is the best part. You add the tags you want. You press the add link button and then
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:23.840]   listen what it does. I love this part. It makes a little sound. Oh, I've turned it off in this version.
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:29.280]   So it wouldn't do it because I'm Puckaing all the time. Let's hear it. I have to open Pucka and
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:37.040]   change the preferences because I turned this. I don't know if it's worth 40. I mean, it doesn't
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:42.880]   do much. I just love it. Here. Let me let me I'll re I'll re I'll redo this link so that you can
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:51.600]   I'm I'm I'm linking now to the KLF manual. Love it. Pucka and I'm a pro. Oh, duplicate URL.
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:59.120]   Keep editing like new. Okay. Because I already did it once. And now I'm going to add the link. And
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:05.440]   here's the little Pucka sound. This is how you know it's called Pucka. Come on. I love that.
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:11.200]   I love it. It's just very happy. I hear that and I go, okay. I think Frip actually did that sound.
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:17.280]   Sitting on a stool. Yeah. It's for pre-prepared. Enjoy the delicious. Can't figure it out. I don't
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:21.360]   know. I just don't like it. You know, it's a it's an acquired taste. But once you acquire it,
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:26.560]   it's hard to get it out of your mouth. Oh, I don't like that. It's great for searching for
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:30.480]   things that have been scanned and approved by other people. Like if you're looking for a
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:34.880]   freeware audio editor, you'll get a million bad links off of Google, but off of Delicious,
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:38.400]   you'll say, Oh, well, that one's been favored by 2000 people. Maybe that's it. I also do it. I
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.800]   use it in reverse all the time. If I'm on a page, I have a bookmarklet for show me who else bookmarked
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:46.560]   this. Oh, that's clever. I'll hit that and I'll just pull up everybody's comments on it. Oh,
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:51.680]   that's a great idea. Where'd you get that bookmarklet? Is that a delicious? That probably is in the
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:56.400]   help section. There's a lot of ways to use delicious. I use it, of course, to bookmark stories as
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:00.800]   I'm preparing for the various shows we do. And so I have a delicious account and I use the book
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:06.000]   market. But Pucka is the easiest way to do that. $14.95 should be free. But you're a cokelicious
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:13.680]   man. I am a cokelicious man. I use cokelicious then to then look at the, to look at the things. You
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:18.960]   can use cokelicious to post for instance, in net newswire, you can have it use cokelicious to post.
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:23.120]   But Pucka is simple. It just does what it does. I don't know.
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:29.680]   Now I love it. P-U-K-K-A. P-U-K-O. So Pucka, I'm sorry. They're wrong. I'm right.
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:36.000]   You know, you don't get to take a word that already exists and then declare that.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.120]   Yeah, I'm putting up, I'm not sure putting up a sound file changes it.
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:44.720]   I'm not sure that they have that sort of authority at this stage in their venture capital adventure.
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:49.200]   I don't know if they have VC for this thing, but Pucka, Pucka, Pucka.
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.920]   That's how you say it. That happens if we put Pucka into the urban dictionary.
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:56.560]   Please don't. Would I be scared? Please don't. Aren't they doing that?
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:00.080]   I have myself silly looking at the urban dictionary. It's hysterical.
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:03.280]   They're making a book of this, like a print book.
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:09.200]   What? Of the urban dictionary? It's kind of like, well, almost like Wikipedia for obscenity.
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:12.320]   Like anytime somebody throws out some term, I like, I always just say,
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.240]   "The slow, the frozen for plan." I like to use it for plan.
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:16.080]   Be that word doesn't mean what you think it means.
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:19.440]   I do not think that word means what you think it means.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:23.280]   So like on the front page of urban dictionary now, bear stern is a verb.
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:28.560]   Bar sexual, a college age girl who kisses other girls in bars and clubs, usually for attention.
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:36.640]   That's good. And drinks. Don't taze me, bro. Let's see who is left.
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:39.200]   Alex Lindsey, Mr. Lindsey of the Pixel Core.
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:46.400]   I have one that's zero, Alex's. And it's actually suggested by someone on the delicious
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:52.160]   tax. And so I was downloading it and I actually enjoy it quite a bit, which is it's called
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:57.840]   Media Snap. Did you guys see this? No. So Media Snap is yet another way. And I know I'm a little
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:03.280]   obsessive, but I get frustrated with whatever the current YouTube stripper, the thing they'll pull
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:10.560]   YouTube videos out. And this one is a great little UI for basically what you can do. As you can say,
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:19.040]   for instance, I wanted to download Obama's speech on race. And so I just do Obama race and it searches
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:25.600]   YouTube for me. And, you know, shows all the stuff that's related to that. And then I just hit,
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:29.360]   oh, I just want to start downloading that. And it's just great the way it's set up because I can
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:32.960]   sit there and just click, click, click, click, click. They disappear from my playlist as soon as I
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:38.080]   click on them and move to a download list. And then I can just keep on kind of cruising along,
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:43.840]   downloading stuff. And it works really, really well. I wish somebody would figure out,
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:48.080]   that sounds awesome. I've been using video box, but it's being a little weird with 3.1 on Safari.
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:52.640]   Media Snap is just super good. I would love for somebody to go back and record how many times
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:56.240]   we've had a recommendation that was basically how to get videos off of YouTube.
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:01.200]   Well, here's the thing is, I don't want to watch them. I don't want to watch them on the
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:05.520]   computer. I want to watch them on the TV. I want to watch them on while I'm doing a stationary
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:09.920]   bike at the gym. So I just click on Google Video too, because I mean, Google Video has some
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:15.280]   awesome, like, full-length movies up. They do. And I really, I don't know if it works on that.
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:18.960]   This one's designed completely wired up. Someone should make one for Google. So if they're listening,
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:24.960]   if the person who's doing Media Snap is listening, I think he is from Germany. You should make one
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:29.280]   for Google Video. But the one that works for YouTube works really, really well. And as I said,
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:32.960]   I just like to, what I do is I'll pull a whole bunch of stuff down that I feel like I should
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:38.000]   have seen or that I want to see some point in time. And then I like the evil eye from the little kid.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.040]   And just to keep up with the stuff, you know.
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.520]   Can I ask you a technical question that's slightly related, Alex?
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:44.240]   Sure.
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:49.040]   Will anybody ever figure out a way, do you think, to pull down Hulu videos?
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:52.080]   I have a way to pull down Hulu videos.
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:54.720]   Does Vixi work on Hulu? V-I-S-Y-D.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:44:00.960]   It's called snaps. He captures them. He just takes snaps. If I want to pull something down.
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:02.720]   Steampunk capture, my God.
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:06.480]   It is, but no. Steampunk capture is using your flip camera to shoot this screen.
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:08.080]   Made out of brass and two.
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:13.120]   I mean, I do the same thing with NPR is that I use a wiretap studio and I just,
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:17.360]   I play NPR in the morning and I just hit record and then I go back to whatever I'm doing. And
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:21.840]   you know, I set up the playlist because you can use their little flash player and you can rearrange
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:24.480]   everything and get it just the way you want it rather than the crap that they put in.
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.840]   Hulu has got some really good stuff up.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:28.720]   I've been using Hulu every night.
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:33.040]   I've been using a Windows program called replay media catcher that is a really good
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:36.400]   flash video catcher catches the actual stream itself.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:40.560]   There's a little bit of degradation, but I can deal with it. It makes it look,
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:45.440]   it makes these beautiful VHS, beautiful like full screen, Hulu videos,
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:49.840]   look like a YouTube video of full length, but again, it's good.
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:53.680]   What's it called? It's from Aplian Technologies. It's called replay media.
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:54.960]   Yeah, that's actually really excellent.
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:56.720]   But is that Windows only though?
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:01.680]   It is Windows only, but it's 40 bucks. And that's the reason why I have dual boot on my Mac.
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:05.840]   All those Aplian programs are fantastic, but they're Windows only. You can capture a lot of
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:06.400]   different streams.
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:10.400]   There's so many for capturing you for taking any audio that's somewhere that you can't just
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:14.800]   simply download it no matter what the source, no matter how it is, it's beautiful. This isn't,
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:19.040]   you know, this isn't Windows break weekly, but I could talk about this for 15 minutes.
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:19.760]   I love it so much.
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:23.520]   Yeah, the problem that I have with the actual one that's hard to get stuff off of is ABC,
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:28.160]   because ABC, the one there ads come up, they stop and you have to click to continue.
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:31.600]   With Hulu, you can just hit play and it'll put the ads in it, which I don't really care about.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:36.080]   The ads actually in Hulu are actually pretty good. And they're short and crucial.
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:40.960]   The comfort in one is comfort in length. The ads are actually worth watching.
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:47.120]   Patrick, you might want to tell Universal that media snap does work on the buddy Holly video,
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:55.680]   FYI. So I'm told I will get their blood hounders out on that.
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:46:00.080]   Try the officer once wants me to ask you, Patrick, if you're scared of being on
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:01.680]   Sessna's after shooting that video.
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:05.360]   Dude, I will never get in a Sessna.
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:08.160]   Let me ask you guys this though.
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:13.920]   I just got 400 emails. Oh, turn off going to your Twitter, Twitter settings.
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:19.440]   Those are all people adding you. Turn off email notifications. You don't want to know.
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:23.360]   Twitter just sends you a receipt saying, "Hey, someone's just dog." It's not the person itself.
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:24.880]   It's just Twitter saying, "Hey, you're not."
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:27.920]   On behalf of the rest of the internet, I'd like to welcome you to the world of bacon.
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:31.360]   That's called bacon. Bacon is like spam, but not right.
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:34.320]   It's like, yes. You signed up for it. Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:39.440]   Just a little program note here. I am going out of the country. I'm going to Australia for a
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:44.560]   photo expedition. More about that on my blog, leoville.com. I'm leaving Sunday.
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:48.080]   This is the last Mac break weekly for a couple of, maybe three weeks.
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:50.480]   I'm not getting back to April 15th, so we won't do another show.
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:56.720]   Possibly we'll do it on April 16th late or April 22nd, depending on, I'm probably going to be
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:59.280]   pretty tired when I get back. I don't know what I'm going to be able to do.
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:03.520]   Not only are we going to miss the next few weeks for Mac break weekly, other shows will as well.
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:06.720]   We'll have a Twitter this Sunday, but we'll miss April 7th and 14th.
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:12.400]   Net at night. I won't have another show till April 21st. Windows weekly will come back April 17th.
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:17.280]   Jumping monkeys will be back April 12th. We have one. Actually, we'll miss April 12th.
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:21.440]   We have a couple in the can. Munch cast. We're going to be back April 19th.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:25.120]   So in effect, we're going to have two weeks off for almost all the podcasts.
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:28.880]   The giz whiz security now will continue on. Those guys are animals.
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:34.320]   We've prerecorded ahead for this, and we will have some tech guy shows, at least two, if not more
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:40.000]   tech guy shows for you. But I do apologize. Think of it as spring break minus the wet t-shirts
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:46.000]   and the fun. Just take some time off. Listen to old shows. And I apologize, but
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:51.920]   they can't do them when I'm not here. And do follow my blog because we're going to have a lot
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:56.240]   of pictures and video and blogging and maybe even some own some special podcasts from Australia.
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:01.840]   I'm going to some very interesting people. Details on that at leoville.com starting April 2nd.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:08.080]   I can't talk about until then. All right. Well, I'm proud to say that Patrick does now have over
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:14.240]   100 followers on Twitter already before the show is even over. And already he's just
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:19.040]   Twittered. I am so over Mac break. We leave these losers. So he's really fitting in very well,
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:26.000]   I think with these guys pee. I'm going to wrap this up right now. Another Mac break is broke.
