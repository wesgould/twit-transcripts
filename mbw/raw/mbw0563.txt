[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.840]   Welcome back to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.840]   I am not Leo Laport.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.960]   I am Jason Snow.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.320]   Former editor at Macworld.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.840]   Currently at sixcolors.com.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.480]   Leo asked me to sit in for this post-WWC edition.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.280]   I have three wonderful guests to talk more about Apple stuff with me.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.560]   The host of last week's Mac Break Weekly is here as a guest, how the tables have turned
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.560]   Andy Inato.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.040]   Hello.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.080]   I think I'm more of a co-host than a guest.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.640]   I mean, this is why I raised the question about maybe he shouldn't actually be in the
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.320]   studio in the chair that belongs to Leo because it transfers things up through the butt into
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.320]   this.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.200]   The spinal cord makes things happen up here that you're not going to be proud of when
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.880]   you're not in that seat anymore.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.960]   You know, I don't see you here.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.200]   All I see is a little TV screen.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.520]   I could turn it off at any time.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.720]   What I'm saying is fight me, but you got to be here to do it.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.480]   Renee Rich, also a co-host.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.480]   Oh, okay.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.640]   Let's get some friends of mine.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.360]   Let's get a few of your guys going there.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.360]   Hi, Renee.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.360]   Steve, John, Andy, and Tony.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.360]   Leave him in your quarters.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's good to see you.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Hi, Jason.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.440]   It's great to see you again, but this time you're not in real life, so I'm sad.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.440]   Yes.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.240]   Now Renee and I were both in San Jose for WWDC as was our very special guest until recently
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.520]   the executive editor at Macworld, one of my colleagues there.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.600]   She's now a freelance writer and an excellent writer at that.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.680]   It is Susie Oaks.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.680]   Hi, Susie.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.680]   Hey, Jason.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.680]   How are you?
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.680]   I'm doing great.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.320]   It was a pleasure to see you last week in San Jose.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.320]   It was.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.320]   That was fun.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.280]   Maybe I know, except maybe Andy actually was there.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.840]   It was one of those things where I had an out of body experience.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.040]   Susie helped us out on I'm more excellently, so we were super happy.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.040]   Yeah, it was great.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.480]   I just turned in another thing about an hour ago.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.480]   So happy?
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.480]   It's big smiles.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.480]   It's all good.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.480]   It's all good.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.480]   So this is the week after.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.520]   This is that time when we get a chance to say, "All right, we were in the moment.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.400]   There was a lot going on.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.040]   This week's show was really excellent, a great set of panelists that Andy talked to."
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.080]   Now we've got a week to think back.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.840]   I thought we would go over some of the things that happened last week and get sort of a
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.240]   little more perspective a week later.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.240]   And number one, I have to say, is the HomePod, Apple's speaker, connected speaker, that
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.680]   is not quite an Amazon Echo competitor because of the price.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.480]   It's more of a connected speaker, Sonos competitor.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.920]   And that's an interesting decision that we could talk about.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.880]   I got a chance to hear it last week.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.800]   Renee, did you get Wanda by and happen to hear one in an undisclosed location?
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.760]   Yeah, there was a random Pepsi challenge that all I can say is how it compared.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.280]   I can't give too much information about it, but I did get a chance to hear it and how
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.680]   it compared to the Echo and the Sonos.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.240]   I think it was a Play 3.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.240]   I want to say.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.240]   It was the Play 3, yeah.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.240]   It was just the one that's priced similarly to the HomePod.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.760]   The Play 5 is a little more expensive.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.600]   Well done with the pricing, Jason Sennell.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   You were on that earlier.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.120]   All that because the trick with predicting Apple pricing is, of course, to find what
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.600]   you expect to pay and then add $50.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.080]   And that's the price.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.080]   So I called it.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.080]   So Renee, what's your take?
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.480]   I heard it too, but I'm curious what's your take on the sound part of it?
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.480]   We didn't get to talk to it.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.280]   We didn't get to touch it, but we didn't get to hear it.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.280]   We talked to it.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   I just didn't talk back.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.280]   It was just a point.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   I was just pointing it.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   It was a point at it.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.520]   This mustn't be played ever.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.320]   I was giving it a side.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.640]   So I sort of have two sets of feedback on it.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.360]   One is that I have Sonos everywhere here.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.800]   I think I have seven or eight speakers now.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.640]   And I've always thought they sound really good.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.200]   And so I was hoping the home-- I'm never going to get this name right.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.760]   The HomePod was going to be about the same level.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.040]   But once I started the Pepsi Challenge, when you heard a whole bunch of different songs,
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.800]   the HomePod sounded clearly much, much better.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.960]   And I think that comes down to the second part, which is using A8 as a digital signal
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   processor.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.000]   And it gives you sort of-- if you know the portrait mode on iPhone, the app, the A9 chip
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.720]   on the-- so the A10 chip on the current iPhone is doing all sorts of work in the background
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.000]   to actually process that all out.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.480]   It's digital computational photography.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.600]   And now we're getting computational audio, where it's ingesting all this.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.080]   It's mapping the room continuously.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.880]   It's looking for acoustic signatures.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.360]   It's finding out where the sweet spots are.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.360]   It's pulling out vocals.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.360]   It's doing all these things.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.400]   And it's making it sound way better than I imagined.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.600]   So Sonos suddenly sounded kind of dull and muddy.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.560]   And the echo sounded like a tin can.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.080]   And I don't want to replace it once a speaker.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.840]   But I think I'm going to have to replace it once a speaker's.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.560]   One thing I'm unclear about the Sonos that was used in these demos is whether it was
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.800]   actually tuned for the room or not, because Sonos has this.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   It was.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.520]   It went through the entire tuning with the app.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.040]   And they made it sounding as best as engineering could possibly make it.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.720]   Whoever they are, we don't know who they were.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.480]   They just set it up.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.720]   We don't know anything about the deal.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.760]   The Sonos elves.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.480]   One of the things that people may not know about the HomePod is technically it's a
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.560]   mono speaker, even though it's got seven tweeters and that subwoofer or that woofer,
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.960]   I guess, not a subwoofer.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.320]   Woofer/cooling system.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.360]   Yeah, exactly right.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.560]   So it's got a lot of speakers.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.120]   But it's essentially a mono speaker in the sense that I asked them about stereo.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.040]   And they said, basically, if you'd like stereo, get two.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.040]   And then you want quads?
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.040]   Get four.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.440]   And they will exactly do that.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.160]   It will spread to a stereo sound.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.080]   But here's the thing.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.200]   They are doing all of this processing, as Renee said.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.480]   So it's almost like this weird kind of mono surround where different parts are coming
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.280]   out of different speakers and they're reflected off of different surfaces in a room.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.040]   So it's not an unprocessed flat.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.640]   What you think of as mono, it is.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.280]   It does have space in it, but it's also not stereo.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.960]   It's a very strange thing to think about.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.960]   It's not at most.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.360]   It's very weird.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.680]   I haven't, obviously, I haven't heard yet.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.560]   So one of the things I'm really curious about is to what degree is it taking the mix that
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.160]   you like of a recording you're really familiar with and say, don't worry, we fixed it for
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.160]   you.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.840]   Abbey Road now sounds good.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.360]   But no, I don't want, I didn't want the drums to be enhanced there.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.800]   I didn't want the vocals to be more bassy there.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.040]   I really wanted it to be the way that the engineers recorded it.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.840]   So do you get a sense that it sounds different?
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.640]   Not just better, but different?
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.720]   Yeah, I mean, the live track was different, right?
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.560]   Jason, at least in my ears, the live music they played sounded different than the produced
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.560]   music that they played.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:56.400]   The live sample was actually the stereo sample and it sounded spectacular, which it should
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.880]   because that was $700 worth of speakers sitting there.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:05.120]   But the produced stuff, yeah, Andy, I think you make a really good point.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.760]   The question is, we don't know anything about the interface of this thing.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.440]   We don't know if it is going to be dynamically processing everything, whether it's going
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.200]   to try to make some judgments, whether as a user you can sort of set what kind of audio
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.400]   processing you want or turn it off and make it a little more flat.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.480]   I found a lot of them sounded really great, but you could tell, like, it's doing some heavy
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:30.880]   lifting to move different sounds to different speakers and if you're a purist, this is like
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.440]   the argument about Beats headphones, right?
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.760]   It's not a flat sound.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.080]   They are emphasizing certain frequencies and if some people love it because it's a crowd
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.240]   pleaser and some people hate it because it's not what they feel is the original artist's
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.320]   intent and Apple owns Beats.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.080]   And it's different than the Atmos because at Atmos they're getting an Atmos mix and that's
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.120]   purpose designed to be in different areas and it's just using reflectivity to put it
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.800]   in those areas where this has to interpret everything from scratch.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.720]   So it has to do a lot of guesswork and assumptions on its own.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.840]   So Susie, what was your a week in?
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.040]   What's your read on the HomePod?
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.040]   Do you want one?
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.840]   Are you excited about it?
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.640]   Or are you kind of turned off?
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.280]   Well, it kind of made me want to sonos because I'm not an Apple music listener and it's
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.360]   just so limited into what you can play with it.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.640]   Like Apple music comes straight from the cloud.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:27.800]   If you don't have Apple music, all you can do is use AirPlay 2 to stream something from
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:34.160]   an Apple device because right now AirPlay 2 is only in iOS 11 and Mac OS Sierra, TVOS
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.640]   11.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.880]   So it kind of made me want to sonos.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.560]   I was never really into the concept of a smart speaker because I think a speaker should
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.640]   just play anything you play at it.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.200]   I mean, now we have smart light bulbs and they have to update their firmware and they
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.560]   talk to you.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.920]   So sometimes when you make things smart, it leads to a bunch of problems.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:58.080]   So I was never on board with the multi-room audio and the benefits of a smart speaker
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.360]   until Apple explained it to me and said, "This is the best thing ever.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.360]   We didn't invent it.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.360]   We're going to make it."
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.360]   So everyone wants it.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.480]   Then I started thinking maybe they have a point and the players that are already in
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.880]   the market might have a product that's better suited to me because I'm just not really into
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.880]   Apple music.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.120]   This is so made for Apple music that it seems like a shame to use it with anything else,
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.200]   like buying AirPods to use with Android.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.600]   There are connectivity issues here too.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.760]   It's going to have AirPlay 2 support.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.120]   But as far as I could tell, it sounds like it doesn't have Bluetooth support.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.200]   It doesn't have an auxiliary import.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:39.120]   And that's the thing is for a speaker to give it life, having it not have to rely on online
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:45.000]   services in order to use it in five or ten years is a big deal.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.040]   My proof and concept here, I have an iPod HiFi on my desk that I use every day because
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.200]   it's attached to my Mac via a little cable, that cable that's not on the iPhone.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   They deleted it.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   They didn't even delete the kitchen.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   It wasn't there to begin with.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   That's my kitchen speaker.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.120]   I've hooked up to a Bluetooth transponder and it's still a very good speaker.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.680]   So what we're saying is bring back the iPod HiFi.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.120]   No, we're not saying that.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.960]   I think, I mean, Susie, you make a really great point.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.280]   I find myself wondering, I am an Apple Music user.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.000]   So this could potentially work for me.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.160]   But as somebody who has an Amazon Echo and a Sonos system, what I really want is the
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.920]   thing that they've announced but haven't actually released yet, which is Amazon Echo
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.080]   integration for Sonos.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.640]   Because that would work great for me to be able to say to the Echo, play this song from
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:37.080]   wherever Apple Music Spotify, play a baseball game from MLB TV on my really good speaker.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.320]   And that is not something that you can really do without buying an Echo Dot and hooking
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.600]   it up to a Sonos Play 5, which I have and it's not a great thing because you still can't
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.440]   control the music by voice.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.720]   You have to choose one or the other.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   So it's, you know, Apple, this is a limited product.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   What's your take for me on the...
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   Go ahead.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.400]   So I was going to say there's two cool things here still.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.440]   One is that it's super early days for the Apple Home Pod.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.160]   I'm never going to say that right.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.160]   The Apple Home Pod.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.800]   Just like other speakers didn't always come with all the music they have now, it's possible,
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.320]   I mean, we're talking about Apple here, it's something that will be other deals and there
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.240]   will be other things available or there will be a way for SiriKit to just do stuff that
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.240]   it doesn't do now.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.640]   So it's been announced with Apple Music because Apple controls that and they can very easily
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.520]   demo it and do everything they want to and secret while they're still announcing the
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.520]   product.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.520]   You've got the same thing.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.520]   But who knows that there was at one point, maybe some intention of explaining a developer
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.080]   story here since this product was released at a developer conference.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.560]   They didn't ship for six months and in the end they didn't do it that way.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.320]   It must not have been ready if they were thinking about it.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.320]   But that is a missing piece.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:45.560]   I'm reminded of the iPod to use another pod which shipped basically for the Mac using
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.360]   Firewire and it took a couple of iterations before they kind of opened it up to...
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.680]   Well, Sonos is the same thing.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.200]   Like Sonos, I still can't airplay to Sonos which drives me nuts.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.440]   I have to use either an Apple TV or an airport, not extreme, the normal air pod, the non-extreme
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.440]   air pod.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.000]   Express in order to airplay to it and the excuse was always, "Well, airplay doesn't support
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.680]   multi-room and can we get multi-room licensing?
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   We're not going to support it."
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.400]   Well, now we have multi-room licensing.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.120]   So I'm interested to see how other people in this space iterate now that Apple is entering
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.120]   it.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.800]   Yeah, but at the same time, never count on Apple growing a product in a way that benefits
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   you.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.800]   I don't mean that as an insult.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.920]   I mean, as a rational thought, don't buy it because, well, geez, it would really add
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.480]   value if it had Bluetooth or for that external inputs.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.480]   But I'm sure that...
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.080]   There's going to be iteration of the software.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.080]   Don't count on it.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:36.680]   I don't realize that the iPod migrated towards multi-platform, but that's because people
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.920]   who didn't want that to happen were essentially had their heads beaten against a rock until
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.400]   they agreed to make that happen.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.960]   And also realize that at that time, it wasn't like an ex-wave type people exclusively to
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.840]   a music store, a content service that you want people to buy anyway.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.840]   So I mean, this is...
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.840]   Here's an Apple watch.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.440]   It's been around for two or three years.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.920]   Is it compatible with anything other than the iPhone yet?
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.920]   Nope.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.920]   So that's a worry.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.920]   Andy, you're right.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.920]   Rule one.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:06.000]   I think we can, as pundits, we can speculate that perhaps Apple will grow this product because
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.800]   in the end, does...
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   We don't know.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.960]   Does Apple want this product to be a really great accessory for Apple music?
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.880]   Or does it want to sell a lot of home pods to whoever subscribes to whatever we...
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.840]   Or it may not matter, though, because with one series of great abstractor...
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.840]   Sorry.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.840]   That's true.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.760]   Well, the cool thing about AirPlay 2 is that other speaker makers are going to be making
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:32.960]   AirPlay 2 speakers that'll let you kind of roll your own very iOS compatible multi-room
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.560]   audio system.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.880]   Some AirPlay speakers that are on the market now have announced that they'll be able to
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.640]   support AirPlay 2 with a firmware update.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:46.000]   So you might have an AirPlay 2 speaker in your house already, and then with iOS 11, and
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.080]   you'll be able to use Siri and say, "Send this to that," and this is audio to this other
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.280]   room.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:57.480]   Apple speakers at once, so you just need the app makers to update their apps, and then
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:04.080]   you'd need the speaker makers to give you new firmware, but you won't really need Sonos
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:11.160]   or a lot of home pods if you want to make a cool multi-room audio system just because
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.520]   of AirPlay 2.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.200]   So I think that's kind of even the cooler story than the home pod, because the home pod
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.880]   is still a very incomplete story, and we don't know exactly what it's going to be like,
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.760]   especially since it's not out for six more months.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:31.120]   And Andy has given us rule one of any technology purchase, which is never buy technology with
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.240]   the hope that a feature will be added later, because it probably won't.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.520]   Assume it won't.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:42.600]   And so if you're going to buy a home pod thinking, "Well, they'll support Spotify eventually,
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.760]   you're making a mistake.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.320]   Don't do it because of that.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.240]   Do it because you want to get the product as an app.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.360]   You can use Spotify this year and they didn't.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.640]   They announced last year that Siri Kit would give Siri to third party apps, but not music
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.080]   apps, that's still exclusive to Apple Music, and then this year, still exclusive to Apple
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.080]   Music.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.080]   You can make a task.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.480]   You can make a task to AirPlay your Spotify to your home pod.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.880]   But you can't do it.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.400]   I'm really looking forward for that for the big official rollout announcement.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:16.760]   And we're pleased to say that we support every music service and every OS through if this
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.760]   than that.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.000]   They're simply set up an if this than that recipe that connects through a server like,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   "Oh, that's not what I want.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   They're pretty supportive.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   They're better than that."
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Andy, come on.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.720]   So let's talk one more thing about the future of the home pod, which is the fact that I
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720]   said it right.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.720]   Oh, good.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.760]   I don't have to pause and be like, "Eee, home pod."
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.760]   What?
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.760]   Six months.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.640]   We got six months between now and when it's released.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.160]   Presumably, we'll learn more about this product.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.080]   I would actually go so far as to say it doesn't seem like it's done, especially on the software
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.080]   side.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.880]   That's why they're not going to ship it for six months.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.960]   So my question for all of you is, what else are we going to learn about this product between
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.120]   now and when it ships?
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.440]   We heard very little about the details of Siri with there are a couple of slides in
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.440]   the keynote.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.240]   Do you expect that there's going to be more to this product than what we've heard that
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.320]   may change your opinion of it between now and December?
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.800]   Or is this all there is?
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.760]   I can't imagine what they can add to it.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.680]   Right now, I think it's a really, really nicely positioned Apple product, which is they know
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:23.600]   that they can't really compete on the intelligence of their intelligent assistant right now.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.880]   But one, two things that they do exceptionally well is let's figure out a way to get immense
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.960]   sound, anything that is sensory.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.920]   Let's make that the best it can possibly be, whether it's sound, whether it's a screen,
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.840]   whether it's a photo color management.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.240]   Let's make that as best as can be done.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.360]   Let's also make an object that looks really great as a static object.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:49.160]   And there's going to be no shortage of people who can afford $350 for a speaker that sounds
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:54.120]   nicer than what they're used to even if what they're buying or $100 and $200 speakers.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.920]   And also they just like they don't want to have a speaker set up in the living room or
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.920]   in the den.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.320]   They just want a place to have really good music and this will fit the bill.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.880]   So I'm not really thinking that they're going to be adding.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.040]   We're going to see a whole lot of new features.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.600]   I think that we're going to see live demos of Siri on it.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:16.520]   And the thing that intrigued me almost as much as the actual hardware was the idea of we're
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:21.440]   going to make sure that Siri is really, really, really hip to music right now that we can
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.120]   say, give me the Beatles music in which the drums are, there's a drum solo.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:32.440]   Give me songs in which the person who quit the band in a huff on tour released a kind
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.720]   of a screw you album.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.240]   Give me tracks from that one.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:41.400]   And so I don't know how to call those specific tracks from John Lennon and John Lennon's
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.360]   follow up albums, but I know that Siri knows which, okay, you mean that you want to hear
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.360]   how do you sleep?
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.360]   Got it.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.360]   We're playing that right up, right up.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:54.080]   So that's how you can get people really, really happy with their $350 purchase 10 minutes
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.720]   later when they're sort of when they're playing stump the band is what I mean.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.760]   When you try to stump it and it comes through even though you didn't expect it to, I had
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.720]   that experience with Google Assistant just this weekend where I said, you know, if this
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.760]   were really good system, I shouldn't have to do that.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.080]   I should be able to say, oh my God, it works that way.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.800]   So I really think that's going to be the highlight of it for me.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:17.440]   Renee, is it a little weird that we didn't actually get more than a couple of slides about
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.440]   Siri?
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.440]   No, I mean, we'll talk about this later, but that show was so jam-packed.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.440]   I'm still upset.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.360]   We got as much as we're not really upset, but we just got way too much as it was.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.360]   I mean, I'm happy we, you know, Craig spoke about as fast as a guy who does those little
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.400]   micro machines commercials, but I would have rather we had a little bit more time to digest
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.400]   all this stuff.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.880]   So that being said, I think it wasn't surprising that they told a short home hub home pod story
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.880]   as they could.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.720]   My thing is that when the AirPods were announced, there was a lot of the kind of goofy and there's
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.120]   a lot of that happens in the Apple community.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.920]   It's like, oh, gold iPhone.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:49.920]   It's so goofy.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.920]   Oh, why can't I buy one?
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.920]   Why are they sold out?
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.920]   Apple sucks.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.920]   AirPods was going to be horrible.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.920]   Oh, why can't I get one?
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.920]   Apple sucks.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.680]   So I've learned not to underestimate them and not to assume that it's going to, you know,
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.200]   sometimes be as lame as it first looks.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.080]   And I think there's a lot of potential there and the sound is amazing and we don't know
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.840]   the full home kit story and the full series kit story.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.280]   And I'm sure that'll be a big part of the fall announcements.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.280]   So I'm sort of excited.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.120]   I don't expect we'll get way more than what we're showing off here, but I do think we'll
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.200]   we'll be told a better story and we'll know what we're getting to a much greater detail.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:23.760]   Yeah, there were a couple of iCloud announcements that were in the iOS 11 section that I think
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.720]   might end up being important for home pod.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.720]   So yeah, I agree.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.400]   We're going to we're going to hear a lot more about the the Siri part of home pod at
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:34.120]   the iPhone event that's usually in September.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.640]   So when they were talking about iOS 11, they mentioned that iCloud now was going to sink
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.640]   your iMessages.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.160]   It was going to sink your Siri queries.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:46.880]   And that's really important because Apple's privacy, you know, whole their whole privacy
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.520]   thing is to do everything on device and they don't send stuff back up and down from the
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.080]   cloud all the time.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.880]   When they do it's very encrypted.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:58.160]   So so when they talked about sinking this kind of data through iCloud, you know, they
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.720]   talked about it being encrypted both ways and and your Siri things are anemized and
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.080]   anonymized and and it's all going to be very safe and secure.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.640]   But this could make Siri on the home pod a lot more useful.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.600]   One of the frustrating things about Siri now is that it works differently on every device
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.600]   you use it on.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.600]   You can't give it the same queries on your Apple watch that you would on your iPhone.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.640]   Sometimes it says, Oh, you have to use your iPhone for that.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.200]   And then I get really mad.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:27.280]   So I think this iCloud syncing of new kinds of data is going to help you're going to be
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.640]   able to ask your home pod, you know, what was my last message from Andy and it can just
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.920]   read it without saying, Oh, those messages are kind of trapped on your iPhone.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.800]   And then, you know, all hell breaks loose.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:43.720]   So so I think there's going to be a lot more Siri demos and new capabilities shown off
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.200]   at the at the iPhone event where they can really demo them and give them the stage time
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.600]   that they deserve.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.080]   All right.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:57.000]   Well, more to come about some reflection a week later from WWDC and a little bit of new
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.680]   Apple news too.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.880]   But I feel like right now would be a good time for us to take a little bit of a break
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:07.640]   and hear from Leo who before he ran off to South America recorded this message just for
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.640]   you.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.000]   Hey, more Mac break weekly in just a bit.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.560]   But first I'm excited to welcome bomb fell to our show.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.760]   I signed up for bomb fell.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.760]   I think it was like a couple of years ago when I was doing iOS today with Sarah and I
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.040]   thought this, this is great.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.560]   I love this idea.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:38.240]   Really nice clothing and a personal styling service for men so that you get close and
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:45.360]   match your style or in my case, upgrade my style was I was looking to kind of look a
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.800]   little bit nicer and perhaps you've noticed, you know, I dress a little nicer than I used
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.200]   to after completing a very simple questionnaire.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:59.440]   You're then matched one on one with the your own personal stylists who hand picks every
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.760]   piece.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.960]   Your stylist before they send you anything will email her selections to you.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.800]   Then you'll have 48 hours to make any changes or just say, hey, you know, no, don't like
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.100]   anything.
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.100]   You can cancel entirely.
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.100]   You're completely in control.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.440]   You don't get anything you don't want.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.840]   Bomb felt offers the best quality menswear collections.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.880]   They scour brands and designers from around the world to send you the pieces that work
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.280]   best for you.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.440]   Clothing is shipped right to your door.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.200]   You don't have to go to the store and shop and I love having a personal shopper.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.200]   Somebody who knows style.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.640]   I don't have very good style sense.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:40.320]   I have to admit, but this, but that your stylist, that's, that's their, that's his or her job.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.080]   That's, that's what they do and they are good.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.240]   And you can say, I want a classic look.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.800]   I told her I wanted a preppy look.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.600]   You can say, I want to, you know, I want to look like James Bond.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.960]   You get to, you get to guide them.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.640]   No store involved.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.880]   You try on what you like.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.960]   If you don't like it, it doesn't work.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.640]   It's not your style.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.640]   You send it back.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.120]   You pay only for what you keep.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.480]   No charge for anything else.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.680]   And by the way, this is the only styling service that doesn't charge a styling fee,
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.000]   a subscription fee.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.840]   It's not a subscription.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.720]   I love my bomb fell close.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.840]   In fact, I'm wearing some of it on vacation right now.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.200]   And I'm going to, when I get back, I'm going to do it again.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.520]   We have a special offer for listeners to the show.

[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.720]   Let's get back to the show.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.720]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.880]   Leo is floating with turtles in the Pacific Ocean right now, I think.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.640]   I checked my Leo camera earlier, and that's what he was doing.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.640]   Let's talk about hardware.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.600]   Today, as we record this, is the day that the new iPad Pros are appearing in stores.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:14.920]   So no longer can Renee or Richie, Richie Lord over us the fact that he has been using
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.920]   one since last week.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.800]   Mine is 0.8 of an inch bigger than yours or 0.08 inches bigger than yours.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.920]   I can do Imperial math really, I can.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.080]   It's totally not because I got a 12.9 here.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.480]   So take that, Renee.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.480]   Suck it, Richie.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.480]   Suck it, Richie.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.480]   There we go.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.520]   So Renee, tell us your, you wrote a review of this for iMore.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.640]   Why don't we start with you and tell me your impressions after using the 10.5, the larger
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.200]   smaller iPad Pro for the last few days.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.760]   So I started off with the 12.9 because I really wanted to draw on that giant canvas.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.560]   I wanted to see if it could be not a laptop replacement because I hate that term, but sort
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.840]   of a laptop alternative.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.640]   But when the 9.7 inch came out, it was just much more advanced, the screen with the true
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:59.120]   tone and the camera system was just so much better that I ended up switching to that.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.560]   And I used it pretty happily.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.400]   And now this came out and this is, it's so, it's such a small difference.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:09.080]   It really is like 0.8 of an eight inches bigger.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.720]   But Apple was really savvy when they said that they made it just big enough to fit a
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.080]   full size keyboard.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.880]   So it's not like a 17 inch MacBook keyboard, it's more like the MacBook, the new MacBook
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.040]   keyboard where it's, you know, just about as small as a full size keyboard can be.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.760]   But it is full size and it really does make a difference.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.800]   And I liken it in my review to like a favorite pair of shoes and then you get a new pair
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.880]   and they're just, they're slightly bigger and they're super comfortable.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.040]   And you go back to the old ones and you realize that they've always been just a little bit
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.200]   too tight.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.960]   And now it's like just the screen is a little bit bigger, the typing is just a little bit
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.120]   bigger.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.800]   And this technology called ProMotion which is Apple's adaptive screen refresh rate where
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.920]   it can ramp up to 120 Hertz for the pencil and then ramp down to 24 Hertz for a movie
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.120]   and actually do both at the same time because math, it can show you a proper cinematic movie
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.200]   next to a high speed drawing is really, really great.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.800]   I agree with Gruber where it's not retina displayed and non-retina display great.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.760]   But once you see it and you go back, it's like, oh, this text is so choppy, this animation
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:06.760]   isn't great.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.560]   It's not perfectly following my hand.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.840]   All these defects you never knew about are suddenly right in front of you and you don't
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.840]   want to go back.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.680]   And that's always my barometer for new technologies.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.240]   If I miss them when they're gone, then I think they're really valuable.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.760]   And I think the ProMotion story and the A10X story and what it'll let us do when iOS
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.800]   11 hits is really a big deal.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:28.760]   So basically if you're not planning on buying one, don't try one because you're very sad.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.440]   No, yeah, it's like running.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.440]   Don't try one.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.920]   Susie, you want one?
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:38.800]   I do. I just bought the 9.7 little iPad because I have a five-year-old.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.480]   And so I like to limit the losses there because it's basically our iPad.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.560]   We pretend that it's mine, but he thinks it is.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:53.760]   So if he destroys it and it's something even AppleCare can't fix, I really like to limit
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.480]   my liability there.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:01.920]   So the 429, 120 gigabyte iPad seemed like the most family-friendly choice.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.240]   And then I bought that about a week before WWDC.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:09.280]   So reading Renee's review of this, it sounds like one of those things that I shouldn't
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.040]   try so I don't know what I'm missing.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:16.560]   The 2017 cheap iPad has been pretty good.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.880]   I have a laptop, so I use it as a laptop alternative.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.720]   And I'm getting a lot of stuff done with it.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.720]   I'm really excited about iOS 11.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.760]   I think that's going to make me a lot more productive with it.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.880]   But yeah, I mean, these new iPads, they just look so great.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:37.280]   But they're $50 more than any iPad before the entry level top of the line iPad.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.640]   So maybe next year.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.240]   All right, a little conflicted.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.280]   Andy, you like me or a big iPad user?
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.120]   What are you thinking about these new models?
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.120]   I think the increased frame rate is going to be really great.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.200]   I'm really looking forward to seeing how it plays out with games.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.680]   I'm really looking forward to seeing how it plays out with the augmented reality stuff
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.560]   that they really want developers to support at the end of the year.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.400]   And I think my anticipation is a lot like Renee's.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.840]   I'm not expecting it to be a blow my mind sort of change.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.680]   I am hoping that it's not an Apple sends me review unit.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.680]   I have to send it back at the end of 60 days.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.560]   I'm like, oh, damn it.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.880]   I'm going to have to buy a new one because I don't like the frame rate of the one I have
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.880]   right now.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.800]   For me, though, it's really the--
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.800]   it's like what Susie said.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.360]   It's the operating system improvements that they've made.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.560]   It's one of the great things about our job.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:32.960]   I love it when you see a product that is really, really good just out the gate.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:38.040]   And then they just keep rehearsing and refining it and just figuring out things that they
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.680]   can't figure out until they put this in front of an audience and they see how the audience
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.840]   reacts.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:48.640]   And they got the message that, OK, we thought it might be a book reader and a games machine
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.040]   and a light duty machine.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:54.400]   But people are like Jason and Andy are actually using it as a real computer.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.680]   So let's make it easier to switch between apps and let's add more functionality for
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.960]   organizing your workspaces and let's make a better keyboard support.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.880]   So the hardware stuff is great, but I'm really looking forward to seeing how well my first
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.640]   generation then top of the line iPad Pro plays out just with iOS 11.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.560]   I'm really excited about this more than most things that Apple's got on the boards for
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.560]   the rest of the year.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.560]   Certainly more than the home pod.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.640]   Do you normally use the 9.7 or the 12.9 right now?
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:27.080]   The 12.9, the 9.7 is kind of cramped to me.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.280]   It's the difference between having a full workspace where we talked about this on Twitter.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:37.320]   I love the fact that when I was covering WWDC from the home office here, I'm in the office.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.840]   I've got literally, I'm going to count the one, two, three, four, five, six computers
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:46.920]   around me, windows and Mac, not even counting the Raspberry Pies with big keyboards and
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:52.120]   mouse and screens, and yet the best application for the job of I need to watch a streaming
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.360]   video, I need to take lots of notes as I'm watching it, but I also need to sort of live
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.360]   tweet it.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:03.960]   The best environment was my 12.9 inch iPad Pro, an external keyboard and just using side
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.440]   by side apps and picture in picture.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.560]   It's just such a beautiful way to work.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:14.960]   So I would find it difficult to get that environment going even in the expanded desktop, even in
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.600]   the expanded size of the new smaller iPad.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.440]   So I hope that the 12.9 still gets as much love as it deserves because there really is
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.680]   something to having a nice big screen and not having to feel like you're cramped at
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.680]   all.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.800]   Yeah, I agree and I'm very happy that the 12.9, which was, there were some speculation
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.840]   it might go away, but I think that given what we know now of the 10.5, the fact that it
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:40.480]   doesn't have the resolution of the iPad mini, which would have given it as many pixels as
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.920]   the 12.9, I'm really glad the 12.9 is still around because it does serve that need to
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.600]   be, if you want to, want to fill more space, run to apps and iPad layout side by side,
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600]   12.9 can do it.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.600]   Yeah, the size classes are a big deal.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:59.040]   And if anything, the, the, the success of the smaller iPad will boost the success of the
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:04.600]   12.9 because it will always be the way to trick, trick to entice somebody to saying,
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:09.760]   well, since you, since you have $789 for the smaller one and you use it so much, why not
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:15.280]   give us $1,100 for the larger one with the, oh my God, it comes in 512 gigabytes now.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.520]   And now I don't know how to deal with the rest of my life without having 512 gigs on
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.520]   an iPad.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.520]   It's a trap.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.320]   Well, and Serenity Caldwell being certainly callable.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.440]   She immediately got two cameras out and started filming side by side of her drawing on both
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.440]   the old and the new one.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.760]   And you can actually see the difference, like the lines are tracking almost pitch perfect.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.760]   Nothing is zero latency.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.760]   I think they're down to 20 milliseconds, but it is darn close and you can do shading and
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.280]   small lines and tiny details way better.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:43.040]   It's the same Apple pencil, but you can do it way better than you could do it on the
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.040]   previous one.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:49.440]   That was such an important move because the surface pencil was something is 22.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.440]   It's 22.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.120]   Now the Apple pencil is 20.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.280]   Used to be about double that.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.280]   So it's great.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.980]   No, I'm serious.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.440]   It's great to see that kind of a horse race.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.640]   So, okay, I want Microsoft and its developers to say, okay, now let's make our pencil even
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.200]   better than apples because this will not stand.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.800]   Also, this is as an iPad fan, this is a sync up of the two models.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:14.200]   The previous iPad Pros were released about six months apart and they had different features
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.080]   that you literally, I think I said this on a Mac break weekly a year ago.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.280]   You can roll into an Apple store with all the money in the world and say, give me your
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:26.520]   finest iPad and they could not give you an answer because you had true tone on the 9.7.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:30.160]   You had fast charging and USB 3 data transfers on the 12.9.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.400]   And with these, they're the same.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.400]   They've got all the features.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.400]   It's really about the screen size.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.000]   I think it's too much rose gold on the big one, Jason.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   I'm decimate.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.960]   My expected behavior rose gold.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.520]   They think it's too much rose gold.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.720]   I think you can have none more rose gold.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.720]   I'm color blind.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.360]   So rose gold looks like gold to me.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.360]   So it's not good.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:49.520]   It's one other thing that I think I'm going to put it in the irksome category, but you
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.200]   guys can tell me how you feel.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:57.000]   Previously, the 12.9 inch had the faster USB C charging and the faster USB 3 data exchange
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   rates.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.160]   Now both of them have that.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.920]   But in order to get it, you still like the cable that comes with it will not give you
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.160]   the two times faster charging.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.160]   You have to go buy a separate cable, which is slightly less pro.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:11.240]   But even more irksome is to get the USB 3 speeds, you have to buy the adapter, the
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:17.320]   USB, sorry, the lightning to USB 3 adapter, because the cable doesn't support in the box
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:20.280]   and support USB C USB 3 and it keeps me up.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.560]   USB 3 speeds.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:26.320]   And even worse is if you do go get that lightning to USB C cable, even that does not support
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.800]   the USB 3 speeds.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.120]   You have to get the adapter.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.720]   And I think if we're going to have a proprietary lightning cable, that cable always has to
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:33.720]   be the best cable.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.720]   And it was not the best cable.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.000]   I'm going to be sad that I have it.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.600]   So give me USB 3 over a single cable.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.360]   This is like the medical disaster movie where like, oh my God, the disease has just jumped
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.360]   species.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.840]   Dungal fever is no longer is no longer a Mac only thing.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.800]   It's not infesting the iPad.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.480]   All we can do is do is do a single wall set of fire.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.400]   Last year, moving shipping dates could have justified like not being able to plug the
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.840]   brand new iPhone into my brand new MacBook Pro.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:02.520]   But it's been a year and I can't plug the brand new iPad into my brand new MacBook Pro.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:07.520]   Even the torment that's going to happen when the iPhone switches over because at some point
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.880]   the USB C thing is going to happen with all of Apple's devices.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.880]   No ports.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.320]   There's already a rumor that the new Pixel phone will have no ports.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.600]   So the iPhone's got to be not that far behind.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.600]   Good Lord.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.160]   How many, how much more portless could it be?
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.160]   And the answer is none more portless.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.160]   All portless.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.160]   They're like an Apple watch.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.160]   Just because everything's going to be completely portless.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.400]   Andy and I are going to be crying in the corner somewhere.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.960]   No ports, all storms.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.960]   Oh my God.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:35.200]   Andy mentioned something that I mentioned as the like number one rule of tech buying which
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.000]   is never to count on a future feature.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.920]   I suspect this may be why we saw these iPads now because Apple wanted to say, look, we're
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.960]   they're going to ship with iOS 10, but we're going to show you what they're going to ship
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:51.520]   with in a ball and you'll be able to get it in public on a public beta later in June.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:56.000]   And that's the iOS 11 features and you put them together and the story becomes a lot
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.240]   more exciting.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:01.440]   So first off, I suspect a lot of buyers of these new iPads are going to go to the public
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:08.960]   data and I wanted to ask all of you if you with a week's thought, if you have more things
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:16.560]   that you're excited about or curious about about the iOS 11 announcements from last week.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:20.240]   I think my thing was just shell shock and initially it looked like the iPad got all the
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.720]   goodies, but when you start delving into it, I mean the drag and drop is built in to iOS
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.720]   11.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.040]   So there's it's already surfaced in some place of the iPhone and there's all things like
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.040]   individual thread.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.600]   It just there's so much stuff in this that I think I've only gotten halfway through and
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.600]   it's been a week, Jason.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.000]   I can't imagine how much more we're going to discover.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.320]   Not only a past beta one, but just as we approach September, it is it is chock full of really
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.720]   cool stuff and we haven't even gotten into like core ML and AR kit and all the stuff
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.000]   that's really forward thinking.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.040]   There's just so much base level features that have either been fixed or tweaked or added
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.240]   that it's going to I think it really is biggest biggest iOS release ever.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.360]   Yeah, there's a lot of interesting refinements.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.840]   I mean, there's some brand new things like the files app is going to be really cool.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.640]   Once it gets, you know, all the third party services integrated and you'll be able to
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:09.400]   have one place to see all your documents, which you can do now, but then, you know,
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.280]   that's a third party app.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.080]   So sometimes they're a little limited in what they can do.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.200]   So that's going to unlock a lot of power.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:23.400]   And then there's a lot of just little refinements that are going to make things better, like
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.440]   the iMessages, getting the apps out of that drawer and putting them in a little scrollable
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.920]   thing along the bottom of the screen.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.880]   So you can actually find them and use them is going to make people actually find them
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.880]   and use them.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:39.440]   So there's a lot of I liked a lot of the improvements to things that were introduced
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.440]   in iOS 10.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.360]   Andy, what are you looking forward to?
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:48.480]   Really, I'm sure I don't know if you want to talk about watch OS later, but I'm really
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.440]   excited about the refinements they're making to watch OS.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.240]   It's gotten me to take this watch out of the box.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.080]   It's been in for the past six or seven months and actually start wearing it again.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:02.600]   But I'm really, really like things like the new control panels where I always thought
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:07.200]   that it was kind of weird that if I want to switch Wi-Fi networks for I want to disconnect
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:12.320]   from a Bluetooth device, I can't just long press on something and then it pops up and
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.840]   I can make the change.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:18.360]   I think I'm spending way too much time both on the iPhone and on the iPad having to go
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:24.080]   into settings and through that navigation in order to get there when again, 3D touch,
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:28.360]   why can't I just press and hold and you show me all the Wi-Fi networks that can tell you,
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.360]   yes, please disconnect from my phone right now because I want you to connect to this
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.240]   free network that I've encountered instead.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.320]   So hopefully we're going to see more refinements like that.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.000]   Once again, it really is about taking, we've been watching how people are using this thing.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.680]   We're not doing things based simply on style or on fashion or on we're bored with old
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.680]   design.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:49.560]   They're doing things to say here's a way to make things even better and more effective
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.480]   and that's always a great direction for anything.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.400]   I'm intrigued by your comments about watch OS and I want to come back to that but I will
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:01.800]   say before I do that one of the things that impressed me about the multitasking features
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:06.720]   in iOS 11 is that it doesn't feel like a couple of features just kind of dropped in.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:11.640]   They all work together, write these bases sort of view of the multitasking switcher and
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.480]   the rethought dock and the drag and drop.
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:18.920]   We're very clearly built together for one purpose.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.400]   That's you can say it's such a contrast with the Mac part of the demo, which is and we
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.880]   had we we some guy had an old office and we found a couple of ideas in the back of the
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:31.560]   drawer and we had an intern that we're going to fire in three weeks anyway.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.920]   So I said, well, tell you what, we're going to be paying you anyway.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.440]   Why don't you add split screen to the to the mail app and then bill us for whatever hours
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.440]   you got left.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.640]   The iOS stuff really seemed like we keep thinking about how we can just enrich this
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.440]   entire thing top to bottom.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.040]   We're not just adding random features.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:51.920]   Yeah, nor are we trying to push something right across the finish line that we so we
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.920]   can ship it.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:57.120]   So we can show it at WWDC, although a little birdie did tell me secondhand.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:01.200]   This is not an apple birdie, but that maybe this stuff was was actually pretty far along
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.680]   last year and it just didn't make it in.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.640]   And that may actually be a reason why it seems so accomplished and so polished is that it's
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.520]   not something that's just been worked on the last few months.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.680]   It is something that's been worked on for the last couple of years.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.680]   And that's good.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.600]   All the dragon drops up was kept was was specked out last year and actually I think
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.600]   was pretty close to this implementation, but you probably took a long time to get it ready
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.600]   for that.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.280]   Yeah, but it does not feel like, I mean, again, it's a developer beta.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:29.080]   I killed my iPad when I installed it on there and I had to restore it.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.800]   That's why I have an iPad just for that stuff.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:31.800]   And it's fine.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.120]   So don't try this at home yet, kids, but I will say five hours went perfectly.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.080]   One phone cannot just cannot do anything now.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.080]   So yeah, exactly.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.520]   It's still not installed if you don't need it.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:45.480]   It's a huge risk, but with that said, the multitasking stuff feels way more polished
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.320]   and stable than it should be for a first developer release.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:52.120]   It is something that they've clearly been sweating the details on and as an iPad Pro
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.400]   user, that makes me super excited.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:59.440]   I'm really keen to see if they finally share this to I can never get the hang of every
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:03.720]   app, even an Apple app that tried to do now keep you holding this and then put another
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.040]   finger here and add this to it.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:11.120]   And it could be when we have basically a multifinger or basic collecting things to drag over, I'm
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:15.840]   wondering if that will become second nature or if I'm not talking about the positive or
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.840]   negative of the feature.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.840]   I'm talking about how I use things.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.600]   3D touch is still not second nature to me.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:24.080]   It's still I can just simply long press on something or I can still do something in a
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   different way.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:29.680]   So I'm really curious to see if that gets programmed into my head the way that a right
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:35.240]   mouse click or a press and hold or a control click has been programmed into my firmware
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.240]   and how to deal with Apple devices.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:41.160]   Yeah, I'm going to want to use two hands, I think more than I used to.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:45.600]   So have you ever seen those crazy accessories where it's like it's like a strap and then
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:49.000]   like sort of a little table like you're a cigarette girl in the club, but it's for
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   your job.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.120]   I think you're just kind of at a waste level and going at it.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.680]   Maybe they'll sell like 10 or 12 of those now.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:01.080]   They have those for real estate agents who do like P a construction people who do like
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.200]   PDF stuff and fill in doctors on the go.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:08.280]   But it reminds me of CBS was monstrously subsidized by Microsoft for a while and they had a bunch
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.640]   of shows including cop shows where they were using iPads and they switched over to the
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.480]   surface and I remember it because when they had the iPads they were holding in one hand
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.080]   and doing things on the other and then we switched to the surface.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.360]   I literally heard them getting out of the car, setting down the keyboard, putting the
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.360]   tablet on top of it.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:26.040]   Meanwhile, running away down the street, getting it up and then we're going to get them
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.480]   and then the guy was already gone.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.680]   And now I have that feeling as much as I love this implementation, it is a two handed
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:34.800]   implementation you can drag and drop with one hand while you're doing all these four
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.280]   finger pinches and swipes and zooms and opening up dialogues and that.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.280]   But that requires second hand.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.320]   So I'm going to be the guy now who's putting my iPad down on the trunk of the car.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.640]   All I suspect is running away and I only have myself to blame.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:50.860]   Yeah, I like it because the idea that it doesn't have to be used by everybody and it is a
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.640]   pro feature essentially and it is a broken part of the metaphor.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.640]   Right, Susie?
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:43:01.160]   You wouldn't be able like, why can't I use one hand to move this thing while I swipe
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.600]   in the springboard with the other?
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.400]   It's like, of course you should be able to do that.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.160]   And if people don't learn how to do that, then that's fine.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.160]   They just won't do it.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:13.160]   But as a person who spends a lot of time in iOS, it's like I love the idea of being able
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:17.280]   to do that when I'm in a two handed context or if we all start wearing a little sandwich
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.440]   board iPad tables, which could be a trend.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.440]   It could happen.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.800]   Mac trackpad gestures have just always been one handed.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.120]   So it'll be an adjustment, but I'm here for it.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:30.160]   Yeah, it's a little Tom Cruisey, a little different.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.160]   Back to the origins.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.480]   Yeah, but so Andy, lay it on me.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:39.400]   I was not, I use an Apple Watch every day and I didn't really lean forward in my seat
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.480]   too much with the watch OS announcements, but you apparently did.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:46.160]   So tell me what was so interesting about watch OS for you.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:53.280]   The move from, it's refinement as hey, it started off as it's an iPhone for your wrist.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.560]   It's like I don't want an iPhone on my wrist.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.760]   I want like a handy set of features that are relevant to this.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:03.200]   And now they've moved a lot of, they've made the application switching a lot simpler.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:10.120]   I still feel as though even a number of iterations later, I just want to go back to the app I
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:15.080]   was just using before I had to swipe away from it to get to that one task I wanted to
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.440]   do before getting back to the clock.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.680]   Now it really seems simple as swipe one way.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.320]   Here's the, here's the thing that you wanted to get to swipe back and now you've got a
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.520]   wristwatch again.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:29.640]   I really love the idea of just as simple and obvious as let's make the music app kick
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:30.720]   butt.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.400]   Now that we know that people love this as a fitness watch, let's make it a pleasant
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.000]   experience to play music on this thing.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:43.240]   So it's not just grudgingly, we will give you if we must one playlist and you're so
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.720]   lucky we're letting you have a playlist.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.560]   I mean, it's such a stupid idea.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.640]   You're such children sometimes, okay fine, we'll let you have a playlist.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.560]   And now it's like, no, we've got multiple playlists, great, have multiple playlists.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.560]   Hey, how about automatic playlists about like recent music?
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.000]   We will like that you do too.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.080]   How about you have a couple of favorite albums that are not playlists, but they're albums
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.600]   you like, great, put that on the watch as well.
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:07.160]   To how about you have a playlist that you would like to listen to while you work out
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:10.280]   and different playlists for different types of workouts.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:14.520]   It's not, and it's not that I technically do a lot of, you know, like crossfit training
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.880]   with this thing on my wrist.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:21.000]   I am a more, I'm more deliberate constitutional walk sort of, sort of, exercise.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.960]   But the idea of why is it making it so hard to do something that's such a natural fit,
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.600]   especially it's 93 degrees here in New England right now.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:33.320]   I took my walk and I didn't even necessarily want to take my phone with me because my phone
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.880]   is the big, the big screen one.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:39.960]   But because I've got the AirPods, which works so well alone with the with the watch.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:43.880]   And now because I have like my one favorite playlist on here, I haven't upgraded to the
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.920]   beta yet. It's just such a natural thing to do.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:51.880]   I think that everything that they do to make this more of a standalone device where hey,
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.800]   if you have your phone, iPhone in your pocket, it'll be even better.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:00.640]   But even just as a standalone device that's even just, if you're just competing with the
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:04.840]   best fit bit, the best Garmin watch out there, it will kick that things.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:08.920]   But even if you don't necessarily have access to a watch, that's what's going to lead this
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:15.000]   device into the next level of utility. When they say that this has to be good in and
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.080]   of itself has to be good to someone who doesn't care about phone apps. It just has to be good.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:23.800]   It has to develop its own identity. And to me, what I was seeing in iOS 11 in the new version
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:29.080]   of watch OS, I'm seeing that kind of new range of thought to saying let's pretend that this is,
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:33.880]   let's raise the pirate flag over the watch OS building and say that we don't care about you
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:38.360]   people who are doing iPhones. We don't care about you people doing iOS. We will do things that make
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.800]   your device irrelevant if we have to because we are watch people,
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:47.160]   the arrest because we have dragons. It also lays the groundwork for a future bit of watch hardware
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:51.240]   that is inevitable, whether it comes this year or next year or in some future year,
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.480]   that is more independent and has some cellular connectivity in it. So you can completely leave
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:59.080]   the iPhone at home without worrying about missing a call and you've got to have the software to
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:03.720]   support it. You know, you can't say, well, you can go for a run, but we can't bring any music with
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:08.040]   you. So sorry about that. It needs to get more self-sufficient. This is a column in my
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:13.880]   to-do list. So I'll make this really, really short. I really think that the way to really elevate
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:18.600]   this watch is to make it as self-contained as possible so that not only does it make it a
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:22.440]   better and unique experience, but also so that guess what? Got an Android phone? We don't care.
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:27.640]   Use it. You want to sync it to an iPad? We don't care. Use it. Just write one simple companion app
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:31.960]   that doesn't assume that I want to be able to share apps between these two devices. Just sell this
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:38.840]   to people who've got $250 for a really a really cool watch a because this is this is a really cool
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:46.760]   watch in and of itself and B or B or two want to spend two or $250 on a truly premium fitness
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:52.120]   watch that is eminently practical and attractive. I think that that's what it's I think the Apple
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:56.120]   Watch is an Earth orbit. It needs to let off that booster that will send it into lunar orbit.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:01.000]   And I think that making it into an independent device that says if you bring it within Wi-Fi
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.360]   contact of a trusted device that will offload your fitness data, that's good. We don't care.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:09.640]   That's how that's how you'll get your updates. We'll be we're good with that.
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:13.080]   That's what Apple needs to do with this. I'm so excited that we'll move in that direction.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:17.240]   Well, you heard of your first folks in a future column, Andy and I co-predict that the Apple
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:22.680]   Watch is going into space. I should hold that back. All right. My social media game is totally
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:28.280]   not on point. So much more to talk about and we will because there's more show, but first another
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:34.520]   message from the ghostly visage of Leo Laporte. Leo, where are you? He's not dead. He's not
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:38.760]   that's fine. He's fine. As far as we know, it might be. We'll get back to the show in a moment,
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:46.360]   but first I want to tell you about my web host, not just mine, WordPress hosts 27% of all the
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:52.600]   websites in the world. I've been a WordPress user. I first set up my WordPress site in early,
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:59.720]   the early 2000s. I moved my blog to WordPress, loved it for years. I admit I left for another,
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:05.720]   you know, I saw a good looking site over there and I briefly had a little fling, but I realized,
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:09.960]   no, I love WordPress. This time though, I went back to not hosting it for myself,
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:14.360]   but WordPress.com and I love it for a couple of reasons. First of all, they do the hosting
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:21.400]   which makes it, by the way, more affordable, frankly. They also do the security and the patching
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:26.680]   automatically. Everything's up to date. They've got great service and support. I never have,
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:30.840]   used to be when I was hosting it myself, I'd have questions and nobody would ask
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:36.280]   or have to search forms or whatever. Now I go online and they're happiness specialists.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:41.560]   They are fast. We'll help you get it going beautifully. I was looking for a template that
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:47.960]   had some features like my screen at Leo Laporte.com. It's a full bleed picture, right? It rotates.
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:51.960]   So I said, "Well, what do you recommend?" She said, "Oh, 2017, you'll love it." I do.
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:56.440]   It's a great template. They have hundreds of them. The thing about WordPress is right for
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:02.360]   any kind of website, whether it's a blog like me or a business. You don't have to have any
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:07.960]   experience building a website. They can guide you through the process. The other thing I like
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:13.240]   about WordPress.com is there's a community there. There's a front page, there's a follow button.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:17.640]   Half a million people now follow my WordPress blog. I've only been back for a couple of months.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:22.920]   That's like blew me away. That means every time I post and I do notice the difference,
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:28.440]   I get all this traffic. Oh, great analytics. I've never seen better analytics. You know exactly
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:35.560]   what people like and don't like. The comment moderation is fantastic. You get to set it the way
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:40.360]   you want it. I can go on and on, but you'll see why more websites run on WordPress than any
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.880]   other platform, including some of the biggest public, Paul Therat's site, Therat.com runs
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:49.880]   on WordPress. Many publications. I love WordPress. Get started today with 15% off any new purchase

[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:10.600]   Thank you, WordPress, for so much, for making my blog sing and for supporting MacBreak Weekly.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:16.280]   Now, back to the show. Thank you, Leo. He's fine. He's fine. He's on vacation. This is a perfectly
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:21.320]   normal thing. It's perfectly normal. Why? What we're saying is that he's in a much, much better
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:28.760]   place. Yes, which is the Galapagos Island. He has a piece. This show was called Mac Break Weekly,
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:34.200]   and I thought that we should actually just admit that Mac is in the name and talk about the Mac
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:39.880]   a little bit. We have Mac OS High Sierra announced last week and a whole bunch of new Macs, including
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:47.080]   updates to the MacBook, the MacBook Pro, the iMac, and the announcement six months early of the iMac
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:53.320]   Pro. I want to start with Renee, because Renee has actually laid hands on many of these products,
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:57.480]   the ones that exist and has reviewed them. I can't look up the iMac. Look at that. Look at that.
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:05.080]   You show off you. Renee, tell us, these are not the most, I mean, this is a gesture by Apple to say
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:09.640]   that they're going to try to keep, I read it at least, as they're going to try to keep the
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:13.960]   Macs and especially the MacBook Pro updated a little more often than maybe it used to. It's been
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:19.080]   about nine months since the last MacBook Pro, the introduction of the Touch Bar, and we've got some
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:24.600]   new chips in here. That's exciting. Is there something exciting about these products in general,
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.880]   or is it just that they've got the new Intel chips? That's a good thing. Exciting error?
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:33.480]   Yeah. Yeah. For something exciting error. Apple is sort of like, there's a lot to the
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:37.320]   Mac story that is Apple's own doing, but there's also a lot of it that's Intel. Last year,
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:42.200]   when they put out the new MacBook Pro, it came with Skylake and not the current generation
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:45.800]   KB Lake. That's because Intel simply had not made the quad core version that Apple wants
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:50.840]   to the MacBook Pro, nor they made the one with the iOS, what they're calling now,
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:55.240]   Iris Plus Graphics that Apple wanted. They had to go with last year's model and it makes them
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:59.640]   look behind as much for their own reasons, but also they're waiting on components. They don't
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:05.240]   control their own chip destiny the way they do on iOS. That Apple 8 series chips when Apple needs
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:11.400]   it to for a reason. A few months later now, we have the KB Lake versions. KB Lake is interesting
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:15.320]   for Intel in a number of ways, partially because it was really hard to get to 14 nanometer and
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:21.800]   instead of going from Broadwell to Skylake and then on to Canon Lake, we now have this KB Lake,
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:27.560]   and I think a coffee lake step in between. KB Lake isn't a die shrink and it's also not a
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:32.760]   giant architecture leap. It's more like a little architecture hop and it means there's better
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:36.520]   base frequencies, better turbo frequencies, which means it'll go faster. You still have
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:40.680]   thermal limits, so it might ramp down faster, but you should be able to burst nicely when you need
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:47.720]   it. The bigger story is that it now has 10-bit H.265, which I refuse to call HEVCA, because it
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:53.640]   sounds funny, baked into it, which means that if you are doing encoding or decoding of H.265,
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:54:00.920]   which is one of the big standards, not the Google one, but the other big standard for 4K HDR video,
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:06.040]   then this will do it with hardware acceleration, which will spare your Mac from otherwise burning
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.960]   a lot of cycles, trying to do video while you're trying to do everything else. There's some nice
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:14.440]   things thrown in, like the MacBook gets a speed boost. The iMac now stands 10-bit color to the
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:18.280]   Tcon. It's still an 8-bit panel, an updated one, but you're getting at least 10 bits to the Tcon
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:23.080]   right now. It's all part of this continual evolution towards better, more colorful, deeper
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:28.200]   displays, and sort of the hardware to support it. So they're not revolutionary Macs, there was no
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:33.000]   big redesigns, but they did make every Mac that got it. As Suzy said, RIP MacBook Air,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.240]   it did make every Mac that got it better than I thought it would. It was a better bump than I
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:46.280]   thought Cable Lake was capable of achieving. All right, Suzy, are you buying a Mac? Did we
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.480]   talk about you maybe buying a Mac at some point here? What are you thinking about these new ones?
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:54.040]   Does it change your mind? Yeah, I mean, I am in the Mac market. I had
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:58.280]   loners from Apple when I was at Mac world, and now I don't.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:06.840]   So yeah, I'm using a mid-2011 MacBook Air right now, and the fans on, and everyone's sad. So
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:11.880]   yeah, I am in the Mac market. The problem is I don't like the new keyboards. So I was really
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:16.440]   interested in the Verge said that the new Mac keyboard is a little better, but not enough to
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:21.320]   convince the doubters. That's me. I'm the doubters. Everyone's like, oh, you'll get used to it. Even
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:26.680]   Apple kept telling me I'd get used to it. And it's been, I think, two years since the little Mac book
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:34.600]   came out. And the Macbook Pro keyboards from 2016 are supposedly a little better. There's like the
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:39.960]   second generation of this new butterfly switch keyboard that you hate. I still don't like it.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:45.240]   So the MacBook Air has a really nice keyboard, but it just seems like a shame to be spending that
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:50.120]   kind of money on two year old technology, although it would still be a huge bump from what I have now.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:56.040]   So I'm not really sure what I want to do. I wrote about, for I'm more about how iOS 11 might let me,
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:00.600]   you know, take my sweet time to come up with an answer because I can do so much better work on my
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:06.120]   iPad now. But yeah, I really do need a new Mac. So I don't know, maybe the MacBook Pro escape.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:10.120]   That's, that seems to be the, that's one of the, the dark courses front running right now.
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:15.000]   Which they cut by $100, which is nice. That's the Touch Barless MacBook Pro 13 inch, which I
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.200]   like calling the MacBook Escape because it has an escape key. You see, it's very clever.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:24.680]   I'm with you. I'm with you, Susie. I have a MacBook Air 11 inch and it's an i7
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:28.680]   model from a couple of years ago. It's still pretty awesome and it's got the keyboard that I'm
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:33.960]   much more used to. And maybe this is why Apple is still selling MacBook Airs. It's because so many
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:37.240]   of us are like all the ports and a good keyboard. Well, they can't get MacBook down.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:41.400]   Diner bucks either. I mean, I think that's a big deal. Yeah, exactly right. Yeah, the MacBook
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:45.240]   still starts at $12.99, which is the same price as a MacBook Pro entry level now.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:50.040]   Yeah, exactly right. Which is, I mean, I have been saying, and I know you guys have probably
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:54.280]   been saying for a while now that the successor to the MacBook Air appears to be split. It's the
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:58.680]   MacBook if you care about thin and light, but don't care about performance as much. And it's that
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:05.080]   the Touch Barless MacBook Escape, essentially the MacBook Pro, if you care more about the,
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:09.400]   the performance than you do about the thinness and the lightness, and now they start at the same price.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.200]   So it's not 99, but... Where's that? I have a phone. You're a cut-a-reco-teachy.
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:20.040]   Yeah, exactly. So I don't know. It's an interesting place to Mac. Andy, did you read it the way I did
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:26.040]   that this is in some ways Apple sort of walking the walk after they talked the talk and that press,
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:29.400]   you know, that little press round table they did a few weeks ago like, all right, we actually
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:32.520]   are going to update our Pro computers in less than a one-year cycle.
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:38.600]   Nice to see new modern CPUs. I think that it makes the MacBook nothing.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:43.240]   I have to make your deal. I will give you a free unlimited license to use MacBook Nothing if I
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:48.280]   can similarly use MacBook Escape. I didn't invent Escape and so please use it with my compliments
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:53.320]   as the person who didn't invent it. Well, then I'll give you credit and say that you didn't tell
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:59.480]   me that it was someone else's and that it was useful. Anyway, it was so easy. So yeah, I think
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:03.960]   that the MacBook Nothing is a much better machine right now. I'm glad they improved the keyboard.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:08.280]   If this is this keyboard makes complete sense with the MacBook Nothing because it is a
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:12.760]   delightfully designed and built machine. The idea that you have this thing that's
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:19.160]   marginally thicker than an iPad, but it is a full bore Macintosh. Every choice that they
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:22.360]   Apple made makes total sense for this thing. I'm glad to see it get it a better keyboard
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:28.520]   and a better CPU. As for the improvements to the MacBook Pro, still a piece of crap keyboard so
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:33.640]   I couldn't care less. Ouch. So you think the regular MacBook keyboard is better than the MacBook Pro?
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:39.080]   Not anymore. It's the same now. Yeah, I thought there were some more. It's got the butterfly
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:45.560]   generation to butterfly switches. It's still got these zero-key travel. It's still a very
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:51.400]   better version of crap. The thing is, I won't go through this the fourth or fifth time. I'm sure
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:57.720]   I've gone through this so many times on the show. On the MacBook Nothing, having a nearly zero-trail
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:01.800]   key travel keyboard makes sense. There's a real point to it. They're trying to make this thing as
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:07.480]   ridiculously thin as possible because it's for people who want something as portable as they can
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:11.880]   possibly make it. They should be willing to make some trade-offs for it for a MacBook Pro. The
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:18.760]   fact that I can give Apple $4,000 and still have a keyboard that's marginally more comfortable to
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:25.720]   type on than what was on the membrane keyboard of an Atari 400 in 1980. That's not okay. It's garbage
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:30.120]   and it's not okay. That being said, I heard the best analogy ever at WWDC. It was a developer who
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:33.720]   had one of the new MacBook Pros and there was a problem with the keyboard and he had to take it in
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:36.680]   and he didn't like the keyboard. He didn't like it at all. He preferred his old keyboard.
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:40.200]   Or so he said, and he took it to the Apple store and he was using his old MacBook Pro.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:44.120]   And he started, he just looked at me and he said, "This feels like typing through mashed potatoes."
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:47.000]   And that was just the best description I'd ever heard of the difference, at least the
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.880]   difference I feel between the old keyboards, which have those Lucy Gucci scissor switches and the
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:56.280]   new switches. I think the butterfly too, especially on the smaller MacBook because it is so small,
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:59.640]   do make a slight difference. I was talking about this with Dieter Bonin, we're trying to figure
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.920]   out exactly what it is. I mean, that's an opinion. I think it's better.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:07.400]   And I understand that it goes to that voice. It's obviously an opinion, but nobody has a choice.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:14.760]   It's such a divisive choice. It's not like the difference between the 2014 and the 2015.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.960]   I agree with all of that. I think you should have a choice. I'm saying that it's not garbage.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.840]   It's for people who like it, it's in a phenomenal keyboard.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.240]   As a choice, it's a terrible, terrible design choice.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:29.800]   I am team Andy. I don't like that keyboard at all. Also, nerds arguing about keyboards.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:34.040]   Yes, you're watching the Android Listing to a podcast about technology on the internet.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:41.480]   It's a thing that we do. But to Andy's point, Apple, you can't, I have an iMac. I have a crazy
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:46.040]   mechanical keyboard attached to it, right? But the laptops have to be for everybody,
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:52.520]   because you can't swap in another keyboard for your MacBook Pro. It is the one that comes with it,
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:56.520]   is the one that you're going to be using when it's on your lap. Let's be realistic about it.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:01.080]   So I get what Andy's saying there. The keyboard is the same between those two models.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:06.040]   I get Andy's point that you need it on the ultra-thin model. You could have put in something
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:11.480]   like the Magic Keyboard on the other model, and they chose not to. And I will admit that that's
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.240]   one of the reasons I am sticking with that MacBook Air keyboard is because it doesn't feel like
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.920]   mashed potatoes to me. It feels pretty good. And they didn't switch on the new iMac keyboard.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.200]   The new iMac keyboard with the numeric thing is still the same as the Magic Keyboard. So they
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.520]   haven't gone to MacBook keys on the desktops yet. I'm a little surprised because it would seem
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.760]   like in the past when Apple's come up with a new keyboard style, it has stuck it everywhere.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.000]   And that hasn't happened this time. So no touch bars, no touch bars on the new iMac keyboard,
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.280]   no touch bars on the new MacBook. I miss Touch ID more. I really have gotten used to Touch ID.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.440]   And neither of those would have told me. I should have Touch ID. That would be great.
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:47.160]   That would be good. Totally. Yeah, I want Touch ID more than I want to Touch Bar at this point.
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.400]   But definitely so. I wonder, you know, we have these arguments out here. I'm sure.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.000]   The other point you're using an iPad is a laptop alternative. You can use any keyboard you like.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.400]   That's true. So it's a point for the iPad. That's true. I got a Magic Keyboard right here, in fact.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:03.880]   Yeah, look at that. What about the Logitech, Jason? Yeah, I use that one.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:09.000]   There are many keyboards available to attach to your iPad, as Susie said, and they're great.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.520]   I can even touch the iPad's are now more flexible keyboard computers than the Mac.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:17.560]   iPad is a better keyboard experience. That is the advantage of not having a hardware keyboard
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:22.600]   permanently attached to your device, right? Yeah. The only thing I just have to say is that
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:27.960]   don't if you like a flat keyboard, great. If you try it and you don't have an issue with it,
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.640]   great. I'm not opposed to someone being happy with what they're happy with.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:36.840]   All I'm saying is that do not for one half of a second accept anybody telling you,
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:42.200]   you will get used to it. You won't. And for $2,000. No, I'm serious. I don't know anybody who
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:47.720]   was like issued a MacBook Pro. They really have to use it six months later. Do you like the keyboard?
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:52.200]   No, I'm used to it, but I would still rather type on anything else. So I'm saying you've got you've
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:57.880]   got to Apple has this awesome return policy two weeks. You don't even have to you can just say that
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:02.440]   I saw an episode of CSI Miami that I didn't like. And for that reason, I'm returning this MacBook.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:07.240]   They will give your money back. They don't that's a good enough reason. So don't believe her. Do not
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:12.280]   keep this this MacBook for two weeks and one hour thinking that eventually you will like it because
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.320]   you will not get over that keyboard. If you don't write to Apple and tell it like right,
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:18.920]   right? Apple's exact team tell them what you fail because you know Apple has backtracked in the past.
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:23.560]   Yeah, I suspect there are some inner divisions at Apple given the fact that the magic keyboard
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:27.800]   is still available that there are probably some debates and they have more place to do.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:33.640]   These computers. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, and they use them every day too and they are frustrated by
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.320]   it. There's probably somebody inside Apple who's got a MacBook Pro with the old style keyboard
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:42.760]   of the magic keyboard on it as a prototype boy, which they love ammunition if you can give it to them.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:46.600]   Yeah, they just and that they're going to use that prototype forever because they never made it.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:53.400]   One of those things that's out there. Let's let's talk about the iPad the iMac Pro for a minute,
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.800]   not like we've learned anything new, I think in the last week since they announced it because
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:03.320]   it's another one of these six month out products. But I'm curious. So does that mean that they have
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:07.480]   to ship five before New Year to qualify as a six month out product like with the Mac Pro?
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:12.040]   Is that is that what they have to do Renee is they have to have them in a movie theater in
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:17.000]   Los Angeles or New York for about a week and then they're eligible for an Oscar. I think that's how
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:23.560]   it works. So the iMac Pro by all accounts was designed at a point where the Mac Pro was going
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:28.600]   to be killed. That is that seems to be the story and then they changed their mind and they held that
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:33.000]   meeting and they told everybody who was assembled at that meeting of journalists that they were
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.040]   going to make a Mac Pro after all but they also had this amazing iMac coming and that was as it
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:43.480]   turns out foreshadowing for the iMac Pro. So since we don't know a lot more about the iMac Pro it's
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.360]   coming out in six months it's going to start at five thousand dollars you're going to be able to
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:51.800]   spec it up to probably into the fifteen seventeen thousand dollar range if you want to if you want
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:58.200]   to max it out it is a you can spend a lot of money on this thing but I'm curious about the the the
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:04.200]   kind of the elephant in the room the shadow that is is conspicuous by its presence but we can't
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:09.720]   see anything about it which is what's the Mac Pro if this is the iMac Pro what is that Mac Pro next
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:15.720]   to your what can it do to be different than the than the iMac Pro is how does it differentiate itself
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:19.560]   thermal core and two graphics cards Jason you'll love it it'll look like a cylinder no that was
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:26.440]   a lot I got nothing I thought I would love it more thunderbolt three hours yeah really it's like
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:31.960]   how do you differentiate let's assume that the iMac Pro will not be or the Mac Pro will not be
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:37.320]   literally the guts of the iMac Pro stuffed in a box without a monitor and will actually be
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:42.920]   different in some way and give pros who are not satisfied with the iMac Pro something to be
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:47.400]   excited about doesn't it have to be the modularity I mean because like this this iMac Pro is going
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:51.160]   to be phenomenal it's going to have zion cores it's going to have you know ECC RAM it's going to
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:54.840]   have everything that you want in a heavy duty machine but iMacs are not the most serviceable
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:58.520]   not the most not the most upgradable machines in the world and if you know two years from now
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:02.280]   even a year from now you want to take out that AMD Radeon card and put in a new one
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:06.040]   on an iMac that's really hard like unless you live next door to iFixit it's really really hard
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.600]   you have your own set of suction cups really hard and if apple does do what they sort of hinted at
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:15.080]   doing and making a modular Mac Pro then it could have everything it could be identical to this in
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:20.840]   every way same zion CPUs same AMD graphics same you see RAM but give you the ability to open it up
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:24.840]   like you did the original cheese grater Mac and just swap out those components and i think while a
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:29.000]   lot of people will love that 5k display there'll also be a lot of people who just want to have a
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.920]   computer that they can upgrade as as time goes forward and they'll gravitate more towards the tower
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:38.840]   expandability does does make a lot of sense Susie what do you think the the Mac Pro should be
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:45.640]   if this is the iMac Pro yeah i agree with Renee i mean people still hold on to and love the Mac Pro
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:52.600]   towers and even the g5 towers i have a friend who still uses one every day so and it's because
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:59.320]   they were so easy to open up and do things with and and that's that that's what pros want at least
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:04.520]   a segment of pros who aren't going to be best served by the iMac Pro so i completely copy Renee's answer
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:10.520]   Andy any other thoughts about the what the Mac Pro might be? Jason i want to first tell you what
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:15.640]   an honor and a blessing it is that you have chosen me to be on this panel today your hair is wonderful
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:22.440]   sorry yeah i think i think the key to the mac pro line also the macbook pro line but especially
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:29.800]   the mac pro line is if your name is gielermo then let gielermo be gielermo if i should have picked
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:35.400]   an easier pronounced name that's how joe let joe be joe if joe wants to be able to swap in drives
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:39.400]   joe should be able to swap in drives if joe wants to be able to have a have a different gpu
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:43.960]   joe should have a different or jane should be able to have a different gpu the pro line is not about
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:49.880]   someone on a keynote saying don't worry you'll get used to it this is not what you wanted
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:54.920]   but believe me in three years time you will have a machine that's three years older and you will
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:58.680]   have forgotten how mad you are that you had to spend four thousand dollars on something that
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:02.920]   wasn't quite right for you so there are different ways to articulate that i think that the iMac Pro is
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:07.720]   a nice it's it's what i think i think that it's the best thing they could have done quickly because
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:11.240]   obviously for what they want to do for a more conventional desktop is going to take a lot more
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:18.280]   time to figure out and to build but so long as it lets me walk out of there for three four five six
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:23.400]   thousand dollars lighter but having a machine that i know will do what i wanted to do as opposed to
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:28.920]   one that demands that i adjust my workflow and my preferences to the limitations of this device
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:33.480]   then they're definitely on the right track yeah i other speculation that i've heard um
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:38.360]   rack mountability is something that people actually made uh inserts that allowed the
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:42.840]   existing mac pro the trash can to be rack mountable which is a trick right because it's a cough
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:48.680]   alexylic cylinder and um and also i've heard and i don't know enough about the way that the
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:53.640]   zion processors work but i've also heard people suggest that stacking processors multiple
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:09:00.040]   multiple zions multiple gpu's stuff that the iMac can't really do but that you could do in a in
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:04.760]   something with a more expandable uh case and with room for cooling and things like that but
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:09.000]   right i mean but in the end and also i mean like just to throw this out there uh we still really
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.760]   don't know what this deal is with apple and in vidia i mean in vidia is a big powerful company if
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:16.680]   they say you can't use metal or they say you have to use kuda cores and apple doesn't like that
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:20.440]   you probably won't find in vidia cores and the products apple nakes but conceivably now that
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:24.680]   in vidia is making drivers and you can maybe put them in that new e gpu box that that you can get
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:29.640]   for developers right now maybe you'd be able to buy whatever apple whenever radion amd chip apple
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.560]   puts sorry board apple puts inside the mac pro but then take it out and put in whatever the
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.480]   successor to the ten eighty is if you want that if you want to have it just a cool if you want to
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:42.280]   do the kind of work that requires a lot of kuda cores for example yeah that'd be a huge plus so i
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:46.760]   hope that that is what we get is the mac pro will be something that has the i feel like it has the
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:53.160]   freedom now that it doesn't have to be um all things to all pros because the iMac pro exists and
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:58.680]   instead it can be yeah a little weird and different and and take advantage of the fact that it's
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:03.720]   not attached to a screen and it is not doesn't need to be super compact and i think pros will be
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.880]   very happy if that's the way that apple goes so we're going to take a break we've got a little
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:13.480]   bit more we're going to talk about some podcast news that happen at wwdc we're going to talk about

[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.960]   try and now back to the show thanks leo all right podcast news now let me tell you a little story
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:41.320]   2005 was the year when apple really embraced podcasting they rolled it into the iTunes store
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:47.160]   as this special corner where you could subscribe to podcast they added it into iTunes podcasting
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:53.080]   is really grown in the last few years reached a lot of mainstream appeal with things like cereal
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:13:02.200]   and here's a funny thing the world's most popular player for podcast stuff is the podcast app on iOS
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:07.720]   run by apple so apple's investment back in 2005 before there even was an iphone has paid off in
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:12.680]   the sense that apple controls a huge part of the podcast market and since podcasts are driven
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:19.400]   by what we call an open standard which is an RSS feed that apple has been building extensions
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:25.160]   into that feed over the years and then other podcast developers support them so apple made
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:29.240]   some big changes that they announced this week that they're going to put in the podcast app and
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:34.600]   iOS 11 and presumably into iTunes as well in a new version a bunch of new extensions to do
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:40.440]   things that we've learned about podcast in the last few years like seasons and more readable
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:45.480]   episode titles and descriptions instead of packing all your information in one title tag which
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:50.840]   I'm guilty of and I think many podcasters are lots of interesting stuff on that end and then
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:56.600]   also on the analytics end they're going to actually gather data from user behavior as they watch
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:03.320]   podcasts or listen to podcasts because you can't watch them on on the apple podcast app can you
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:09.240]   or maybe you can anyway analytics so now we only know if you download the podcast we don't know if
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:14.680]   you listen to it apple's going to tell podcasters if you listened how long you listened when you
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:22.280]   skipped lots of information anonymized aggregated but more data than we've ever had before about
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:28.360]   podcast rene richy you're quoted in my article about this because you were sitting in the room I
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:33.160]   think for this session what do you think about all this I think leo is finally going to know that
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:37.240]   whenever I talk the listenership just drops to zero and I'm going to get a first turn phone call
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:42.360]   come this September and we'll find out that kac list is the most popular podcast or on podcast
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:46.440]   ad app and all sounds going to be upside yeah no I think it's really really great and they sort of
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:50.120]   broke it apart because there's a new podcast app as well it's going to really show off sort of
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:54.120]   the same new design language that apple debuted in music it won't have all the machine learning and
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:59.000]   the recommendations and the you know I can't see what Jason is doing with podcasts like what he's
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.560]   listening to yet but I'm sure that's coming because they have a shared foundation and then they sort
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:07.640]   of got into this really interesting stuff where they did they did realize that back in the day you
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:11.960]   know when leo started it was very much episodic like in reverse chronological it was like a blog
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:16.120]   post in audio form and people would subscribe and they'd want the latest breaking news in the
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:20.840]   latest breaking episode and now thanks to things like cereal things like the incomparable you know
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:24.840]   all these things that have sort of a more seasonal approach people sometimes want to start off with
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:29.080]   the latest season and the first episode of that season and they want to listen to it the way that
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:33.560]   it was actually broadcast and these tags give you that option and they give you options to do things
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:38.040]   like trailers which up until now we're just regular episodes and things like bonus material which I
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:41.480]   know you've been doing you know people like dan and dan benjaman did after dark for a long time
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:44.920]   exactly and all of that was just crammed into feats and now all of it is going to be a first-class
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:49.880]   citizen and that's super exciting yeah a short version of the podcasters really we're given like a
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:55.480]   few boxes to fill in and we started filling them in with anything we could like bonus material or
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:16:01.800]   season numbers and and we were we were using what was there and what apple has done here is redesign
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:07.640]   the podcast app to support a richer data set and if you support the richer data set like the listener
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:12.840]   experience becomes a lot more sensible which is great and because apple is so dominant in this
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:17.160]   every podcast provider is going to adopt these new tags and the nice thing about it is they're
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:22.600]   not proprietary every podcast app can adopt them too so if you listen to overcast or pocketcast
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:27.560]   or any of the other third-party apps i will bet you that they will support these tags too and so
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:31.880]   everybody's experience is going to get better with native seasons and these built-in support
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:36.680]   for teasers so like a teaser about an upcoming season doesn't show up as an episode it shows up
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:41.800]   as a teaser inside the season a lot of really nice stuff on apple tivy still can't figure out by the
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:47.400]   way yeah it's well you know i i hope i have hopes that this law will get out get worked out and apple
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:52.040]   get its season structure straight across all media but you know i can dare to dream what do you
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:56.440]   think about the uh the statistics stuff Andy you make some of your living doing uh talking on
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:02.120]   on on the internet uh is that exciting news or or does the privacy issue of uh aggregating
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:08.680]   people's listing data trouble you uh well i i am a lofty angelic being i i live
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:14.600]   exclusively on the on the editorial side of the paywall so but i but i do know that i have i have
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:21.720]   not a few friends who do podcasting as a business and so you can't really you don't know how you're
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:26.840]   really how you're really uh making your listeners happy until you find out what who your listeners
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:31.560]   are and what they actually want so more data is sometimes it's more data but in the right hands
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:37.800]   it's a it's a really blessed thing and also it just as a podcast listener uh metadata my goodness i
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:43.240]   almost think that i would much rather have uh hardware that's six years old but a metadata
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:49.480]   system that is absolutely current than the top of the line listening device but you get to know what
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:54.360]   the name of the podcast is and an episode number and that's it because it's all these problems that
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:59.000]   we've been talking about that i just want to know here is an entire story arc of this of this entire
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.360]   podcast or i want to know i want to be able to quickly go the way that i'm using podcast right now
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:09.160]   is i used it used to be just here my favorite podcast please download every episode and if i
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:13.160]   have time i'll listen to them but i have too many favorite podcasts now so i need the ability just
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:17.560]   simply it now i don't download anything whenever i need a pot whenever i'm going off for a walk or
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:21.880]   something or you're taking a flight i have to pick and choose that that fresh air looks good that
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.600]   fresh air looks like it's going to be super depressing that fresh air is a repeat oh my god i got to
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:30.840]   listen that fresh air ooh another fresh air about how tens of millions of people are going to die
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.360]   early because they're okay i don't want to listen to that one you know that that's that's how it goes
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:38.680]   and looks like all these different changes are going to make it easier for me as a podcast listener
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:44.360]   to have a great time and because apple has this ability as the as the enormous gorilla of the
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:50.200]   industry to say we are going to have this standard going forward and maybe the rest of the university
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.800]   would kind of like to consider jumping on board it because it would be a good thing
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:19:00.040]   susie what uh what do you think about podcast you listen to podcast don't you i do i do listen
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:06.520]   podcasts um right now i use pocket casts and i really like it but i'm wondering if a lot of like
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:13.080]   podcast power listeners are going to suddenly abandon their awesome third party pod catcher apps
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:18.680]   so they can jump into apples podcast app and be like the Nielsen families of podcasting
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:25.880]   and be like i want my listening data and my habits in that anonymized data set because um you know
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:32.120]   if i listen to overcast and and these pod these pod cast makers don't know you know how will it
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:37.320]   be tailored right to me so i'd imagine that's bad news for the third party podcast apps i'd
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.400]   imagine it'll be a good enough sample that it won't matter but i do i think that's an effect that
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:47.480]   might happen psychologically i also have to wonder if um people are going to start feeling like well
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:52.840]   i really want to skip this ad but then they'll know and that'll be bad for this podcast i love
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:56.680]   i got the opposite i got a lot of mean tweets i got people saying i'm not gonna listen to you now
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:03.160]   they'll know it's 400 it's like it's like as it 2x was that does that count oh that's a that's a
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:07.160]   that's an interesting question i wonder if we'll know like average uh listen speed
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:12.280]   so there's a lot of stuff here um i i did hear from several people who said they don't like the
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:16.440]   idea that apple is going to be collecting and and and aggregating this data because it feels creepy
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.920]   to them now i you know i i will tell you probably there are going to be third party options that don't
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:26.360]   collect data i can envision mark arm at ever collecting that data for overcast but um apple does
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:32.600]   say it's following apple's rules right it's anonymized you're given an anonymous token you can reset
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:37.560]   the token if you want so they can't even track you as an individual across these sessions and so
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:41.960]   apple's doing all the things that we would expect from apple in terms of making this not a creepy
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:46.440]   thing where they're trying to find your behavior and sell that behavior somewhere it really is just
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:51.720]   in aggregate how many people listened and when did they tune out and it's all about averages and
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:55.560]   all of that which is not surprising you go to amazon and you just finished listening to the
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:59.560]   incomparable godfather now they're offering you a three dicks super that's three discs super pack
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:03.400]   of godfather just to watch it's not gonna happen it's no good you launched a faring there's no
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:07.320]   more casper ads because they know that you heard them all on the podcast but i see that's the thing
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:10.840]   the thing that's so interesting about this is that when you look at things like uh there's
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:14.280]   some sponsors who advertise over and over and over again and people wonder why because you
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:17.880]   think that it's diminishing returns but they're really investing in brand value and they know like
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:23.720]   for example wordpress that you might not have coincidentally need a website when you hear leo
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:27.240]   talking about it but six months from now you're relative to ask you to make them a website and
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:31.080]   you don't want the headache and you just direct them to wordpress and that kind of value even if
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:35.000]   people skip the ads they still hear what the ad is before they skip it so it still reads that kind
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.360]   of brand awareness and i think we're not going to see the hit we're not going to see the hit to the
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:43.320]   kind of advertisers i personally like best with this model by the way wordpress and casper our
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:48.440]   sponsors from time to time here and rene was not compensated for using them as examples right
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:53.400]   there just always trying to think of an advertiser yeah i mean mention the ones on the show that's
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:58.360]   always maybe it'll attract a new you know a whole new wave of advertisers that we haven't seen you
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:02.840]   know interested in podcasting now because they don't get data back so that's what the big players are
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:07.000]   hoping is exactly that which is that they're the ones who are tv and radio advertisers and even
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.320]   like billboard advertisers are skeptical about brand advertising on podcast they want to see
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:16.360]   the numbers and this will give them a better idea because unless you're doing direct response as
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:21.080]   as rene said where you can directly measure it it's a lot harder to tell who's listening and if
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:24.920]   it's having an impact and that is there's a lot of money in brand advertising it's just a very
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:29.480]   different beast than saying fill out this URL or put in this code and we know that you listen to
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:32.440]   that part and it's kind of not fair right now because i might have listened to 300 episodes of the
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:35.880]   incomparable and then listen to mac break weekly and use that code because it was a freshest in my
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:39.800]   mind and great you get zero credit for that right i get people on twitter who are asking if i have
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:44.680]   a code for a thing that they heard you know now that they're in the market for it right that happens
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:48.760]   a lot and bless those people but you're right most of the time that doesn't happen you're just
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:55.080]   thinking i'm gonna go buy a soda and coke's not a sponsor right uh and i'm gonna get a coke instead
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:59.960]   of a pepsi because i saw that funny coke ad or or you know what where brand advertising matters a
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:05.160]   lot is a product uh from a brand that is not perceived as being legitimate and this is why
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:09.800]   viseo started doing mass and brand advertising about five seven years ago and they hired like
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:13.800]   lydanian tomlinson who is the best running back in the nfl and he was their spokesman and they did
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:17.480]   all this branding so that when you were standing billions of dollars yeah because when you were
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:22.840]   standing at casko and you saw viseo tv instead of saying viseo i've never heard of this before
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:27.240]   you're like oh yeah that's a real company they can pay for advertising and that's that's brand
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:32.120]   advertising in a nutshell so podcast people the gimlets of the world they want that money they
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:36.600]   want ford to come in and do brand advertising and they're hoping that this will give them that
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:42.920]   sponsor let's also let's also not ignore like smaller uh smaller stuff like the number of times
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:47.480]   where i've watched let's say a youtube video and i don't care if they're i have youtube red so i
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:52.040]   don't receive any ads but i watched your youtube video and that got me introduced really interested
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:58.200]   in the singer and now i mean i can't tell you how many actually i can't tell you how many like cd's
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:03.640]   i've bought of this singer because i just like her voice so much and her attitude the ability to
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.840]   have a podcast where you've got an interview with somebody and maybe you've got some clips from
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:10.840]   their stuff and say by the way here are some there are some amazon links affiliate links because if
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:15.800]   you want to buy here here's a collection of things that you can buy that if you liked what you heard
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:21.080]   here to go out and buy and by the way it will also benefit us tangentially in the form of a good 30
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:25.000]   or 40 dollars at the end of the month of credits we can spend on those big huge bulk
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.920]   bags of m&m's that we're not supposed to eat but we'll think oh my god well this is free so why not
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:33.880]   get the free m&m's stuff like that again give give people the power to find their own awesome and
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:38.840]   sometimes there can be an awesome factor in doing advertising that really really works yeah it's
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.920]   true that the fact is i've heard from people who say oh the jig is up this is going to ruin everything
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:47.320]   for podcast advertising and i those are people who i guess don't believe that people actually
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:52.040]   listen to podcasts and it's not true people do and they and they do listen to the ads and they do like
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:56.280]   the ads and there wouldn't be ads on podcasts if they didn't work so i think this is going to give
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:00.360]   podcasting a little more legitimacy because the data is going to be a little stronger and come from
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:05.800]   a third party who is probably trusted more than the podcaster themselves in that it is apple and
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:10.920]   that it will probably be a pretty good sample for most shows of the average listener because they
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:15.720]   have apple has such a huge market share this is a very large percentage of the podcast audience
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:19.080]   it'll be the it'll be the mainstream listener which is what they're really interested in because i
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:23.160]   think a lot of the tech shows skew towards pocket cast overcast but this is gonna yeah like you said
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.200]   for cereal and things that's the biggest player they're gonna get all the data they want for that's
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:31.480]   right tech shows i mean my shows are usually about 50 percent overcast and only about 25 percent
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:36.920]   apple and then some like 10 15 for pocket cast and and yeah cereal even some of my shows that are
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:43.080]   more general that i do on the incomparable have once you go to like the incomparable radio theater
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:48.200]   that's like 60 or 70 percent apple so very quickly when you lead the tech sphere apple is the dominant
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:53.160]   player when it comes to podcasts and that's because of their long investment and google hasn't made
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:58.680]   that same investment on android which is why it's it's uh it's behind there um okay we should
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:04.040]   move on and talk about picks before we wrap it up this week so much to talk about i like to say
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.360]   that this will be grist for conversations for this whole summer things that little things that
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:13.160]   get mentioned at wwdc look they're gonna be covered in mac rick weekly for weeks to come so there's
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:18.120]   much more to come i'm sure but for now i'm curious about the picks of the week andi and not co

[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:41.880]   this is the uh our friend who does diesel diesel swedes our stevens has a new enamel pin and it is

[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:22.200]   have to order some more but hey for 11 or 12 bucks you can afford to get them all right that's great
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:27.320]   that pride band is beautiful everyone was envious when we saw that apple employees had them it's great
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:32.040]   that they made that available during pride month no less apple no stranger to a six color rainbow
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:37.720]   by the way but this is the uh the pride flag rainbow and it is beautiful even people i know who are
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:42.120]   apple watch skeptics have pulled out their apple watches because they think that is the best-looking
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:46.600]   band that they've ever seen for the apple watch it's made it's made me wish i had like the the the
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:52.280]   jet black watch because i've seen now this with the jet black bands like oh now i know what rene
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:56.440]   goes on about having every single color in every single model because i would kind of want to see
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:02.440]   if i've got 700 dollars for a black edition not that there's anybody who resembles that rene anyway rene
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:07.400]   what's your pick so i want to echo andi's sentiments about this band it's this is actually a little bit
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:12.680]   deeper color than the one that apple gave employees last year so it is really really nice it is not
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:18.120]   the apple logo colors it is actually the rainbow colors if you want the apple or six uh or six
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:22.600]   colors version you have to go for you know the jason snell memorabilia apples rainbow is is
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:26.440]   a different hues i am told i'm colorblind so that's hard for me and of course their rainbow starts
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:30.760]   with green which the pride flag rainbow does not it's the order steve job says it was jason and
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:35.240]   we're not gonna we're not gonna serve who would we need to argue uh so what i'm going to recommend
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:40.840]   again is based on my rant earlier in the show and that is uh if you get the new ipad pro it is a
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:44.840]   really really good machine and if you want to use it again not as a laptop replacement but as a
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:49.160]   laptop alternative you might need it once once in a while to connect to other things and that can
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:53.640]   include a keyboard it could include you know a microphone for podcasting could include an ethernet
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:57.640]   port if you really need to do some sort of secure or high bandwidth internet or you just want a
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:02.520]   more reliable connection and in order to do that you need what apple typically builds as the usb
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:07.240]   three camera adapter the camera part in that is a lie yeah you can use it to plug in things that
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:13.320]   have a usb a cable including your iphone or any camera you want but it really is a multi-tasker
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:19.240]   in the absolute good eats best sense of that word you just put a get you plug it in and i
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:23.080]   believe it's still low power i don't think you can put anything that that draws too much power
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:27.880]   from the usb a port but for anything that is a low power peripheral again the keyboards the low
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:35.080]   power mics uh the ethernet adapters you just plug that into your ipad pro you get usb usb uh usb
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:39.960]   three not see usb three transfer speeds which is much faster than the previous usb two point
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:44.840]   whatever transfer speeds and it feels like you're almost kicking it old school style for a while
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:50.040]   so you know it's go ahead i don't want to well actually actually you there but uh that lightning
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:54.920]   port that you see on that adapter what you do is you use that for all that's right power and then
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:59.400]   you've got a powered usb situation there you can run pretty much anything you would think you could
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:04.840]   run off of usb power which is pretty great just make sure you plug in first please people
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:09.240]   play release be safe yeah you get a lot of wires in this scenario but it can be done you can plug
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:13.400]   in an ethernet adapter you can plug in the usb microphone pretty much anything you can think of
[01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:16.680]   which is pretty i'm sure you've done all that Jason i have i've tried it all yes
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:24.440]   and he's still here i've survived to sell the taste Jason Jason is the jane goodall of like mobile
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:30.920]   ipad audio it's like he he he has sat in the in the wilderness with these weird field devices
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:35.720]   communing with them getting them to earn their trust yeah it was one grove over from where i heard
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:42.040]   the uh home pod in the out in the wild wild in the wilderness sousie what's your uh what's your pick
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:49.320]   for us this week well uh last night i watched a very good basketball game the warriors are world
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:56.280]   champs once again and i don't have cable so i watched that on youtube tv um you could also stream it
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:02.600]   through the esp n app on my apple tv but even the native apple tv app was not delivering the
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:08.920]   performance that myself and my party guests needed it was stuttering and pausing and just
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:14.200]   terrible and i think that's probably because a lot of people stream with the esp n app so i jumped
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:21.880]   over to youtube tv which is youtube's new a thirty five dollar month um it's over the top streaming
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:28.600]   service it uh has unlimited dvr which is kind of nice and it's really good for sports so when i
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:34.200]   signed up i just said yeah i like the giants and the a's and the warriors and it just started dvr
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:41.720]   and me all their games um so and and it does really good live stuff so the app is ios only which is
[01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:48.360]   a bummer um but you can airplay it to the apple tv it was just updated with airplay pretty recently
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:55.240]   so i i did that and it played smoothly through the whole game it never started again we had no
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:33:01.000]   audio problems and it was great it looked like we were just watching over cable so and then it also
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:06.120]   has um bravo so it's kind of all my all my real housewives shows that i love so much so like sports
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:11.960]   and real housewives together it lasts it's basically my favorite tv thing i had been using slack which
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:18.920]   has some advantages for apple fans because it has a native apple tv app and you can do the single
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:25.480]   sign-on feature of apple tv so you can sign on with your slack account not a cable subscriber
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:30.280]   you're just paying for slack and it'll show you all the different channel apps that you can also
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:37.400]   now sign into so you're not getting cable but you have access to if your slack program if your slack
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:44.680]   bundle includes fxx you can get that app which has every simpsons episode ever and i'd always
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:50.040]   wanted to just buy a login for that service but um you can it's called slack all right
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:55.800]   by speaking of youtube actually my pick is an app that's really a plugin it's called pippafire
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:01.480]   it's available on the mac and on ios and if you ever so good on the mac is so i love the picture
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:07.000]   and picture feature that's in ios on the ipad and is also on the mac with uh sierra and later
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.160]   where you can have a little floating video window that is that is above the ui and you can't close
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:16.360]   it accidentally you kind of have to really try to close it and i use that to watch you know
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:21.640]   anything i possibly can especially on the ipad to andy's point of having a couple apps open
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:27.560]   and have some floating video here's the thing though only some services support the floating
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:34.440]   picture in picture button what pippafire does is add it to other html5 video providers most notably
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:40.680]   youtube once pippafire is installed i can go to a youtube web page and from the share extension
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:48.120]   menu just the share button choose pippafire and out pops a picture in picture window from youtube
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:53.640]   and this is how i watched a bunch of uh of uh keynotes from various tech companies over the last
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:58.520]   month including google i.o popped it out into a picture in picture box so if you ever get frustrated
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:03.160]   that you're watching video on a mac or on an ipad and you want that picture in picture button and
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:09.000]   it's just not there check out pippafire i think it's free with a requested donation but uh it's
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:16.040]   great it's a very limited use scenario but it really works and it has made me nothing more frustrating
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:20.680]   than having to use one side of my multitasking view to have a web page open showing a video
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:25.480]   when instead i know it could just be floating in a little box while i do my work so it sounds
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:30.360]   it sounds i have a different app that makes you copy to the clipboard then go in then pull it down
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:34.600]   from someplace else you can just tap the share button say please share this directly to
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:39.240]   picture picture yeah you share it to pippafire and it literally you can watch it it does the
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:44.360]   animation and everything it flies out of your uh safari window into the picture in picture box just
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:49.000]   like it just like you press that button that isn't there so i don't i don't get i don't get
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:54.200]   whether makers of the youtube app and any other streaming app says that our our app is so awesome
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:58.600]   we we we fear for the sanity of the person who uses a version of our app that is even more
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:03.240]   awesome because of picture in picture why would you not support picture in picture is it a legal
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:08.120]   licensing thing i wish i knew my gut feeling is it has something to do with the ad roles in between
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:13.240]   you know queuing up the next video or showing the pre-roll ad or showing overlays and things like
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:19.640]   that that are like extra parts of youtube that i don't mind missing quite likely to play one of
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:24.280]   those you tubes that's like you know just eight hours of white noise or something and i was trying
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:29.160]   to play that and then on the iphone and then close the app and do something else and it said that
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:34.600]   was an exclusive feature for youtube red subscribers so it might be a value add thing background audio
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:39.800]   is definitely a youtube red feature as well so oh well so great picks for everybody and i think
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:45.560]   we did a good show good uh one week later again a whole summer to to chew over everything that
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:50.200]   happened at wwdc but i think we did some uh i think we did some fine work today and it's all down to
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:56.760]   my wonderful group of guests co-host india nato thank you for being here thank you jason i you
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:02.440]   did shock me by not oppasting after a week it's good to take a pause and say la as it is known
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:10.120]   that's good it's a four-bet-blatt one five reference acknowledged yes of course i was like i felt
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:14.440]   that there's at least a 30 chance you're going to do that i you were such an experienced and
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:19.400]   professional host i'm sure that that was the right call that that for you not to do it because you're
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:23.480]   your judgment is that it would be embarrassing if we sat here making babble on five references
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:27.160]   so i'm glad we didn't it didn't but we would enjoy it so much jason and that really is all that
