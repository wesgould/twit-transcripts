[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.560]   Mac-a-toshes. Yes. Andy Enoco is here. It's normally Chicago sometimes now just Enoco.com.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.060]   Hello, Andrew. I am a rock. I'm a mountain and a rock needs no newspaper. A newspaper
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:47.440]   causes pain. Great to have you and your Canadian teapot. Also, Renee Ritchie from imore.com.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.920]   You, Adam's Leo. I have new Adam's. Oh, I can't wait. We're going to be talking about
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.120]   the new Mac book. He's already got his. Mine's coming soon. And we will talk to Alex Lindsay,
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.520]   who's in Washington DC today, the nation's capital. Yes. Where it's boring and nothing's
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.240]   happening here and nobody's upset. Nothing's happening. Everything's fine. You know what?
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:20.680]   You should do. You should celebrate. It's world emoji day. And the emoji PD again,
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:32.400]   Jeremy and company sent us emoji cupcakes. Oh my God. Who wants the poop cupcake? I'm
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.080]   sure it's a cupcake first. I'm sure it's a cupcake before it's anything else. So we've
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:46.040]   got a happy face. This is so nice, Jeremy. Thank you. You're so awesome emoji PD again.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.120]   And then this intermingled with just regular cupcakes. What's amazing is he found a bakery
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.920]   to do this. Look at that. Isn't that incredible? You know what? So last week, you had cupcakes
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.560]   in the studio for Alex and this squeaky cupcakes for emoji. Next week, I'm going to buy myself
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.680]   cupcakes and you're not going to have any and you'll get this was watch me have cupcakes
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.480]   and think, Oh, I wish I had a cupcake. I'm going to send you just for you. The poop cupcake.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:21.200]   That's all yours. I had some cupcakes. That's not that's not that's just a delicious pile
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.720]   of chocolate ice cream. It's chocolate soft serve. Yeah. That's you. You have you have
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.200]   a very, very promising career in government. Actually calling it ice cream. It's not it's
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.640]   not raining. It's a secret plan to flight inflation. Anyway, thank you, Jeremy Bridge
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.560]   and team everybody over there at the emoji Pedia and actually we'll be talking about
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:53.640]   that there are new emojis coming to iOS 12 70. No Twitmoji, but there's a peacock ball
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.000]   of string and guess what? A cupcake as well as other baked goods. There's a bagel is a
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.720]   frozen Canadian face, which I'm sure is Canadian because it's frozen. Wow, we'll get we'll
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.360]   get to that in a little bit, but I did I didn't want to thank Jeremy for the poop cake and
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:20.040]   the and the happy face cup poop. It is a celebratory. Where do you get emoji? That's
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.600]   good. That's pretty special. I bet you that's a special order. All right, hard to ask a
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:35.120]   grand cupcakes. Now, Renee Richie, you went down to New York. Yes, sir. You lucky dog
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.320]   because there are new Macintosh computers in the offing right here for a yellow part.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.080]   And you I know you got space gray. Of course you did. Yep, 15 inch. Now. Oh, you got the
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.640]   fit now. Is this a review? This is a review. Yeah. No, this is Apple owned hardware. Okay.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.480]   Because I bought one. I'm still vacillating over. I was so sure I was so sure when they
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.320]   were talking to me that I was going to go for the 15 inch for terabyte. And then I'm
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.160]   like, I saw the price and I'm like that 13 inch to terabyte. Yeah, it's more than enough
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.160]   computer for me. I didn't. I couldn't. I did. You know, I bought it for review purposes
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.720]   because they don't I don't have any clout with Apple. But that's fine. I prefer to,
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.920]   honestly. Well, I usually get the review units so I can have it right away. And then I buy
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.920]   one and I get to sort of figure out which one I'm going to buy turns out you could get
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.200]   it right away if you were get if you didn't do a BTO, a bill to order, you could get it
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.360]   and go to the Apple store. But of course I did a BTO. Let's just let's just walk through
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.920]   my thought process. Well, if you're going to get it get a 15 inches because this is
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:42.400]   a pro device, right? This is not by any means. I'm acting a bag. Yeah. So the so the 15s
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.920]   start at 23.99. But you don't want that one. You want, you know, one with a little more
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.880]   hood spot and you want an I nine, you know, yeah, well, okay, that's a good thought. I
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.200]   did want an I nine. I was actually the day before Apple announced this shopping the
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.240]   think pads for an I nine. That's only 300 bucks more. It's not that the I nine. Is it
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.720]   a big difference between that I nine and I seven or is it just those three little gigahertz
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.960]   so I mean, it isn't it isn't like the Apple is doing what Apple always does and they are
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.280]   using the absolute ultra highest spec Intel chips. Now I asked a lot of people and no
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.600]   one is that everyone says, Oh, you know, Apple's later they're using the same. No, they're
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.280]   not using the same chips. Everybody else. They are using like the top of the top chips
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.760]   they can possibly get which are slightly different than the ones that everyone else is already
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.000]   selling. So if you want that, Leo, like if you want the Mercedes AK, you want Mercedes,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.400]   you want the AKG version of it. And that's what all the I suspect part of the reason
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.080]   they do that is they don't want people to do compare as price shopping. So you can do
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.240]   it. It's just this is the most expensive possible part that you can compare. So yeah, I think
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.600]   actually that's what Apple did all around, didn't they? I mean, that's the thing that's
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.840]   so let's just let's just spec it out. Yes. So I got the I nine. I did do that. Now, if
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:07.440]   you notice that the four terabytes solid state drive adds $3,200 to the price, you might
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:15.560]   hesitate to terabytes. That's a mere $1,200. And since you were going to get 800 bucks
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.680]   ding for getting the one terabyte, mine is well just, you know, the four terabytes are
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.520]   two two terabytes in scary raid with a custom controller. Not good. We don't like scary
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:33.840]   raids. So two terabytes is one unit. You think? Yes. Yeah. And it's soldered on. Well, there
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.440]   are chips. Yeah, there are chips. It's just they don't make though. They don't actually
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.520]   make a four terabyte version of that important to understand though. This is not upgradable
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.120]   in any form or fashion. No, that's it. You get what you get and you're stuck with it.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.240]   So you can sell it and buy a new computer. Right. So I got the two terabytes. Final cut
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.520]   priority. Have a logic pro. That was it. That's all I could choose. Well, where's my 32 gigs
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.520]   of RAM? That was there too. Oh, let's put that in there. This is the first Apple laptop
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:05.920]   with capability. Now this is DDR4. So it's not as power efficient as the as the low power
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.080]   DDR3. They're using in the 13 inch, but to compensate for it, they're put a slightly
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.760]   bigger battery in and to compensate for that they took they took Adams out of the rest of
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.280]   the computer to keep the same way. I fixed it. Notice that that the battery is heavier,
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.640]   but the laptop's not. So some Apple stated Apple stated that at the announcement. So they
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.840]   are not hiding it. I fix it. It thinks that maybe they shaved down some of the aluminum
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.080]   in the top of the device and then you filled it with helium or something. So we've got
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:39.360]   now a I 9 32 gigs to terabytes. Four thousand six hundred ninety nine dollars. It's still
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.680]   less than my iMac Pro. Is it how would you think it compares to an iMac Pro though? I
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.680]   mean, it's only with them last year. I'm like, I would love an iMac book pro and they sort
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.520]   of looked at me. And then it turns out that if you get this and then you get an eGPU as
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.720]   a docking station and one of those LG 5K monitors, you essentially have not an iMac
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.640]   Pro because those are Xeon processors, but a pretty, you know, top flight iMac that you
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.720]   can take the bottom part off and travel with. Well, actually, don't you get better single
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.720]   core performance in the Mac? You do. You do. So it depends on what workload you want.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.800]   Yeah, if you want, but the was it 18 cores, right? I got a 10 core iMac Pro with a lower
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:23.280]   single clock speed. Yes, but it's four more cores, but that's a very specific use case.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.600]   You have to have an application that's going to use and it's also like it's durability.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.000]   Like everything in the iMac Pro is like it's ECC. It's built to be server workstation
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.800]   class. Alex? Yeah, I think that I mean it, the biggest problem with most of the Mac books
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.880]   is that they're their GPUs are not not very good. Oh, yeah, I mean, see a GPU choice here
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.320]   that I think because we got the top of the line, we got the upgraded 560X that is
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.080]   until did not ship a better into so it was so hard for Intel to get coffee like out.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.080]   They basically didn't do anything with the GPUs this year and the 30s uses the integrated
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.000]   so the 13 is user the integrated Apple couldn't use the integrated for the 15 inch Apple still
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.880]   can't work with Nvidia. So they went with AMD. Yeah, plus they could have helped an external
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.720]   GPU alongside this, didn't they? They could have all those black magic gas. You can get
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.520]   a black magic with the Vega that you get in the iMac Pro. Yeah, let's let's look at
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:23.240]   that black magic eGPU. It's still not a super fast. Yeah, I don't quite. I mean, I get I
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.760]   get the idea of building something and I'm a big black magic fan, but I didn't understand
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.920]   this one. I was I looked at it. I was like, well, for most of us that are going to really
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.320]   want this, we're going to want more. Could, but you know, there are other companies that
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.200]   make it. This is cheap. This is only 700 bucks. It was mostly designed for people who want
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.960]   to buy it. And it has it's really a dock too, right? Because it has a bunch of it's a
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.440]   docking station and it was designed for developers who would go for an iMac or MacBook Pro,
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.160]   but they don't want the big fan and you can call them Fussy developers if you want, but
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.480]   they just want to plug in their vibe, do their work and not hear it. No, I can see I can see
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.280]   supporting a vibe on it on your laptop. I mean, your laptop to this to a vibe actually makes
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.560]   a fair bit of sense if you're developing if you're you're doing something for it really
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:14.760]   is enough GPU to support a 360 development on the, you know, for on Final Cut and and
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.720]   you know, other things like that. So I can see I can see that that makes more sense.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.400]   For most of us that want real, really soup up our computers, you want one that you can
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.200]   put whatever you want in there, continue to upgrade it and possibly have more than one.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.280]   Right. This is a Radeon Pro 580. It's kind of a middle of the road GPU. It's nowhere near
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.160]   a 1080 Ti or anything like that. But Jesus is really nice. Can you not get any GPU that
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.840]   will allow you to use other? You can and you can even you can even if you don't mind messing
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.840]   with drivers and stuff, you can try and see if you can get an Nvidia run in it. So you
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.480]   can get Apple said that there's a ton of those options out there, but they did hear from
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.920]   a certain element of developer community. You just wanted something quiet. And I remember
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.360]   remarking on that when we did the iMac Pro demos, they had cinema 40 and a bunch of
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.880]   developers in there and they would turn on the GPUs and man, were they powerful, but
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:06.560]   all of a sudden it was fan everywhere. So if I max out that device by putting in the
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:13.640]   four terabyte drive, we now get it up to $6,700. That's that's all the way up. That's that's
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.800]   going to 11. This is this is this is not this is not a complaint. Just an observation.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:24.320]   I have never paid that much for a car. Yeah, let alone laptop. So I mean, because Apple
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.840]   is Apple, they had a bunch of people there doing demos for us. And one of the people
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:33.600]   were the director and editor for Despacito. I hope I'm pronouncing that right. The video
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:40.840]   that Scott six billion views on his pass. See though, they did not edit it on this computer
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.760]   because it wasn't around them. But as soon as they got it, they put the whole thing on
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.280]   there. And they said that for them in their business, which the bottleneck is always the
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.240]   performer like getting the performer on the phone is the most important thing in the world
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:57.760]   for them. They could put the entire 5k read video file, no optimized media, no scale down
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.720]   media, nothing, no proxy media, have a whole thing on there. They could edit it. It would
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.320]   render in half the time it took to play. So twice real time, they could send them and
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.240]   I was apparently what everybody does now they just send you iPhone versions for you
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.800]   to prove. And if they wanted anything changed, they could just re render one and send it
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.760]   back in two minutes, have another change. And they're their most important thing more than
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.960]   time, more than money with not having to deal with external storage and not having to deal
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:29.920]   with proxy media anymore. So if you that was the $6,700 option, if you don't do any customization,
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:36.680]   you can get the 13 inch MacBook Pro without, you know, with a 2.3 gigahertz i5. That's
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:45.080]   four cores. It's eight gigs of RAM, not 32 or 16 and a 256 gig SSD. That's 1799. So that's
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:51.280]   the base price. You cannot get any of these without the touch bar. Yes. That's a given
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.800]   now. They did not abandoning the non touch bar one, but they did not talking about it.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.200]   Did not update the MacBook escape as some people call it because it has a real escape
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:05.560]   key. And maybe even more notably, they didn't update any other long overdue updates for the
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:11.760]   MacBook or the MacBook Air or the Mac mini or Mac mini, or even just the iMac that they
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:18.400]   these what Apple has done in the last two years is focused on the high end pro market,
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:24.000]   the premium market. And Alex, you said this many times the pros are not price sensitive.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.240]   No, no, these are not. I mean, even I about 4,500 is about what I've spent on most of
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.600]   my laptops in the last 10 years. I mean, you know, when you start adding up all the
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.720]   little bits and pieces, because you try to soup it all up to what you need, because
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.320]   you're using that every day and theoretically, it's generating revenue most of the time.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:45.520]   So if you're if you're doing this as a business and you are buying the newest thing, you're
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.480]   probably making money at it. And that is generating revenue. And you know, that's the
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.680]   price of a small camera or a lens or or anything else. I mean, when it's a tool of the trade,
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.960]   it's just an entirely different calculation. Would I buy one of these for myself just
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:06.640]   to play with? Like, no, probably not. But but for work, it makes sense. I'm still I'm
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:13.800]   still hanging on to my I travel so much that just the idea of going away from my mag safe
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:22.200]   is still holding back. Well, no, that may have to continue the 15 inch 2015 MacBook Pro.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.000]   That is what I have now. It's not like I'm up. Yeah, it's what I have to. That's what
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.280]   I'm replacing. And I I'm hoping so there are it isn't just the touch bar. It's the touch
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:37.360]   bar with a new T2 chip, the same one in the Mac Pro. So that means hey, Siri works. You
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.640]   don't have to press a button. Yes, the co processor for a Siri. Is there anything else
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:47.280]   that T2 is adding? Sorry, sorry to start out to answer me. Yeah, so the team gives you
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.920]   the same functionality that you have in the iMac Pro, which is secure boot, real time
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:57.400]   encryption encryption. And the other the basically consolidates all the controllers. So instead
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.800]   of having discrete controllers for a lot of the different components, all those controllers
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:06.000]   are now in the T2, which is I think essentially like an eight or a nine hybrid. I was gonna
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.440]   ask I was gonna ask you like privately on Twitter by me as we'll do it now. I've been
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.800]   trying to have they upgraded the microphone array at all to support. Hey, Siri, or is
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.240]   it still the same sort of like chat microphone sort of situation? They had not they said
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.680]   that the microphone system from FaceTime was capable of doing what they needed for a
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:29.080]   hey, Siri. Yes, that's it. Sorry. And that that that one that one bothers me. I think
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:34.000]   that the next whatever they redesigned the next Mac books, I think they need to put in
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.360]   omnidirectional microphones because Siri is useful to you when you're not like right
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.600]   directly in front of the screen. If you're right in front of the screen, why not just
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:49.800]   type it? Why not just you know, use a use your keyboard to do that. So nice move though.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.200]   No, I asked them about that right away because I also wanted them to have fancy new mics
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.800]   in there because they're they have that whole audio system team. I just wanted to do everything
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.520]   now. I was kind of surprised that they didn't start adding stuff like depth sensors into
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.320]   the into the into this for you know, for Face ID and so on so forth. You know, I've had
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.400]   kind of incorporated all that the iPad does that. Sorry. Yeah. The iPad is getting them
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.640]   next. So they're gonna get all the iPad stuff next and then they just seem like when you're
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.840]   not dating this, it would it would be the time to do it. But of course, but that but
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.360]   that makes sense. We see we see this big gap where how much retooling would they have
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.720]   to do to the MacBook Pro line in order to accommodate all this stuff, not only in the
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:30.880]   front bezel but also, you know, under underneath the keyboard. And given that they did a huge
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.840]   and not entirely successful, maybe rev a couple years ago, that's not on. I'm more
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:41.120]   curious to see what happens when they decide to make the consumer I'm the consumer I max
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.720]   and the consumer Mac books, which I believe are going to be pretty damn different from
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.680]   what we're seeing right now, that if they're basically patent, they're making this part
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:55.160]   of the of the first wave of real next generation, a max with more of these iOS hardware features,
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:00.520]   not just the software features. But it's not a redesign in the sense that the hardware,
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:06.440]   the outsides are designed differently at all. No, suspect bomb. I'd be I'd be happy if they
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:13.560]   did that, but no, no. Well, that break comes brings us to the keyboard. Yeah, Apple and
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.720]   Gruber pointed this out. Apple's not going to say we've made these more reliable because
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:22.520]   for liability reasons, they say that we made them quieter, which led to a lot of people
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:28.560]   including I just seen and and Dieter bone doing recordings of the keyboards. And for
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.560]   all I could tell, I didn't seem much of a difference. How about you, Renee? Do you
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.720]   do you feel like about this? So yeah, so they they were not it's not that they didn't
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:42.000]   do anything. They said they were not discussing. Yeah. Oh, good. So that confirms a Gruber
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.920]   kind of inferred, which is they would never say it if they did. No, I mean, they might
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.400]   mean the people in that room might, but there's probably other people in other rooms who would
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:56.040]   not let them say that. Exactly. So what they did talk about is not just that they said
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.080]   that one of the biggest complaints they did get was noise. And if you go back and look
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.840]   at some of the original 2016 MacBook reviews, they all talk about how loud this keyboard
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.240]   is clicking the clackity. And they didn't they said it significantly reduced the loudness,
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.440]   but it wasn't volume. It was tone. It's like you can deal with different different tones
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.360]   have different thresholds of annoyance when it comes to volume according to them. So they
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:22.160]   changed. They did I forgot the right word, but I think it's a word Dieter used, but I
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.400]   forget the word they used was, but it was also a change in tone that they said made
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:30.280]   it. Did you able to hear that? Yeah, I've been using it all weekend. And it was weird.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.080]   I almost didn't like it as much at first because it didn't feel quite as crisp. And
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:38.200]   I know I'm at the opposite end of the typing scale from a lot of my friends, but I like
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:43.000]   a real Chris and it felt a little bit more like the older keyboards a little bit looseier
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.560]   gooseier. But again, like I adapt quickly to that. So after two days, I didn't notice
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.640]   it anymore. I fix it was able to take apart the keyboard and note that they have added
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:20:00.100]   a silicone barrier that looks like it's a crumb guard to each key. It's a noise baffle
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:06.980]   crumb guard hybrid. It's the cummerbund. The back keyboard cummerbund. Yeah, so it may
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:13.120]   in fact be more robust. They'd be foolish not to do something to address that issue.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.020]   They've read this keyboard every year. I don't recall them ever revving a keyboard as much
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:22.900]   as they don't call it the butterfly three. They do. It's a generation three. Yeah. And
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:27.140]   this and this is why we keep saying that the new stuff is really good, but they're not
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.620]   going to figure out when they when they do a complete redesign of something, they're
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.580]   not going to figure out if they got that design right until they've got hundreds of
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.820]   thousands or millions in people's hands. And then you see the revision B and then the revision
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:44.020]   C and those are the ones that really, really prove the pudding. So you don't order this
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:48.340]   yet. Wait. Well, no, I'm saying don't there. That's the disadvantage. Realize that if you're
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.460]   buying if you've been waiting a couple of years for the new one to come out, realize
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:57.420]   that there might be things that if you waited an extra year for the revision B, there might
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:02.180]   be benefits that you will get that have nothing to do with the specs. Basically reliability,
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:06.020]   little things like, Oh, we didn't realize that dust was going to accumulate in this
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:10.740]   part of the fan box. And this is why the fan is now making more noise at six months than
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:16.100]   it did at six days. I did spend a couple hours at two different. I don't I don't own one
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.780]   yet. I haven't gotten a loaner yet. But I did spend a couple of hours typing in two
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:25.420]   different Apple stores on them. And is it okay? I couldn't feel that much. I still don't
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.500]   like it. But I can't really feel that much of a difference.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:34.820]   So we have here one person who likes the butterfly keyboard Renee. Yes. And then three
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:40.340]   of us, I think who do not. But only one of us actually owns one of these. I'm I'm still
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:46.020]   waiting for mine. I won't. If you if you if your concern was the actual keyboard, it
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.940]   will change nothing. If your concern was the reliability of the keyboard, then odds are
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.580]   apples gotten closer to making a little bit of both. I didn't want a keyboard that's
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:22:00.140]   going to fail on me. Obviously. And I did buy Apple care, which I don't usually do.
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:06.940]   I did buy Apple care on this. It's I do everything. Yeah. I do think I'm sorry. Go ahead. You're
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:13.300]   always trying to say. Okay, I'll just quickly say it does it does underscore the idea that
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.980]   Apple doesn't believe the keyboard is defective. I don't believe it either. But when we would
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:22.860]   have seen a larger change, not just in the not just in the first, but by the second revision
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:27.260]   of this keyboard, if they were getting lots of data saying that no, these are failing,
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.420]   failing, failing, failing, not just this is not just a legal liability. But this is a
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:36.260]   point of disappointment with our customers. We would have seen a new keyboard design,
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:41.020]   something really radical more than just a tweak to the existing design. So if nothing
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:45.460]   else, this indicates that this is simply a design that is controversial, but Apple continues
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.900]   to believe in it. And also, I mean, people forget that Apple is a ginormous company and
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.340]   all the the act like a bunch of small units. They also do have things like SAP implementations
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:58.100]   that come with giant companies. And a lot of the stuff when it deals with failure rates
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.140]   is do they hit this number? If this number of failures gets hit, this alarm goes off and
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:06.060]   some human has to come and look at it and make like a lot of that is purely procedural.
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:09.580]   And as far as I can tell, it is not hitting the alarm bell stage like they did with the
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.220]   batteries when you actually like this is a reactive thing. If you have a problem, come
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.460]   in and we'll place it. The batteries like no, bring your computer in and we will change
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.460]   it for you.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:27.740]   So here's my, I'll throw this out and you guys tell me I'm wrong. I'm starting to see
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:33.060]   maybe a way to a strategy that makes sense for Apple with regard to Macintosh and iOS,
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:38.180]   which is that perhaps they're seeing the Macintosh and Mac OS, they know they have to
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:43.860]   continue it at least to make apps for iOS, right? And they, I think they would like the
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:49.860]   gloss that professional photographers and filmmakers add to a product by endorsing
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:55.540]   it and supporting it. But it strikes me that maybe they're thinking that the consumer products
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:24:00.180]   are not that important. Those people, maybe people would buy a MacBook should maybe consider
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:05.780]   using an iPad, maybe not this year, maybe next year. Did you ask them about whether they're
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:09.220]   going to update any of the lower end Macintosh products, Renee?
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:13.460]   Yeah, I mean, there's classic line is we're here to discuss these products, but it sounded
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.740]   like these were just the next ones up. And as we go into the fall, we'll have discussions
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:21.460]   about the other ones. And I think what you're, what you're saying is sort of true, but I
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:26.220]   also think that Apple made a series of not totally interconnected, but not totally disconnected
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:32.580]   either. Errors like the Mac Pro went the wrong way. And they were, they were, they saw
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.980]   the massive success of mainstream computing with the iPhone and the Halo effect and people
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:41.060]   who wanted to buy Macs because they owned iPhones and they had different needs than the
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:45.780]   traditional Mac customer. Like they, when they say that these, these MacBook Pros sold well,
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:50.260]   they mean it, these MacBook Pros sold well, but they did not resonate with the traditional
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:56.100]   Apple Pro customer. They were part of the new generation of founders and developers and people
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.900]   who had very different, more mobile needs. And I think they realized that, you know, at first,
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.340]   they thought, Oh, maybe these old, you know, these old pros are just grumpy and they'll come around
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:09.140]   if we give them a year. And they realized, no, we made a miscalculation and we can ignore them.
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:13.460]   And some analysts say, please get rid of the Mac, go all in on iOS, you're just wasting money there.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.460]   But I think Apple still very much wants to be a Mac company. And it hurt them that they were not,
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:22.340]   the pros were not happy. And this is the iMac Pro, which was already planned, but the new Mac Pro
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:26.580]   and these new MacBook Pros and going to DDR4 RAM, for example, which I don't think was originally
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:30.820]   part of the plan is part of a process of making good with that traditional plan.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:36.180]   But I don't think it's a bad strategy to say, we're going to make the Macintosh a premium product,
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:41.940]   a premium price for people who really need that power. And we're not going to focus that much on
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:47.060]   low end Mac OS. Why should they? I think I think I think I think that I think that most of your
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:52.580]   users, most users who are using a Mac that are consumers really could use an iPad.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:57.700]   I'm spending more and more time trying to use an iPad for stuff that I normally do on my Mac.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.300]   So I'm trying to see where I've been, as we discussed this, I've been trying to figure out
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:08.100]   where is that crossover. So I'm forcing myself to work in pages and build numbers docs and
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:12.980]   build keynote docs and work with other apps to try to figure out when do I stop and say,
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:18.100]   I can't do this on an iPad and I go back to the computer. And I think that they are definitely
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:24.100]   quickly running to a point where I don't feel like I need for a lot of this kind of stuff.
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:30.020]   Definitely for web surfing, for writing emails, writing documents, I can get a keyboard for my
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:36.180]   iPad and it's just fine. In fact, it's better. Working in pages on an iPad is actually better
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:42.820]   than working on your computer because you can draw on it. The thing is, this is the whole
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:48.980]   problem with these Macs and why I think that they have an explosive, if they brought back the
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:56.020]   Macs safe, which they won't. But the touchscreen, I think, is a big piece of it.
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:00.340]   Not because I'm going to sit there for 10 hours touching my screen, but what happens is,
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.940]   when you're on an iPad and you're in pages, you start typing and you go, "Okay, I want a
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.380]   picture right here." And you just draw on the thing of a sketch of, "This is what I'm going to put
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:11.780]   in here." And then you keep on working. You can't do that on your Mac.
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:17.140]   And then what you get into is you start doing this thing where you work on your Mac,
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.740]   and then you go to your iPad when you want to start adding the images or when you want to start
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:25.220]   doing some other stuff. And if you're sharing it between the two of them on iCloud, it takes a
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:29.860]   couple seconds. It's not like Google Docs. It's like 10 or 15 seconds. It pops up over there.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:37.780]   So, but there's a lot of, I think that for a consumer, I don't think that laptops are going to make
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:42.980]   sense except for people who have been using them their whole life. But I think that if you were
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:47.140]   just starting now, it wouldn't make any sense to get anything other than an iPad until you started
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.980]   doing professional level work. And then you're going to want to spend a little more for a
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.780]   professional level. And you spend it and you have it and you need it? Absolutely.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.460]   I'm not uncomfortable with that. I don't know if that's Apple strategy. I don't think it'll happen
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:01.700]   this year. I think they will update at least once more of the consumer-grade stuff. But I feel like
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:06.820]   that's the, this makes sense as a long-term strategy, Andy. My thinking has changed in the
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:16.580]   past couple of months where I think that Apple now believes not specifically in specific products
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:22.260]   or even specific platforms. I think that their enthusiasm is for a specific mission. And I think
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:29.460]   that the mission of the consumer Macintosh, they think is now better served by higher-end iPads,
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:34.980]   where they can create a really friendly, when you, the thing that people associated with the consumer
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:39.380]   level Macs is that we would recommend them to our friends and family because they're just not
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.900]   going to give you any trouble. They're going to work. There's going to be really good creative
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:48.660]   software for it. And by, I don't mean like for creative purposes, by me that the people who write
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:55.380]   software for this is, are going to be very, very creative in how they solve a problem. And I think
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:29:00.660]   that once again, they're thinking more along the lines of the iPad is much better suited. And even,
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:06.420]   and also the iPhone in there is much better suited for the, for the mission of the original Macintosh,
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:14.340]   particularly given that they can build a kick, but iPad and sell it for $329. I mean, that is,
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.820]   I really think that this is, that's one of the most significant products that Apple has ever
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:24.420]   shipped from day one. It's a miracle, and it's a wonderful value, and it's within reach of most
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.500]   moderately priced, morally priced users. And I think that now they're saying the mission
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.380]   of the profession of suiting the people, the creators, the people who are making software,
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.780]   the people who are making movies, the people who are making photographs is best served by a pro
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:42.980]   and Mac, which is, I think, why that was the first problem they decided to solve, which is,
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:48.340]   people are not our pro customers are not happy with the Mac Pro. We need to address that really,
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:53.060]   really quick. We need to make sure that they have Macintosh's that can do not only do the jobs they
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:58.980]   want to do, but do it in the situations in which they like to do them. So I would not be, I'm still,
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:05.460]   I still don't believe that Apple will, the consumer grade Macs as we have come to know them. I don't
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:10.340]   think they're going to continue to exist after the next two or three years, certainly not by the
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:14.260]   next five, but I don't believe it's because they're abandoning consumers. I think it's because,
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:19.940]   once again, they love the mission of the Macintosh. They just think that their consumers be much
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:25.700]   more happy if they solve that mission with an iPad. I that's exactly my point of view, Andy,
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:31.140]   but we'll see. I mean, they could surprise us all. One thing that is kind of surprising
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:37.300]   is that they took the true tone display from the iPad Pro and they put it in the laptop. That's not
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:42.660]   something the photographers want or film. Yes. So we had a bunch, they had several people there,
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:47.140]   they had a gentleman who does gigapixel photography, does the Beauty and the Beast project,
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.980]   and they had someone who does environmental photography, who goes and documents the different parts
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.740]   in Greenland. And they all had different answers. And I also asked a bunch of photographers and some
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:58.660]   of them are like, no, I never have it on. And some are like, I turned it on. I'm never turning it off.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:02.580]   Oh, really? No, there's had a hybrid approach. And they're like, I shoot in so many different
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.660]   conditions. And I just want to batch process things. And I'm going to tent one minute and then
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:10.660]   a forest the next minute, I have torch light, then I have incandescent light. And I just leave
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:14.500]   it on because I just want to work. And then I turn it off when I do the final edit. That makes
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:20.900]   sense. No one had no one had a everyone had a different opinion, but all of that a lot of things
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:26.180]   to say. The issue, of course, is accuracy because true tone is going to tilt the screen towards
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:31.380]   the ambient lighting. But the external lighting is going to make the screen look more blue or
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:36.420]   more yellow, some felt anyway. So, right. And what do you think, Alex? You're the one who uses this.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:41.620]   Yeah, you shouldn't you. I don't use it. I like to just set, I like to know what I'm
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:47.780]   set to. I don't like it changing on me. But I, you know, in general, you should either be in a
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:52.580]   good room to do color correction or you should not try. You know, all of those, you know, like,
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.860]   you shouldn't try to do color correction somewhere else. You should go into a neutral room. That makes
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:59.860]   sense. You take a spider five and you throw it on onto your screen, you calibrate your screen,
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:05.220]   and then you do color correction. And that's the way that that's the process. When we were at,
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:09.140]   when I was at ILM, you know, they swapped out our monitors once every three months, some
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.860]   guy would come by and take your monitor and give you a new one. They had, you know, and they just,
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.740]   that's all they did all day was to two guys. That's all they did was just change everybody's
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:18.420]   monitors because we, because we had to do color correction. But we were in controlled environments
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:23.220]   when you're, you know, so I think the truth sounds fine. If you like it changing, I don't like it.
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.180]   I feel like it changes too much. And so I turned it on for a little while and I was like, oh,
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:31.540]   this is making me crazy. So I, I turned it off and I like to just have it be the way it is.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:37.620]   And I don't, I know not to trust it unless I've calibrated it within the last literally when I
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:42.820]   sat down, have I calibrated it? And if I calibrate it, then I can start doing color correction. If I
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.860]   haven't calibrated, I don't make any assumptions that I know what that color is.
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:56.580]   What else to say? Battery life is not going to change even though you've got a bigger battery
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:03.620]   because of the DDR. And more cores like the 13 inch one from two to four and the
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:10.820]   13 inch one for to six. Now what the one you have is a lower end. Or is it what is that the
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:15.940]   I seven? I have the mid range. Yeah. I have the I seven to terabyte. How is the heat on that?
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:20.660]   I mean, it's a MacBook and going back five years, if you put your finger right underneath the
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:24.740]   keyboard, like right underneath where the screen is, it feels warm, but I haven't had any, it hasn't
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:31.700]   been any hotter than any other MacBook I've ever had. Okay. I we before the show is true that if you
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.740]   go ahead, you sir, if you circulate a lot of air underneath it, you're going to get better
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.500]   performance because the CPU isn't going to get you don't want thermal gating. You don't want it to
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:44.260]   just to protect the CPU because it's too hot. That'll show it. And that's one of the things when
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:49.220]   you look at how CPUs are measured, when you do a quick benchmark, you don't know if it's in if
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:54.020]   it's still ungated or if it has been gated or the performance is that's all the thermals are
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:58.660]   always a problem, especially I mean, I'm really in some ways worried about the I nine and the six
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:04.820]   cores at that high clock speed high frequency ever get to that high clock speed. Yeah, it depends
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:07.860]   on your load. Like how do people just need a burst? Like they just need to have something
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:13.300]   full tilt running and other people need sustained and those sort of different workloads as well.
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.700]   I'll be honest, if I can just move from picture to picture in Adobe Lightroom on camera raw,
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:23.060]   I'll be happy. And also for me, it was compile time and Lightroom Lightroom's such a pig and
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:26.180]   that's not Apple's fault. That's Lightroom. That's Adobe's fault. Everything is a pig.
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:32.260]   Alex, there's something that I now want to ask you because you'll you'll know the answer to this.
[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:37.780]   Why don't why don't I see people making an accessory for high performance users that's
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:45.060]   essentially a forced cold air system that will basically blow cold air into the intakes of a
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:49.780]   high performance machine to make sure that it will never never thermally thermally clock.
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:56.340]   You see that car is. I think that somebody actually did right when you're as you were talking
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.780]   through that I was like, I think I saw that somewhere. Well, you can see why these laptop
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:04.420]   cooling. It's having a lot of it. Like this, the Noel Bird.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:10.900]   It's blowing air on. Sure. Make it make it look like a like a hot plate. That's a good
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:14.340]   day. That's good. This is this is really interesting. This one actually clips on
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:21.540]   and a junction. Yeah, it's a laptop fan cooler temperature display rapid cooling auto temp
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:28.820]   detection, 13 wind speed. It goes all the way up to 5,000 RPM. Probably sounds like a jet airplane
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:33.860]   taking off. Yeah, I think more than a fan, I'm thinking about something that's actually a
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:37.860]   chiller. Something that actually is basically. Right. Active cooling as opposed to. Yeah.
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:43.300]   It's weird. I was just searching while you were doing it. It does anyone do like a water
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:48.500]   cool liquid cooled stand. Like and there's someone who's got like some kind of kickstarter
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:55.540]   or something that they did a while ago that was called the tilt, which is I guess a liquid cooled
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:02.660]   for the Mac Pro MacBook Pro. Anyway, it's but I think it looked like it was estimated delivery for
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:12.820]   2011. I don't know if it took off. But I do think that I'd be curious to see what the real
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:19.300]   percentage changes. Is it really is it are you getting 5% more 10% more or is it really 2% or 3%
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:24.900]   faster to have it or is it 50% faster? Is that thermal gating really making a difference?
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:29.780]   And I don't know the answer. But I'm sure that we could start figuring it out. It's a hot day
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:37.220]   outside. We can take our computer out, test it when it's cold. Actually, I can't imagine that any
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:42.260]   sort of a forced active cooling system would be less expensive than it would cost for me to
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:46.980]   actually buy an air conditioner for this big room. And why should my computer be the only thing that
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:53.940]   gets cooled off? But it was hilarious. But I think that if it's sitting, these computers get really
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:58.820]   hot when you're pushing all the CPUs. I mean, you turn compressor on and you set it where
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:07.620]   that's extra instance and it just uses up all of the CPUs. It definitely heats up the computer.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:11.940]   And I don't know if air conditioner is enough. I mean, I think you do need to get it. I know I
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:15.140]   try to get it off the way. If I'm doing a lot of compression over a long period of time, I tend
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:19.540]   to get it off the ground. I just I don't have anything special. I just take little things and
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:23.860]   set it underneath it so it balances on something when I walk away. Just try to make sure
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:28.180]   it has as my air movement is. I should put out the Lori Gill and McSimmons did write an article
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:34.500]   for Eimor last couple of months ago on best cooling pads for the MacBook Pro in 2018. How do
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:40.820]   I get rid of this? Go away Amazon. I should be an excellent. Sorry, it's Prime Day and Sanity.
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:46.260]   And I turned off. You'll be glad to know my ad blocker on Eimor. So there are thermal
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:51.780]   take makes one. There are some pretty hefty devices. There were some amazing stories from
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:55.620]   earlier in the year about people walking around with their phones in in the heat and
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:38:00.020]   them overheating. So buying ice blocks to put on underneath their phones and then getting ice
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:07.060]   burns getting frostbite from holding the ice block. I actually was reading on some support
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:12.340]   forum where this is 100 degrees in so many places. So many people a lot of people were getting
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:15.940]   like on their iPhone 10 like overheat problems. They're sorry. I can't do anything right now
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.940]   because I'm overheated. So they just said, well, you know, this the iPhone 10 is waterproof.
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:23.940]   I'll just like put this bet. I'll just put it on or in this bag of ice to cool it down.
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.420]   And I guess they got condensation inside it. They'd say, yes, but we're not working at all
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:33.620]   from now on terrible idea. It's 95% humidity in Montreal today. So I'm just not going outside.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:41.380]   I feel like, well, I'm very excited. I can't wait to get it. I did. You know, you can't. So I got
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:48.500]   a few accessories. I sleep. Yeah. So I did get the sleeve and I wish I hadn't because it's $200.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:56.420]   And here it is. This is this is the unicorn leather. It must be because that's a lot of money for what
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:03.460]   is essentially a pouch, two pieces of leather stitched together for 200. But it does have something
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:08.500]   nothing else can have an apple on the front. You could barely see it. But it's there.
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:14.180]   How's the leather? Is the leather really really soft and supple? Do not recommend instead.
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:20.980]   $20. This is probably going to protect it better. Right. This is a talk. It's not cool. It's not
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.420]   what it is. It's not cool. It doesn't look cool, though. No, it's not cool. You know,
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:29.460]   else doesn't look cool. Just in case the keyboard isn't well sealed. I've got a silicone rubber.
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:38.900]   You are like, you're pro lactic. I really read. Yeah. They had different colors. They have like
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:43.060]   rainbows and you could get paintings. You get a van go, you get starry, starry night. It's just
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:47.780]   one of those. It's just a little silicone. You just put that right over the top. That'll keep the crumbs
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:54.740]   out. There you go. No, you got a silicone barrier inside and outside. Use protection.
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:40:01.380]   Use protection. First, you got to have a cable to charge your phone because there are only lightning.
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:09.780]   I mean, Tender Bolt C type C type C connectors. So you got to get that. Although I am actually
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:14.420]   pleased because this is not was not too expensive. And Apple offers this. This is the Belkin
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:22.900]   dock. And it does support 40 gigabit gigabyte Thunderbolt 3. And so I think this is probably a
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:29.860]   useful doohickey for three hundred. You could just get the EGP for 600 Leo. I know for twice.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:36.220]   Yeah. Why did I do that? Where's the firewire 800? Even more ports. This has a
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:44.140]   dual link DVI display port to type C connectors. One with its own charger that is 20 volts by
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:51.500]   8.5 amps. So 160 watt charger. It's got two USB three. It's got ethernet ethernet. Who needs
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:55.100]   that? I don't know. No, VGA. How am I going to use it in the office? Well, it's got display,
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:41:00.860]   but giant display port if you want that. Where's the HDMI port? You'd think they'd have HDMI.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:08.300]   Wait a minute. Come on. Is it HDMI two? Or is there only HDMI one? There's no there's not any HDMI at all.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:16.140]   HDMI none. None. That's a really that was 300 bucks. Yeah, maybe that's maybe that's not the
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:20.540]   best thing to guess. Is it USB on the front? Is there like a USB on the front and a headphone jack?
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:28.220]   And no no HDMI. That's bizarre, isn't it? Why would you have displayed? Well, I guess because
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:33.260]   Apple's cinema displays have many display port, which you could get an adapter for and Thunderbolt.
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:37.420]   You can get an HDMI adapter port to. Yeah, yeah, I have I have display port.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:41.340]   That's more dongle. So you got this to go to the dongle with the dongle. So here's the thing.
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:45.740]   I still maintain that it's not the like pros are always going to have like I've had dongles for as
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:51.740]   long as I've had a MacBook of I DVI and VGA and HDMI and firewire and all but this is the first
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:57.660]   time non pros deal with USB 80 USB C and they they felt and experienced our pain and that's
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:01.740]   that's where all this resentment has come from. So I'll keep this here at the office so that I
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:06.380]   can bring the laptop in and then we just dock it and we can use it but it doesn't I'm actually
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:11.420]   thought it would have HDMI so that's less useful, isn't it John? We have adapters. We have
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:17.660]   Thunderbolt HDMI. We have any display or massive display port. I don't see. Yeah, that's odd. I just
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:24.940]   assumed that maybe I should send it back you think and get the EGPU. That has thunder that has HDMI.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:29.820]   Yeah and Thunderbolt 3 plus it looks cool. It does. This is Thunderbolt 3 though. That's
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:33.900]   like bow ties and fizzes they look cool. Yeah. All right.
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:42.620]   Okay. I didn't spend enough so I had to get a $200 piece of leather. Turn the piece of leather
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:46.940]   and get the EGPU. Oh there you go. If I just not bought the piece of leather. Oh you can take it
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:51.020]   back us within two weeks. I'll get this Belkin bring the Belkin and the leather back and get the
[00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:55.340]   EGPU for only a hundred bucks more. How about that? Now how much would you pay?
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:43:02.940]   How much how much how expensive does a MacBook Pro have to be before they start
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:09.100]   including things inside the box instead of charging $15, $30, $50 for you to be an extension
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:14.540]   cord. Remember that? Now you got to buy the extension cord. It's even free. I know. It's super
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:20.860]   annoying. That's you know but again I think this is this is as Alex's point. This is to an
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:26.620]   incense price insensitive market that just wants the power and I bet a lot of pros are happy with the
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:33.820]   exception of those who are waiting got through WWDC with no hardware announcement and then said
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:38.060]   well I guess I'll better buy my MacBook Pro now and now we're outside the two week return time
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:43.500]   which must be fairly upsetting. Did Apple address that? Why didn't they say this a month ago? Why
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:48.940]   didn't they say this was coming a month ago or six weeks ago when they had WWDC? They're not
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:52.380]   trying there's no vaporware required. You know they they they don't generally want to announce
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:59.420]   anything that isn't shipping. They still haven't shipped the charger. Right. They're trying to tell
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:03.500]   you that it's coming that way you don't buy something else you know same way with it. Don't
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:09.100]   keep on buying more Amazon you know echoes because we're going to put out a speaker. Right.
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:13.020]   Don't do that. I also think they didn't mess the MacBook Pro because they wanted to continue to
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:18.700]   sell the 2017. Also it was unclear exactly like Intel's roadmap is so unclear right now that I
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:22.060]   think you know to certify those chips and get everything done. They probably didn't want to
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.940]   promise that it and then not deliver it on top of everything else that you're wrong.
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:29.500]   Yeah. I'm not sure they didn't read to realize the i9 platform is what two and a half years old
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:35.180]   three years old at this point? No I think two years old. So yeah i9 that didn't didn't they
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:42.860]   announce it and I'm sorry no the 2017 the i9. I thought that was a that's a KB Lake
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:47.020]   that's a fairly. This is a coffee. This is a yeah this is the coffee.
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:51.340]   Very good. I'm sorry. Coffee Lake. I think it's fairly new.
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:54.700]   The six core right. But this is but this is the first i9 we've seen in the MacBook Pro
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:45:00.300]   heavenly. And we were supposed to be at Cannon Lake last year. You're right. May 2017 the i9s
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:05.740]   were announced but but that's not the that was those were that was coffee. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:09.420]   The mobiles are coffee like okay. But like but like Renee says that's the thing
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:16.860]   the Mac Pro line particularly in this in this generation of of Apple's tenure it really is about
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:26.860]   you know. They want screw you this is fast. Yeah. They want like hold hold a raw egg
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:32.940]   within a foot of this and it becomes hard boiled in about 12 seconds. They really want that sort of
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:39.340]   this is this is a suspiciously fast machine. So if they if they had any Intel top line
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:44.300]   CPU that they felt good in any way work in a MacBook Pro we would have seen it another at least
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:49.340]   generation ago. So that underscores what Renee says. Let me clear. I'm sorry. I'm really
[00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:55.660]   clarifying this mobile part the coffee Lake 14 nanometer part i9 was announced only in April
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:46:01.660]   to which is which is exactly to your point Renee which is the Apple has the the you
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:08.460]   very I forget which one it is. This is the 8950HK 583 dollars is the part which also
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:13.260]   explains a little bit the price. This is an expensive part. Yeah. I mean everyone's got to
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:19.180]   get their margins. It's it's yeah it's been unclear sort of went into I think also the power mat sorry
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:23.740]   the power air power. That part of that I think was Apple's announcing their first Qi
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:28.780]   devices and they wanted to show that they were deeply behind the Qi standard and they intended
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:32.460]   to ship earlier and it just hadn't worked out. I wanted it to be this. We're going to be here.
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:35.660]   We're we're not just doing this flop and thing. We're going to really help move Qi forward.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:40.300]   Perhaps this is hard. Oh I think Alex is right also. You don't want to Osborne your your
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:44.300]   divide your your computers by announcing something the next thing too early. Yeah.
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:51.340]   I think we're going to face facts of schedules that we thought were pretty easy to predict
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:55.980]   on out completely up in the air. It's not just the fact they have this new campus and they can
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:00.620]   they have demo areas and they have theaters that they can use whenever. I really think their philosophy
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:07.420]   now is that why we really the only deadline that's kind of sacrosanct is new phones in September.
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:11.420]   Anything else in that it's like yeah I suppose I suppose people are expecting them during
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:14.060]   WWDC but what can you do? We're going to do it a couple of weeks later.
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:19.660]   And it's not it's not good for the company to to do things even even in September.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:25.180]   The September announcement that we usually assume is not super good because that means that
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:29.500]   like in August people stop buying phones. You know they they you know anyone who knows anything
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:33.420]   or anyone who's spending any time looking at iPhones is not going to in their right mind by
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:37.420]   iPhone in August. I mean some people do but it's because they broke it or dropped it in the water
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.700]   or something like that. They just go out and buy another one or they're not paying attention.
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:44.780]   They don't care but anybody who's really going to go after that brand new phone and
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:49.100]   stop buying them. And so I think that regularity becomes it's good because it gives them a cycle
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:53.020]   to work on but I think it becomes harder because and so I think that with everything else other
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:59.260]   than the iPhone which is really paying for everything. The I think it makes sense for them to not
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:02.940]   to be unpredictable you know to keep you just buying until they have something new.
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:07.340]   I think they're also I mean I think their attitude isn't iPhone obviously they have to get that out
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:10.540]   every year and they feel real pressure and would play adversely affect the stock price if they
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:14.140]   didn't. But everything else it's like I don't think they ever hold anything back as soon as it's
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.980]   if it's not ready they don't ship it they wait till the next window to ship it. If it's a new
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:22.700]   product it needs an announcement so it has to wait till March or WWDC or September or October.
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:27.020]   If it doesn't they do one of these things either it's a press release or a briefing or something
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:35.260]   else they just get it out as fast as they can. Anything else to say about the new Mac books?
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:39.660]   I'm pretty excited Renee have you done any benchmarking yet or anything like that?
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:43.740]   I don't typically do benchmarking because sites like a Nantec are so good at it. I don't want to
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:49.580]   do my weak ass version of it. I was going to do my weak ass version of it but what I wanted to do
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:54.620]   is compare it to the iMac Pro because I think in some in some processes it'll actually be faster
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:59.260]   than the iMac Pro. And also for people who do like i know Marco likes to joke about putting his iMac
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:03.660]   Pro and is slaying and going off to Starbucks but not sorry best full kooky coffee shop.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:09.900]   I don't actually think he's joking. I think he actually does. I've seen pictures of people on
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:15.100]   the subway with iMac pros in their lap as they go. But for other people they just want to be
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:19.660]   able to disconnect it and take it with them and for them the mobility is more important so the
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:23.820]   portability is part and parcel of the performance. I think that's why the eGPU is actually
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:33.580]   makes sense. When you're at your desk you'll have something similar to an iMac Pro but you can
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:37.180]   still then unplug it and carry it. I'm blanking. It's the biggest message that a lot of the pros
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:40.540]   and they've all been using it for about two weeks had is that it's similar to the iMac Pro
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:45.660]   that they could get down to these real time workflows. One of the women models molecules for a
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.900]   university and she was working on modeling the HIV lifecycle and she was saying with a previous
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:55.740]   MacBook Pro the most she could do was VNC into her workstation to use Maya and now she's doing
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:50:01.100]   everything but the final render on this MacBook Pro and that to her was a huge convenience upgrade.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:09.980]   Nice. Yeah the the CPU that they're using even a non to let's see an on says it's the
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:21.260]   the i7 is the 8750H they don't I don't see the let's see 2018 maybe I don't see it.
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:26.860]   I'm just looking at a non-zarticle I don't even they don't seem to have the part number
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:36.380]   for the i9 so no it is it's the 8950HK it's the one I was 17 i7 will be the 8750H
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:47.260]   i9 is the 8950HK that's the only one until offers so all right let's take a break come back
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:52.060]   there's still a lot more to talk about the minute we ended the show last week John Janandrea who was
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:58.860]   very sharp hire from Google received new assignments at Apple we'll talk about that
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:05.020]   and a lot more Mac break weekly has finally some Mac news to talk to talk about.
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:11.740]   Our show today brought to you by slack we I just I think slack has changed the way people work it's
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:16.620]   you know on the face of it it looks like a messaging program but really what it is is a
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:22.940]   collaboration hub for work whatever work you do it's it keeps your team in the loop
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:29.180]   the information the right people need is always there at the right time teamwork on slack happens
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:34.780]   in channels which means you organize conversations and information around projects around offices
[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:41.740]   around teams however you want but the organization really is awesome and of course because your history
[00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:46.780]   is always there there's never any question it's it's better than email it's the fastest easiest
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:54.140]   way to get things done send less email streamline your team's communication all the tools and
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:59.900]   services you need are connected through slack so everything's in there it allows you to organize
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:06.700]   your team with real-time messaging and video and voice calls group file sharing searchable archives
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:12.060]   all in one easy to use and I don't think we should minimize this beautiful app I think one of the
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:18.460]   reasons slack is so popular especially with you know Macintosh folks is it's just good looking
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:23.740]   slack saves time and improves productivity you don't have to switch across multiple tabs and
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:27.900]   platforms to keep updated with work if you use JIRA or Salesforce or Zendesk or Google driver
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:35.500]   whatever you can drag and drop file sharing you can tailor it to work with more than 1,000 apps
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:40.780]   what you do is go to slack.com just see some of the integrations available there's also some fun
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:50.300]   stuff there's lots of fun stuff I don't so some of my there's a Borat one whenever and I was mad
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:55.020]   because when we were working with our web team every time I typed that's nice which I typed a
[00:52:55.020 --> 00:53:01.580]   lot apparently Borat would pop up and say that's nice and then there was there's my favorite plugin
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:06.780]   which I want to duplicate in our ISC room is a is a jeopardy plugin an Alex Trebek plugin that
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:11.820]   you can say let's play jeopardy so awesome so you can get it's fun too but mostly you're going to get
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:19.340]   things done with slack your team is better connected learn more at slack.com just a big plug for
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:26.860]   one of the best apps for keeping things on track ever slack.com
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:40.460]   Apple hired Google's head of search some time ago John Gendrea he joined to Apple in April he'd
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:47.420]   been at Google since 2010 including bringing AI at Google to Google Assistant to Gmail Google
[00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:52.860]   search knowledge graph now Apple's announced that Gendrea who reports directly to Tim Cook
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:58.620]   is and this is on the company's leadership page is now in charge of machine language and
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:03.900]   artificial intelligence and covering his chief of machine learning and AI strategy he's covering
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:13.180]   Siri and core ML so I think this is actually really good news this guy is very sharp and he has by
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:19.980]   the way a very good looking me emoji yes just in time to be the emoji is this going to be just
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:25.340]   today or they're going to do this for world emoji it is world emoji day as we know because of the
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:34.860]   cupcakes but yeah all of the Apple leadership is now me emoji that's silly that's really silly.
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:41.180]   I have the exact opposite hair from Johnny Suruji but the hair seems to be the biggest
[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:46.220]   distinguishing feature frankly and all of these. They got they got to work on the eyes they
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:52.540]   they're super super creepy for one thing when you see 11 sets of those like children of the corn
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:57.500]   yeah children of the time Johnny and I that's scary you just still can't smile well that's
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:01.420]   there might be an emiraphetamine problem at Apple that's what I'm worried about.
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:08.220]   Wow I said Mike we're legally we're covered I'm saying Mike.
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:12.700]   So just out of curiosity you think Tim Cook designed his own or do you think he had
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:18.380]   people who did that form. I don't know I mean I again I once saw him grab a well not grab we
[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:22.940]   once saw him take a an iPad from the marketing team and do a hands-on demo for a bunch of people
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:27.740]   at an event so he did he definitely is deep in how everything works and I do notice they didn't get
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:35.020]   the board to do it like you didn't get Al Gore to do a me emoji Bob Iger didn't do it me emoji the
[00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:38.940]   board is just a G. But they would have I think a lot of them would have yeah you're right if they
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:43.100]   had on the board of Apple in fact they're probably they're probably gonna be like hey why why why
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:50.620]   didn't you do a me emoji for us a lot of me emoji I love it we should have done the whole
[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:54.380]   show with me much easily we shouldn't have was still possibly so anything to say about
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:59.420]   Gian Andrea I think this is good news I think he's great I mean he did a series of talks about
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:03.660]   the ethics of AI and it seemed to be something he was deeply concerned about it wasn't just
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:07.740]   like because some people just care about engineering AI but there's other people who care about how
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:12.540]   that AI is going to affect us and how it's going to be used and about not just being pure AI but
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:17.740]   being AI that works with and in collaboration with humans and it seems like Apple was a really good
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:23.580]   fit just for his philosophy of AI at the same time Apple really desperately needed leadership in
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:29.420]   that area that Siri team has had issues for years and the ML team was brand new and it was sort of
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:33.100]   scattered across the company because different organized like the silicon team have been using
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:38.620]   AI for one thing and the software engineering for another thing and services again and I always
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:41.980]   think when you have an owner it's like when the App Store got an owner even though it was Phil
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:47.420]   Schiller long standing Apple person when one person is the front face of it and one person is responsible
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:52.620]   all these long standing issues seem to disappear and I think it's the same thing for AI used like
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:55.900]   at the end of the day now he is the person who's going to be held accountable for everything from
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:57:01.500]   Siri to machine learning to computer vision to natural language all of those things and that
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:03.980]   in and of itself I think motivates everyone to get it right.
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:11.340]   Apple has released a fix to the do you want to say something any before we know just just just
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:15.180]   quick comment that I think that there is a line between Apple cares about this or Apple doesn't
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:20.380]   care about this they care about every product that they they continue to make but some things are
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:25.580]   priority some things are not a priority and they need a product needs a cheerleader or service needs
[00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:29.100]   a cheerleader within the company say no we're definitely going to do this and not this other thing
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:35.100]   so that's why this is sort of an important hire. I presume you've all installed the big update
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:42.620]   to iOS 11.4.1 I'm just checking to make sure oh yeah this is the one that makes it harder for
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:47.980]   law enforcement to access lock phones we talked about it last week right after we did the show
[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:55.100]   Security Research or Patrick Wardle noticed there was another fix apparently Apple I we got
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:58:01.420]   only speculate had added some code to appease the Chinese government when you typed Taiwan
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:10.460]   yeah into into messages or you got a message containing a Taiwanese flag emoji the vice crashed
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:17.500]   it's basically a denial of service attack it could have just been a coincidence well but we do know
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:23.260]   the Chinese government does not recognize Taiwan and considers it I think but it wasn't wasn't
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:28.460]   the reporting on that that Apple had introduced that code at the at the request of China they just
[00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:34.940]   did it quickly and they introduced a bug oh what was that what was it supposed to do it was supposed
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:40.860]   again China does not acknowledge Taiwan so therefore the Chinese version of iOS if you tried it was
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:46.780]   supposed to basically suppress a Taiwanese flag suppress mention excuse me not I'm sorry the word
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:51.900]   Taiwan because Taiwan does not exist country suppress the Taiwanese flag because again the
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:57.020]   tried the Taiwan doesn't have a flag it's part of China so yeah Wardle traced the likely purpose
[00:58:57.020 --> 00:59:01.980]   of the buggy code according to ours tech to documented the iOS behavior that hides the Taiwanese
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:06.940]   flag from the emoji menu or from being displayed on the screen when the region is set to China
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:14.940]   I'm getting a little fed up with Americans and American countries companies appeasing
[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:20.540]   dictators and authoritarian regimes you know it's time to stop doing that
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:27.820]   real real real especially because China is exceptionally pissy about Taiwan remember that the
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:32.940]   I think was Marriott hotels they did an update they had some sort of a form or some sort of a
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:39.020]   a web form where they just simply introduced used whatever module they used to populate a form with
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:45.180]   select your country and because they just simply copied in this this external module it included
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:51.740]   Taiwan as one of these selectable pop-up lists and China basically slapped them down super hard
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:58.700]   turned off all access to Marriott's domain names through the the grape firewall of China and
[00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:05.260]   not only did Marriott go if I'm remembering correctly the name of the hotel chain not only did Marriott
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:14.060]   basically make sure that was removed from the web form they had the most groveling apology
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:20.220]   that they fired the guy too didn't they right it was we apologize for having caused such
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:27.340]   horrible offense to the government it's I'm really sad that these American companies are doing this
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:35.340]   course dictators overreact that's what they do because they're authoritarian and it's time for
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:40.060]   American companies to start deciding whether they uh I mean you know what is is it money more
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:48.540]   important than supporting free free human ideals yeah again I'll I'll just say I will collapse my
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:54.140]   usual 15 minute rant down to 30 seconds that it's becoming more and more important for Tim Cook to
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:59.660]   make sure to make it clear that there is a line that apple will not cross because I'm for all we
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:05.900]   know they're they he's already taken very brave and very very risky stands inside closed doors with
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:12.220]   closed meetings but when we hear about this that they're that simply having a flag as part of an
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:18.940]   emoji kit is going to be such an incredible problem that they are removing it from a billion users
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:25.100]   that makes us worry that again what if they what if your if your country country code is turkey
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:29.100]   we need to activate certain code that says are you a journalist well great we're going to make
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:32.780]   sure we send all of your traffic and all of your contacts to the government to make sure that we
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:39.020]   can make you part of the next uh 500 journalists uh that get put into prison so I don't like it I
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:43.740]   don't think they would do that but now we have to we don't know where the line is we have to make
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:48.460]   sure that apple is now saying if they're gonna do these things I'm not saying necessarily every
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:53.180]   one of these things is wrong I'm saying that we need to know where that line is or that there
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:59.660]   even that there is a line sorry that was more than 30 seconds but I'm with you 100 percent it's
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:03.420]   becoming more and more important that we stand up to these authoritarian regimes period
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:10.780]   uh I understand it's a billion customers okay so you're saying and the money is more important
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:15.820]   okay I got it oh and also it's the easiest what you don't want the iPhone to become a tool of
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:21.660]   oppression and that's exactly what can happen if you keep cotowing to the whims of a government
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:27.900]   that wants to continue to surveil its people and also and I want to keep being this guy that
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:33.900]   once it happens in one country it's easy for it to happen everywhere and history shows us that
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:38.460]   you know you don't like it somewhere else but you start doing it almost immediately and it's
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:43.260]   once it happens in china it'll happen in europe it'll happen in north america it's just it's one
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:47.500]   of those things that you you can't let it get any beachhead into your thinking well and I think that
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:52.700]   I think that some degree apple has drawn some pretty hard lines about access to the phone which we
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:58.540]   think is probably globally um you know it's not preventing access to the phone definitely doesn't
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:02.460]   do it in the united states probably doesn't do it in china i think it looks like it's a lot more
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:08.140]   flexible on on other on other things like getting rid of the flag but i think that they're not
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:13.820]   capitulating a hundred percent yet uh you know i do you know i think that the i think they're just
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:17.020]   looking at their market i mean it's just a it's corporation i mean they're not you know they're
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:21.180]   just making money yeah they're still going they're still going by the maxim that we are
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:25.180]   pollet they're they're standard boy the plate responses that are policies to obey the laws of
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:30.700]   laws and customs of the local region which we operate and one of the things that i have no doubt
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:35.500]   whatsoever that they are virantly opposed to what the government is our government is asking them to
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:41.340]   do to make sure that law enforcement can get into encrypted phones but the question comes what if
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:46.460]   and this is such a wacky wacky state of politics right now what if they do pass a law saying that is
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:51.260]   now illegal to have any sort of encryption on a on a device sold in the united states without
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:55.900]   some sort of provision for law enforcement be able to get in there is apple going to say screw you
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:04:00.540]   we're not gonna we're not gonna do that we're just simply not well russian russian russian
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:06.300]   russian does that by the way it's uh... ecriptions illegal in russia i don't know what apple does about
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:10.860]   i funds and russian they negotiate very that that's their so far that is their line in the sand where
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:16.140]   they have with the u_s with france with china with everybody is that they are agreeing to things like
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:20.460]   cloud and things like uh... and patreon of data because they do not want
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:23.260]   uh... any sort of back door put into their systems
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:27.420]   yeah i mean after all not putting a time when he's flagging the emojis is
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.420]   it's not a human rights issue
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:33.500]   but but is a slippery slope it's a slippery slope
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:36.780]   i'm returning this piece of junk two hundred dollar letter pass
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:42.300]   he convinced me he changed me into it yeah i just hope i hope i hope to help they don't make a hermaz
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:45.820]   version because it'll be five hundred dollars
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:48.860]   let's talk about let's cheer let's cheer everybody up new emojis
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:52.140]   seventy new emojis coming to ios
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:56.140]   it's world emoji day happy world emoji day everybody
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:05:02.060]   emojis are the greatest thing you don't need the time when he's flagging your emojis come on
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:06.300]   if you go to the link on the apple and you have some nice animated
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:11.340]   ifs yeah this is from apples newsroom so they've animated these you could see now that
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:15.500]   people like me with gray hair are suddenly represented
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.300]   you get the nearest i carry it and storm from the x-men
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:19.660]   yeah it's going to say
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:26.380]   have you have you found yourself not like when you're testing the new new ios 12 have you
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:30.540]   have you noticed that you're not using other emojis nearly as much
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:33.820]   no once you have me mojis because you've got my mojis yeah i don't use
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:37.580]   what i mean i notice i haven't used a me mojis since i got ios 12
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:40.060]   oh i use it all the time but the my biggest complaint is i don't
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:44.860]   yeah but i don't my biggest complaint is that i don't want sound i want i need to have
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:48.060]   something that just says mute because a lot of times i you know i just want to do facial
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:50.940]   expressions you know you do have a moji without sound catch your nay
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:55.740]   because it does sound automatically and i don't think you can't do it but i just want to do that
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:06:00.620]   surprise expression all the time i know exactly what i'll do yeah yeah so i do these funny i'll
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:05.740]   do these funny uh i find them much closer to what i much closer to how i feel when i when i do it
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:10.140]   myself but you get all this ambient noise so if you're at the airport or something like that it
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:14.700]   all comes through and then then it just seems weird like when it didn't have any noise it was fine
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:18.140]   when it's really weird when you're not making any noise and you're making facial expressions
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.820]   it's just uh should get a viewpoint i'm gonna file that radar i'll file that radar Andy
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:28.300]   to your Alex if we wanted to do a show with me mojis is there a way rene we could
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:33.980]   replace you guys with me mojis i think you do it through face time we'd have to use face time
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:37.660]   for each face time yeah once we all have the new face time installed we could do it easily
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:44.060]   and you have ios 12 and some beauty it would be carsten's problem at that point is what i'm saying
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:49.180]   then we have then we'd have to use max on this end because right now i think we use windows machines
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:54.860]   uh all right we need we need to three three max no four because i'd have to be
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:07:00.380]   it would be a call though oh yeah well we could do individual calls that's what we need
[01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:04.060]   you could yeah the same way you do it with skype you just give individual calls you mix
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:09.420]   minuses back to each one um and we just do it otherwise yeah we have the capability of doing that
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:15.420]   yeah uh we just need four max we could probably cobble together four max when faced out for
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:23.580]   uh max out is it on mojavi it's just beta right it's just mojavi right now it's working a bit iffy
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:26.940]   but we can give it okay well we'll wait we'll wait till it's a little stable maybe then
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:30.220]   maybe to celebrate the release of mojavi we'll do the whole show on me mojis
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:34.700]   finally we're gonna have to shave i'm all for this
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:42.700]   and then is there a way oh max don't have face ID so how does that work oh that's true it's only
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:47.580]   iPhone 10 that can do the emoji oh you'd only we need to have to yeah we don't have to be on
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:52.380]   iPhone 10s i have a okay i have an iPhone 10 i can do that and then i could sit here but i'd
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:57.180]   have to i have an i phone 10 in front of me yes no it'll be great you'll want to you'd have to
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:03.260]   garbage map my head onto my body you'll be you'll be like one of those like uh like actors in an
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:07.580]   avengers movie where the real thing is actually just you with like a bicycle helmet with like a
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:12.140]   phone like a camera basically but in front of you like on a goose arm you'll be great
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:18.780]   they can motion you can motion track you up i think we'll have to wait on Alex's in studio to do this
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:24.860]   the fewer people than studio no that's right we don't want him to studio but we want his help
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:31.900]   okay we put he put him in my my office to do it because you want to do you want to do internet uh
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:35.980]   you know we'll do want to ethernet to the phones oh lord it's not going to be easy
[01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:40.380]   yeah ethernet to the phones and then you just and then to get good to get good audio you want
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:43.580]   ethernet to the phone and then you want through the headphone jack you want to use an xlarta
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:50.860]   to you know xlarta rr's connector headphone jack we didn't yet oh it might be it where's the head
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:57.820]   phone jack it might be simpler you just like if rana just like sort of fly out to san francisco
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:06.540]   and we do it in person oh which would be the perfect apple demo we're actually physically in
[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:11.340]   the same room together but we're going to use incredible amount of technology to do something
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:14.940]   heroically stupid anyway you and your girlfriend are playing world of work craft and messaging
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:19.740]   instead of talking that's actually how we used to do satellite calls at tech tv we just put the
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:24.460]   guy on the other side of the studio pretending he was on a satellite you know it's a lot cheaper
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:28.860]   when you've toured when you've toured as many studios as i have people still do that a lot
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:33.740]   too there is a lot of we have oh yeah yeah when you see uh sunday morning especially you see all
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:38.380]   these shows and and if you've been in a lot of the studios you're like ah that that's over in the
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:44.380]   corner but they do that probably to give them parodies so that i i know it's a problem here even
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:48.860]   if we have one person in studio and two people on skype it's a little bit of a disadvantage for
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:52.140]   the people on school well they have a model a lot of them have broadcast models you know that this
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:55.900]   is the way we when we're interviewing this person they're gonna explain this way yeah we don't want
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:59.340]   them to you know especially if we're gonna do a one-on-one we don't want to have it be yeah especially
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:04.860]   if you're doing like a conservative and then a liberal one-on-one advantage yeah yeah even if
[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:08.940]   they're one after the other you don't have one feel like he got they got brought in and so they
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:13.420]   just put them both in the same box and they and then they just do it that way every week for whoever
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:17.820]   is going to be interviewed to tell her about the television insert yeah which is a little less
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:25.660]   magic so you think this is the canadian emoji because it's so cold yeah it's me that's me that's
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:31.660]   Renee in the winter so you're I thought that was the one in the cape and I'm the one in the
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:37.740]   lobster kangaroo yeah these are apples versions of these which actually are quite beautiful very
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:42.940]   three-dimensional yeah now can I now can I can I make a prediction yeah it might be based on my
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:48.700]   saying this I would predict that sometime in the next revision apple is going to change the color
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:54.860]   the lobster emoji so that it's like green and black and a little streaks of blue because red is the
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:11:00.940]   color of a cooked lobster and most lobsters are cooked like while alive which is cruel I'm guessing
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:05.580]   that I think that if someone has not already thought about this if this gets out because I've
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:10.220]   talked about it I would not be shocked if they change they decided to change it as a really really
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:15.660]   subtle thing to say let's not be let's let's let's change all cruelty to animals and remove
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:21.180]   them from the emoji list oh man there's been like how's I protest about that since the spec for the
[01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:26.380]   new version of emojis have been released I think we're complaining about it it's going to ruin the
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:34.060]   whole hotel chain you're gonna hold a hotel chain I've always said nothing I fully respect
[01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:38.220]   people who are vegetarians and vegans and all that other sort of stuff but I'm saying that if
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:43.100]   there's no better proof that the lobster was meant to be eaten it's a one-step cooking process and
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:48.540]   it changes color when it's done god meant for a student you can you can have every other creature
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:51.580]   I think clearly god meant for us to eat this one creature
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:12:01.260]   apple I've downloaded all of the the jpegs of these emojis and I'm loading them up all at once
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:06.380]   and it's kind of an interesting experience uh when window do you think that do you think making
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:12.780]   these emojis is either the most fun job at apple or the most tedious that I had no idea what a
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:17.980]   mechanical how to make a mechanical pencil fit in with this is design aesthetic why am I doing a
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:22.860]   mechanical pencil we have a pencil already well they you know of course uh the uh
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:30.540]   Unicode group that does emojis uh gives you a reference design yeah which is usually fairly
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:37.980]   ugly and so then uh you can you can take that with their controversy today because google said
[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:41.660]   they're moving away from the glob and then all of google reddit said I am the glob and the glob is
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:48.460]   me i am glob is me god reddit reddit reddit what will we speak in a bush we were just in the middle
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:53.900]   of a google outage it's just now debate yeah google app engine and cloud and whatever sorry google
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:59.340]   cloud all the logins were down just come on over there google because during the uh one of the
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:05.740]   semi-finals of the world cup I lost google tv at youtube tv for like an hour and then amazon
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:09.580]   yesterday I mean we used to be able to rely on what's going on with amazon yeah we use to rely on
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:16.220]   amazon prime day overwhelmed amazon and cn cn was down this afternoon
[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:20.860]   so keep in keep in mind that we were warned last week that we are under
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:26.300]   affect the infrastructure is a rescue attack is it the roosteries i that's been on my mind since
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:30.220]   that since i noticed last week yeah they said they were getting the same kind of chatter they got
[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:39.340]   before 9/11 oh yeah yeah it just it seems uh it seems incredible that uh amazon would go out of
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:45.900]   would go down on its own because of its own fault on prime day yeah i mean these guys have more
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:52.780]   bandwidth than god yeah they run the bandwidth for everybody else yeah yes so rene uh i'll give
[01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:55.820]   you a plug i don't know if this is going to be your pick of the week for thrifter but i'll give
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:14:01.900]   you a plug okay you guys are doing a great job if you gone in the war room are they like smoking
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:07.740]   cigarettes and drinking coffee or an amazing an absolutely amazing team they often get to i don't
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:11.660]   know if they did this time but for black fight they all got a room together a condo together
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:17.020]   and they were just nailing it but they literally they go through they check every deal they and
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:19.980]   again i don't want to plug my own stuff here but they check every deal they check the historic
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:24.140]   prices they make sure it's a real deal and let a lie deal that there's actually quantity available
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:29.740]   and they update it constantly and they are they are like super passionate about yeah yeah this is
[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:37.260]   awesome yeah they're doing thrifter thrifter.com TA car and they have a Canada version too so you can
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:41.020]   there's a thrifter Canada and i think a thrifter uk now as well i think you launch that in time
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:46.300]   yeah oh look at yeah so prices are there's some good prices on here there's some good stuff i
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:51.900]   you know but you got to know if it's a good deal or not and that's where thrifter and we'll
[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:57.980]   mention of course the wire cutter is also doing this combine them both and uh oh finally i could
[01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:05.980]   throw the old rubber made easy fine 60 piece set out and get the new ones yeah it's a must have it says
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:11.020]   like again i mean like buy what you want but i always recommend like if there are if there is
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:14.620]   stuff that you know that you want look for the sales for that stuff because it's very easy to get
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:19.580]   caught up in it um you know and especially now when people are begging for distraction from real
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:25.740]   life but if they're plant purchases you have check this seed because not just amazon but like walmart
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:29.420]   a lot of companies trying to counter program amazon so check around you can get some really
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:34.060]   good deals on the stuff that you want yeah absolutely that that in that we've already i think Alex
[01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:39.820]   and i've already gotten a couple of thank yous or at request for okay the the anova suv cooker
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:43.820]   that you keep talking about was it was actually increased like down to 80 bucks so a lot of people
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:50.060]   are buying them and i think it's it's great Alex oh here's a here's a try here's a steak tips with
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:55.020]   the garlic and butter and da da da da da da and i said okay we'll get a micro get a microwave burrito
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:16:01.180]   from the store and use that as your food i bought my anova on prime day last year because of you guys
[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:05.820]   yeah i got a good deal on it i thought i thought i thought a second one i use it all the time yeah i
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:10.860]   have a couple well i have two because i have the mellow as well and there have been times and
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:15.580]   i've got two things going i did it by the way little tip for anybody i'll give you a tip
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:24.540]   uh for anybody who has a uh trader joe's uh around they have uh practically suvied ready
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:30.700]   marinated like we got a spatchcock chicken and brine we got a i get their try tips
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:35.740]   and they're already in the marinated and they're in a vacuum sealed bag you throw it in the suvie i
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:42.460]   i did it i do the trader joe's uh try tip for 24 hours and then we threw it on the grill for
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:46.060]   a couple of minutes just a brown on each side of that thing is the best thing i ever had in my life
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:51.900]   it's like butter yeah yeah my my uh the first time i did that the safe way has them as well they
[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:57.820]   have these like pre you know marinated um and uh i i got i got one in the morning and i just threw it
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:03.020]   in and then and then uh that evening you know it was the first years ago but i i brought it out
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:08.460]   and i cut it up and and when i when i my you know carlita made all of the other stuff so she made
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:11.980]   the the potatoes and everything else but she didn't really do a lot she just kind of threw
[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:15.180]   something together microwave didn't put it out and when as soon as you took a bite out of the
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:19.740]   steak she was just like well if i knew you were gonna put this much work into it and i like the
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:24.860]   yeah i slave it all day over a hot day i literally took i bought a bag and i threw it into the water
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:30.540]   and then i turned the grill on and then i that was it i know you know it's so good but it was amazing
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:36.620]   i cooked it 135 degrees so it's it's medium rare it was pink on the inside it was perfect
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:42.140]   and because tri-tip can be kind of tough and stringy it's it's after 24 hours it's just it's
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:48.700]   beautiful yeah my wife you carlita loves she insists that the tri-tips are at least 24 hours like she's
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:53.260]   now used to it like she won't she does not want me to she's like it's only been in for eight hours i
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:57.900]   really think we should just wait until tomorrow oh she she's so yeah because if you look online
[01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:03.100]   it's everything from two hours to four days there's a lot of money right now i know i'm so
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:08.540]   happy now if you i did forget i did forget one of those i i forgot to try to i mean remember the original
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:14.220]   sous vide was like a box that was like it was uh a metal box that was closed and it didn't make any
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:21.580]   noise at all and it just sat there and i i forgot one and i i forgot it and um and when i when i came back
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:25.660]   like three weeks later because i was traveling i came back like three weeks later and it was it
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:29.820]   was liquid like in just case you're wondering what happens with the sous vide it just turns into
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:33.980]   this liquid mush with little bits it just gets it breaks down the yeah breaks down the protein
[01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:38.380]   usually you want to get it out before like unless you're going for like a 24-hour brisket you want
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:43.500]   to get it out within like three hours but what i i love what i love love love about it is that
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:47.980]   there are times where like i'm cooking i'm doing fancy cooking and i'll use the sous vide because
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:52.540]   again it makes me look really really good although meats come out great everything comes out wonderful
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:59.740]   and i also use it for again well all my freezer is usually filled with like uh black beans uh that
[01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:05.660]   i black beans and chicken breasts that i cooked like on sunday vacuum sealed tossed in the freezer
[01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:12.220]   stuff like a general pows chicken in bulk you can get it in the grocery store but i then like parcel
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:17.340]   out into like onceing portions so if you just anything that's like been cooked and is frozen you
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:22.220]   can reheat it perfectly in the sous vide and so it's both for the fancy cooking and also the
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:28.940]   i've been working from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. i don't want to think about cooking anything i want to open
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:34.620]   a bag dump that bag into a plate or a bowl eat it and then move on with my life so it's better it's
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:40.380]   it's you make your own lean cuisines with it and they're better we we we i we ragged on apples
[01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:44.540]   so let me give them some credit apple partners with the melala foundation they're going to fight
[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:51.260]   for equal opportunity in education for girls in brazil uh they put some significant dough into this
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:57.340]   so that's thank you apple for see i think you know i don't know if that makes up for but i know
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:06.460]   that they care and that's uh that's good uh apple's being sued over the do not disturb while driving
[01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:13.660]   technology smt m technology says oh no we have a patent on driving detection and automated responses
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:21.980]   um the patent is mobile device inactive mode inactive mode verification granted to inventor
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:29.980]   nick bovis in 2015 he applied in 2014 of course bovis doesn't own an a more smt m acquired the
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:37.980]   patent and is now going after apple bovis created an off-mode application for android in 2013 so it
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:45.340]   is actually a fairly similar patent uh when the when the android device was connected to a bluetooth
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:49.660]   system the app would temporarily block calls text messages and notifications that could
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:54.220]   distract a driver it is true i've been aware of some of stuff like this on android for some time
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:21:01.100]   this guy says this company says we have the patent so um seems like apple probably should
[01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:05.020]   this it's not exactly a patent role in this case it is a non-practicing entity but
[01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:10.300]   there was a there was something that did exactly the same thing apple has killed an app in the app
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:21.020]   store called q drops which was basically a conspiracy theory app uh based on the pizza gate
[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:27.260]   and it would uh i guess i guess push notifications out developer of q drops a husband and wife team
[01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:33.020]   out of north carolina the app was 99 cents it's also on the google play store and is still there
[01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:41.900]   q drops twitter account is active um apple it's interesting because i apple you know clearly
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:49.260]   approved it in the first place there's no secondary use for this and every a company is going to
[01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:55.100]   start to get under much much tighter scrutiny uh similar to what uh google and twitter and facebook
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:59.980]   are coming under to make sure that okay well you approve this app and this is being used by a foreign
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:07.020]   agent to just to basically to just to uh so disinformation during an election year what are you doing to
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:10.940]   make sure that that can't happen again that the people who say that they wrote this app are actually
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:15.580]   the people who wrote this app and how closely do you monitor every single thing that goes on
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:20.140]   inside this to make sure that you know this is going to be part of the business if you're running
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:26.060]   any sort of operation that puts things on phones at scale including app stores uh incidentally uh
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:36.380]   facebook still has info wars on on its site uh as a news source yeah yeah and info wars is as crazy
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:43.260]   if info horses Alex Jones uh radio fake radio but hey but hey a spokesperson
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:47.980]   spokesperson explained that we you know there are people on the left and on the right that our new
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:54.620]   source that are doing conflict both sides yeah out out like one of Alex's my favorite
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:23:00.940]   Alex theories is that there is a slave colony on Mars that is run by the US government
[01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:09.260]   he is such a I mean he screwed up one of our shows and so I'm I I have to do how do you do that
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:15.420]   show we were we were we were doing streams and uh and he just you're just very clear that he
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:21.820]   doesn't believe in anything no he just is out to get some money money to get not get eyeballs and
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:26.460]   make money yeah but but he's the guy you know he just just for you know whatever he you know
[01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:30.380]   we're just doing a show I'm not going to get into exactly what the show was but it was just a regular
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:34.540]   show and he just came storming into it like literally just storming to the middle of a show
[01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:38.860]   while you're recording and you know spitting on everybody while he's yelling and you know like
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:43.820]   just just a complete mess you know just in person he came in and yelled it was yelling and yeah
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:50.700]   yeah yeah yeah it was just maybe he's just nuts it was amazing he is borderline nuts but I think
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:55.740]   it's all just an act I think he's just a yeah he's just out for eyeballs and out I mean he's just
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:24:03.020]   taking that that that performance you know experience to assert to its end point you know of I don't
[01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:06.060]   think there's anything he believes in you know and I don't I don't I try to stay out of
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:10.460]   saying political stuff on and I don't have any thinking about his politics I'm just saying he
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:20.540]   personally is an idiot both these things can be true yes yeah yeah adobe says we're gonna put
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:26.380]   real Photoshop on the iPad maybe next year why Leo what's interesting timing what
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:36.620]   happened what is your theory Renee Richie I I'm a feeling that mobile first companies with much
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:42.620]   newer code base is made to laptop somebody like maybe affinity photo yeah yeah maybe and it's
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:49.900]   radically reframed the universe for them picks yeah yeah yeah yeah and actually what's really
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:56.780]   gonna fry Adobe's bacon is when Sarah or skylum or one of those companies comes out with a digital
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:03.500]   asset management part part to their stuff I think affinity could be really an interesting
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:08.460]   competitor if they do that because that's the one thing that nobody still does is handle
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:13.740]   photographs as well as Lightroom in terms of organization triage not just organization right
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:17.420]   but you come on with a thousand pictures where are the 13 that you actually want to do something
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:24.140]   with yeah but that's why I had to buy a back pro and a six thousand dollar laptop because it takes
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:30.540]   a long on a Lightroom it's just terrible isn't but isn't it great that even even in this day and age
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:34.060]   there's still an excuse to say oh that's gonna take a while I'll go out and get waffles and then
[01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:38.300]   come back no but that's the problem is you can't because you're going through your photos so one
[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:45.180]   okay yeah that's a good one next one you don't let you don't just like let them let them stew for
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:50.060]   about for a little while maybe it's take a while to make this smart that's see that's I usually I
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:54.620]   wait for it to finish building previews and then it's like boom boom boom boom boom boom boom yeah
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:58.860]   let it do all those previews first that's smart that was the biggest complaint about the new Macbook
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:02.620]   Pro is the guy who did the environmental photography and he said previously he'd put something on to
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:06.860]   render get up and go get a coffee and I put it on to render it as he was getting up finished he's
[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:12.780]   like oh this is great for my workflow terrible car I was your line I loved that line I read that
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:19.180]   that's funny terrible for my coffee let's take a break when we come back I think you guys could
[01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:24.940]   help us out with some pics what do you say pics of the weekend do coming up sounds like a plane sounds
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:31.900]   like a plan my friend our show day brought to you by rocket mortgage you know buying a home is a big
[01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:35.980]   deal right biggest check you'll ever write for sure biggest purchase you'll ever make and something
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:39.980]   you're gonna be living in for quite some time you want to make sure you do it right you don't
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:44.780]   want to be pressured to to find the right house too fast and with interest rates going up maybe
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:48.940]   that's exactly what's going on for you hey if we don't buy this house now we could cost us more
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:53.740]   next month and the month after the month after don't worry don't worry the best lender in the
[01:26:53.740 --> 01:27:01.740]   in the country quick and loans biggest as well as a solution no more anxiety with the power
[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:06.540]   buying process here's how it works first of all quick and loans will verify your income your assets
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:10.940]   and your credit as you know we've talked about this with rocket mortgage and and give you a verified
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:15.500]   approval in less than 24 hours now what does that do well that is already a great feeling because
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:19.740]   when you make an offer the seller treats it as cash because they know you're good for it there's
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:26.300]   no contingency I've got the loan give me the house so that's awesome but here's the here's the best
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:31.820]   part once you're verified you qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield approval they'll lock
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:36.940]   your rate up for up to 90 days while you shop you have three months to look at a house with no
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:42.620]   fear of the rate going up it can't you're locked in at that rate if it goes down yeah they'll lower it
[01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:47.980]   but they won't raise it so you win either way it's kind of amazing it's the thinking you'd
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:55.180]   expect from America's largest mortgage lender take the anxiety out of show them shopping go in there
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:28:01.980]   loaded and ready to buy to get started go to rocket mortgage comm slash mac break rate shield

[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:31.100]   support over the last couple of years for keeping mac break weekly on the air let's start with the
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:38.380]   expensive stuff Alex Lindsay your pick of the week mine isn't that expensive today um so there's a
[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:43.420]   I'm actually recommending a book uh that um good friend of mine is a guy named Andy Beach and
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:49.260]   there's a few people that I call when I like so a lot of people talk to me about live streaming
[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:54.860]   uh when I needed some input on encoding uh there's really two people you know Colleen Henry and
[01:28:54.860 --> 01:29:00.300]   and Andy who are the two people that I really go back to to talk to about you know issues that I
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:05.420]   might be dealing with and on uh and coding and so on so forth so Andy put out another a new
[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:12.140]   edition of his book uh on on encoding uh video compression uh handbook and it's just the best
[01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:15.820]   one out there and if you're trying to figure out how to this is this is my bible to
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:21.340]   uh figure out you know think through processes and how it works and how it might change it whether
[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:27.500]   it's encoding for VOD or live just really understanding you know what's going on there and how it works
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:33.260]   if this is something you're interested in uh that's that's the bible so um it just came out last week
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:38.380]   so I figured I would let people know new versions out there video compression handbook second edition
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:46.620]   you can get it uh on Amazon and paperback $49.99 Andy Beach and Aaron Owen all right I'll get
[01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:53.580]   a copy for our engineers because I it's a must-have in the in the uh technical library yeah absolutely
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:30:01.500]   great Andy and I co-pick of the week uh my new favorite app in the entire world it's a it is
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:09.020]   uh an app for the iPad called liquid text uh and what it's you the simple slug is that this is a
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:15.260]   PDF reader but it isn't it is for reading if you're in a job that requires an immense amount of
[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:21.100]   having to read read read read research and take notes and extract from that stuff what's important
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:28.460]   I have not found a single app that is it's like it's like they listen to me grumbling every night
[01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:35.180]   that I've been up for eight hours downloading more PDFs of like the most it seems like a huge amount
[01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:42.060]   of my work over the past two or three years has been having to like download PDFs of court cases
[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:47.740]   and indictments uh last night I was I was I was reading the three-page mailer indictment preparing
[01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:52.860]   for another public radio thing on Thursday and the thing is you it's pages and pages and pages
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:57.100]   long and then you just want to say oh that could be important and then basically clip that out
[01:30:57.100 --> 01:31:02.860]   so I can take a look at it later on uh it allows you to really easily just simply select something
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:07.980]   and not even formally saying oh please make a note about this and tag it such and such I can just
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:13.820]   simply drag it into this gutter and then make connections between these things uh and export
[01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:19.580]   that out to something else uh if it works most most obviously on PDFs but it has a built-in web
[01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:24.940]   browser so you can just simply browse to a web page then create then basically use the
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:31.100]   uh and use these same features here again just basically trying to do your research and taking
[01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:37.660]   notes on what's what what you need to learn from here reorganizing things uh it is so simple but so
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:44.140]   powerful and all these little touches that they do uh it is one of the most uh well thought out
[01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:51.260]   and well considered multi-touch iOS apps like there are times where uh I'm on page like 53 of
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:56.060]   some sort of technical spec and I'm saying wait a minute they said they said that they're working
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:32:01.020]   with the LPR LC what is that or did they mention that the very top of the document so you can
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:05.660]   basically hold down one finger on the document and then use your index finger to scroll back and
[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:09.820]   now there's two pains and you can basically be looking through two sections of the document at
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:16.460]   once uh comparing two documents is really easy it'll import word files import text files uh it really
[01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:22.860]   has become given how much I now have to pretend to know everything about live on the radio in 30s
[01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:29.500]   in 30 seconds or less uh 30 minutes or less uh nothing has come close to making it so easy to
[01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:33.980]   get through eight hours of reading and feel like you've gotten out all of the information and all
[01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:39.900]   the comprehension you need to get uh it's most 90 percent of its features are free uh I think
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:45.340]   it's something like 10 bucks maybe maybe I can't remember with 10 or 30 all I know is that I was
[01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:49.580]   so appreciative after using it for a week that I just simply said I don't even care about them
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:55.580]   the extra features I just want you to have some of my money so if part of your job is this is not
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:33:01.500]   this is not the PDF reader for like marking up tests and putting notes in margin saying A+
[01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:06.540]   but do but but uh run a spell check the next time it's not about like it's just signing documents
[01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:10.700]   there are other things that are more flexible like that it's not going to let you draw a sketch
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:15.500]   about what you think that the on a page of an architects plan to say oh I think that the patio
[01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:23.100]   should go here it really is optimized for the for the process of I've got 100 200 300 pages of
[01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:28.940]   digital research that I need to read through process and turn into information that I will
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:35.020]   understand uh and will help you get through that so quickly and so easily there is an enterprise
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:41.100]   version of it for $30 but you're you're talking about the basic liquid text right basic liquid
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:47.100]   text I think yeah exactly that's a $30 version for 10 bucks more um I think that there's subtle
[01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:52.380]   features like creating your own like sort of flows through the text which is a feature I haven't
[01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:57.660]   really understood yet I honestly over the past month I haven't really gotten to the bottom of
[01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:03.820]   even all the features that you get with the basic version but like I said I downloaded try it out
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:08.940]   and it really is one of those great apps where at the end of the first hour you're like oh there
[01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:13.580]   you go found it this is what I wanted nice it was it was logical that that someone must have
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:19.180]   written an app to do this because it's such a basic need and all the other apps are only like
[01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:23.660]   halfway good at it there must there must be an app for this and it turns out that there is one
[01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:31.820]   it's called liquid text so it's it's more it's allows you to combine other documents in to the PDF
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:35.260]   right so I think that's I think that's that's one of the bonus features if you want to create
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:40.220]   like projects of yours here's like two dozen related files and here's all the research I'm doing on
[01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:46.540]   each one of these things and then you can go into a text editor and create your own organization
[01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:51.740]   create your own structure create your own labels but again just for the simple idea of what is
[01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:56.940]   here's the here's the three pages of the indictment how do the how does the FBI know that that it
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:01.980]   was the Russians and not just it was the Russian government and not just some Russian people who
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:05.900]   sold information to the government how do they get in and like you're pulling all these things
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:09.180]   here's the detail from here that's I'm gonna have to quote that I'm going to take a look at that I
[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:13.340]   don't understand how this works I'm gonna look into that uh as you can explore it including the
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:18.700]   workspace and documents it's a single PDF which is really right cool because then I could do all
[01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:23.820]   this research research and put it into something like Devin thinks so I'd have it that's nice yeah
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:28.540]   sounds and it pops and it pops it out as text so or depending on how you do the selection you
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:31.900]   leave the pop it out a straight text so that you can then incorporate into another document
[01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:37.180]   or it'll incorporate it as sort of like an image of that section of the document so it's very very
[01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:43.100]   flexible again what I love about it is that it's super super powerful but the interface is minimal
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:48.060]   and they're they keep they keep focusing on what kind of gestures can we incorporate into that
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:52.700]   that the user is probably going to discover on their own and once they discover it they're not
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:57.180]   gonna have to be reminded about how it works yeah really really great well job it really is such a
[01:35:57.180 --> 01:36:04.220]   great demo of everything that's good about iOS and to be frank when uh I was learning when I was
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:11.180]   getting some information about uh the new uh the new uh cheap surface tablet it's like the the
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:15.260]   windows tablet is very very nice it's wonderful to get windows on such a compact and expensive
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:20.220]   multi-touch device but windows problem is always going to be that they don't have people in the
[01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:25.900]   windows developer community that are developing apps that are as interesting and well executed
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:32.460]   and as natural for the tablet format as liquid text nice very cool you know I have what I've
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:39.180]   been doing lately I realized now that I you can use with iBooks you can use iCloud to sync iBooks
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:44.940]   your iBooks library to all your devices is I've been slowly importing every I have a lot of ePub
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:53.900]   books but I also have in my library a ton of uh in my on my desktop a ton of PDFs for manuals of
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:37:00.300]   things yep and I've just imported them all into iBooks and now it syncs them so this is this is my
[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:05.660]   iBooks I just that so using this in conjunction would be great too because then I could take a
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:10.060]   liquid text document and put in iBooks yeah that's why I like the idea that you can export it as a
[01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:14.060]   single PDF of course if you do an iPad you don't have to worry about that but that is a wonderful
[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:19.180]   tip like every time you get something that has a PDF manual just by just before you throw out the
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:24.780]   boxes that this new camera came in put the PDF for that because the number time I've had my camera
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:28.700]   for three or four years but I still there's there's times where oh I do what really want to do a
[01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:33.820]   time lapse I've never done a time lapse before how do you do a time lapse and now because I have a
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:38.380]   PDF and iBooks they're working for you figure it out so awesome to have it in iOS yeah now it's
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:45.980]   on everything I use I love that Renee Richie pick of the week the mine is a repeat pick I believe
[01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:50.860]   but it's it's something I carry with me when I travel and again I was at Pokemon Gofest this weekend
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:55.180]   where I was away from power for an extended period does that have an HDMI port oh no it's just a
[01:37:55.180 --> 01:38:00.300]   no as USB C so you can actually use it for your MacBook and MacBook Pro that won't
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:03.740]   call it you can't keep up with the MacBook Pro but it can give you some extra juice it's like a
[01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:08.940]   thousand hours on an iPhone though and you have multiple people with you especially it's just
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:14.140]   fantastic you charge it up I use my MacBook Pro power adapter to charge it I brought two of these
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:18.780]   with me one you know one of us had one with us at each time and we just plugged in whatever phone
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:23.900]   needed it and it was fantastic we never got below three this has four levels on it when you get to
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:32.380]   those hundred hours I guess 24 hours per per charge we got down to three of them and it just it worked
[01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:37.660]   it was a workhorse it's got a soft touch finish on it it does fit if you if you have a pocket like
[01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:42.620]   me or dal rumple that fits an iPad mini it'll easily fit one of these and I just keep it plugged
[01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:47.340]   in put it in my phone when it needs it and never slow down or never stop and it's just so much
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:53.580]   power and one thing to leave I am gonna mention I already did an anti-pick
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:39:00.300]   yeah I really wanted to think that this would somehow be magically worth two hundred dollars
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:07.020]   this MacBook Pro leather sleeve and I just it isn't the leather isn't magical it's there's nothing
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:12.380]   nothing special about it especially when for one tenth the price you can get this this is this is
[01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:19.180]   what I'm gonna keep my six thousand dollar MacBook Pro and this is the TomTech TomTock 360 protective
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:27.420]   sleeve for a 15 inch new MacBook Pro with touch bar it has a little rubber soft little rubber
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:36.940]   padding inside it's got a pouch for the power supply it does you know it's my my thought is I'm
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:41.980]   not gonna carry this around it doesn't have a handle this is the sleeve that the MacBook's gonna go in
[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:45.820]   when it then it goes into my backpack or whatever else I'm gonna carry it in that was what I was
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:51.420]   gonna get the leather sleeve for but this is much more protective and at one tenth price I think
[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:57.100]   probably something I will keep and I'm gonna trade in let's see 200 plus 300 I think I can
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:40:03.660]   trade in those two things and maybe just a little bit more get an eGPU why not right
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:09.180]   to it yeah the the balcony that's a little disappointed the balcony doesn't have an HDMI
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:13.100]   that was totally the point of it was to have it here so we could have the HDMI connected
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:18.460]   it's a little bit of a a little bit of a missing feature
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:24.860]   ladies and gentlemen that concludes this edition of Mac break weekly for the for the first time
[01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:27.420]   with a Macintosh news in about a year and a half
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:32.700]   Richie is at imore.com that's where you could find all his great stuff including the great
[01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:36.620]   vector podcast where he talks about the new MacBook and a lot more
[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:43.820]   imore.com/vector thank you for being here Renee I have so many Pokemon Go questions okay
[01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:52.460]   I have to do I have to do a special you know I just I just learned I finally read some of your stuff
[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:58.300]   all for the last two years and spoken mind go came out I always thought you were supposed to throw
[01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:02.780]   the ball when the circle was at the smallest you're supposed to throw the ball in the circles at
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:08.300]   its biggest so I mean the smaller the circle the bigger the bonus you get for it but you should
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:13.820]   target the size that you can hit most reliably yeah you always be nicer yeah yeah I always nice
[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:17.980]   good excellent but it's very nice great excellent but you want whatever you can hit reliably so you get
[01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:23.500]   more what kind of points experience points if you do it so it's so a catch so every every this is
[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:27.980]   deep dive every Pokemon has a base capture rate some is like three percent some is 10 percent
[01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:33.580]   and you get a bonus percentage so it's like 1.3 times if you get this one point you're more likely
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:38.860]   to catch it if the circle is small yes you get if you do a curveball it's 1.5 modifier if you use a
[01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:45.180]   razz barrier it's 1.5 golden razz I think is 2.5 and then if you do a if you get the excellent I think
[01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:52.780]   it's 1.5 again on top of that see I read the fine article at i'm more.com/pokimon-go
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:59.020]   about how to catch them all awesome as you can see you got to go more towards the edge of the
[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:05.580]   spin wheel yeah clearly my curveball is just this the alan lys is going to get away for sure oh
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:11.020]   and then by the way I recommend throwing left yeah I don't yeah maybe I should i'm a righty i'm a
[01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:15.900]   lefty though so maybe the other thing is the iphone 10 is a bad choice for pokemon go because
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:21.500]   half the time I slide up and close the back it's also narrow and nyantic is not always like they don't
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:26.780]   always put the effort in and so all they did was instead of making the the frame instead of painting
[01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:31.820]   the frame bigger they just cut off the sides so it's a very narrow experience yeah now I I tend
[01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:37.420]   to play on my pixel 2 excel which is a little wider but i'm having so much fun and you and I
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:41.980]   are great friends again apologies to all the people who tried to befriend Renee and me
[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:49.100]   we're maxed out so I keep getting friend requests but both Renee and I and now my wife Lisa we're
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:52.860]   all we're all at 200 friends we can't get any more and we can't apologize it was
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:57.100]   george and I ended up walking seven miles to complete the quest on saturday but we did it she
[01:42:57.100 --> 01:43:05.660]   was in town right yeah we crushed that quest Leo oh man i'm so jealous i think i think that whenever
