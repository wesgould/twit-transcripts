[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   He's actually touched the new IMac Pro. He'll give you his impressions.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Alex Lindsey, he'll probably buy a hundred of them, he'll give you his impressions.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   And Andy and I, we don't have IMac Pros.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   We'll give you our impressions and watch carefully because it might,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   I might just get seduced by the dark side of the IMac.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Net-cast you love.

[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   You're not, you're not from Chicago.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   You're not from Chicago.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   The Chicago scene.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   The Chicago Tech scene.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   That's really what I...
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   From Pixar, Alex.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.960]   Right from Lake and
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.960]   two weeks from now, one week.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.960]   All right. And then Renee Richie in his new studio in a couple of weeks.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.960]   Yes. Two weeks.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.960]   Yes. A couple of weeks.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.960]   Yep. Everything is changing, Leo.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.960]   This is kind of the end of the line for a number of things at the end of the year.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.960]   Renee Richie at iMore.com.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.960]   And I want to thank you and I bet you you're going to talk about it.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.960]   I'm only just look what your pick of the week is this week for the Vector Podcast this week.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.960]   You gave...
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.960]   I heard you. I heard you talking about it earlier with such a great app cap for iOS today.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.960]   And I don't know if it's going to be...
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   Or is it going to be your pick this week or no?
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.960]   No, I was going to leave because I heard you talking about it.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.960]   So I was going to leave it for you.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   It was all Merlin. It was all due to Merlin.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.960]   Oh, it just... It's changed my life.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.960]   Yeah. Anyway.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.960]   It's so great.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   In iOS, an Apple Watch app that is... that you will love.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.960]   Before we go any farther, there's a guy named Joseph Knoll, who is a sweetheart of a guy.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.960]   And he's an airline captain, lives in Hawaii because if you could live anywhere...
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.960]   Why not?
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.960]   You can fly.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.960]   Because he can commute to work.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.960]   He sent us gifts for everybody.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.960]   We have a bunch of these hand-carved paperweights.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   He does woodworking and he does a beautiful job.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.960]   And look, it says East Side Studio, Petaloma, California.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.960]   But that's not all.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.960]   I'm going to eat your help, John, because we got a lot of these paperweights.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.960]   And he said, "Would you do me a favor and just save these and give them to Twitter?"
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.960]   You know, super fans when they come to the studio and I will do that for you, Joe.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.960]   Thank you.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.960]   I'm a super fan.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.960]   I'm taking one.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.960]   So there's a lot of these.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.960]   But there's something for you and you.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.960]   So this is for Andy.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.960]   Andy?
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.960]   And we're going to...
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.960]   I'm not going to unpack this one because we're going to send this to you.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.960]   A small pizza.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.960]   I've been saving for one of these.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.960]   And I'm going to send this to Renee.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.960]   Because this one's for Renee.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.960]   Yeah, I'll try to clean up with the TV like Tron.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.960]   Can we...
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.960]   And I'll open mine too.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.960]   Thank you, Joe.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.960]   It was actually surprisingly easy to open.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.960]   Thank you, Joe.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.960]   He makes these.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.960]   I must take him a lot of time to make.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.960]   He says, "Finally finished my next plaques for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.960]   I wanted to send them to each person.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   But I didn't get a reply to my email.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   Sorry, Joe.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.960]   Email and I don't get along too well together.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   I miss a lot of email.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.960]   He says he wanted to come out while Alex was here, but he didn't have any three-day trips to the Bay Area.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   If you could make sure each one gets their plaque, you bet.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.960]   Oh, those are cool.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   And what he's done is he's personalizing it.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.960]   So that one says...
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.960]   Ooh.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   Leo Leoport now.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.960]   Alex Lindsey, yours are going to say your names.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.960]   So that we all know special.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.960]   We can all be with Leo.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   Yeah, super cool.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.960]   So there aren't any beautiful, incredible works.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.960]   And I have...
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.960]   He's done them for every...
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.960]   I think almost every show that we do, and I have in my office...
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   How did he?
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.960]   And Leo.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.960]   Is it Leo Leoport and Leo Leoport?
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.960]   Is it Leo Leoport and Leo Leoport?
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.960]   Leo Leoport.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.960]   I know you're the best.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   Thank you.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.960]   Thank you.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.960]   I apologize for not responding to emails.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.960]   I do thank you for this, and I will send you their email addresses for future.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.960]   That's great.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.960]   Of course, this is what it really is.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.960]   Leo Leoport and friends.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.960]   Oh, that's amazing.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.960]   That's amazing.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.960]   That's amazing.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.960]   I know.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.120]   He uses really nice kind of woods, and I don't know how he carves them, but he does a beautiful
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.480]   job because these are raised, and then he paints them too.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.480]   So this is...
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.480]   I mean, incredible.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.480]   He's on for just...
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.480]   That's...
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   Yeah, that's...
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.480]   I have no words.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.480]   That's so cool.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.480]   I know.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.480]   I know.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.480]   We have great listeners.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.480]   We have great viewers.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.480]   You know, it's a great community.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.280]   Really, frankly, makes this worth doing, besides the millions of dollars I make every year,
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.280]   is the...
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.040]   It's not true.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.600]   Is the millions of dollars I pay in taxes each year, that might be true, is...
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   And by the way, happy to be a pass through corporation now.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.600]   Just so you know.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.440]   You might all want to consider that, is the family.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.200]   So you guys, of course, right?
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.440]   I mean, one of the reasons I...
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.000]   In fact, the reason I started doing these podcasts is so I could get together with you
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.880]   guys every week and talk.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.880]   This is what I would...
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.680]   This is like my dream, what I would do, even if we weren't broadcasting them.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   But we do.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.200]   We have a wonderful audience.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   And they're very generous and very kind.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.120]   And you don't have to send gifts, please.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.640]   But you're giving us a little of your time each week is more than enough.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.760]   It's a very generous gift.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.480]   So thank you very, very much to...
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.880]   Every time you walk into an Apple store, like, "Oh, I love Twitch so much.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.880]   Say hi to Leo."
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.880]   Really?
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.880]   It's amazing.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.880]   Absolutely.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.880]   I don't get that.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.880]   When I got to my Apple store.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.480]   Because Leo, they're already saying hi to you.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.840]   But also remember that lab with Leo and call for those are big and still on three days
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.840]   a week.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.840]   Not anymore.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.000]   No, G4TechTV died at the...
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.840]   This month in Canada, it was the end of the line.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.840]   Sad to say.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.840]   That's all right.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.840]   These things, you know.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.320]   Just to tell you the kind of fans we have, I was once waiting in line with a friend of
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.400]   mine outside a chowder fest.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.200]   You know, you pay 20 bucks, you know, all the chowder you want.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   Pick the best chowder in New England.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   Wow, that sounds good.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.000]   And I was just talking to my friend and someone like stops like, "Are you anti-anacto?"
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.560]   So yeah, "Oh, I recognized your voice for Macbreak.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.400]   I love the show."
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.520]   My friend couldn't stop talking about the...
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.680]   Just from your voice, he recognized you.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.680]   That's kind of amazing.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.760]   I'll do have a distinctive kind of a voice, by the way.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.760]   Exactly.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.760]   I suppressed my natural Belgian accent.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.160]   I also paid over the mustache.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.960]   Is that the octog?
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.480]   This is an extended Andy Kaufman style immersion acting technique.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.840]   We also, somebody named Sir Johnny Ives stopped by this morning and threw this out the window
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.360]   of his limousine.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.480]   This is actually a Burke pod.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.480]   So this...
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.480]   We have Burke do this.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.000]   Whenever there's an Apple product that we can't get our hands on, but we'd like to know
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.560]   at least the dimensions of it.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.840]   He's done it with the iPhone 6 when they first started making big phones.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.640]   He did it with the TrashCan Mac Pro.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.640]   This is the HomePod.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.640]   Is it really?
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.640]   I thought it was going to be bigger than that.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.640]   That was a Pantone.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.120]   I feel the only one Renee who's actually seen one.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.640]   It's a little bigger than a roll of toilet paper, which is probably what's in here.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.560]   Look at Mini Mac Pro.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.760]   Yeah, it's a little bigger.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.760]   So maybe an inch or two taller and maybe an inch or two wider.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.800]   But that's roughly the size of the HomePod, right?
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   Yep.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.480]   Like a half a roll of paper towels.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.640]   Yeah, it weighs five pounds.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.640]   This does not.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.720]   Burke did not make it true to weight.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.720]   And I think that's because it's made out of toilet paper.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:37.160]   And he's got to sit inside and answer a series of questions for you to make it really real.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.400]   Except you say, "Hey Burke."
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   Yep.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.400]   Hey Burke.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.320]   Anyway, thank you Burke for at least giving us an idea of how it's bigger than I thought
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.320]   it was going to be.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.000]   I thought it would actually be smaller than that.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.480]   Apple makes $1,444.76.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.520]   That graph is amazing.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.520]   A second.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:03.080]   And when you look at it compared to everybody else, you're just like, "Whoa, whoa."
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.360]   By the way, that's not revenue.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.320]   If it were revenue, it'd be five times bigger.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.280]   That's profit.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.560]   That's money in Tim Cook's pocket.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.560]   That is.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.560]   And compared to the-
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.560]   It's money in a hidden account.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.560]   Yeah, that's money.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.560]   That's money to the account.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.560]   That's money to the account.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:27.480]   And it is Fortune 500 number three, but it is, I think, easily the most popular.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.560]   It's a profitable company we've ever seen.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.560]   In fact, look at the numbers.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.560]   I hate my name.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.920]   Number two, JP Morgan Chase is almost half.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.920]   And the rest.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.480]   Isn't that a great graph?
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.920]   That is a really interesting infographic.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.280]   It also breaks down the product lines.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.480]   This is a technology internet.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.040]   Green is banking finance.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.120]   And the top four or five are one or the other.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:58.440]   Then Johnson and Johnson, then tobacco.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.640]   Surprisingly, tobacco is still bigger than Walmart.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.640]   Wow.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   Wow.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.960]   And then oil and gas.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.200]   But yeah, really nice.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.880]   I got to give credit to whoever made this.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.880]   Is it Tucker Jackson?
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.640]   He's the one on Pinterest who posted it, but I don't- or on visual.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.480]   It's on visual.ly.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.520]   Tucker Jackson too.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.520]   They're not selling munitions.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.960]   They're not selling pills for a million dollars a bottle.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.960]   And they're not doing all sorts of-
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.960]   Yeah, it looks like he did it.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.960]   Full-time nerd.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.760]   They're selling devices with an even more corrupting influence on our society that we
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.760]   would give up after the guns and after the-
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.760]   We'll get past it.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.760]   We'll get past it.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.080]   We'll make them work for us soon.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:46.800]   You could take my iPhone when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.040]   You was after you've been hit by a bus because you're crossing the street looking at your
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.040]   phone.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.920]   Somebody got- The driver was reading his phone and it was all phones all the way down Andy.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.560]   Somebody I think got an early Christmas present I'm thinking because I saw a picture from Mr.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.680]   Renee Ritchie of a steel gray, I'm Mac Pro.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.680]   Did you get one?
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.680]   What a machine.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.680]   What a machine, Leo.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.680]   Tell us about it.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:13.120]   So that's- I regretfully couldn't make it last week because flights kept getting canceled.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.680]   I was hoping to get it earlier enough to do it, but it was a storm.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.840]   So I got there late.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:21.560]   And Apple had this- It wasn't like a full-on event, but they had a bunch of Apple people
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.800]   and a bunch of developers who had been using the iMac Pro for a while.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.040]   I think some of them were a few days, some of them were weeks, some of them were probably
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.040]   longer than that.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.760]   And they just sat down and basically gave us the story of what it was like to use it
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.160]   in video production.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.400]   And they had HTC Vives making VR apps and they had audio engineers there.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.360]   And they had to find out- That must have been fun.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.280]   Like that's a amusement park for geeks.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.840]   It's just- It's so cool to see like one of the things that Apple is famous for is they
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.000]   go on these flights of fancy.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.640]   Like what if we took an iMac and without making it a millimeter different, we just stuffed
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.000]   everything we could.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.280]   Like server grade, close to server grade parts in there.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:06.680]   So you have XeonW and you have ECC RAM and you have Vega Pro graphics and you have memory
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.440]   soldered onto the board and you have four big dims.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.120]   And just what can we do to trick this out to make it the ultimate hypercomputer and what
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.160]   would the results be?
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.320]   And then they did it.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.680]   And it isn't like the modular Mac Pro and the Pro Display that's coming next year.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.240]   But for people who love, especially there were a lot of people in production environments
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.520]   or client sides of production environments who wanted something clean that they could
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.560]   put on their desk but demo in real time.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.880]   That was the thing we heard over and over again.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.880]   It's real time.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.840]   We have an architectural model in real time.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.000]   We have Cinema 4D and real time rendering stuff.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.440]   We have Cinema 4D by the way.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.600]   They had two eGPUs off the back of their iMac Pro.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.680]   They wouldn't tell us how many they could actually use because Apple hadn't fixed on
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.680]   a number yet.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.200]   But they're just like, yeah, we can crank that up.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.120]   It gets to take one under your arm and take it home.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.760]   No, it's really hard because I'm in Canada and I don't know what they're doing for US
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.920]   people but I'm hopefully going to have one to play with sooner rather than later.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.560]   So these are based on your impressions in Cooper T. It was on campus?
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.160]   No, well, the one I went to was in New York.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.920]   I'm sure they had some too on campus.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.920]   Oh, no.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.920]   Okay.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.920]   I'm a police coach.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.920]   I am jealous.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.240]   It sounds like a lot of fun.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.800]   The people there really liked it.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.600]   I mean, the people who are using it, the pros really seem to like it.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.600]   You're the pro.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.600]   I haven't bought one yet.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.600]   Interesting.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   Number one is...
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.360]   Five grand is not too much for a pro.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.360]   Oh, no, no.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.280]   I don't think the price is the issue.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.000]   We're probably going to get some.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Upgrade ability?
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Is that an issue?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.920]   Well, the issue that I have is mostly that Apple's history of the first release of an
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.400]   architecture is usually a little funky.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.280]   So, I'm just waiting to see how the chipset...
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.240]   The rev for the Rev B.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:54.840]   Yeah, Rev B is usually a good thing or sometimes Rev C. But to spend that...
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.720]   I guess for me to spend that kind of money on it, I want to see how it matures.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.240]   And also, I want to see what the more powerful ones look like too.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.240]   I mean, I think some of them are...
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.320]   These are only 10 core.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.480]   They're going to do up to what?
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.480]   16 core events.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.480]   18.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.200]   The 10 are out now and the surprise 14, which we weren't expecting.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.240]   The 18 come out next year.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.440]   But both Apple and the developers were kind of...
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.800]   They said it depends on your workload.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.720]   Like people who do machine learning might skew towards the 18 core.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.920]   But for most people, the 10 core has the highest turbo frequencies.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.600]   And it gives you 10 cores plus the highest turbo frequencies.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   And that was the one that a lot of people seem to be talking about.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.600]   I want to...
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.400]   We should mention that this is not necessarily the fastest Mac if you're looking for single
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.600]   core performance, right?
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.600]   Right.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.840]   No, it's a good blend.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.120]   But I think that's really for people who know that their apps are going to be...
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.880]   Multi-core, they're going to take advantage of 10 or 8, 10, 14 or 16 products.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.240]   What I want to do is I want to take some reps at the same time.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.760]   There's a handful of operations.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.760]   So...
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.760]   Let me just...
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.760]   I just want to get this clear.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.040]   So the Mac OS takes advantage of all the cores.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.040]   Yes.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:04.840]   So if I launch multiple applications, it'll intelligently assign applications to individual
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.840]   cores.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.840]   Is that correct?
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.840]   Yes.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.840]   So the demo they showed was watching three simulators, like the iPhone X, the regular iPhone, the
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:18.000]   iPad simulator, all with an Xcode, then having Linux in one VM, Windows 10 and another VM,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.400]   an older version of Mac OS and another VM.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.960]   The Windows was running Chrome, by the way, at the same time.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.560]   And they're showing that they had almost zero impact on each other.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.840]   And I bet these were all 128 gigabyte RAM, the maxed RAM, right?
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.840]   That's part of it, by the way.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.840]   Not...
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.840]   Yes.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:39.000]   So 128 gigs of RAM, 8 to 16 cores, a little bigger ones will be later.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.080]   But the clock speeds are...
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.360]   So for instance, if you're running a game that you want to just own the machine and it's
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.840]   not a multi-core game, which I think most are not, you're...
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.000]   Well, a lot of the games are leaning on the GPU anyway.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   I mean, you mean...
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.840]   Yeah, this is the best GPU Apple offers, yes, right?
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.840]   So most modern.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.480]   Some people are still upset that it's not Nvidia, but Apple has a working relationship
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:04.360]   with AMD that they don't have with Nvidia and they will get completely out of the way
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:09.320]   as much as it's technically possible and just let you hit that video card straight on if
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.320]   you want to.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.320]   Right.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.320]   And that seems to give them really good performance.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:19.360]   It's weird because if you pay more money and you get more cores, but the clock speeds
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.360]   go down.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.360]   Yeah, that's strange.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.840]   So the 8 core has the fastest clock speed, the 18 cores, 2.3 gigahertz compared to 3.2,
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.200]   but it does have turbo boost.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.640]   My only point being it's hard, people who should buy this to people who know that they're
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.640]   using Final Cut...
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.160]   Well, if you're gonna spend that kind of money, if you're gonna spend $13,000 or whatever
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.080]   on a computer, you should know, is this really...
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:46.920]   And those are the kind of people that are gonna buy this.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.920]   The issue with...
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.440]   And a lot of people say, "I've seen people posting like this is crazy, $13,000 or $15,000."
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.520]   The max hardware is $13,199.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:59.320]   For the people who are gonna buy a pro, they are the people who, you know, the cost of
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:04.440]   labor, the cost of their time, the cost of waiting, the cost of making deadlines.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.440]   That's why you buy a pro.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.320]   If $5,000, it seems like a lot of money for you for a piece of hardware, then don't buy
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.320]   it.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.320]   I mean, go get an iMac.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.320]   I have an iMac at home.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.320]   I love it.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.800]   But even if you had loads of money, it wouldn't necessarily be the right choice, depending
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.560]   on what you do with your Mac.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.200]   But yeah, no, if you have loads of money, that's not the issue.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.520]   Well, I haven't limited funds, but I want to play a video game.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.520]   It may not be the right choice.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.960]   It may not be any better.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.880]   I think that it would probably be great, but it would probably, you know, with a GPU
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.880]   and everything else.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.280]   But I think that there are certain things that I'm interested in testing on it, which
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.880]   is PhotoScan, which does photogrammetry, to put it in perspective, on my iMac, which
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.680]   is the latest iMac that's pretty decked out.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.760]   It took one to do one.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.480]   I turned 140 photos in India into 93 million points.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.480]   Holy crap.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.480]   And that took about six days.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.680]   Fortunately, I was traveling.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.480]   So I just turned it on and went cooking.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.480]   And then I checked in on it.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.680]   But this would be presumably a...
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.640]   Well, if this became overnight, that would be a huge thing for me.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.640]   And so...
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.760]   And even if I could do lower res previews right now, they take four or five hours just to
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.240]   see how it's working.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.400]   Whereas this could be something that I could see in half an hour.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.080]   Another one is something like Cinema 4D.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.200]   I'm sure that they'll release Cinebench stuff that will help figure that out.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:25.640]   But I bet you things like Cinema 4D and 3D apps are going to benefit a lot from this compressor.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.640]   I can only imagine how fast...
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.640]   Good pressers multi-core.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.640]   Oh, it'll take full advantage of that.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.960]   Final Cut 360 video and 6K support to go along with this.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.960]   Right.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.720]   Well, I mean, Final Cut, we're going to be talking a lot about Final Cut and it got tomorrow.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.680]   One of the reviews which we talked about last week, talked about 8K video.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.680]   It's coming.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.360]   And this is fast enough to have an 8K workflow.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.360]   That's remarkable.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.360]   And that's...
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.000]   Because I remember when you started shooting this show in 1080, it took you days.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   It was horrible.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.920]   And no one could watch it.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.920]   And then we've done 4K.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.200]   We had the same crash on the rocks when we did 4K about 18 months ago.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.200]   And we saw Blackmagic.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.200]   This would be 4K, no problem.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   It wouldn't even think about it.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.840]   And my current iMac does that.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.840]   What's...
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.840]   We saw Blackmagic release 8K cards, you know, capture cards, I think a week or two ago.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.760]   And we were like, "Well, that means there's 8K cameras coming in and NAB."
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.760]   I was like...
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:28.400]   So interestingly, so if you're going to buy this...
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.400]   You're stuck...
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.400]   You're not upgradable.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.400]   This is a...
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.120]   The RAM is, but you have to take it into Apple or a service center to get to the change...
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.120]   Oh, good.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.120]   Okay.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.120]   So you can...
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.120]   They can open it up or you if you're careful.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.960]   So they had to move the slots higher up so you can't get to the bottom anymore.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.040]   But a service center can just pull it off and stick them in and then replace them for you.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.960]   So the only thing you can upgrade is the RAM.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.480]   Although if you were wily enough, you probably could upgrade the hard drive.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.840]   So a lot of it is soldered.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.120]   Like it's not actual components.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.120]   It's chips.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.120]   That's how they get a lot.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.400]   Like they're getting a pretty amazing throughput and they're getting a piece by connecting everything
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.080]   onto the board and so there's nothing replaceable.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.080]   Which also makes it cheaper.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.800]   I mean, I know it's expensive, but it's cheaper than it could have been.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.800]   The only way to get to that size and...
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.800]   When you look at...
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:14.240]   They're smart to make Final Cut be the showcase because frankly you could get a PC that is
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.800]   upgradable.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.400]   I mean, it probably wouldn't be much cheaper, but you wouldn't be able to run Final Cut.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   Well, yeah.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.800]   And I thought the most interesting part of the press release for Final Cut, they just
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:31.360]   one that when they released it last week was the 2 million installed base is I think
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.400]   bigger than I think a lot of people thought.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.680]   People did not give up Final Cut.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.680]   We thought they might.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.520]   Well, or they found a new audience.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:45.520]   You know, I mean, at $300 where they have still, what is this, eight years later or seven
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:50.440]   years later, haven't charged an upgrade and they put out these huge feature sets that
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.800]   are new.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.800]   It's a different model.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:57.400]   Well, also 2 million, I mean, I downloaded I own Final Cut and I keep downloading it.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.920]   It probably includes a lot of people like me who bought it.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.920]   But all of them do.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.920]   Photoshop doesn't.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.920]   Doesn't mean you're using it full time.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.120]   I own, I have Premiere on my machine as well.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.920]   I don't use it every day.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.920]   Right.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.560]   So I think that the...
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.160]   But I think that the two...
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:16.800]   Like, arguably, people say in Hollywood and TV there's about 150,000 editors.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.800]   That's the real question.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   What percentage of those 150,000?
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.800]   I don't care.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:20.800]   Who cares?
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.800]   You know, like...
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.800]   I don't care about that.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.800]   Why don't they care?
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.520]   Because there's a huge industry now in cutting your shows, you know, from YouTube and for,
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:33.640]   you know, all these online outlets and for your company and for PR and for education.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.960]   And you know, there's a lot of other things in Hollywood.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.040]   Oh yeah, it's way bigger.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:43.880]   It's always been the top of this little pyramid, you know, and Final Cut is, you know...
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:48.400]   And again, the issue is that Final Cut takes like, for instance, I now have to think twice
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.480]   about opening Photoshop because right now inside of Sierra, and I don't know exactly
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.480]   why.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.280]   I was having trouble until the last upgrade.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.080]   So until Final Cut upgraded, every time I opened it, my whole laptop would slow down.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.080]   Like it would just...
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.000]   And there was something about the old code or whatever.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.320]   As soon as I upgraded Final Cut last week, all of that went away and suddenly it was
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.320]   snappy again.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.640]   Like Final Cut worked really well.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.640]   My playback worked well.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:15.320]   I mean, because I was really frustrated that I'd upgraded to high Sierra.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.600]   But Photoshop still drives it into the ground.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.040]   You know, so if I open Photoshop on my laptop, my Mac doesn't have the problem on my laptop.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.400]   The job is to get with the program and they haven't updated whatever they have.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.160]   And again, and so Apple is able to take full advantage of...
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.800]   And this is the, you know, by the way, this is the whole fight that...
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.280]   This is how Final Cut started.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.280]   Was Apple telling...
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:39.280]   I mean, this expression of the iMac and iMac Pro is what Apple was trying to persuade
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.560]   Adobe of in the mid 90s.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.560]   Right.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.400]   Where they said, "Hey, base it on QuickTime, base it on our architecture, and as our hardware
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.400]   gets better..."
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.400]   We promise you'll get better.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.400]   You'll get better.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.400]   And Adobe would...
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.400]   No, Adobe didn't want to do it.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.400]   They want to not be cross-platform.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.240]   There's a whole bunch of good reasons that Adobe chose it, not do it.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.080]   But then what Apple did to do that is they bought this little editing package from Mac
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.280]   or Media to just show people that you could build it on top of their platform.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:07.920]   And then that upset Avid, Avid put out a horrible press release, and then Steve Jobs
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.920]   went for the kill.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.000]   And then otherwise, we wouldn't have Final Cut at the level that it is now.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.440]   Renee, Jonah and our chatroom wants to know, and I don't know if you had enough time with
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.440]   it.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.560]   It was really fans when it was really ramped up.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:27.600]   So the only thing is we had a lot of people there, and it was a big room.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.600]   But it was Whisper Quiet.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.160]   And I know Marquez said that it was Whisper Quiet when he was editing with it during the
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.160]   week, and all the people there...
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.160]   And Marquez was doing 4K, I think, right?
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.160]   I think he went up to 8K.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.160]   Can't do 8K.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.160]   Yeah, I think...
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.880]   And I know Vincent LaFarere was doing 8K with his red weapon.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.920]   But the EGP who's are super noisy.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.280]   So that's now that I want Apple to make a...
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.280]   Are people using...
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.280]   So those are the external EGP.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.760]   Are people using those?
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.600]   Are there so unhappy with the radiance that they're actually adding?
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.600]   It's not unhappy.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.240]   It's that you can use multiple.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.120]   So like Cinema 4D was using 2 in addition to the internal card.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.760]   And they were doing what Alex was talking about, things that used to take them a night
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.760]   or a day.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.760]   They were doing...
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.040]   It was like the scratchy version of it.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.280]   But they were looking at it real time.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.240]   And they said, "Before we hit a button, go out for the day, come back and say, "Oh, no,
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.360]   we're in the wrong settings."
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.360]   And now we can see a good enough version that we can tweak it and then make sure that that's
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.680]   the way we want it.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:28.040]   So that's why 10,000, 5,000, 13,000 is kind of...
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.680]   It's less than the red camera they're putting.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.240]   That's not actually the price tag.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.920]   Because you're going to add EGP use.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.320]   You've got the input devices, the cameras.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.600]   And you're certainly not going to stick with one monitor, right?
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.600]   Video editors.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.360]   I've never seen a video editor with just one monitor.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.520]   And I'm going to add another two, five K monitors.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.240]   You may, and I wouldn't, for instance, on the storage, I probably would only do a one
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.240]   terabyte.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.240]   Do a terabyte and then have a thunderstorm and a hot-ass.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:54.880]   I don't want to have my applications internal and I don't want to put anything on the internal
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.880]   drive.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.760]   So that makes it a little less expensive.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.760]   And I think that...
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.240]   Yeah, I took a $3,000 off.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.240]   It's only 10,000.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.640]   And there was one thing that they said, and we tried to fact check as best as we could,
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:10.960]   is that compared to a consumer PC, if you're going straight Skylake or KB, this looks expensive.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.440]   But if you're going part for part, if you're using PC on W, ECV RAM, then it's...
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.440]   This is a $1,500 processor by itself.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.360]   Yeah, it's comparably priced.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.120]   And when you add in the display, it's usually about $1,000 under what you can do for build
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.120]   toward.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.640]   Yeah, and you're getting a really stellar P3 full gamut display.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.640]   And again, the...
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.640]   So what would you...
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.640]   So let's come on.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.640]   I want you to...
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.640]   Let's customize this.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.640]   By the way...
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.640]   Spec it out.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.640]   Yes, take it out.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.400]   So you can get the 16 core in six to eight weeks.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.400]   That's...
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.400]   Eighteen.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.400]   That we know.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.400]   I probably...
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.400]   I'm sorry, 18 core.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.400]   If I was going to buy one, I'd probably still buy the...
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.400]   Standard?
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.400]   The five?
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.400]   No, no, I would buy the 18.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   Of course you would.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.400]   Okay.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.280]   And memory, you'd go to 128.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.280]   Do you really need...
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.280]   Probably...
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.280]   I'd probably go to 64.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.640]   The problem is if I don't feel like I can upgrade it, I'd be leaning towards one point.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.640]   You can, though.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.640]   We know you can.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.640]   But I think it's fine.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.640]   So 64.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.640]   Storage, you set a terabyte because you're going to use external.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.640]   That makes sense.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.640]   Fast gradient.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.880]   Now, there's two different graphics cards, but as far as I could tell, the only difference...
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.880]   The $600 difference is...
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.600]   It's a 56 to 64, eight gigs of RAM.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.600]   So 16.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.600]   So it's more internal memory.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.240]   And that internal memory is going to affect your texture maps and so on and so forth.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.240]   I would definitely do.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.240]   I would definitely do.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.240]   Okay.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.240]   Upgrade that.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.240]   And then we're not going to bother with the magic mouse.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.240]   I would get the Visa Mount adapter kit because I'd probably put it on an R.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.240]   Yeah, of course you would.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   So that's...
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.240]   That's actually not bad.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.240]   That's 8878.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.920]   So that's probably something that I'll get sometimes soon.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.080]   And you already own final cuts, so you don't need to buy that.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.080]   And logic.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.080]   And logic.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.080]   Which are great, by the way.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:46.600]   Now, a lot of people say, "Well, Pro's never going to buy at all in one unit like this."
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.600]   But they might because this is disposable.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.600]   It's also really weird.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.600]   Especially in developers.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.320]   I mean, well, even a couple of years.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.720]   I mean, we're still using the trash cans.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.040]   I mean, it's not like we stopped using them.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:01.080]   And we still use computers until they die.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.080]   But I think that...
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.600]   But you hand them down and the people who make them down.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.600]   You hand them down.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.600]   They end up being servers at the office and that are doing...
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.160]   Just saying this mail or whatever.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.160]   A pro has completely different priorities and needs than you do me.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.160]   Totally.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.160]   You're a pro.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.160]   But then I do.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.160]   When I also define different kinds of pros.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.920]   Like developers, they said, is now their biggest pro market because there's so many
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.920]   people making apps.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.080]   And they actually like the all-in-one and the clean desk.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:26.960]   And they need a multi-core sometimes for making machine learning now is incredibly popular.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.960]   And it really scales well across machine learning.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.640]   Yeah, the guy doing the augmented reality app, who did his reviews, said it just...
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.640]   Yes.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   Compile time alone.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.680]   And to me, if I can compile 10 times faster, this is all I need.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.680]   When you look at someone...
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.680]   And I think this...
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.680]   You look at an...
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.160]   I think the average developer is getting paid.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.720]   I don't know what the number is anymore.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:49.280]   But I think it's like 130,000 in Silicon Valley is kind of the going rate.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.120]   So you look at that salary and you look at...
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.400]   You just break it down to if they're spending an extra...
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:00.520]   If they save 20 minutes a day or an hour a day of compile time, it's a lot of money.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.440]   I mean, it adds up.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:08.320]   And I think that those numbers are similar to folks working in visual effects.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.040]   I could definitely see this...
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.040]   I don't know anybody that I would talk to about it at Pixar, but I can imagine Pixar
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.040]   or even ILM.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.200]   No, they're kind of Unix.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.160]   They have a lot of Unix background.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:27.440]   But if a big firm was already Mac-based, a lot of times what they do is they have all
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:31.560]   the servers in a central location and they're running fiber out to a monitor and a keyboard
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.800]   because they want to keep it all clean.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.200]   They want to keep it all away from the artist.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.560]   The artist just needs a way to control it in the screen and this is what it gives them.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.560]   So I think that you're...
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:46.440]   I think there's a lot of people that that kind of speed is going to be enough to go
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.280]   a year or two and then after that it's...
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.280]   It doesn't matter.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.280]   I mean...
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.280]   Well, we're going to talk about what's coming in.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.280]   They had some great architects there who...
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.640]   They said that often it is a server farm behind the scenes, but they loved this for when
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.640]   clients would come in.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:01.040]   They had an app that would take CAD models and render them and you could set the time
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.920]   and day and season and year and you could paint in trees and walk them through it.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.320]   And again, for them all in real time again was a super important thing and they would
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.520]   just have them for the client meetings and it was worth it.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.520]   That makes sense.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.880]   I could see a lot of people using it for that.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:19.920]   But if I wasn't doing heavy video, a lot of 3D, photogrammetry, heavy compute stuff,
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:25.640]   like Photoshop is not enough in my opinion unless you're doing 60 megapixel images or
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.280]   something like that.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:33.400]   But for the average Photoshop user or the average video editor, I think the iMac, the
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.480]   base iMac or your laptop is fine.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.240]   So this is not an E-
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.840]   They had logic with 40...
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.240]   Was it 80 extra tracks all without?
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.600]   It could be plug-in running and still going in real time with it.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.640]   So that's where you really get bogged down and stuff like that.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.280]   So this is Craig Hunter who is doing an AR app called Theodolite.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:53.920]   He says most of my apps have 20 to 30,000 lines of code spread out over 80 to 120 source
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.920]   files.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:59.560]   He says reductions in compile time for me between 30 and 60 percent.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:04.240]   You still have other slowdowns like launching the simulator.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:08.940]   But if you're doing repetitive code compile test cycles, 30 to 60 percent reduction in
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.940]   compile time alone.
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.160]   I think Apple said LLVM compile is 2.4 times faster.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.640]   That's a lot more even.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:23.240]   Yeah, I think he's including all the other stuff that he has to do to change compile run.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.520]   That stuff, there's other things that a fast computer isn't going to...
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.520]   And they were clear.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.400]   It really depends on what your coding is for, what your project is and what all the elements
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.400]   are inside that part.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.840]   He's got a lot of good benchmarks though.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.280]   This is a great review at HRT apps.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.280]   And also he hits the science stuff because you have those vector processing booths that
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.560]   you get to the Xeon chip.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.560]   Yes, he talks about that.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.760]   Xeon is a workstation chip.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.920]   It's not a consumer chip.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:52.280]   So everything you would say about choosing a Xeon for your computer versus a coffee-like
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.280]   processor.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:31:02.000]   And it has some trade-offs because the Skylake does not support the HEVC 10-bit the way that
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.320]   KBLake and others do.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.000]   So what Apple is doing is because it's so powerful, they're using the 8-bit and then
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.200]   they're adding in the GPU to do the final HDR part.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.200]   All right.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:20.320]   So now the question is, and this is frankly, I bet this is the same thing for you, Alex.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.640]   I almost pulled a trigger on this.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.640]   It's the color, Leo.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.640]   Get it for the color.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.640]   No, I do love the color.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.080]   And they're smart because that when you go into the architects office and he's showing
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.240]   you your elevations on this, it's beautiful.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.720]   You go, "Oh, that's special.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.120]   It's different."
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.800]   The old silver ones look kind of old now.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.920]   But we got a Mac Pro on the way.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.480]   And that's the real question because I would much prefer to buy a Mac Pro for work.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.480]   And a Pro display.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.480]   Right.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.200]   And for modular and I could upgrade and things like that.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.160]   So we're starting to hear now some rumors.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:57.960]   You just kind of intimated that the Mac Pro might be coming pretty soon.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.520]   What do you think?
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.520]   It's next year.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.920]   So the thing is, I hate to make predictions like this because for a couple of devices,
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.280]   like Apple TV was supposed to be WWDC and move back to September.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.960]   Mac Pro was supposed to be WWDC and move back to September.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.880]   So Apple could have every intention of showing off the next Mac Pro at WWDC and we might not
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.520]   see it until September or maybe like HomePod where it gets to December and they're like,
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.920]   "Ah, it's not quite right.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.920]   We'll see it in January."
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.360]   So I think it's their goal to get it out in 2018.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.400]   And if everything goes perfectly, I think we'll see it then.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.720]   But with projects like this, I think you always have to just in size, you don't build
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.240]   up expectation debt.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.160]   You have to be willing to mentally pad it out.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.880]   Like maybe it'll be six to nine months after I really wanted it to come.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.880]   As you pointed out, all they ever said is not this year.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.400]   They didn't say 2018.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.880]   They don't want to set any expectation.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.280]   And yet the buying decision for an iMac Pro really hinges on, "Well, is there going to
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.200]   be a Mac Pro in the next six months?"
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:57.840]   For some people, I think that I'm quite happy with the iMac form factor on my desk and at
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.840]   home.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.360]   Like my work desk, because what I'm doing on the computer, you want something simple
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.360]   and clean.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.360]   It's just simple clean.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.520]   It's out of the way and right now it's super fast.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:12.400]   So I think that I wouldn't feel like I needed to wait for the Mac Pro.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:17.120]   I think given the kind of horsepower you're getting from the iMac here, again, in a professional
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.840]   world, it's two or maybe three years of use.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.840]   As short as long.
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.080]   You will have a cleaner desktop though if you don't have to use an external GPU, if you
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.120]   don't have to have external hard drives.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.520]   I mean, there's something to a tower case that actually could be cleaner.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:36.800]   Obviously, the trash cam Mac was as unclean, as you could be.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:41.760]   But I think a lot of people would be, I mean, if you're an editor, even editing 8K, I think
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:46.560]   that you could buy this top of the line iMac Pro and you'd be super happy.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.120]   I mean, I think I haven't used it yet, so I don't know.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.120]   There is.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:56.120]   So one of the things, Stimulate Venture Beat has an article, intimating that it says
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.680]   Apple hints at New Mac Pro and Pro Display as iMac Pro launches.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:05.480]   The hint is really that Apple has kind of indicated, correct me if I'm wrong, that they're
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.600]   going to make a new monitor.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.440]   Remember they stopped making-
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   I'm thinking of setting it out right.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:16.040]   They stopped making cinema displays and they said, "By the 5K from LG."
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.160]   But Apple has said, "We're going to make a new monitor."
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.160]   What did they say about it?
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.880]   That didn't turn out so great for them for a couple reasons.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.520]   One is the interface is the app.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.520]   You can switch from Gmail to iCloud or whatever, but it's your mail app that you interact with
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:29.520]   all the day.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.800]   And the same thing with the monitor.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.320]   You can switch out, like you can get a Mac Mini switch to a Mac Pro, do sorts of things,
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.240]   but you're staring at the monitor and not to have Apple's brand on what you were actually
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.240]   looking at all day.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:43.280]   It was probably bad marketing on their part, but also LG had a bunch of issues.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:47.080]   They took the spec and didn't really produce it fantastically well.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.520]   And I think Apple learned maybe the hard way that they really have to- if they want to
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.320]   control- famously, if they want to control the integrated experience, they have to control
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.880]   the integrated experience.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:35:00.280]   So when they said the new modular Mac Pro was coming, they were very, very adamant that
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.920]   the new Pro Display is coming along with it.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.200]   And I think that's sort of like the hub that's going to glue a lot of their next gen
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.200]   back.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.240]   And the timeline, though, does it not really?
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.240]   No.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.680]   I mean, when it's ready.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.720]   Yeah, that's frustrating.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.840]   We really shouldn't have to- we really shouldn't make any assumptions about what the Mac Pro
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.840]   is going to be like.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:22.320]   I wouldn't be surprised if the reason that they're not committing to a timeline for
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.960]   it is that they realize how much research they have to do into their market for this
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.880]   before they pull the trigger.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:34.680]   The fact that they were- this is a company that was capable of doing a computer the shape
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:39.520]   of a Quaker Roadbox, so different, so radical, such a different change because they felt
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:44.000]   so strongly about they had the numbers, they had the research, they thought they needed
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.640]   to build what was going to sell well to the people they want to sell to.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:51.240]   It doesn't mean that we're going to get the tower box with a whole bunch of slots and
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.160]   racks for internal drives.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:58.520]   It could be that we will get something that's actually closer to the Mac mini with only
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:03.720]   the entire- basically half of the stuff inside that box is just there to keep the CPU's
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.600]   cool and to make it run as quietly as possible.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:11.480]   So we really- if I think that any complaints that people might have about the iMac are
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:16.880]   premature the iMac Pro rather because again that's supposed to be half of their Pro Mac
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:22.700]   line, not the entire Mac line, but at the same time you just be ready that every time
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:27.300]   that Apple says that we have a design that we think you're going to love, put the seat
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:32.000]   belt on, make sure you've got the Hans device clipped into your helmet because this could
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.600]   be a hard ride.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:39.640]   I think the amount of power that they put into the iMac pushes more towards the idea that
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:47.040]   we're going to see a really high-end rack mountable 3U that's highly modular but done
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:52.400]   in an Apple sort of way where things are actually easy to take in and out because there's no-
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.840]   From your mouth to Tim Cook's ear because that sounds like we would want.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.840]   Something you could turn-
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.160]   But it will be twice as expensive as the iMac Pro.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:04.520]   Yeah, no, absolutely, but it'll have- but that's what Pro- if Pro users aren't going to buy
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.480]   an iMac, what they want is that.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.680]   I mean, you know, they want- I can take the ears off and set it sideways if I want to
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.400]   and it looks really cool or I can just stick it in, I can rack mount it.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.680]   There's so many people that have rack mounted these- the trash cans and they don't rack
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.440]   mount very well.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:25.040]   And so the thing is, is that what Pro users want, whether Apple, you know, is a- you know,
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.800]   is something- and it looks- here's the funny thing.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.560]   Good looking servers actually get a lot of work.
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.560]   You know, like we have- I know it sounds crazy, but you know, we have these elementals that
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.560]   are expensive.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.560]   You have an elemental.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.560]   You guys have elementals, right?
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.560]   Mm-hmm.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.560]   And they just upgraded.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.760]   The new elementals are even more expensive.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.200]   How many did we get?
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.160]   We were trying to decide if we needed two for redundancy and I think I decided they're
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.160]   so expensive.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.840]   We'll just have one and if the stream goes down, the stream goes down.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.120]   Yeah, I- we buy them in pairs and I- well-
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.040]   Well, it's reasonable because you can't afford to have a stream get down.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.240]   But the- they have these little green-nounce orange.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.240]   It's really annoying.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.840]   But anyway, they've had green ones.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.840]   These green fronts.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.840]   It's very pretty.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.040]   And people recognize them.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.840]   They're like lit green fronts and people recognize them and they were talking about
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.560]   getting rid of them and I was like, "You don't understand.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.840]   We made a lot of money on that because people ask you what it is."
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:18.960]   "That's a state of the art, hardware, and coder that, you know, that's used in all the
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:19.960]   major CDAs."
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:20.960]   It's like 25,000, right?
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.960]   I don't know.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:22.960]   Like that fishbowl of old X serves.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.960]   North of that.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.960]   How much?
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.960]   I have two options.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.400]   The chiclets you can get for less.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.440]   You can get the little chiclets for like 10 grand or something like that.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.440]   There are-
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.000]   Oh, ours were I think 25K.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Those are each-
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.840]   Does those have one channel or two channels?
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.520]   Well, you also have to get a service contract.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.520]   Two channels each.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.820]   You also have a very hefty service contract because you can't buy it without the service
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.820]   contract.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.680]   I could buy a Tesla every year for the non-ISP, and I could service for the correct.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.680]   But-
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.680]   But we're high maintenance too.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.680]   They've got a lot of emails from us.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.680]   So, the-
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.380]   Well, we're paying for your service fees.
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:52.380]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:53.960]   I mean, they were pretty clear.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:58.040]   Like they said that like the Mac Pro is about 1% I think of their- of their business because
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.080]   the iMac is their most popular desktop.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.560]   But they did things like made the- previously you had to order the Visa Mount or not order
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.360]   it that you had to make that decision when you placed your purchase.
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.640]   And with the iMac Pro, you can get the Visa Mount and then take it off and put it on.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.360]   If you're in a production environment, you can mount it.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.360]   Take it off, put it on a desktop.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.840]   Take it back off, put it on the mount that you want to take as a studio.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:16.840]   Whatever you want to do with it.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.960]   So I think they're listening better and hopefully, you know, knock wood like what Alex said.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.880]   They're going to listen to the people who actually want that device as opposed to an
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.720]   iMac and purpose build it more for their needs.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.200]   And I would love to see that divergent.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.920]   It's like we're going to put something- a server based thing that still clients will
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.760]   see and it looks cool and it has a cool like apple in the center and everything else.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.400]   Or we have an iMac that you want to put on your desk.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.720]   But the trash can doesn't need to be on the desk.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.920]   You know, we don't really want to show that.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:47.680]   Here is the- I think this is the picture of our new yellow element.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.680]   Ah, orange.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.680]   It's Amazon orange.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.680]   Oh, Amazon owns it.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:51.680]   It's right.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.680]   They got bought.
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:53.680]   Sad.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.680]   I don't know.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.680]   I'll get into a lot of trouble for the fame that but-
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.680]   You like the green better?
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.680]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:39:59.680]   The green was great.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.680]   The green looks like Hulk.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.520]   Oh, I meant to smash.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.080]   I don't even think about the color.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.080]   It's over in Iraq somewhere.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.680]   I think about the check that I wrote.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:14.520]   But I got- We've owned a lot of different encoders and once you get used to-
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:20.560]   Well, not but see, you can easily look and see which is new and which is old.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.560]   Or the elementals?
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.560]   Well, I keep all the red.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.360]   I keep all the green ones and then I replace them with the orange ones with the green ones.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.360]   So you can see how you stand.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.360]   Where you stand.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.360]   Exactly.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.160]   So if I were going to buy one then I would get the standard, what they call standard
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.260]   configuration.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.400]   That's the $5,000.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.400]   But I think you're right.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.080]   I think you don't- You don't need to upgrade.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.520]   Eight cores plenty.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.000]   But I think 64 gigs, not 32 gigs, right?
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Of RAM.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.160]   Yeah, I would still go for the 10 core.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.520]   That seems to be like the most popular sweet spot.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.520]   10 core?
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.640]   Just because you do get that turbo.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.960]   It's the fastest turbo frequencies.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.720]   If you want to do single threaded fast.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.200]   Yeah, good point.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.040]   Three gigahertz.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:03.720]   No, actually, yeah, the turbo frequencies 4.5, by the way, Berkus-Sennis, yet another picture
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.600]   of the elemental with the lights on.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:10.280]   But in a server room, in a server room, it sticks out and that's the sales thing.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.840]   Yeah, it's the one that stuck out.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.840]   People go, "Oh, they've got an empuz."
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.840]   You got one of those.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.480]   How do you like it?
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.480]   How do we like it?
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.520]   No, say, you just changed the lighting system on it.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.880]   People know that, "Oh, you've got one of those things that I've read about.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:24.880]   How do you like it?"
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.200]   It's good to ever tell you, "Oh, it's lovely."
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.760]   And then for my purposes, would I upgrade the video card?
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.400]   Should I stick with the...
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.400]   I would.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.640]   Come on.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.480]   For my purposes.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.480]   I don't know.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.280]   You can live the way you want to live.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.680]   Or is it Borrelio?
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.040]   You're not an animal, Leo.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.240]   Are you putting your HTC Vive on it, Leo?
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.800]   Do I really have to use it?
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.800]   I mean, you have to use it.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   All right, so...
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:52.120]   So instead of the $5,000 base model, the reasonable model for a person who just wants
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:58.600]   the fastest Mac you can get and likes to have it in SteelGrace, be $71.99.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.880]   And you can get it January 4th.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.880]   Won't be able to get it for Christmas.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.480]   Not putting it under the tree.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.480]   I hope I could put a Mac Pro under the tree by next year anyway, but we'll see.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.480]   I think you're right.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.760]   I completely understand why Apple is not pre-announcing.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.080]   They shouldn't.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:19.320]   But it does make it a little bit trickier decision for somebody who's got some budget.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.200]   How long do I hold out?
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:28.120]   And then the big thing is they basically put it out.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:32.320]   So there's a lot of people with the end of your financials.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.400]   There will be people that just jump on it right now because it is a business cost.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.680]   And I'm sure that that was one of the reasons they wanted to make sure they gave everybody
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:43.800]   enough time to order it is to book that cost in 2017.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:48.160]   You may be ordering for February 23rd, but you're paying for it now.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.960]   Mine isn't until June 30th.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.960]   Your fiscal year ends in June.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:53.960]   I got it.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:54.960]   May.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.200]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.840]   There's much more to say.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.120]   ReneeRitchie, I'm more.com.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.120]   Thank you for your impression.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.120]   That sounded like a fun event.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.120]   I'm jealous.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.120]   That sounded really fun.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.120]   That was a lot of fun.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.120]   We weren't sure where you were.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.200]   I thought you were probably on a plane to Cupertino, but New York City, that's almost as good.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.520]   Yeah, except for the snow.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.160]   Three flights cancel on the way back.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.320]   Holy cow.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.160]   And that was before Atlanta had its.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.440]   Ice is not the plan.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.240]   It's not the friend of flying.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:26.680]   Oh, my Echo spot just got delivered.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.200]   That's the little round one that watches.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.000]   Mine too in bed.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   Yep.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.360]   That might be a cameraless version.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.080]   And I think they might sell that.
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.080]   It's a tape over it.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.600]   Because it's also about the brightness sensor is in the same place as the camera.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:43.200]   So then they're complaining that the brightness goes too high or too low if you cover it.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.200]   I don't know, John.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.160]   I don't know if it's I can't tell where it got delivered.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.320]   See if I got a box.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.560]   It has eliminated everyone in my house calling me by my name.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.800]   So I'm officially dad because otherwise the show was constantly turning.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.480]   I think Alex is, you know who?
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.840]   There's so many show on all the time.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:43:59.840]   All the time.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.840]   I'll tell you.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:06.560]   And so that it has the family has been the show has persuaded the family not to.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.560]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.800]   He is the pixel core man, the score to come Renee Alex and of course Andy and I go from
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   the Chicago sometimes.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.720]   So did you want to say something?
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:21.440]   So no, no, I'm just saying that when the over the over the commercial break, just try
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:26.280]   not to think about if this says something about your family caring more about this devices
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.840]   feelings than yours.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.760]   I'm not going to call you by name dad because I don't want to bother.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.760]   If you go down that road, that's a long way.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:44.280]   I'll cheer you up by a new house or you know what?
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.200]   This is the time to refi because interest rates are going up.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.200]   They've already said it.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.320]   If that is going to raise them again and again and again, they raised it at one quarter
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.320]   of a point.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.640]   They say three more raises in 2018.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.320]   That means your lovely low interest rate.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.600]   You'll need to lock it in now.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:03.440]   You might even get a lower interest rate if you're refi with quick and loans, the best
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:08.880]   lender in the country and rocket mortgage, the fastest way to get mortgage approval.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.600]   We love rocket mortgage.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:18.360]   First of all, if you don't know quick and loans and I imagine you do, the best lender
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:23.120]   in the country, number one in customer satisfaction year after year after year according to JD
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.600]   Power, eight years running now.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.600]   That's pretty darn good.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:32.040]   They just got the award again for 2017 in both mortgage origination and mortgage servicing.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:36.240]   Now, the mortgage approval process with rocket mortgage has gotten light years better.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.880]   I think they just locked it in for many years to come.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:44.080]   You can do it entirely online, no more going to the attic to find paperwork.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:47.240]   Everything they need to know, they can get easily because of their trusted relationships
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.680]   with all the financial institutions.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:55.200]   All you have to do is go to rocket mortgage.com/macbreak, pick your term, pick your rate,
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:01.520]   pick your down payment, give them some basic information, the stuff you have in your head.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.320]   Some address, birth date, that kind of thing.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.800]   They will say, "All right, we found you.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.800]   Is this you?
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:09.600]   Give us permission to pull your financial records?"
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.600]   Yes.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:15.440]   And then based, and this all happens instantly and not in a bank office, but on your phone
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:19.880]   or your tablet or your computer, based on your income assets and credits, they crunch
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.960]   the numbers and they offer you a loan.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.320]   They give you all the options for which you qualify.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.640]   You pick the one that's right for you and you're done.

[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.120]   30.
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.120]   30.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.040]   People are always saying, "How can we support the shows?"

[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.400]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:29.280]   Rocket mortgage by quick and loans, rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:34.560]   They didn't get iPods to put in the stockings too late.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:39.560]   Apple says we're sold out till January.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:43.400]   That's from the online store, US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.400]   Kingdom.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.680]   Most of the Apple retail stores, although I guess if you looked around, you might find
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:51.160]   one that had something fell under the counter and they forgot.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.760]   More best buys or Macy's or Target or Walmart or Verizon.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:55.760]   18t's.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.520]   So many in New York.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:03.360]   Everywhere I went, I thought there was an AirPod shortage because everyone in New York
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.360]   was wearing them.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.840]   Just on the streets, in the coffee shops, in the hotel, people just kept walking by and
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.400]   that brisk New York pace with like airplugs.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.640]   I noticed that too.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:12.640]   I noticed that everywhere.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.640]   It really shows you at first when we saw them, we thought, "Oh, nobody's going to want
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.200]   to wear that white thing hang."
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.840]   But it's now the norm.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.840]   It's the norm.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:20.840]   It's a new norm.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.200]   I think one of the things that Apple does well is it looks different.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.560]   It's white and you know that everybody else has one.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:29.720]   I think that was always the white headphones always told you that.
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.880]   So I think it's which I've never actually used them.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.560]   I mean, I use the wireless ones.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:38.520]   They do fit better in your ear for whatever reason without the cape.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:39.520]   They look the same.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.520]   It's not pulling down.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:44.880]   But I've never been able to have the other ones work for me at all and these ones, they
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:45.880]   work fine.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:46.880]   I love them.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:47.880]   I think they're very functional, Andy.
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:48.880]   Yeah, no.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:53.640]   I've never thought that the little stem hanging down was a ugly thing at all given that we
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.200]   recently have white cords hanging down.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:01.320]   And that certainly is, I think that's certainly responsible for how good these airpods are
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:05.960]   at keeping in contact with my phone despite the fact that I don't have it in my chest
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:06.960]   pocket.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:15.960]   I can have it in my pants pocket and it works just fine.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:21.000]   So if you want to look around and retail, you might 18 T stores apparently have some.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.800]   You might find them, but otherwise you're going to just want to make a handmade card.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:29.720]   Otherwise, you just want to remind you that December 19th is getting very close that you
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.720]   probably need to buy.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:31.720]   Okay.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.720]   You know, here's what you do.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.360]   You get you put the pre-order in.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.800]   It's going to take a couple of weeks to get it.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:40.960]   So for the box under the tree, you get a couple of those like when you go to the bank or your
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.240]   dentist's office, they have those like miniature candy canes.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:47.800]   And then you just put like a wedge of marshmallow inside the crook of the cane.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:52.240]   So it looks like a pair of obviously it's a pair of Christmas-y airpods so that A, they
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.280]   know they're getting airpods sooner or later.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.800]   And also they've got a sugar hit and it's also kind of cute.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:00.560]   Just make sure they don't stick in their ears because that will be an unhappy thing.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:04.960]   I'm looking at the Apple Store January 9th is right now.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:05.960]   Oh, that's not too hard.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.400]   Are they having a hard time making them?
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.440]   They're obviously having a hard time keeping them in stock, which is pretty impressive.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.240]   I think they overcame the initial.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:16.360]   They had couples making them and now it's just they have surged towards into the air.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.760]   Sure, that makes sense.
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:25.840]   And they also might be wrapping down slightly because they have the wireless case coming
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.840]   out early next year, the inductive charging case.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.520]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.680]   My understanding is that they're the same airpods.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:33.880]   They're just a different case.
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:34.880]   Right.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.520]   Yeah, you might have to buy it separately.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:40.320]   Although I know Ming Chi quote today said they're tweaking the airpods.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.560]   I'm just amazed at how much nicer.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:47.880]   I have a lot of headphones and I'm just the overall experience of sinking them in the
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:48.880]   back of the case.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.880]   Everything is just so much better.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.360]   And it's just like, what is it?
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:58.840]   Just amazing how all those little details of when you drop it in, it kind of pops in
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:00.960]   and the way it's set up, you put it in.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.160]   I bought those after.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.640]   Did you just whipping out my...
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.840]   The Jabra is a good example of what...
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.520]   I mean, it's so close.
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:11.840]   If it were as easy to pair, maybe they need the W1 chip, I don't know.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:12.840]   They're not as easy to pair.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.080]   And when you put them in the case, you're not totally sure that they're...
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.080]   I know.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.040]   I always open the case upside down and they fall out.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.040]   Yeah, I mean, it's just little things.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.360]   It's all those little things that didn't quite get sorted.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.360]   But the sound...
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.360]   Do you like the sound better?
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.360]   I think the sound quality's better.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.360]   The mic is not as good.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.760]   Ah, I've not made a call with it.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:29.760]   I tried it.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:33.760]   These are the Jabra Sport elites that we talked about last week.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:34.760]   But they're okay.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:35.760]   I mean, they're good.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:38.120]   I mean, I'd rather wear them.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.440]   They feel like they'll stay in my ears a lot better.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.440]   Yes.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:44.600]   I tested them this morning.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.520]   So I was listening to music in chopping wood.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:48.520]   Wow.
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:49.520]   And it was...
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.520]   Oh, they blink it.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:51.520]   They didn't pop out.
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:52.520]   They didn't pop out at all.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:53.520]   I was curious.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:54.520]   I was like, "Oh, I wonder if they'd work."
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.760]   And we cut down a tree in front of our house.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.240]   And then I got them to cut it up into pieces.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.600]   And my favorite pastime is chopping wood.
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:02.600]   That's a good...
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.400]   You know, I did that when I got fired at CanB.R.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.600]   I chopped a quart of wood.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.160]   It's a good way to get...
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.920]   I thought you were a little sweaty when I patted you.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:09.920]   Now I understand.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:10.920]   No, that was...
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:11.920]   He's wearing his lumberjack shirt, though.
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.920]   It looks good.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:13.920]   This is a Lindsey Platt.
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:14.920]   This is...
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:15.920]   Lindsey, isn't that your family?
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:16.920]   This is my family.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:17.920]   Wow.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:18.920]   I need a Dunlap Platt for my family.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.760]   I have like five of them.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.760]   So, you know, 'cause whatever...
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:22.760]   Where do you get that?
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:23.760]   LL Bean.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.400]   And it says the Lindsey Platt?
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.400]   Oh, yes.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.400]   Lindsey Platt.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.400]   And it's always so...
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.080]   Like, so what happens is I think my mom gets me a new one every year, depending on what
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:36.440]   weight I am, I get like someone between XLR to medium.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.160]   And that's usually the thing.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.840]   And she knows I'm happy with it because I kind of just wear them all upon.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.840]   See, I don't want the Dunlap tartan.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.840]   That's kind of ugly.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:45.840]   It's thin lines.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:47.840]   But the Lindsey Platt is...
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:48.840]   Yours is nice.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:49.840]   It's got red and green.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:50.840]   It's very Christmassy.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:51.840]   Mine's like blue and black.
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:52.840]   But LL Bean...
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:57.240]   We can really upset if a year pops up and LL Bean doesn't have the Lindsey Platt, but
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.240]   they sell out every year.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:52:59.240]   So we...
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.240]   There's a lot of Lindsey's.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.240]   There's not so many Dunlots.
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.240]   It's a nice...
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.240]   It's a nice platt, too.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:04.240]   Well, they never check ID.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.240]   So, maybe...
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:07.240]   Responding to the platt.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:08.240]   But back to the earpods.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:12.240]   The only thing I don't like about them long term is that they pick up the...
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.240]   The inside...
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:18.160]   The nooks and crannies inside the case picks up so much lint from inside my pants inside
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.160]   my pocket.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:23.040]   And I just flip it open and it just looks like I've been...
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.400]   It's like Pigpen.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.400]   You open your iPod case.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.400]   And I was thinking...
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.400]   I haven't had that.
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.400]   I haven't had that.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.400]   I haven't either.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.400]   And he's just...
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.400]   And he's living in a different...
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.400]   I mean, the thing I like about the end...
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:38.200]   It's all the cold dust from your furnace.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.200]   I don't have them on me, but I'll show you.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.200]   Oh, wait.
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.200]   No, actually I do...
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.760]   See, they're so small and handy.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:44.760]   I didn't even know it.
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:48.040]   And before I show you the inside, I have to point out that...
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.640]   I love your Rebel Alliance logo on there.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.440]   Yeah, I got a need to reapply.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.840]   It's been sort of...
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:58.600]   But I want to say that I did like swab it the first time this happened to see, "Oh, my
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:00.840]   God, are my ears that filthy?"
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.240]   But no, that's not it.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.200]   And so you can see it's sort of a little bit...
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.640]   I don't know if the camera will focus.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.440]   But it's just like around the seams.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:08.440]   It's a little lens.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.440]   Yeah, I see that.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.440]   Mine does that too.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.920]   I just wish it weren't little.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:16.480]   Well, they're so white that any schmutz at all really shows up.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:19.720]   I think my concern is you had a great article on cleaning them because he's very particular
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:20.720]   about that.
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.080]   Well, yeah, we talked about it on iOS today, but maybe we've been too aggressive because
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:28.000]   one of Merritt-Megan's AirPods failed.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Really?
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.200]   And some people have had that with sweat too because they're not a lot of people.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.200]   The one thing I have got...
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.600]   Oh, steam cleaning them.
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:35.600]   These are waterproof.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.200]   These Jabra Elite sports are waterproof.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.160]   So if you sweat a lot, you might want to think about those instead.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:48.520]   I do notice you can't get lazy and just leave them out though because I have had them...
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.120]   Like I walk away and I'm in the phone.
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.840]   I thought that when I took them out, they wouldn't.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:53.400]   Oh, they pair randomly.
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.400]   They're glad to pair.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.320]   I lose calls all the time because my phone just decides, "No, you don't want to listen
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.320]   this way.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.320]   You want to use those."
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:04.520]   Yeah, according to Ming Qiu, you mentioned this, Renee.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.520]   He...
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:09.720]   Remember, again, analysts predicting for investors, not for normal people.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:17.800]   He predicts AirPod shipments will double year over year to 26 to 28 million units.
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.640]   No, Apple does not say how many they sell.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.000]   So this is all just projection-
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   They love the category.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   That's a lot though.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   Wow, that's a lot.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.160]   I mean, again, I think that there's not a lot of strong competition for the average
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.160]   user.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.160]   I think the...
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:32.160]   I wouldn't...
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.400]   I'd much rather wear the Jabros for working out.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.400]   You know, than the...
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.400]   Shopable.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:41.040]   I feel like they're more secure in my ear, especially when you get the right sizes and
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.040]   you clump it in.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.800]   It really feels like it's part of your ear.
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:46.880]   But on an average use, I don't use them.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.280]   I use the AirPods.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:53.920]   Quo said the second-generation AirPods, and again, no one said anything about second-generation,
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:57.520]   but him, will include a smaller quartz component.
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.600]   I don't know what that means.
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.240]   That didn't say anything else.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:05.280]   But again, remember, he's got great connections in the supply chain.
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:10.720]   So what he's probably hearing from Inventec and the other manufacturers is, yeah, we're
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:11.720]   making them.
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:12.720]   We got a new component.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:13.720]   It doesn't sound like functional changes.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:14.720]   No.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.120]   If you buy one and you buy the other, you're not going to crack it open.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.120]   Oh, my quartz component.
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:19.920]   I mean, I think they're still figuring a lot of things out.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:24.760]   I think that there's some future there where it is kind of in your ear closer to the Jabra,
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:28.360]   and it's a really nice hear-through or not-through.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:32.560]   Well, see, the Jabra gets heart rate in the ear.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:37.200]   They get VO2 max in the ear, but they have to fit closer to do that.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.680]   But that's what I think Apple needs to do is the next step.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.320]   This does coaching as you run.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.320]   That's the next step, I think.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.720]   I guess it's the app that's doing coaching as you run.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.280]   Yeah, AirPods can do coaching, but they can't do it.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.800]   AirPods can do that with the right app, right?
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:54.280]   But the coaching's tied to your heart rate, which is getting from this.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:56.280]   I guess you've got heart rate on your watch.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.280]   Yeah, RunGo will pull it from your watch, for example.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.120]   I think we've barely seen the integration.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:04.440]   I think there's certainly the integration with workout tools and everything else where
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.440]   you're done.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:10.840]   There's going to be a point where you walk up and it designs and constantly changes your
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:14.520]   workout and every device that you're using is smart.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:16.680]   It will keep track.
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:20.000]   I think eventually it'll automatically set your weight.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.960]   You won't have any of those little pins or anything else.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.200]   It'll just set your weight.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.600]   It'll count how many you did.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:27.720]   It'll know what it's going to do next time.
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:31.400]   The high end gyms will start with it, but it'll be in 24-hour fitness in 10 years.
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:32.960]   Let's take a little break.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:38.800]   I want to talk about other news in the Apple world, including the podcast analytics features
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.000]   now in beta.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.640]   I'm curious what you podcast types think of that.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:46.640]   I have to talk to some podcasters and see what they think.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.080]   Those podcast types.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.880]   Those podcast types.
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:54.200]   And a little more about the Mac Pro and the T2 chip.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.200]   That's a fascinating chip.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.680]   We're learning a lot more about that.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:58.680]   Update for iOS.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:02.680]   You might want to do that during the commercial 11.2.1.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:04.560]   What do we get?
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.560]   We'll find out.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:11.480]   And don't buy Cuphead on the App Store.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:13.480]   It's not available.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:16.400]   It does raise some interesting issues.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:22.120]   Plus, if you're a battle star, go lactic a fan.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.120]   You got to ask them.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:24.120]   Oh, God.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.120]   That news, Leo.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.120]   Happy, happy news.
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:30.280]   First word from WordPress, my blog host.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:32.720]   For many years, I started a WordPress blog.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:36.120]   When WordPress first came out, I used every blogging platform there was.
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:41.640]   And the minute WordPress came out, I was like, I have found my Nirvana, but it wasn't perfect.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.800]   I'll tell you why I was running it on my own server.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.400]   I was hosting it.
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.000]   And that's expensive.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.520]   And more importantly, I had to spend time maintaining it, thinking about it, upgrading
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:52.840]   it.
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:54.360]   Then I found WordPress.com.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:59.400]   Other servers, much less expensive than my server, and they maintain it.
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:00.560]   They keep it secure.
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:01.560]   They keep it updated.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:03.400]   They keep all the plugins updated.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.720]   So you never have to think about it.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:09.280]   All you have to think about is your beautiful WordPress website.
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:10.880]   I use WordPress.com every day.
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:14.640]   And let me tell you whether you're looking to create a personal blog, a business site,
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.320]   or both.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:21.280]   When you create your site on WordPress.com, you help others find you, remember you, connect
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.280]   with you.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:26.760]   WordPress.com site is actually a very active social site as well.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:30.200]   So it drives traffic to your blog.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.200]   That's great.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.280]   There's a follow button, which I use.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:36.800]   I have lots of followers at WordPress.com, which means more people read my posts, more
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:42.320]   people are going to cross post, tweet about it, Facebook, my posts.
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.600]   That helps you build your business.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.240]   Literally, your customers are helping you build your business.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.000]   And you don't need to be an expert.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.760]   Sometimes people say, oh, that's too complicated for me.
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.760]   No, no, no, no.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:57.440]   Despite how great WordPress looks and the fact that everybody uses WordPress, 29% of all
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:02.400]   the websites in the world run on WordPress, including I was just reading the Facebook
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.280]   research blog post, it's on it's on WordPress, not Facebook.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.280]   I love it.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.040]   Even Facebook uses WordPress.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.400]   But you don't need to be an expert.
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.080]   You don't need to hire somebody.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.680]   They make it easy, deceptively simple, really.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.920]   You just pick a template, start blogging, start posting.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.920]   You're there.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.640]   You get built in search engine optimization automatically.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.200]   You get social sharing.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.440]   You get app.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:27.520]   So your site loads faster on mobile.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.560]   You get HTTPS secure.
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:34.120]   So your site, not only is your site secure, but Google ranks it higher because of that.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.840]   And their business plan gives you access to hundreds of plugins and themes.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:42.800]   Some plans even allow you to add your own themes and plugins from the outside world.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.440]   And what a great customer support team.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.800]   I've used them several times there.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:50.920]   They're 24/7, well, 24/5, I guess 24 hours a day, Monday through Friday.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.360]   And then they give them a little time off on the weekends.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.440]   They're there on weekends, but not all day and all night.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.280]   Plans started just $4 a month.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.240]   29% of all the websites in the world run on WordPress.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.440]   I think they're before we're done.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.560]   They're going to be a third of all the websites in the world.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.000]   That's amazing.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   We got a great deal for you as always.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   We like to arrange these with our sponsors.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.040]   If you go to wordpress.com/macbreak, 15% off your new plan.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:22.240]   15% off wordpress.com/macbreak.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:25.000]   And it'll also, as I said, let them know you saw it here.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.080]   And that helps us keep the lights on.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.760]   WordPress.com/macbreak.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.040]   That's one mistake I made.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.960]   If this were an audio show, we could just do it in the dark.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.880]   We wouldn't need to keep the lights on.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.400]   I could have a single bare ball.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.400]   It's true.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.400]   It's hard to read the notes.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.880]   All right, Renee, you said like you're interested in talking
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:48.920]   about this T2 chip.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:49.920]   I don't know anything about it.
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.200]   Tell me about it.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:54.040]   So originally, the T1 chip was what
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.560]   was inside the MacBook Pro with Touch ID.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.960]   It had a secure enclave, so it could handle things like Apple
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.880]   Pay and the display for Apple Pay.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.680]   So a merchant couldn't, for example, say, this is $20
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.400]   and then charge you $200 and not show you.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.800]   It was all really secured and locked down.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.560]   And when Apple started to look at the iMac Pro,
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.320]   they started to wonder what they could do
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.920]   when they had an ARM processor running inside the machine.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.720]   And one of the things they did, for example,
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.200]   was take a lot of the controllers,
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.240]   like the disk controllers and the sound controllers
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.320]   and the video controllers.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.520]   And they put all of that into this ARM chip.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.720]   So this ARM chip not only does all this control stuff
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.080]   in a unified way, but it does it in a secure way.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.880]   For example, people can't mess with the FaceTime camera
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.840]   or turn off the light and turn the camera on.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.000]   Do that sort of thing.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.040]   Also, because it does hardware level encryption,
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:45.040]   it has an AES engine the same way that the iPhone ARM chip does.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.360]   It can do live in-crypt decrypt.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.840]   So as you're working, all the stuff that you're working on
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.560]   is encrypted on the fly in, I think,
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.480]   pretty much real time by this chip.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.240]   And then as it's saving out, you know,
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.120]   pulling in, saving out all that data is encrypted,
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.680]   decrypted, and even if you use file vault,
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.400]   it takes significant, maybe even almost all the hit
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:07.840]   off of the actual SSD that you're spinning to do it.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.640]   It has a secure enclave, so it can do all,
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.000]   you know, it can hold the keys for you,
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.520]   it can do all that sort of stuff.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.120]   But to me, it's really interesting
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.760]   where Apple is still letting Intel do what Intel
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.920]   and AMD does best, and that is the big processor.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.520]   It's a big hot, heavy-heatsing processors.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.960]   But they're letting the smaller stuff,
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.920]   the stuff that is low power, that needs super efficiency,
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.720]   and they're offloading that to ARM.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.400]   And it seems like that is one of the big stories
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.120]   of Apple over the last few years, is this fusion.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:36.360]   And whether it's online and local, or wide-angle
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:41.360]   and telephoto, or SSD and HD, or now ARM and Intel,
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:45.280]   or even like the efficiency and performance,
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.880]   Apple's doing this too-pronged approach
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.160]   where they're pushing the performance limits on one end,
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.400]   but instead of leaving a huge gap underneath,
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.640]   they're sort of filling that with something
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.680]   that is small and efficient on the bottom side.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.240]   So T2, it feels more like an SOC and less like a system
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:02.200]   and package, which is what Apple used on the MacBook Pro.
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.280]   But I think we'll see a lot more stuff
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.640]   sort of fall under its governance
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.640]   as we go forward.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.480]   - Cable Sasser said he has, I guess,
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.920]   one of the new iMac Pros.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:13.560]   So there's new utilities that are specific
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.160]   to the T2 chip like a startup security utility.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.320]   - Yeah, it'll verify the boot and the boot will verify
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.000]   the firmware and the firmware will verify the OS
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.640]   all the way through so that no one can sort of forage
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.160]   anything into that chain.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.640]   And you can turn it off if you hate the idea of Apple
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:32.800]   encrypting and controlling your boot process.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.240]   You can go into settings and turn all that off,
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.680]   but if you like the idea of that security,
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.520]   you can leave it on.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.360]   - Sure do.
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:40.960]   And if you think about government clients, banking clients,
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.880]   I definitely could see a lot of the stuff
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.960]   being very valuable to them.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.480]   - Makes me wonder why they didn't put a fingerprint,
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.600]   a touch ID in it, 'cause it could have done that, right?
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.840]   It, T1 does it on the MacBook Pro.
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.040]   - Yeah, I think it was, so there were rumors of them doing
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.560]   a touch ID equipped magic keyboard,
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.000]   which is what this would need because the keyboard
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.880]   is separate from the chip,
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.600]   which is different than a MacBook Pro,
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.480]   where you have a hardware channel,
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.960]   but they've done sort of touch ID over wireless
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.120]   before they just encrypt the packets.
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.040]   But I think this came out at an awkward time
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.880]   where touch ID is being replaced with Face ID,
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.760]   but Face ID is not ready to scale yet.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.520]   It's still iPhone only for now.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.920]   And if this will come out next year,
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.000]   it might have Face ID, or if it come out last year,
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:19.840]   it might have touch ID.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.480]   But I think right now it was just an unfortunate consequence
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.840]   of the timing where we're caught in between
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.120]   those two biometric worlds.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.600]   - It actually could have, could,
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.200]   well, but you make an interesting point,
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.720]   it could ship a separate keyboard.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.960]   - Yeah, they could really say any time.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.520]   - Tomorrow, then has it.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.680]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.800]   - That's interesting.
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.800]   I would love to see that.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.720]   I mean, they're not talking about it.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.600]   They're saying we did this for device level security
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.880]   and performance.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:47.720]   - Right.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:52.560]   - Not for voice recognition.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.000]   - And I think they haven't announced that yet.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.640]   I'm sure that's coming, but they haven't announced,
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:59.080]   "Hey, it's Lomo for this device."
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.680]   - And I think that Apple's definitely taken advantage
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:06.440]   of what it has to offer as far as being a closed system.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.360]   You know, that it can do all of these things.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.120]   With the OS working with the hardware,
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.960]   you know, this is something from a, on a PC side
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:14.520]   that would be, you know, more difficult to achieve.
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.880]   - So I ordered one, what the hell?
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.200]   - That put me over the top.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.280]   It's a T2 chip.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.200]   Three gigahertz, 10 core.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.280]   You said that was the sweet spot.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.360]   64 gigs, terabyte.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.680]   You said I don't need more.
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.280]   - No, I don't think so.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.680]   - Fega 64, right, 'cause why not?
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.720]   - Yeah. - I'm not an animal.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.560]   - Yolo, Yolo.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:36.020]   (laughing)
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:39.240]   - John's getting all excited now.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.600]   - We got a review over yours.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:45.040]   - It'll be, this is like, every YouTube video
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:49.160]   where the friends are sitting around the guy
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:52.240]   in the bicycle saying, "No, no, you totally almost made that."
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.120]   If you just pedal a little bit harder,
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.400]   you'll definitely clear the gap
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.040]   between those two buildings.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.840]   - So you're saying this is gonna be a fail video
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.480]   on YouTube next week?
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.560]   - I'm just saying that when friends are recommending
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.720]   you do something and they have no skin in the game,
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.840]   just think of it.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.480]   - So January 4th, so what I'm hoping,
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:13.240]   it won't be in time for the next live Mac break weekly,
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.000]   but it will be for January 9th's Mac break weekly,
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.480]   and I'll have-- - CES special.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.480]   - The CES special, and I'll have a lot more to say.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:23.000]   I'm not replacing this, I like my Surface Studio.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.200]   - We'll make a thing so we can lay down.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.040]   - Well, oh, I didn't order the Visa mount.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:27.920]   I should get the Visa mount.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:31.040]   We probably could have some sort of Visa mount.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.280]   Could you make a way, or you dig a hole in the desk?
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.440]   - Only you could-- - It's gotta be a way
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.400]   to do it. - Only had a touch screen.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.280]   - Oh, you see the lack of touch, that does it.
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:40.680]   I can't do that. - I'm keeping the Surface Studio.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.000]   I like the Surface Studio.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.600]   But I think we should review it.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.080]   I think we need to review it.
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.360]   - Absolutely. - Yeah.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.800]   - Alex, shouldn't there be a way to just set up
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.920]   three cameras to keep an eye on the screen
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.880]   to track your finger and translate that
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:57.280]   into a virtual pointer device?
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.160]   - There are many technologies that allow for that.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.640]   They're just not very, the resolution is not very high.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.160]   But that's how the smart boards work,
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:10.000]   and that's how the, they only use one to triangulate it.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   But, and they, people make covers for the screens.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.640]   So it's like a little touch thing,
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.560]   but none of it works great.
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.840]   And then it also, some of them are the ones
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.160]   that work really well that you can just touch really,
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.920]   use basically an infrared at the very bottom.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.520]   And then if you use certain kinds of lights in a studio,
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.760]   it doesn't work anymore.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:33.640]   Just in case you're wondering,
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.280]   it's not that that's ever happened to me
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.920]   when I need to work on a TV show.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:38.800]   - I'm just curious.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.120]   I'm just thinking, I'm looking to look
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:43.880]   at our Mac break weekly show numbers here.
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:48.880]   We, we use a pod track to do the show numbers.
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.040]   And let me just get a report,
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.360]   'cause I'm just curious how many of our listeners
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:55.800]   listen on iTunes, right?
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.720]   That would be the thing that would be most interesting.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.400]   And I think that they do tell us by source here.
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:06.120]   Oh, I have to enable Flash Player.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.280]   - Oh, what?
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.960]   - Well, it's an old site.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:14.360]   So it looks like, wow, that's interesting.
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:19.040]   Mozilla, iPhone, Stitcher, and S Player,
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.440]   is an S Player iTunes?
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.280]   That's something Apple.
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:24.800]   Apple Media, Apple Mobile, something, I think,
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.680]   is the app. - I have,
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:26.520]   I have, I have, I have.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.240]   - I have iTunes, Windows.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.880]   So really the biggest slice,
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:33.200]   which is interesting by source is Unknown, 61.52%.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.800]   This is a Mac break weekly.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.320]   I should do it, let's do it quarterly.
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.440]   That's just one show.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.440]   So let's do quarterly, that'll give you more.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:44.440]   So the next slice is Mozilla Linux.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.800]   But I think that's because a lot of browsers,
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.160]   including maybe even Safari, identify as Mozilla.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.840]   So that might, that's just browser.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.160]   iPhone is 6%, right?
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.680]   So that means that's Apple Core Media.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:59.400]   That means using the podcast app on the iPhone, right?
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:05.400]   6%, Stitcher 6%, and S Player, whatever that is.
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.120]   Clearly an Apple product, 'cause the next step,
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:12.120]   NS, 2%, iPad 2%, iTunes, Windows 2%.
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:16.400]   iTunes can't be more than say, you know,
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.520]   25% of our total downloads.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.840]   Oh, here it is.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:20.960]   Here it is.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.680]   And it's not bright percentage,
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:27.680]   but iTunes Macintosh, 289,000, 295 downloads
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.560]   out of 1.8 million.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.880]   So that's for a quarter.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:35.760]   In other words, it's not a big player for us.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.840]   How about for you guys for, I mean,
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:40.480]   I'm more, you're doing mostly Apple stuff.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.880]   Yeah, I'm more, excuse higher,
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:43.720]   Vector skews more towards overcast right now,
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.520]   which I thought was interesting.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.800]   Oh, this was all about Android.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.800]   Wait a minute.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.720]   I accidentally, that would explain a lot, wouldn't it?
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.800]   Let me go to Mac break weekly.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.840]   Pocketcast, unusually high.
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:56.560]   No, that's pretty much the same.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:59.160]   Unknown.
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:02.760]   Oh yeah, look at that Apple Core Media, 39% iPhone,
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.800]   iPad 7%.
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.760]   So it's more, yeah, it's closer to half,
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.600]   or maybe even more than half iTunes.
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.440]   Okay, so that's a big difference.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.280]   I was looking at the wrong show.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:16.360]   The reason I mention this is because Apple has podcast analytics,
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:19.520]   but they only count for people who listen
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.400]   to Apple podcasts or use iTunes, right?
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:26.600]   I think that we do a lot of analysis of shows.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:30.280]   So there was some of our first web materials
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.440]   that we built were from a company called On Networks
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.720]   a long time ago, and they had great analytics.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:35.960]   It's now become like UStudio,
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.120]   and they still do all the analytics.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.400]   And you got to watch how people watch your show.
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.520]   So regardless of whether everybody watches it or not,
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.720]   if you have a high enough sample rate,
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.520]   you're gonna get a flow of things.
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:46.080]   I guess you're right, because you know,
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.360]   it may not be 100%, but it's a,
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.240]   it's a fairly representative sample, I guess.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.320]   Yeah, I think of it as like a polling thing.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.920]   They're not asking everybody in the United States
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:57.040]   whether they like Trump, they ask 1,000,
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:57.880]   and then they travel late.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.800]   But even if they get as much as 50%,
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.720]   that's gonna be pretty, as much as 10%.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.400]   Might be skewed a little bit by the fact
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.800]   that it's in the platform, the platform, it's Apple.
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.520]   I think it'd be iOS, or I believe it'll be iOS,
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.480]   or the desktop or iTunes.
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:16.400]   And the big thing is, is that what you really get to see
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.560]   when you start looking at that data is,
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.920]   what you did during the show.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.480]   Like, so there's definitely curves that you wanna see.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.880]   You know, if you see a real big spike at the beginning,
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.480]   that means your marketing is good.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:30.120]   If you see the slow drop off, it means that your,
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.320]   the content isn't compelling because you're,
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.160]   you know, losing people slowly.
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.120]   If it drops off really fast, it means you did something
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.560]   that made them really upset.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.440]   If it jumps up really high, then you look at like,
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.560]   did you, did someone tweet during the show?
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.880]   Did someone, did you do something that was crazy?
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.600]   You know, there's, so looking at all that data
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.880]   allows you to make a better show.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.800]   So it's very valuable.
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.600]   I think it's huge that Apple did this.
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:56.760]   - I don't even know what, I wanna log into our analytics.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.400]   What account do we use?
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:01.320]   Would you ask Patrick, what account do we use?
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:04.560]   Do we, does anybody know (laughs)
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.960]   to post on iTunes?
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.240]   It's not my account.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:11.600]   - Oh well, we'll have to find.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.080]   But, but so that's what you do, you log in
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.400]   and then you get some analytics.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.280]   I presume Renee, you're doing this.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:20.040]   - Yes, although I haven't had much time to play around it.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.440]   I was at the session at WWDC where they introduced it.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.640]   And I know it's scarce some people,
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.120]   'cause some people think it's like big,
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.800]   big analytics moving in like on the web
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.440]   and they're gonna start micromanaging their purchases
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:33.080]   based on every second of audience engagement
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:36.000]   or some, you know, insert your marketing buzzword on there.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.560]   But I like to look at it from Alex's point of view,
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.360]   which is what is it telling me about how the show
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.200]   is being listened to?
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.120]   And granted, if your show is all about Android,
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:47.440]   maybe very few people are listening to an iTunes.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.960]   But for people who have Apple-centric shows,
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.120]   I think, or people who just have very pop culture
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:54.880]   shows in general by which iOS is a huge platform for them,
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.840]   then I think that it's just more information.
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.600]   And the trick is a lot of people get focused on data,
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.600]   but data is worthless without good analytics.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.640]   They data actually tells you nothing.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.280]   Even if you see big spikes or big valleys,
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.120]   they don't maybe, you know,
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.120]   they don't really tell you that much
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.480]   unless you know how to interpret them.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.880]   I think for people who are skilled,
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:11.640]   people like Alex who are skilled with this,
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.360]   it's a lot more and a lot better data sort of.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:16.520]   >> Well, and I can speak, you know, in radio,
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:20.720]   you don't let the boss, the program director,
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:22.480]   the DJs read the numbers.
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.280]   You have a research director who has studied statistics
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:29.360]   and understands what this all means to tell you,
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:30.920]   because you just look at the raw numbers,
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:34.360]   it's you're going to maybe draw the wrong conclusion from it.
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:35.200]   >> Yeah.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.320]   >> But I think definitely looking at it
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:39.160]   will help a lot of people shows.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:40.000]   >> It's very valuable.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.080]   >> Because again, you can start,
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.360]   there's so many things that we do in our live broadcast
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:46.360]   that are based on that data.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:47.640]   You know, and whether it's that data
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.760]   or it's data on a live broadcast, you know,
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.440]   so when you watch the live feed,
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.880]   you can usually watch that data
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.320]   and that tells you so much about
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.720]   whether you are doing a good job or not,
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.160]   you know, as far as holding people,
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:02.200]   as far as attracting new people, all of those things.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:05.360]   >> I'm just trying to, actually more than half
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.520]   of our downloads for this show
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.760]   are I'm just doing the calculator,
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.400]   are from some form.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:16.440]   Does every kind of app, so if it's iPhone, iPad,
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:19.080]   does every Apple, Apple count everything
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.480]   from every Apple source?
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.680]   >> I mean, it's interesting because some apps
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:26.560]   use Apple technologies, so they'll report as, you know,
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.600]   like Apple's whatever framework or foundation it is
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.600]   or Core, I forget the media player name,
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.320]   but they should give you at least very good insight
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.760]   into what the Apple devices are doing.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:37.040]   And then as it gets further away from the Apple ecosystem,
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:37.880]   it's not so much.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.520]   >> 62% of our downloads for Mac Break Weekly
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:43.440]   are through some Apple thing, iPhone or iPad.
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.840]   So we would get numbers for 62, presumably,
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.800]   I'm guessing 62% of our audience.
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.480]   >> And you're right, that's statistically very significant.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.320]   At least for this show.
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.600]   >> You would definitely have a very clear idea
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.840]   of how people will send you the show.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:54.760]   >> Well, I gotta pay attention.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:58.920]   You know, the only reason I resent it is I presume
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.520]   they're also gonna provide this at some point
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:02.240]   to advertisers or not.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.320]   >> I think that'll be your choice,
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:05.000]   but advertisers may ask for it.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.640]   You know, like that, you know,
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.480]   I don't think Apple's gonna give it to them, but Apple.
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:10.920]   >> Oh good, but advertisers are gonna say,
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.760]   hey, let me see how the show's going.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.840]   They wanna know whether--
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.200]   >> We give them raw numbers.
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:17.880]   I mean, they, and this is pretty much typical
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:21.640]   of all broadcast media, you pay per thousand impressions.
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:26.200]   So in broadcast, it's called CPM and cost per thousand.
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:29.000]   And which doesn't make any sense at all, CPM.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.160]   >> No, I mean, the whole thing is a lot.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.280]   >> Because they would pay the most.
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:33.680]   When they knew the least about their audience,
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.280]   they paid the most because like you get a magazine
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.040]   or newspaper and give it off to five different people
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:37.960]   and they never knew.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.000]   And then they got the television,
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.400]   it was slightly better and they paid less
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.960]   and they get the internet and it's precise
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.280]   and they wanna pay even less
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.560]   instead of taking it as a brand marketing opportunity.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:46.400]   I mean, it's just--
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.960]   >> But you can see why broadcasters
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.600]   wanna control additional information.
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:52.600]   I don't necessarily wanna share audience information
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:56.840]   with advertisers or I wanna control how I share
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:58.760]   that with advertisers, not because I don't want them
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.640]   to know 'cause I wanna protect our audience's privacy.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:02.480]   It's a privacy issue,
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.880]   but that's why Apple would probably also do this.
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.760]   >> I don't think Apple would have any issue
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:09.840]   as sharing, but I think that as a podcaster,
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.560]   you'll probably end up as this gets bigger.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.440]   >> Well, they'll be demand to share your bet.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.560]   And that's another issue is that,
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.720]   when advertisers know that information's there,
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.160]   they're gonna say, "Well, you know,
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.560]   "you wanna see if it's their ad to the tail end of the show,
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.080]   "how many people are gonna watch you in the tail end of the show?"
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:24.840]   They're not gonna wanna know how many people totally--
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.760]   >> So let's pretend none of that exists
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:27.600]   and just move on.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.760]   >> But then you can charge them more
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.240]   for the beginning of the show, Alex,
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:31.080]   the class has to--
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.320]   >> Exactly.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.440]   >> The old price is just for the end of the show.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:35.920]   The new price is three years entire.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.200]   >> Are you-- I don't know, it's Mike Hurley using this.
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.880]   Do you know Andy is--
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:41.720]   >> I have.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:45.960]   >> I am on the wrong side of the editorial barrier.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:46.800]   >> Yeah.
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.560]   >> So you don't wanna know, and I don't blame you.
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:51.520]   We try not to tell hosts that kind of information.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.760]   >> I'm very-- I'll say just as a podcaster,
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.280]   I'm very, very pleased at the relationships
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.400]   that I have with podcast networks.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:00.400]   Means that I can just focus on doing good shows.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.600]   If there's something that I need to be told about,
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:06.360]   then the people who produce the show,
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.280]   let me know what that is.
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.120]   >> Yes.
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.160]   >> But I feel as though I would--
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:14.480]   I might go nuts if I had access to that specific data
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:18.080]   and try to figure out how I can get another 2,000 listeners
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.360]   or 10,000 listeners.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:22.200]   I know I would go nuts if all of a sudden
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:25.640]   the business end was saying, "Oh, you really had a good spike.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.440]   "And we don't know, we were trying to figure out why it was.
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.360]   "And we know that that was the time
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:33.120]   "you were wearing a University of Colorado hat."
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:33.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.280]   >> Over the last week, you're wearing a Red Sox hat, so--
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:35.800]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:36.280]   >> Don't worry.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.160]   >> That's why you don't wanna work in real media,
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:41.080]   'cause you hear stuff like that.
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:42.920]   >> And it's the worst.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.400]   And so, yeah, I don't-- I wanna isolate our hosts
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:47.160]   from anything but editorial content.
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:48.120]   That's all that matters.
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.240]   >> What I like about it is that I can look at it
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.400]   and go back to the show and go, "Oh, right,
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.400]   "that's what we did."
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:54.240]   (laughs)
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:55.080]   Like that worked or didn't.
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.240]   And if I don't see it, then I just go,
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.200]   "Well, that's a anomaly."
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.040]   >> Yeah.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:18:59.880]   >> 'Cause sometimes it is.
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.760]   So, but-- and I think that you have to watch enough of it
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:04.360]   and also be clear that you don't really know.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.640]   You're just, you know, but a lot of times,
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.440]   what we find is that you can see certain things.
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.600]   Like I can see bumps in a live stream
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.680]   when a different person comes on the show.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.000]   And you know, and it's a different star,
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:14.720]   it's a different thing.
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:16.600]   You know, they-- you can see these little bumps and then--
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:17.840]   >> Stuff I don't wanna know.
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.560]   (laughs)
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.120]   >> It allows us to design them.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:21.640]   >> Yeah.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:25.000]   >> As a broadcaster, you know, if you're the boss,
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:25.640]   you do wanna know.
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:27.760]   >> I mean, there's an Iambic pentameter kind of thing
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.040]   that you kind of start approaching.
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.640]   I wanna have a heartbeat thing,
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.280]   where I'm gonna let you kind of do this stuff
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.120]   and then I wanna bring something.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:37.200]   And then you watch some, you know, the stream we did last week
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.840]   just went like this the whole time.
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.680]   And that's a great--
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.280]   >> I think it's tricky though, and again,
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:45.120]   and to reiterate, it's easy to misinterpret this data.
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:45.960]   >> Oh, yeah.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.120]   And you definitely have to know that you probably
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.280]   only know half the story.
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.640]   But as you watch, you know, we do a couple hundred events a year.
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.520]   As you watch those events over time,
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:57.080]   you start getting a sense of what you're looking at.
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.440]   Hey, should I have bought AppleCare for my--
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.280]   >> Yes.
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:01.120]   >> I'm actually--
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:01.960]   >> You believe this?
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:02.800]   >> I bought AppleCare.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:06.040]   >> It costs the same to buy AppleCare for,
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:08.440]   even if you get a $13,000 iMac Pro,
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:11.440]   it costs $169.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.480]   No matter what, right?
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.400]   >> I'm looking at cost of entry.
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:14.400]   I mean, it's--
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.440]   >> What was the cost more to buy an iPhone AppleCare?
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.800]   >> What was the last time that you forgot to take your iMac Pro
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:22.360]   out of your pants before you put it in the wash?
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:23.200]   >> What could go--
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.360]   >> Nobody times you drop your iMac.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:25.960]   >> Yeah, you're not gonna drop it, right?
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:28.000]   So do you buy AppleCare?
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:28.960]   >> I have everything.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:29.800]   >> Really?
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.640]   >> I win.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:31.880]   I win all the time.
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:33.320]   >> Well, I have this thing where the minute after
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:34.960]   the warranty expires, everything breaks.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.720]   And so I've learned to get a Senate warranty
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:37.920]   because I just take it into guest fix.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.680]   >> Our hardware lives a hard life.
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:41.440]   You know, like it's on the road.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:44.600]   It's dropped, you know, moved around and, you know,
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:47.560]   we definitely get our money's worth out of that.
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:51.320]   >> MacBook Air is $249, MacBook $249, iPhone 10,
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.160]   $199.
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.440]   >> And these are all statistics.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.200]   They just know that your iMac--
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:56.360]   >> You're not gonna drop your iMac.
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.600]   >> Is gonna be sitting on your desk.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.960]   >> It's much less likely to go bad than your MacBook Air
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.280]   or MacBook or iPhone.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:04.480]   >> Yeah, I mean, truthfully, that's why I don't buy it
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:07.320]   'cause you're deciding whether you want Apple to ensure
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.720]   or whether you want to ensure and self-insure.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.520]   >> You're paying for the clumsiest customer,
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:12.360]   which is me, Leo.
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:13.200]   I thank you.
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.360]   >> And that's what I don't wanna do.
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.840]   That's why I don't.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:19.760]   Apple is putting, okay, so Apple has so much cash.
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:23.680]   We mentioned last week that they spent $400 million
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.400]   to buy Shazam.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:28.480]   Apparently, according to Recode,
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:32.840]   Apple's putting $400 million into lasers.
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:34.120]   >> Frickin' laser beam.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:38.320]   >> They're actually giving $390 million to Finisar.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:42.240]   This is part of that Apple kind of investment program,
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:45.640]   where they are actually giving money to their suppliers
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:47.360]   to make them better.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.320]   And they're gonna build a plant,
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.720]   Finisar's gonna build a plant in Texas
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:53.800]   for vertical cavity surface emitting lasers.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:57.560]   And aren't you glad?
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.720]   The world needs more VC cells.
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:02.760]   >> When you look at this, I think this points towards
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:04.160]   facial recognition in the iMac,
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:09.160]   in your MacBook Pro, in the reverse side of the...
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:14.160]   >> The C iPhone X face scanner uses it.
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.560]   >> Basically, having all of that, and definitely AR.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.920]   I mean, the AirPods use it.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:21.080]   I didn't know that to sense your ears.
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.960]   It's like the proximity sensor, basically.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:27.360]   Huh, I didn't know they were lasers.
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.560]   >> Sounds scarier when you see a laser.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:29.600]   People don't want to put them in their ears,
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.160]   so you just take infrared sensors.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.240]   >> Infrared sensors.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:36.200]   Apple has other sources than Finisar.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.200]   And so one of the reasons Apple pumps money
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.160]   into one supplier is to, what?
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.240]   Make sure it's--
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.200]   >> Favorite nation.
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.040]   >> Yeah.
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:44.880]   >> Yeah, most favorite nation.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.560]   >> Make sure they're first in line,
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.320]   but also to have some influence
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.960]   on how they grow their business,
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:50.800]   how they run their business.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:53.080]   Basically, that's their ability to say,
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:55.400]   you know, as long as we're holding the pink slip
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:56.600]   to this equipment, you're going to make it
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:58.760]   to our specifications, to our tolerances.
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:02.040]   And maybe we'll also give them some exclusivity.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:05.240]   I remember how it was years before people,
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:07.320]   or any other phone had a fingerprint sensor
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:09.080]   that was half as good as Apple's.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.720]   That's because for time they had basically a lock
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.360]   on that particular technology,
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.960]   that particular model of sensor.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:15.800]   >> Yeah.
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:17.720]   >> I had a, we had, I knew somebody that was building
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:20.600]   a little converter box in,
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.160]   and they couldn't finish the converter box.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.760]   They had the designs done, and I was like,
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:24.600]   why?
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.600]   And I said, well, they share like two chips with the phone.
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.440]   >> Yeah.
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:29.200]   >> And it literally the whole world's why,
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.360]   when Apple released it, they had to wait like four months
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:32.600]   to put their product out,
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:34.120]   because they just couldn't compete with Apple.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.160]   >> This is part of Apple's $1 billion advanced manufacturing
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:38.760]   fund, and there's a political purpose too,
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:40.440]   because this is too.
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:43.360]   Apple says, it's not an investment, this is an award.
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.240]   >> I wish I, I gotta figure out something
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:47.200]   that they can get awarded $300 million.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.720]   >> Hell of a leg lamp for that much money.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:51.440]   >> That's pretty good.
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:52.680]   >> You did a great job.
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:53.520]   >> You used $300 million.
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:56.120]   >> 200 million to Corning, same thing for, you know,
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:57.200]   the Gorilla Glass.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:00.600]   So, yeah, but this is political too,
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.600]   because it supports American,
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:05.080]   it's an American manufacturing jobs,
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.200]   and Apple's gonna put out, in fact,
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:12.320]   Apple did produce a feature report about how the $390 million
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:16.800]   will transform the future of this Texas town.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.200]   >> Yeah, what Texas town?
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:22.320]   I don't know, Sherman, Sherman, Texas.
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:27.520]   You know, in 2012, the plant closed in Sherman, Texas.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.800]   Bruce Armstrong has been walking through that empty plant
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.840]   ever since, always holding out hope
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:36.120]   that would come alive again.
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:38.040]   Well, thanks to Apple,
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:41.520]   that hope is about to become a reality.
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:45.920]   Here's Finisar workers wearing specialized gear
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:48.120]   in the VC cell manufacturing area
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.880]   to avoid contaminating the wafers.
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:52.280]   I don't know why they're behind bars,
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:54.640]   but probably because of high security.
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:58.160]   All right.
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.760]   >> They have the journalists behind bars,
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:00.600]   just a process and a measure.
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.440]   >> Oh, that's right.
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:03.800]   Yes, that's who is, that's who's behind bars.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:06.160]   Looks like the bars are decorated for Christmas.
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:09.120]   Anyway, let's take another break.
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:10.840]   I wanna get you a picture of the week,
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:14.880]   but first a word from the stocking stuffer
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.080]   of 2017, and I can tell you how I know that
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:19.200]   because we all have gadgets we lose.
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:21.640]   We all have more gadgets than ever before,
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:23.080]   but many of those gadgets,
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:26.320]   I'm sad to say, are ending up underneath sofa cushions,
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.360]   underneath beds like my AirPods.
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.080]   I have two AirPods,
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:32.040]   two, I bought a second pair of AirPods
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.920]   'cause I lost my first and then we found them under the bed.
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:39.400]   So that's why now all my stuff has a tracker on it,
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.080]   the coin size tracking device using Bluetooth LE
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.600]   to pair with your smartphone
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:48.600]   and help you keep an eye on your most valued possessions.
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:55.040]   We're all looking for something, love, purpose,
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:57.720]   unforgettable experiences,
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:00.920]   but for most of us, it's our keys.
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:04.040]   And years ago, tracker changed the world
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.560]   with the first Bluetooth tracking device,
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:07.640]   and now they've done it again.
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:10.760]   They got the new really sweet tracker pixel.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:11.840]   It's the size of a dime.
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.920]   It's the lightest Bluetooth tracking device on the market,
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.400]   and it has LEDs on it, which helps you find it.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.960]   If they're, see if I had it on my AirPods,
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:22.240]   out of the bed, I would have seen the lights.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:24.320]   - Back into it, the guy who does Halide,
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:26.240]   he said he throws one in his bag before he checks it,
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:27.840]   then it's always easy to keep track
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.040]   when he gets off his flight.
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.600]   - Totally know where your bags are.
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.920]   - Yep, and now remember, Bluetooth only goes for,
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.680]   see this crowd locate notification
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:36.760]   if you're watching the video.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:38.680]   Bluetooth only goes about 150 feet.
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:41.600]   If your bags are farther than that,
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:43.280]   don't worry, you can still find out where they are
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:44.600]   because you can get notifications.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:45.680]   You turn on the notifications,
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.840]   and then anybody who has the tracker app on their phone,
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.440]   they'll auto, because of Bluetooth LA,
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.720]   there's no pairing, it automatically,
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:54.600]   it'll see the tracker and say, oh,
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.760]   and add it to your, it'll send you a notification
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:57.880]   and add it to the map.
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.480]   So you know where everything is,
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:02.960]   thanks to get this five million trackers
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.360]   all over the world, everywhere you go.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.840]   It's the largest crowd locate network anywhere in the world.
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:10.520]   Plus with a 30 day money back guarantee,
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.040]   you have nothing to lose, I'd sound like keys,
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:13.280]   it's in my bag, what you have one?
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.280]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.280]   they should give these to the baggage handlers.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:20.280]   They should just put it on bags.
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:23.160]   You know, Denver Airport could have saved millions
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.720]   if they just used trackers.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:25.560]   - Oh man.
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:27.200]   - Go to the tracker.com/macbreak,
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.800]   you'll save 20% off any order.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.440]   It is not, I think it's not too late to order for Christmas,
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:35.240]   but you've got to do it right now.
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.680]   These are great stocking stuffers
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.560]   when you're given those nice gadgets,
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:40.840]   put some trackers in the stocking
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:43.320]   to help them keep from losing them all sorts of colors.
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:48.320]   Go to THETRACKR, the tracker.com/macbreak for 20% off.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:53.040]   Now a little hard to remember how to spell tracker,
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:54.400]   so I'm gonna spell it for you, THE,
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:57.520]   you got that, tracker's missing the E before the R so it's
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:02.520]   THETRACKR.com/macbreak20% off at the tracker.com/macbreak
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:06.600]   we thank them for their support.
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.040]   - A Macbreak Wiggly.
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:09.760]   - I, my pick is my new Fidget Spinner.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.280]   Thank you, Alex, Lindsey, I just love this.
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:15.560]   It is Jon, I'm Renee Ritchie, you're pick of the week.
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.560]   - So I have two because the first one
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.160]   I haven't actually had a chance to play yet,
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:22.240]   but it's inside, it's a really well-known console game
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:25.240]   that has finally quote unquote, finally made its way to iOS.
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:26.920]   And I know my coworker, Laurie Gill,
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:29.160]   lost her entire weekend.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.840]   - I've been looking for a good new game.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.760]   - Oh, so if you like ambiance and you like,
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.760]   it's just, it's gorgeous.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:38.800]   And people are just enjoying the,
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:40.440]   I've been afraid to play it because I only have
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.000]   a couple hours of sleep left in the night
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.600]   and I'm afraid I'll give that up
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.680]   and then I start playing it.
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:49.680]   But if you are looking for just a beautiful, beautiful iOS game,
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:52.520]   this is, this is the game for you.
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:54.080]   - It's a puzzle kind of.
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:56.200]   - Yeah, you know, again, I haven't played it.
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.560]   I just saw everybody I know freaking out about it.
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:01.280]   The minute it hit iOS, my Twitter just lit up inside,
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.200]   inside's available.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.440]   And then I asked Laurie about it.
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:05.760]   She said, oh yeah, spent the entire weekend playing it.
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:06.600]   - Down low.
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:09.760]   - That was, that was as good a recommendation.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.360]   I've downloaded, I've not yet opened it.
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:12.800]   I'm afraid, I'm so afraid.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.600]   - I need a good game 'cause I've already made
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.080]   all the paper clips in the universe.
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.000]   - Oh, no, I know.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:18.920]   - So, I know.
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:19.920]   (laughing)
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:23.800]   - My second pick is DJ Pro for Mac was updated.
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:25.640]   Now there's DJ Pro 2.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:28.040]   And this is an app that a lot of professional DJ players use.
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:29.880]   And I've used it just because it's fun,
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.120]   especially if you have friends over
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.640]   to have that sort of interface up,
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:35.040]   either on your iPad or on your Mac.
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:37.680]   But now the Mac version has gotten a huge boost.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:39.360]   And they didn't really make it formulio,
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:40.960]   but it feels like they did because they have
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.920]   this machine learning thing that makes it possible
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:46.240]   for even complete sound morons like me
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:49.160]   to actually have two songs sort of mixed together.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:51.280]   Because the machine learning has just been trained
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:55.280]   to identify the perfect endpoints and outpoints for songs.
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:56.960]   And you can hook it up to Spotify if you have it.
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:59.440]   So you basically have unlimited records with you.
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:01.040]   And then you just pick the songs
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:04.880]   and it will handle mixing them together for you.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:07.480]   And it'll also, if you throw photographs at it,
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:09.040]   it'll time the photographs to the beat.
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:10.360]   So if you have a television set at home
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:13.520]   or if you're a pro DJ and you have a giant screen behind you,
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:15.920]   you can instead of just using stock images,
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:17.720]   you can throw your own photos and stuff in there.
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:20.200]   And it will time the show, the visual show
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:23.400]   to go with the audio show in real time of what you're doing.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:24.400]   And it's algorithm.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:28.560]   They won the Apple Design Award for Accessibility at WWDC.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:32.160]   So it's fully accessible, which I think is absolutely terrific.
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.880]   And it's a great update to an already great app.
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:39.200]   I know you were probably going to mention draft speakers.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.600]   I saved it for you because it was such a good job.
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.800]   Well, so this, I only learned about it
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:47.200]   because of the Vector podcast, Renee's Vector podcast.
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:49.440]   Merlin Mann was on and he talked about it.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.360]   And it's one of those programs you might, you know,
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:54.480]   drive by on your iPhone or iPad and see it in the app store.
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:56.440]   It's an indie developer, Greg Pierce, this one guy.
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:57.440]   It was amazing.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.440]   It was an amazing thing.
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:00.600]   Yeah, as that is, as a tortoise.
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:04.760]   Anyway, the problem with it is you look at it and you go,
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.000]   I don't need that.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.480]   It's a text entry program.
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:10.920]   So you already have, you know, notes and reminders
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:13.720]   and everything else, you know, email and messages.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.160]   You have a keyboard.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:19.520]   But drafts is like the keyboard on steroids.
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.800]   It supports Markdown.
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:23.880]   But more importantly, you can download actions
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:26.480]   and there's lots of third party actions.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:29.720]   And it works with the, I see my key is I don't want to type.
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.720]   I want to dictate and it works with the Apple Watch.
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:33.840]   I put a complication on my Apple Watch.
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:37.400]   And so if anything strikes me, a quotation to do,
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:42.160]   a reminder, a text entry of any kind, a message I want to send,
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:45.000]   a tweet I want to send, I can dictate it on my watch.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.480]   It automatically then goes to my phone and my iPad.
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:48.880]   I can correct it.
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:51.480]   And just as easily as using any Twitter app, for instance,
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:53.360]   you know the character count, which by the way,
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.680]   is a very handy thing.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:56.680]   You can send it to Twitter or--
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:58.720]   Time and space shifting for text.
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:03.840]   It's basically a front end for all your iOS apps.
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.320]   4.99.
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:08.040]   If you're Merlin, you can make it so that the first line
[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:09.600]   is the name of the journal you want to update.
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:12.480]   And the second line is the entry you want to append it to.
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:16.080]   And you can just go as deeply Merlin-y as you want to.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:16.760]   And that's the thing.
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:18.560]   When you look at it, you go, well, first of all,
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:19.280]   why is it five bucks?
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:21.040]   What do I need this for?
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.400]   And it really does.
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:23.840]   You've got to watch the screencast.
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:26.320]   Listen to the podcast for sure.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:29.000]   And watch all the screencasts.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.280]   And then really, it only gets valuable when you put some effort
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.560]   and customization into it.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:37.200]   But once you do, it's a whole new workflow.
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:38.760]   We should also public service announcement.
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:41.600]   Do not buy Cuphead in the App Store.
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.280]   You can't anymore.
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.480]   Yeah, it was a fake.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.480]   It was a bundle.
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:47.400]   I don't understand why these things are sneaking
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:48.520]   into the App Store.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:49.960]   Isn't Apple paying attention?
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:50.880]   This was a five dollar--
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:53.560]   I have no idea how this got passed app.
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:54.200]   It's the second one.
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:56.360]   There was a Bitcoin wallet that got through.
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:57.080]   There's been a lot.
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:58.400]   There's a history of fake apps.
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:00.120]   Any time an app has been popular,
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.720]   like there's suddenly there'll be an app that just
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:02.640]   has a screenshot of it.
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:05.240]   And they'll try to charge people before they get caught
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:05.960]   and pull down.
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:07.280]   And maybe there's a volume issue.
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:10.920]   Maybe they're using utilities to check them before humans do.
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.000]   But it's a problem.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.360]   They absolutely have to fix.
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.560]   They can't let this happen.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.640]   And you can get a refund.
[01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:17.160]   The important thing is if you bought it by accident,
[01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:19.240]   if you saw the original article that went up,
[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:21.560]   where you saw it on Twitter, and someone said, buy it,
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:22.400]   and you went and got it.
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:24.720]   You can just go to your receipt, hit the report, a problem
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.040]   thing, and ask for a refund.
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:28.680]   And iTunes will give you your money.
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:31.120]   Mr. Alex Lindsay, he's typing furiously.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:33.680]   That probably means he's either buying something or--
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.360]   I've already bought everything so far.
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:36.680]   It's trying to help out.
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:37.360]   It's working.
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:41.240]   So I have two little things to talk about.
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:45.040]   One is-- two things to recommend is
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.640]   Commenda, which is--
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:47.560]   This is your app.
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:48.360]   We made it.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:51.640]   So what you do is you just log into Facebook
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:52.240]   through the app.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:53.400]   I'm doing it right now.
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:54.080]   OK.
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:54.600]   Yeah, I don't have.
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:55.840]   We don't gather much information.
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:56.760]   Continuing is Leo.
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:57.480]   What is this?
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:02.960]   Now what you can do is if you go to Facebook, open another tab.
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:03.480]   OK.
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:04.160]   I'll show you.
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.000]   And do a Facebook--
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.040]   And go Facebook Live Map.
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:12.080]   Facebook Live Map.
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:13.600]   This is a map of a lot of Facebook.
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:14.600]   Click on that.
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.200]   And then--
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:15.720]   Live.
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.360]   There you go.
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:21.520]   Now click on any one of those.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.120]   Control click on that video.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:23.600]   OK.
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:24.520]   Just hold on to Control key.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:25.920]   You're a very fancy boy.
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.240]   Oh, I know.
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:28.480]   This is my life.
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:28.880]   Hold on.
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:29.400]   OK.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:30.600]   So you control click on it.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:31.520]   It should be one of those.
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:31.520]   One of those.
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:32.000]   That's not letting you--
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:32.480]   What do I want?
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.040]   The URL?
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:34.040]   You want the URL.
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.440]   It'll give you the URL if you write--
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.760]   Maybe if you right click it.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.280]   You're-- I'm on a Windows machine.
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:39.280]   It doesn't work like anything.
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:40.200]   No, it won't work with that.
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:41.280]   That URL doesn't work.
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:42.200]   Oh, that doesn't work.
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:42.200]   There you are.
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:42.720]   That doesn't work.
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:44.200]   You need the live video URL?
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:47.640]   That's the actual location in the world.
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.200]   So you can--
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:52.240]   Tell me what I do and then I will do it at some point.
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:55.400]   Yeah, so anyway, so if you take that information in,
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.400]   you just can't see much until you do it.
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:01.640]   But what it does is it lets you manage all the comments.
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:02.120]   So--
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:02.640]   What do you mean?
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:04.600]   It's a little bit of a pro thing.
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.760]   And this comes from an API that Facebook offers.
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:08.440]   Yeah, so there's an API that basically,
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:11.960]   if it's a public event, now you can't change the comments.
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:12.840]   It's not designed for that.
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.720]   But if you're doing events, it's something
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.280]   that we've kind of built into the back end of a lot of our shows.
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:19.560]   I don't know what's wrong with your--
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.360]   so yeah, right click on that.
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.320]   Just hold one up and then just click on one of those
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:24.760]   or anything.
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:26.800]   I don't know why that one's not working.
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:27.320]   OK.
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.040]   Something really weird about--
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:30.240]   It's something that's--
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:30.760]   I'm already networking.
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:35.440]   So anyway, so if you right click on that video,
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.920]   we have on a Mac, you control click it.
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:37.440]   Oh, there you go.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.200]   Show URL.
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:39.080]   Show URL.
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:39.680]   OK.
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:41.400]   And it's not going to show it to you.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:42.080]   It's doing it.
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:43.800]   It's thinking it's--
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:44.880]   It should pop up and--
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:47.240]   Think it's a Windows issue or a problem issue.
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:49.880]   I think it might be a Windows issue there.
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:52.880]   This is all becoming more complicated.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:56.280]   So anyway, on the video, if you right click on the video there,
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:56.800]   it'll do it.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:59.680]   But I think that there's something going on there.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:01.360]   Anyway, what it does is it lets you--
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:06.960]   if you're a broadcaster or you're running a show on Facebook,
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:09.760]   you can get all the comments and sort them
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:13.960]   and put them on iPads and let everybody really drive it in.
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:14.320]   There you go.
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:14.840]   There you go.
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:15.680]   You can get that.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:17.160]   Right click.
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:18.440]   And this is the-- yeah, there you go.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.040]   Now, show URL.
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:20.400]   There you go.
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.920]   Now click on that and hit Copy.
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:23.880]   Now I paste this.
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:24.560]   Oh, now we're there.
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:27.360]   Now paste that into Comedia.
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:28.560]   And now hit Show Comments.
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:29.080]   Show Comments.
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:30.280]   And what it's going to do is it's going to go--
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:31.280]   And what it's going to do is it's going to go--
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:31.600]   Those are all the comments.
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:32.280]   And they're coming in line.
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:34.000]   The problem is they're coming so fast live
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.160]   that you can't really do anything with this.
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:36.760]   The other problem is they're not particularly useful.
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:40.080]   So if you click on Filter here--
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:42.440]   and then turn that min words up to like 12.
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.360]   So somebody's going to show you all the stuff.
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:46.640]   And then you go take display matches
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:49.320]   and say just remove them.
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.600]   And now go back to recent.
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.720]   And now all you have are the longer ones.
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.360]   And it'll also move slower.
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:57.680]   Now the other thing is is that you can have someone looking
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:01.160]   through this in a different language, but hit Highlight.
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:03.280]   So this can be-- you can be saving the ones
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:05.240]   that you like in the middle.
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:06.600]   Oh, this is great.
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:07.560]   And then you can--
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:10.840]   So Facebook, obviously, has an API for this.
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:11.960]   Drag that into Host.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:12.840]   I don't know if you can drag it.
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:14.800]   Just hit Host button.
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:19.840]   Now what that does, if you click up here that says Host Control,
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:22.600]   this is if you had an on an iPad.
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:24.520]   If this were me instead of my astronaut.
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:26.360]   And then you can reject it or you can hit Answer
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:27.560]   and Answer will make it full screen.
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.960]   This is more for an iPad, but it pops up so that you see it.
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:33.680]   Now if you go back to the other window, go back one,
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:35.920]   it's turning red so that in the control side,
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:38.400]   I can see that it's activated.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.360]   So this is kind of like the tool you had before.
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:41.840]   This is the next generation.
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.360]   But this is for Facebook video.
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.120]   This is for Facebook Live.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:49.280]   And if you hit Active here, am I screwing up this woman's
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:49.760]   poor woman's--
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:50.160]   No, no.
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:51.640]   This is completely passive.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:55.040]   So it doesn't touch the event itself.
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.000]   But what it does is it'll--
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.680]   It's a real time though, which is nice.
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:00.000]   Yeah, so what happens is that it actually makes it--
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.760]   this is the--
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:02.600]   we spent a lot of--
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:03.520]   Anybody can use this.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:05.840]   I just logged in with my Facebook account.
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.440]   You're making this available to the public.
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:08.400]   This is the light version.
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:10.320]   We have a much deeper version of this
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:11.680]   that we still use internally.
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:16.680]   So we have the legacy labs.com/kmenda-light.
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:17.880]   Cementa is--
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:18.400]   Cementa is--
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:20.920]   Cementa is in Shona.
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:21.840]   It's in Zimbabwe.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:24.520]   So anyway, we had to think of a name.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:27.480]   And then you also have-- if you click over here to--
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:29.400]   you see output 1/3.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:32.400]   If you go over to them, there it is over green screen.
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:33.400]   So--
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.760]   Drop that lower third.
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:38.160]   And then if you also click--
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:41.320]   I wish we had this capability built into art.
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:42.200]   ArtStream.
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:42.840]   This is awesome.
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:44.040]   And then if you have host--
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:46.360]   We should start streaming a Facebook just so we could do this.
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:47.920]   And then this is teleprompter.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:48.680]   Oh my god.
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:49.680]   You can read it.
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.560]   It'll reverse it back and forth.
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:53.960]   So if you get a mirror-- sometimes teleprompters use mirrors.
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.560]   So all that.
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.040]   And those are all just web pages.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:58.160]   So it's easy.
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:02.640]   You can have someone managing these questions from anywhere.
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:04.640]   And so it's not-- the team doesn't
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:06.720]   have to all be in the same room.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:09.680]   And this is, again, a little light version that--
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:11.880]   I know that for a lot of users, you're not doing a lot of this.
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:14.720]   But if you're doing streaming, this becomes super useful.
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:17.680]   Maybe if you're streaming to Facebook.
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:21.760]   So we do a lot of Facebook lives.
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:29.280]   So we built this to kind of manage the shows.
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:31.240]   And we're trying to figure it out.
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:35.360]   We just want a lot of people to hit it so that we can find any bugs
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:36.360]   and so on and so forth.
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:39.240]   We're kind of curious also whether people like it.
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.240]   Well, let me do some Facebook live.
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:42.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.960]   And I'll let you know.
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:44.760]   Wow.
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:46.840]   Anyway, so that is pretty amazing.
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:48.440]   It all started.
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.960]   It was started with the comment engine that we started.
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:52.560]   I don't know, 10 years ago here.
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:53.000]   Yeah.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000]   We used it.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.680]   So this is a slightly--
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:57.280]   Very nice.
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:00.120]   10 years of thinking about it.
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:01.840]   You said you had two picks.
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:05.520]   The other one is-- oh, by the way, we're going to use that command.
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.760]   We're doing a final cut user group tomorrow.
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:08.200]   Oh.
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:10.080]   So follow Alex on Twitter.
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:11.960]   On Twitter or Facebook.
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:14.720]   But we're going to do it on the Pixel Core Facebook page.
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:15.520]   And--
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:16.920]   We did this experiment.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:17.280]   Yeah.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:18.920]   But what I was going to say is--
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:23.280]   My other recommendation is Mel Chemistry.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:23.800]   This is--
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:24.680]   We subscribe to this.
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:25.640]   This is so cool.
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:26.680]   It is awesome.
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:28.080]   Chemistry kits by mail.
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:30.200]   And the only thing I'll warn you about is you suddenly
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:34.200]   have your kids nagging you to do experiment.
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:35.480]   Like to learn about chemistry.
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:37.040]   We did this one too.
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:37.560]   That's burning.
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:40.120]   That's setting foil on fire with a battery.
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.320]   And it's just-- it's a great--
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:43.440]   and they're simple.
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.120]   They're straightforward.
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:47.560]   There's a little iPhone app that lets you do something.
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.440]   They have an AR thing that I haven't really figured out yet.
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:51.120]   But they've got lots of little videos.
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:54.080]   So the kit comes by mail and it has instructions.
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.360]   And there's usually four to six experiments per kit.
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:00.280]   I don't know what-- Lisa got it for Michael.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.200]   I don't know what it costs, but it was really fun.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.040]   It's really great.
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:05.360]   Like if you're looking for something for Christmas, this is--
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.120]   52 kits for 50 bucks.
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:08.360]   That's a good price.
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:10.480]   And the experiments are really well laid out.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:11.240]   And the kids love them.
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:14.400]   And they're great experiments.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:16.120]   They're a lot of fun.
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:20.240]   And the kids, again, we did one where you make the magic snake
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:20.720]   where you light it.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:22.000]   And it goes, yeah, that was fun.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:22.920]   Of course, now my kids want me to--
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:23.760]   They have a sugar.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:26.280]   They want to make one that's like three feet wide.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:31.120]   So they-- but almost every day, they want to do one.
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:33.960]   So it's just-- I don't have that many.
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:38.080]   But it's a great way to get kids excited about it.
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:39.040]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:39.440]   It's really fun.
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:40.440]   It's really fun.
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:40.920]   Anyway, that's it.
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:45.600]   MelMELScience.com.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.840]   Andy and I go pick of the week.
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:48.360]   Two picks.
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:51.560]   One is the album Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas.
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:52.720]   Yes, she does.
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:55.360]   Which is my favorite Christmas album of--
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:57.720]   that's not new, but it's the first one that I-- best one
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:59.040]   that I discovered this year.
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:01.240]   Now, there are lots of Ella Fitzgerald Christmas
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:02.760]   albums that they've put together.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:06.000]   This is like the original-- this is the one that she put together,
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.760]   I think, while she was still alive.
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:11.000]   So it's the one that really feels like an Ella Fitzgerald
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.040]   album that happens to be all centered around Christmas time,
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:16.320]   as opposed to yet another Christmas album.
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:18.520]   And oh, cool, this one is Ella Fitzgerald.
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:19.520]   And so it's available.
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:22.360]   It's like part of the basic free streaming thing.
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:24.360]   In a one horse open sleigh.
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:25.440]   It's Jazzy, baby.
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:25.940]   Yes.
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:27.200]   Swinging.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:28.560]   And some deep cuts.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:29.680]   Some of them are standards.
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:32.440]   Some of them are new stuff you haven't heard about.
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:35.080]   They're all jazz and they're all Ella Fitzgerald.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:36.920]   Yeah, I never heard Christmas Island.
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:38.920]   Let's listen to Ella.
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:40.640]   Jazzy.
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:42.840]   Yeah.
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:43.360]   Jazzy.
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:43.880]   Swinging.
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:44.960]   Smell the cigarette spoke.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:48.000]   I'd like to spend Christmas.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.960]   Oh, see, this is the Christmas music I want to have in my house.
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:52.840]   That's lovely.
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:54.240]   Ella, baby.
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.560]   Ella wishes you a swingin' Christmas.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:57.040]   Yeah.
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:59.560]   And the second is a good gift for yourself, your family,
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:00.760]   or for other people.
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:03.560]   It is a streaming video channel called FilmStruck.
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:04.400]   Oh, I know.
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:05.120]   I subscribe.
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:06.280]   I love this.
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:07.520]   Yeah, I love it too.
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:10.200]   When I canceled cable last year, the year before,
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:13.040]   the only thing I really missed was Turner Classic Movies.
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:14.920]   FilmStruck is sort of like that.
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:17.440]   It's put together by the same team
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:19.320]   that does Turner Classic Movies,
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:20.640]   but also the Criterion Collection.
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:22.680]   So it's nothing but documentaries,
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:25.320]   art house movies, and classics.
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:30.080]   And it really restores that role that I love in Turner Classic
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:32.680]   movies and other services like that, where I don't know
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:33.800]   what I want to watch tonight.
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:36.160]   I just want to watch something awesome.
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:38.560]   And just a-- here's a--
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:42.120]   I'm at the page of the new editions for this month,
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:44.400]   A Face in the Crowd, All Monsters Attack,
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:47.720]   a bunch of Godzilla movies here, Bill Cunningham, New York,
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:52.040]   from my favorite documentaries, Birdman's Alcatraz, Blowup,
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:56.920]   City Walk, Contraband, scrolling down here.
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:59.200]   More Godzilla movies, The Leopard,
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.160]   Tails Ahofman, The Third Man.
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:02.960]   I'm just picking out the ones that I'm definitely adding
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:04.600]   to my list unzipped and other documentary
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:05.760]   that I really, really like.
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:09.200]   And a lot of this is not available streaming anywhere else.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:13.120]   I mean, right, they're like two fancy and high quality movies.
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.400]   It's like the same reason it's--
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:17.080]   there's some stuff that they keep off of streaming
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:20.080]   because they feel like they can make more money.
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:22.120]   You're not going to get Easter Parade on streaming.
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:24.680]   You're not going to get the bandwagon on streaming,
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:26.640]   except for maybe a narrow window.
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:28.880]   And it's not that expensive.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:33.520]   A year's subscription to both the Criterion Collection content
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:35.920]   and the FilmStruck content is 100 bucks.
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:38.120]   And by the way, by Criterion Collection,
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:39.880]   you've probably heard of this before.
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:42.760]   This is like this distribution label
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:46.160]   that just gets the greatest movies of all time
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:47.240]   and makes a great presentation.
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:48.880]   I used to buy those laser discs, boy.
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:51.080]   I love them and I miss them.
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:53.280]   So this is the way you get them.
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:56.040]   Are they all on there, the Criterion?
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:57.360]   I think most of them are.
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.920]   It's technically the Criterion Channel Collection.
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:02.280]   I only have subscribed to this for the past couple of weeks
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:04.560]   and I'm barely scratching the surface of this.
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:07.880]   But really, it's like--
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:10.360]   when I signed up for it, actually someone bought it for me
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:12.640]   as a gift, a year of subscription for 100 bucks.
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:13.640]   That's a nice gift, yeah.
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:15.400]   Which was an amazing gift.
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.680]   And so I kept--
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:21.400]   I'll just go to the first scroll until it gets--
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:23.480]   kill it, I stop finding good stuff.
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:25.760]   And I was there for 20 minutes when I just gave up.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.080]   More and more and more movies kept coming in and coming in
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:28.880]   and coming in.
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:32.240]   And my list has got longer and longer and longer.
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:34.960]   And if you want to-- if you don't have to go for a full year,
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:38.040]   1099 will get you the Criterion stuff and the FilmStruck stuff.
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:41.200]   If you just want to get the FilmStruck content,
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:43.400]   I think that's just $699 a month.
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:43.840]   Excuse me.
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:44.880]   Yeah, $699 a month.
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.360]   And this is a 14-day free trial.
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:47.680]   So you can just sign up for it.
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:49.840]   Watch the hell out of all these movies
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:53.280]   and then dare yourself to be without it.
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:55.120]   It's got an Apple TV app.
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:56.280]   It's got iPhone apps.
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:58.120]   It's got even got Android apps and Roku apps.
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:00.440]   Basically, every streaming platform that you have.
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:02.280]   The only thing that it doesn't do is
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:05.040]   you can't download for offline viewing.
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:07.720]   But it really is.
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.000]   I don't think there's much chance
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.600]   that when my gift subscription expires next year
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:16.480]   that I'm going to let this go, I'm already kind of sunk with this.
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:19.280]   How about Jim Henson's Giddily Inventive Time
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:21.120]   Traveling Short?
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:21.480]   Yeah.
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:24.560]   Which is a parody of Tom Jones.
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:27.040]   So you got to watch Tom Jones, which, boy,
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:29.600]   I haven't been able to find that on streaming in for ages.
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:30.560]   Albert Finney.
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:33.800]   And then put it together with Jim Henson.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:34.920]   Yes, that Jim Henson.
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:38.160]   There he is with his head on a platter.
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.520]   Short feature parody.
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:42.440]   See, what a great-- oh, man, this is awesome.
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:45.640]   Again, features as short as documentaries.
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:49.880]   It's also like bonus content you would find on DVDs and Blu-rays.
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:51.280]   It's just--
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:54.280]   it's a target-rich environment, let's say.
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:47:00.160]   Last chance to subscribe to watch it's a mad, mad, mad, mad world.
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:02.200]   Limited engagement ends New Year's Eve.
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:05.000]   That'll be a good New Year's Eve movie to watch.
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.160]   My local channel, Third Data, I think, in Boston,
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:09.760]   used to run it every New Year's Eve.
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:12.520]   And it scarred me the first time I watched it.
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:15.080]   So now, after that, it was like--
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:15.920]   Let's watch the studio.
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:16.720]   Look at all the extras.
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:19.440]   So I think they're including the Criterion Collection extras.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:21.160]   There's an extended cut.
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:25.600]   There's commentary, Stan Freeberg does an introduction.
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:27.040]   Wow, this is really neat.
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:29.280]   These are all extras that you really
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:32.680]   wouldn't get unless you-- the radio ads.
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:33.520]   Wow.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:35.200]   That's one thing I don't like about--
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:38.240]   I'm disappointed with Netflix and other these movie channels.
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:39.560]   They just give you the movie.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:42.320]   You don't get the other material that's been produced for it.
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:44.920]   And so it's high recommendation.
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:46.840]   Putting that on my watch list, too.
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:48.040]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:49.920]   Yeah, I highly agree.
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:52.920]   It's filmstruck.com.
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:57.720]   Folks, we are not going to be here next week.
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:59.400]   We're going to have a best of edition, which
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:01.840]   we're about to record if you want to stick around.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:02.840]   I'll be in Pittsburgh.
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:03.760]   You'll be in Pittsburgh.
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:05.760]   Andy, what are you doing for the holidays?
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:08.000]   I'm spending my usual Christmas in New York City.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000]   Nice.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.040]   It's a great place to spend.
[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:11.520]   And I think you might have a white Christmas.
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:13.320]   I hear snows in the forecast.
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.800]   I got my bean boots ready.
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:17.440]   Renee Ritchie, are you going to stay in Montreal?
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:18.000]   Where are you going?
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:18.600]   Yes, sir.

[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:51.160]   These are the moments you remember for years.
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:53.400]   And have a happy new year.
