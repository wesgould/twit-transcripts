[00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.160]   John Gruber from daringfireball.net, the quintessential Mac
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.720]   blogger.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.920]   Hey, John.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.480]   Hey, Leo.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.640]   Good to have you.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.080]   The Grumpy Macker.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.920]   Oh, no, I'm a nice guy.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.560]   I know it's funny.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.080]   You're so happy.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.360]   Go lucky.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.400]   Such a--
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.240]   But then sometimes on the blog, sometimes you
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.480]   seem like you're a little grumpy.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.200]   And maybe I should add smileys or something like that.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.640]   There you go.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.400]   That'd help.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.640]   Also here, man, is all smiles.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.440]   It is now beautifully lit.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.880]   Solarium.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.840]   Yes, I love it.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.760]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.200]   in the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.840]   Hello, Andy.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.760]   Thank you very much.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.800]   I've been reminded that back when I didn't care
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.480]   what the office and the studio looked like,
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.960]   my life was so much easier.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.680]   Yeah, I could go up to breakfast on Tuesday morning.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.720]   What a work.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.960]   But now this is a set, right?
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.520]   This is not-- you actually don't have any windows
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.600]   to the outside where you are incarcerated.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.360]   No.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.560]   And unfortunately, I couldn't afford the green screen.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.360]   So this is just a matte painting.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.640]   I hired some XLM guys to just paint me
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.440]   a huge backyard thing.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.880]   It's very realistic.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.960]   And we have two guys at a table there with those kind of squeezy
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.240]   things that make bird sounds.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.800]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.000]   You see, this has costed me a lot of money.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.720]   So if we don't hear a lot of interruptions from the background,
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.720]   I'm going to be really, really stingless on the phone.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.960]   For those who are curious, some of these
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.120]   asking in the chat room, you have a camcorder that you use.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.240]   We sent you, I think, an HV40 at Canon HV40, yes.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.120]   And that does give you a--
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.560]   the nice thing on the Mac you get the firewire in.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.920]   It's 40s, I mean, it takes a lot to get it dialed in,
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.200]   but also you can do things like--
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.400]   Ooh.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.000]   The daring eyeball.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.960]   Yes.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.920]   So, I mean, if I don't want you to see that I'm taking a sip of tea
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.320]   or something here, I can just make it fun for all of us.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.640]   And just so you're focusing just on my eyes here.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.280]   Can't see the lettuce in your teeth.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.800]   Yeah, this looks--
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.280]   It certainly feels a lot more dramatic.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.280]   It does.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.800]   It does.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.120]   I'm going to have a giant and not go over my shoulder.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.680]   It's almost hitch cocky.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.400]   Well, there's a couple of things going on today.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.680]   Actually, the big story today is Apple will announce
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.200]   its quarterly results, its quarterly earnings.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.480]   Of course, as always, they like to wait till after we get off
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.400]   the air before they do anything of import, afraid that we might
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.480]   report on it.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.840]   But it looks probably to be pretty good despite--
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.560]   and please don't kick me, John, antenna gate.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.080]   All signs--
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.240]   But that wouldn't be reflected in this quarter anyway.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.840]   I guess it wouldn't, wouldn't.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.640]   iPhone sales would be or would not be.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.640]   I guess they missed the quarter, did they?
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.480]   When was the end of the quarter?
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.280]   It must have been--
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.800]   End of June.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   So no.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.240]   Mostly we're looking at how the iPad affected sales
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.640]   of desktop Macs and sales of iPod touches
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.160]   and that sort of stuff.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.280]   So I think it's like almost like three years ago
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.560]   where the first few days of iPhone 4 sales will be--
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.560]   Will.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.560]   Will.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.720]   What the hell?
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.840]   Those Iolend people just $18.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.840]   Your tax dollars.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.760]   No, you can't get any time.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.040]   You can get the blue angels to fly over your podcast.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.640]   Bit pricey, but you know what?
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.840]   We have that Netflix Roku streaming deal.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.240]   There's some money coming in.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.160]   And I really appreciated the missing man formation.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.280]   I'm sorry, we didn't get to the shot soon enough to see it.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.640]   Well, that's for Alex Lindsey, who was away this week.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.320]   Oh, thank you for reminding me, Alex.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.760]   Actually, he's in Pennsylvania.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.680]   He's in your neck of the woods, John, doing some training.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.840]   Couldn't break away.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.560]   But we're very pleased to have John Grubb.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.640]   Chris Breen is in Hawaii.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.600]   Everybody's out of town.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.160]   Basically, it's that time of year, not unusual.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.280]   So the quarterly results we'll hear about by the time you are
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.520]   listening to this, you'll already know.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.840]   But it looks to be that Microsoft perhaps will overtake
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.640]   Microsoft in terms of revenue for the quarter, which is--
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.880]   earlier, their stock price meant that their stock market
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.440]   value anyway was greater than Microsoft.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.480]   Now their revenue, which is predicted
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.400]   to be somewhere around $13 to $13.5 billion,
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.040]   will exceeds Microsoft's.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.600]   That's kind of amazing.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.360]   It is amazing, but the real part, you know,
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.520]   business is profit, not revenue.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.680]   And Microsoft is still the, by far and away,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.240]   the most profitable company in the industry.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.800]   Because they sell bits, which cost nothing to move.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.640]   Right, exactly.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.520]   Almost everything they sell is software,
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.360]   and software has higher margin than the hardware.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.760]   But, you know, the graph is very interesting if you look
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.280]   at the trend, that if it keeps up, you know,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.320]   it's not inconceivable that Apple will pass them in profit.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.480]   I should say Apple will overtake Microsoft.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.560]   Apparently I said Microsoft will overtake Microsoft,
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.440]   which would be, I think, an impossibility,
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.280]   like Oribus eating its own tail.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.360]   Analysts say, Apple, a poll by Reuters,
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.320]   says Apple is expected to report around Apple predicted
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.880]   $13 to $13.5 billion.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.000]   That was Apple's own prediction.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.280]   As usual, they sandbag the analysts going low and coming
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.120]   out high.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.040]   Analysts expect $14.6 billion in revenue,
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.160]   $2.85 in net income.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.800]   Microsoft expected to do $15 billion and $4.1 in,
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.080]   I cannot talk today, $15 billion in revenue
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.840]   and $4.1 billion in net income.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.600]   I've never been good with numbers.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.200]   This will be the first quarter to reflect sales
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.080]   of the iPad.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.520]   So, now they don't usually reveal sales numbers, do they?
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.380]   Just revenue.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.320]   Well, Apple's usually very proud to say how many
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.120]   they're selling per week.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.760]   So, I think that they should have no problem figuring
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.640]   out how many iPads got sold.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.640]   Any predictions there?
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.240]   4 million?
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.840]   5 million?
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.680]   A billion?
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.520]   I don't know.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.560]   I think that one analyst was saying that,
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.960]   in terms of how the effects of the iPad,
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.360]   they're saying that they actually sold more desktops,
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.800]   more Mac OS devices in that quarter
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.200]   than they did the quarter before, the year before.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.560]   So, the big answer, the big question that I was curious
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.800]   about when we've got the actual news from Apple
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.400]   is are people buying iPads instead of MacBooks?
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.040]   And this analyst seems to think that,
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.320]   "No, the numbers are gonna reflect that,
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.280]   for some reason, people are still buying Mac OS devices."
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.600]   So, everyone wins.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.000]   Can I, I'm gonna cheat, Leo.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.520]   Here's how I'm gonna cheat.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.600]   So, you guys have heard of Andy Zakey,
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.080]   his last name is Z-A-K-Y,
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.080]   I'm not sure if it's Zakey or Zakey,
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.320]   but he's sort of unaffiliated analyst.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.360]   And, you know, if you track these guys over the quarters,
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.160]   this guy has Apple nailed.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.360]   I mean, this guy's record is unbelievable at the brand.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.880]   - That's Zakey saying.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.880]   - So, his web blog is bullcross.blogspot.com,
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.200]   and he's got his earnings preview.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.440]   And so, I'm just gonna cheat
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.960]   and I'm gonna steal his predictions.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.760]   - Okay, so he predicts, from Macintosh,
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.200]   he predicts 3.37 million,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.560]   and he predicts 3.4 million iPads.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.360]   So, you know, his prediction is pretty much
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.520]   about 3.4 million Macs, 3.4 million iPads.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.360]   - That's great.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.920]   - So, to think of a company that was, you know,
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.680]   happy with the sales of its computers,
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.640]   introduces a new product,
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.040]   and it does as well as the computers, you know,
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.240]   out of the box, that's phenomenal.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.920]   It's just doubling your sales out of the box.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.400]   - And here's the other interesting things.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.040]   So, there's those IDC numbers
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.520]   that come out every quarter with market share, right?
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.800]   So, everybody seems to have agreed the iPad is not a PC,
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.000]   so it doesn't count towards PC market share, right?
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.400]   But, on the other hand, everybody's also worried,
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.680]   well, is it gonna make people not buy MacBooks, you know?
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.000]   So, maybe, if you added them together,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   it would, you'd have Apple,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.400]   if you do count the iPad as a computer,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.280]   then Apple is selling close to 7 million computers a quarter.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.120]   - Impressive, yeah.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.120]   - Which would totally put it at a different spot
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.720]   on that list of, you know, computer makers.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.560]   - Right.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.720]   - I'm not sure if they'd be number one,
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.680]   if they'd be ahead of Dell or what,
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.080]   but they are, I guess, HP's number one.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.240]   But, I think-
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.840]   - There's no question that the mobile-
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.680]   - It's a lot closer.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.680]   - And, I think, if you had a device that was exactly the same
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.760]   as the iPad physically, but it was running macOS 10,
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.400]   it would count as a computer.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.840]   So, it's, you know, it's a question of,
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.200]   does the fact that it runs iOS,
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.760]   put it in a different category?
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.600]   I mean-
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.720]   - You know, it's a computer, right?
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.600]   - That's what I think.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.600]   But, that just shows-
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.160]   - But, it shows how those old definitions
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.120]   are sort of going away.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.760]   - I can't fit them in the boxes anymore.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.640]   I mean, it is a low price computer.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.680]   It's a $500 to $800 or $900 computer.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.680]   Do you think the margins are good?
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.000]   Do you think that Apple must make more still
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.440]   on the computers and laptops?
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.640]   Must make a lot more on the computers and laptops.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.400]   - Yeah, there's, I think they're the, sorry.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.240]   (laughs)
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.200]   I was struggling for actual numbers,
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.240]   but then realizing that the numbers that I have on,
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.560]   how much money they're making on each unit
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.280]   is about nine to 10 months old.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.640]   Sorry, I really shouldn't talk about it.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.120]   But yeah, the most conservative tear down
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.640]   would say that an iPad, they make about a half
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.440]   to a third as much money on as each desktop.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.800]   But it's kind of remarkable though,
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.160]   when you think about how much more money
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.440]   they're getting from people for each shot
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.560]   out of a desktop than from an iPad.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.960]   I mean, an iPad is not quite an impulse purchase at 500 bucks,
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.920]   but it's a little bit more,
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.880]   and also it's as a unique item that has immense
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.600]   initial release hype behind it.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.520]   I don't think it's quite that dramatic
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.080]   and accomplishment to be selling that much money
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.840]   and iPads versus here is the 18th edition
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.240]   of our portable Macintosh,
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.800]   and we're still selling more of this quarter
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.520]   than we did last quarter.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.480]   - Right.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.080]   We'll have one week of iPhone 4 sales,
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.880]   but I think everybody agrees the iPhone 4
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.320]   is gonna have to consider it to the bottom line.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.840]   And when you combine the two portable devices together,
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.320]   I think that they probably equal Mac sales.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.600]   We've talked before, and I actually like to give John
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.120]   a chance to, 'cause you weren't here when we talked before,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.160]   about the notion that Apple is paying more attention
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.520]   now to these iOS devices and less attention
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.000]   to OS 10 devices.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.360]   Do you think we're seeing a diminution,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.680]   or is Apple able to pay attention to both?
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.840]   Are you worried that the Mac computers
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.700]   are gonna be a week second to the portable devices, John?
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.240]   - Yeah, I think it's definitely a shade
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.200]   of gray type problem.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.840]   I mean, I don't think it's black and white,
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.760]   like, well, either they are hell-bend on the Mac,
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.280]   or they've completely dropped the Mac.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.920]   But the Mac has definitely shifted into a shade of gray area
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.320]   where it's, obviously, I mean, I don't think,
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.040]   you don't even have to be an expert observer of the company
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.800]   to say that it's not the shining star of the company anymore.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.200]   But it's still important.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.800]   I mean, but you look at things like the fact
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.680]   that the Mac Pro hasn't been updated in, I think, 400
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.960]   in some days.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.440]   - We're waiting for, we've been waiting for the new,
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.760]   I can't remember the chip, the six-core chip,
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.840]   in this thing forever.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.280]   - Right, so it's a little weird, but I think it's sort of,
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.320]   I don't really think it's so much that Apple
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.120]   isn't as interested in the Mac,
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.560]   is that this is Apple's estimation of how important
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.560]   PC hardware is to the industry at large.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.560]   That they sort of see it as a market where it's,
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.920]   what's the word for it?
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.000]   Like, it's set, and this is how it is.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.520]   This is how PCs are.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.560]   And so innovation isn't as important there
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.040]   because there just isn't that much room for it.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.120]   - It's almost an incremental market at this point for Apple.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.640]   - Right, right.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.360]   I think it's more of a case where desktops and notebooks
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.280]   are a highly established field to mine money out of.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.280]   They basically said, well, what if we go to this other
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.920]   continent over here and see what resources we can strip out
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.880]   for that land instead?
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.920]   And that's what they're doing with the iOS devices.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.560]   It's a market where they can essentially define
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.760]   what success is, they can define what the product's
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.960]   going to be and essentially bring all this new money
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.720]   into the marketplace.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.360]   Instead of, especially now that it's July and August,
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.400]   this is the traditional season in which everybody goes
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.280]   to the stores with $500 to $1,500 in their hands
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.880]   to buy a notebook for school.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.280]   And that's always been a fixed part of the market
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.080]   that season, at that time, every single year.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.320]   Now we also have this place where people will find
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.960]   an extra 500 bucks for an iPad or they'll find an extra 200
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.040]   bucks for this handheld device that they would not have
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.560]   wanted to purchase before.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.600]   So I think it's just as much a question of building
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.440]   a brand new market as it is being content that they're
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.800]   still making money off of the old technology.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.640]   - Yeah, right.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.440]   I mean, just take a look at the iPhone, you know,
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.920]   the iPhone 4 versus the iPhone 3GS.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.640]   I mean, it's a pretty remarkable one year over the last year,
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.800]   12 months later, difference.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.840]   There's no way that they could make a MacBook Pro,
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.440]   no matter how focused they were on it,
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.640]   no matter if they'd had everybody in the company
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.760]   all focus on making a new MacBook Pro
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.560]   or new MacBook Air or something like that.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.400]   They couldn't make one that 12 months after last year's
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.200]   models is that much better.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.800]   - Well, we're seeing that in general.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.560]   I mean, we talked about this on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.000]   All the innovation in technology right now is being
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.520]   focused absolutely on cell phones.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.560]   And that's where all the excitement is happening.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.600]   - Yeah, but that's because the, I think the customers
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.760]   haven't really insisted that we know exactly what we want
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.600]   in this sort of a device that could still open to new ideas.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.320]   At this point, the roles of a notebook and the roles
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.360]   of a desktop have been so firmly set that if you were
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.560]   to deviate markedly from that place,
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.560]   the people who count on this to not as an exciting new tech
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.920]   toy or an exciting new consumer product,
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.960]   but just as that boring device that helps them get
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.200]   through their workday and make their money and go home,
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.680]   that will frighten people a lot more than a brand new
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.400]   cell phone or a brand new tablet device.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.960]   - That's kind of what the iPad was, wasn't it?
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.800]   It was a redefining, a reinvention of what a portable device
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.040]   is and or a computer.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.400]   And look at what Dell's doing.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.040]   This week they announced they're gonna start
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.960]   shipping that five inch tablet that they've been talking
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.000]   about for some time.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.840]   That's neat.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.880]   I don't know what that is.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.000]   It's neither here nor there.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.240]   It's a five inch display, which is an oddball device.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.080]   - Yeah, the Dell Streak.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:22.960]   - The Streak, yeah.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.040]   It's been available in the UK for a while.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.200]   And it's just happened to me.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.040]   - Oh, I didn't realize that.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.320]   - Oh, two got it.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.160]   I don't know a few months ago,
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.600]   but it's been out for a couple months now.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.640]   - Sadly, it'll be AT&T here.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.000]   - Yeah, but that'll be an interesting test of
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.480]   one more thing that can be bogged down the AT&T network.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.280]   - Well, no, I just mean an interesting test.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.760]   I've been saying all along that.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.480]   We don't really, the iPad has not completely proven itself
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.760]   yet because it is so new and it is a brand new
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.240]   type of device that has never really existed before.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.040]   So we don't know yet what it is
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.480]   that people are gravitating towards.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.920]   If you need a device that's that big,
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.840]   if you need software that's that sophisticated,
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.600]   on and on and on, it's kind of like
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.520]   when the first digital cameras came aboard
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.360]   and every single new camera that came out
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.960]   had a different shape and a different size
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.400]   and a different form factor and a different set of features
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.320]   because the market had not yet said,
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.400]   this is what we want a digital camera to be.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.160]   This is how we would want to use it.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.400]   So this is an exciting time,
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.200]   at least for the next year, year and a half,
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.400]   when they finally come out with an iPad like device,
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.640]   only something that's small enough
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.000]   you can actually stick in a back pocket.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.200]   You don't need to carry it like a clipboard.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.000]   Is that going to be as successful as an iPad?
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.440]   Is that is the size of the iPad hindrance?
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.040]   Or is it literally everyone is saying,
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.240]   no, we really love that big screen.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.080]   So, I think the interesting part of the showdown though
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.200]   is gonna be that this is gonna be running,
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.680]   it's Dell's was gonna be running Android.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.240]   HP is getting into tablets,
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.360]   but they're gonna be using the new Palm WebOS
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.920]   that they bought when they bought the company
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.080]   a few months ago.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.640]   And if there was ever an operating system
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.360]   that could compete with iOS as a touch operating system,
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.720]   it would probably be WebOS and not Android.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.680]   - Great article in Wired Magazine today
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.680]   on the checkered history between Apple and AT&T.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.440]   And really how tense it's been since,
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.120]   almost since day one, you wrote up a little blurb
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.600]   on the daring fireball.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.160]   - Yeah, Fred Vogelstein wrote the story.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.920]   Really, really, it seemed like some fantastic recording.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.760]   - Great recording.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.600]   - That's a good source.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.560]   - I'm gonna go yell at Ralph, the quote that you pulled.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:39.120]   Steve Jobs saying, you know, how upset he was with AT&T.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.320]   - Well, and specifically that quote
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.120]   where he talked to somebody in the room,
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:49.120]   that was in the context of what was like in December,
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:55.760]   it was after, so in June 2009, I guess,
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.600]   a year ago when Apple first announced
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.480]   tethering support in the OS.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.560]   And they said, you know,
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.400]   here's the carriers around the world
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.480]   that will support it this summer.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.320]   And AT&T is not on the list,
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.640]   and everybody in the room is like,
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.480]   ugh.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.320]   And then it was December.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.760]   So it's like six months after Apple had already
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.480]   put the support of it in the OS.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.120]   And Ralph, what's his last name?
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.240]   Daila, Vega, whatever his name is.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.400]   - The new CEO replaces it.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.400]   - He gets up on stage.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.200]   They're still in negotiations with Apple,
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.240]   but he gets up on stage and says it's coming soon.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.000]   Even though they haven't done it,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.120]   and that's what set Jobs off is that he got up there
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.120]   and put effective, 'cause when Ralph,
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.640]   Daila Vega says something like that,
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.440]   he's effectively speaking for Apple and AT&T.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.760]   And it wasn't a done deal, you know,
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.760]   and he was like, I'm gonna go call Ralph.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.600]   - Hi.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.400]   - I'm gonna go yell at Ralph.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.720]   But AT&T not so happy with Apple,
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.120]   either according to this article,
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.080]   blaming Apple's buggy baseband software
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.640]   for some of the problems that they were experiencing.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.440]   It seems like it was a, you know,
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.760]   I mean, I think we always kind of knew
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.920]   that this was maybe a difficult relationship,
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.160]   but according to this article,
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.240]   the great reporting from Fred Vogelstein,
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.840]   it's really been rockier
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.800]   than anybody really imagined.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.480]   - Yeah, and the article actually does the impossible.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.920]   It actually gives you a little bit of sympathy
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.320]   for AT&T's position.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.160]   - Yeah.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.520]   - Because his reporting was talking to
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.840]   from AT&T's position,
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.240]   they're never a company that's,
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.560]   Apple to make up an example would be a company that says,
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.200]   oh, by the way, we're gonna be making a new iPhone
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.040]   that's the size and width of a number two pencil.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.440]   And if AT&T says, there's no way that we can get
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.520]   - Can't do it. - get that supported.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.080]   They'll say, tough, we build the phones,
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:39.920]   you build the networks.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.480]   If it's a problem with your network,
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.560]   then you should solve it.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.400]   - Right. - And say,
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.640]   but it's the size of a pencil,
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.120]   you're like people are idiots.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.320]   - Right.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.200]   And also apparently from almost from day one,
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:54.320]   Apple was actively considering splitting with AT&T
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.920]   just months after the iPhone launched,
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.000]   I'm quoting here from the article,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.200]   and not long after RIN asked Apple to limit YouTube usage.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.680]   This is another story where early on AT&T said,
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.080]   "Could you just please have the YouTube video stop
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.240]   after 30 seconds or, you know,
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.440]   - Like a wifi. - Make them use them.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   - Yeah, please, 'cause they're killing us here.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.520]   And Apple's response is, no, just no.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.920]   And they said, well, we'll escalate this
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.840]   to our executive suite.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.040]   And Apple said, well, we'll escalate this to Steve Jobs.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.840]   Who's gonna win? - Yeah.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.480]   - And AT&T went away with its tail between its legs.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.160]   So shortly after that, according to this article,
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.560]   quote, "Jobs was investigating
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.640]   another possible solution, dropping AT&T, dropping."
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.680]   Not merely splitting it, but dropping AT&T
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.680]   and striking a deal with Verizon.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.360]   The problem was, of course, CDMA and the CDMA chip
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.680]   and designing a phone that had a CDMA chip instead of a GSM chip.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.520]   But apparently,
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:54.600]   Scott Forstall went to Qualcomm,
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.320]   which makes the CDMA chip and investigated this.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.680]   But in the end, it was, they decided
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.840]   just too complicated and expensive to do it.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.160]   However, they said there were at least six documented cases
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.640]   of Apple investigating a switch to Verizon.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.040]   It's a must read article.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:18.040]   If you're all interested in it, it's a great soap opera.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.240]   - Yeah, not only that, it's just,
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.880]   he got those really wonderful little quotes
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.120]   and little stories about how,
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.160]   like some AT&T low level flunky was talking to
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.760]   some counterpart, Apple.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.600]   And he actually suggested, oh, by the way,
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.640]   when Steve Jobs meets our board of directors,
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.600]   he should probably wear a suit.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.920]   - Oh.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.400]   - Like, oh, for God's sake.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.340]   - The response was apparently, "We're Apple.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.840]   "We don't even own suits."
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.680]   - Which I love that response.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.080]   - And you know what else is funny too?
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.480]   And it wasn't mentioned in the article,
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.240]   but on the AT&T board of directors is Gil Amelia.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.880]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.960]   That's got it.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.760]   There's no love loss between Steve and Gil, of course.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.680]   - Oh, to have been a fly on the wall.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.520]   (laughing)
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.840]   - Hello, Gil.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.840]   (laughing)
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.440]   - And Amelia even had the gall at one point to say,
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.080]   "Everything Steve Jobs did for Apple
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.000]   "I had put in place already."
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.840]   It was my idea, he basically said.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.100]   So yeah, I can only imagine.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.520]   Any other, I'm just looking through the article,
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.480]   see if there's any other juicy tidbits.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.960]   It is an absolute must read.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.000]   He points out the hashtag, #ATTFAIL
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.800]   and it's checkered history on Twitter.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.400]   Every time anything happens with AT&T or Apple,
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.840]   the hashtag makes it, raises its ugly head once again.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:46.160]   And yet, for both companies,
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.080]   it's been a huge commercial success,
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.400]   as difficult as it's been for both of them.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.960]   He's quick to point out that at least short term,
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.880]   it's a financial success.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.240]   iPhone represents more than $13 billion in annual revenue
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.720]   for Apple and it has been incredible for AT&T
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.800]   since the iPhone came out.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.280]   AT&T's wireless revenue is up 43%,
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.400]   profits up 200%, subscribers have grown 40%
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.120]   and you can clearly point to the iPhone for all of this.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.160]   And yet, he says, "The true cost to AT&T
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.040]   "of this exhausting relationship,"
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.400]   this is Fred Vogelstein writing,
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.080]   "will be debated for years."
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.480]   It's true that AT&T has suffered
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.760]   in its reputation greatly from this.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.840]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.040]   I'm sure they can't be happy about it
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.240]   because every time that something good is going on
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.520]   with the iPhone, it's always a testimony to Apple
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.200]   and to Steve Jobs and innovation and to design
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.680]   and we love our users and everything bad,
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.320]   it just gets swept towards AT&T.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.400]   - I do have to point out though that Steve showed some,
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.200]   on Friday showed some real forbearance.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.360]   He didn't, John, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.600]   but he didn't mention AT, he didn't blame.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.280]   He could have easily blamed AT&T.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.000]   - No, no, he didn't mention him, but I thought he,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.360]   he only mentioned them in a positive context.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.080]   I thought that his...
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.800]   - He bent over backwards, in fact, it seemed.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.920]   - Yeah, and I went there, we can talk about that,
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.840]   I mean, you probably have a segment planned on it,
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.680]   but I went there thinking...
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.800]   - No, let's talk now, that's good, you were there.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.440]   - Yeah, I was there, and I went there thinking
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.520]   it could be anything, I mean, it effectively went off,
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.400]   more or less with them saying,
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.400]   "Here's why the iPhone 4 antenna is actually just fine."
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.920]   It's not perfect, but,
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.080]   and has this problem with touching it down here,
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.120]   but overall it's good. - Don't touch me there.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.360]   - So more or less, that's sort of what I expected.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.600]   And, but I thought it could be anything, though.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.960]   What if they have determined that either all of them,
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.400]   which I think is very unlikely,
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.720]   given how many iPhone 4s, I mean, mine personally,
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.960]   and many other people I've talked to,
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.920]   that just don't have a problem with this.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.720]   But what if there was a subset of them
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.240]   that did have a hardware defect?
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.440]   So if your serial numbers were in this range,
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.280]   maybe there would be a recall, which would be huge news.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.640]   And I also thought, just as a wildcard,
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.640]   what if jobs concluded that it's AT&T's fault?
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.880]   And so far as it's only with mediocre to spotty coverage
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.480]   that you run into, that it drops far enough
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.680]   to be a problem when you touch it wrong.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.800]   And what if that's it?
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.960]   And he was gonna say, "Look, the iPhone's..."
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.960]   I know we only released this damn thing a month ago,
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.120]   but we're going to Verizon.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.480]   And we're announcing it.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.840]   And the reason they announced it in a hurry
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.840]   was to do it within the 30-day return period for AT&T, right?
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.720]   I know, I did I expect that?
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.840]   Would I have bet on it?
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.680]   No way.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.360]   I mean, it would have been a bombshell.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360]   I would not have bet on it.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.000]   But what I have put it past him
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.200]   is that sound totally un-Steve Jobs like to do that?
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.960]   I thought, you know, I better be there.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.800]   - It could have happened.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.640]   You're absolutely right.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.480]   It could have been huge.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.680]   - But at the actual event, I would say that Steve Jobs
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.960]   did not sound like a man who's planning to...
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.960]   - Drop AT&T?
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.080]   - Drop AT&T soon.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.160]   - And I have to say, Verizon's not acting like a company
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.200]   that wants the iPhone at this point.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.040]   - Right.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.440]   And the most interesting thing he said about AT&T by far,
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.560]   and it's almost like, how did this not come out before
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.120]   if it's literally true,
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.200]   is he was talking about the problems that AT&T has
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.080]   improving reception in certain areas.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.080]   And he said, "If they want to put a new self tower in it,
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.760]   Texas, on average, it takes about three weeks.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.520]   In city of San Francisco,
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.440]   due to how crowded it is,
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.440]   and due to the much more complicated urban zoning restrictions,
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.280]   takes on average three years
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.000]   to add one new self tower in San Francisco."
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:37.840]   And so you think about that,
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.560]   the iPhone's only been out for three years.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.920]   So whatever, if that's literally true,
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.120]   that it takes about three years to add a self tower
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.080]   in San Francisco, whatever changes AT&T wants to make
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.760]   to their coverage in San Francisco because of the iPad,
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.880]   or iPhone, we're literally only gonna start seeing now
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.160]   because the iPhone only came out three years ago.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.520]   - Would it be smart for Verizon at this point,
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.960]   or any other phone company to say,
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.920]   "We don't want the iPhone,"
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.640]   because of the potential black eye?
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.680]   I mean, right now, you can blame AT&T.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.920]   It's easy to blame AT&T,
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.800]   but what if another company like Verizon comes along
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.800]   has the same problems, then you start saying,
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.400]   "Well, maybe it's these companies
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.000]   don't have enough bandwidth for a heavy bandwidth use."
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.200]   And certainly, there's no question that iPhone users
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.880]   use bandwidth at a rate far greater than any other phone.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.280]   I don't know about these new Android phones.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.240]   I wonder, I would bet it's comparable on phones
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.040]   like the Droid X, the EVO.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.680]   - Verizon would have an advantage that AT&T didn't,
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.280]   which is to craft a rate plan for iPhone users
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.960]   with knowledge of how iPhone users use the network.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.680]   So I really have no doubt that Verizon would love to,
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.440]   right now they do correctly a bunch of commercials.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.080]   I say that we have the most reliable
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.640]   and the broadest network that would love to also say,
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.480]   and we have the hottest phones out there.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.320]   - Right.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.480]   - Well, any other big difference Verizon has over AT&T
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:06.400]   is AT&T went into this obviously with a low ball estimate
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.920]   based on how much they thought that people were gonna use it.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.320]   They really saw it as, they really didn't think iPhone users
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.560]   were gonna use much more data than other phone makers.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.320]   And maybe Apple told them, "No, dude,
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.280]   you should be ready for this.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.160]   People are gonna love this.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.000]   People are gonna use it."
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.760]   And AT&T obviously didn't believe it.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.720]   Verizon, though, surely has a pretty good idea
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.200]   of how much data the average iPhone user uses on AT&T.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.880]   And so whatever, if it ever comes to pass,
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.640]   I think they're gonna have a pretty good idea
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.320]   of what they're in for.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.160]   - Exactly.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.440]   But they have the same problem in San Francisco
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.340]   that AT&T does.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.120]   They don't get towers up any faster.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.200]   Does CDMA have an advantage in data that GSM does not?
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.240]   I don't know, I'm not technical.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.080]   - Not, I don't know.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:47.920]   - Yeah, I don't think so.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.560]   But I wanna talk more about the press conference.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.400]   You were there, John.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.320]   Andy and I were watching closely from afar.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.480]   And Tenegate and whether what Apple did was enough,
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.620]   sufficient, better than sufficient.
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.880]   And we have lots more to talk about.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.920]   We're watching Mac Break Weekly.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.520]   John Gruber is here from DaringFireball.net.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.600]   The Apple blog to read, as everyone well knows.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.080]   Andy Inaco, also from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.080]   Alex Lindsey has the week off.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.320]   I'm Leo LaPorte and I'm here to tell you today
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.800]   about carbonite backup.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.440]   If you are a user, Mac user, you have data.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.240]   And if you have data on hard drives,
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.440]   I don't care if it's solid state drives
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.000]   or spinning drives, internal or external,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.920]   you're at risk.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.920]   Those drives will die at some point or other.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.360]   And that's why I say use carbonite.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.200]   That's why I back it up.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.720]   I just got to be a 13 inch MacBook for college.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.840]   She's going to college in about three weeks.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.280]   And you better believe the first thing I did
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.480]   is I put carbonite on it.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.400]   She doesn't even need to know.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.640]   The point is if anything should happen,
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.000]   she could log on to any computer at school and get her data back.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   She can even use the iPhone or the Blackberry apps.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.960]   Those are free.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.840]   And get her data back, carbonite.com.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.880]   That's something no local backup can do.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.200]   And of course, backing up off site is very important
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.880]   in case the worst happens.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.800]   Everything gets stolen.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.480]   There's a fire, a flood, a tornado or an earthquake.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.520]   And you lose your backups.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.000]   If they're sitting right next to the computer,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.920]   you have to have offsite backup too.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.840]   Carbonite does it so easily.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.320]   Go to carbonite.com right now.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.560]   Use the offer code MACBRAKE.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.360]   You could try it free for 15 days.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.640]   I just got an email from Australia
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.560]   saying, hey, mate, we've got 30 days here in Australia.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.080]   All right, you get 30 days there in Australia.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.000]   But try it.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.680]   Do try it for free because it does use your broadband.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.640]   So you have to have a broadband connection.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.280]   You'll be glad to see it doesn't slow down
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.120]   either your connection or your computer.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.040]   It's very smart technology that watches
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.880]   and makes sure you're not using the system when it's backing up.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.760]   But always in the background, it's keeping you backed up
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.560]   so you can always get your personal data back.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.240]   And it's unlimited, by the way.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.640]   Everything on your internal drive,
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.160]   all that personal data on your internal drive
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.960]   for less than $5 a month.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.600]   Plus, if you use MACBRAKE, you get your first two months free
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.840]   or I guess two months out of the first year free.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.000]   carbonite.com offer code MACBRAKE.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.040]   It's just backup done right.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.000]   You gotta back it up to get it back.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.520]   So do it with carbonite.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.880]   Now I don't wanna hear any complaints.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.760]   So John, you were there.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.040]   You know, I wonder, this whole thing reminded me,
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.560]   and I kept using the word nixonian.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.720]   The word antenna gate, which computer world coin,
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.480]   but Steve Jobs highlighted.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.760]   The blaming of the media, the saying it's not our problem,
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.040]   but we're gonna take care of it.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.160]   But even the fact that I have a feeling,
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.400]   people who were in the audience seeing it live
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.240]   might've had a different experience from those of us
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.640]   who were outside kind of watching the live blogs.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.720]   What was your sense in the room?
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.720]   (sniffles)
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   - I think it was a sense of frustration.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.680]   I mean, I kind of had the under the current sense
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:57.680]   that Apple sort of, it was sort of a gamble call
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:03.000]   as to whether they needed to do it.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.760]   Like what if they hadn't called the press conference, right?
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.600]   What if they hadn't?
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.600]   Would we still be talking about the iPhone 4 antenna this week?
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.360]   - No, obviously it was, I think what precipitated
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.360]   the whole thing was the consumer reports follow up
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.120]   that said, - Absolutely.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.360]   - And hear me out now, this is,
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.680]   it's one of those like butter five flapping its wings
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:28.520]   in China type list, but, so people made the videos
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.160]   where you can put your finger on the thing
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.640]   and lose some bars.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:36.440]   And it seemed to have gone away, right?
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.280]   And the thing that really rejuvenated it
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.160]   was the consumer reports follow up.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.840]   And the headline said,
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:48.000]   "This is why consumer reports can't recommend the iPhone 4."
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.800]   Now in consumer reports lingo,
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.440]   if you're a consumer reports reader,
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.280]   recommended is like their stamp of approval, right?
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:58.400]   It's a very specific meaning for them,
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.760]   that something is recommended or it's not.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.880]   And what they really meant is we can't give this phone
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.760]   our recommended stamp of approval.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.160]   But in plain English, everybody read,
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:11.040]   we can't recommend iPhone 4, they turn that into,
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.040]   and just in plain language, consumer reports says,
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.480]   "Don't buy the iPhone 4," which is definitely not the case.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.720]   And in fact, consumer reports has a separate stamp
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:25.720]   like the red badge of shame called "Don't buy."
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.120]   And they give it out like, I don't know,
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.680]   like three times a year, you know,
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.760]   like your product really has to like burst into flames to get it.
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.600]   But there were literally headlines then
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.000]   across the country the next day
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   that said, "Consumer reports calling, 'Don't buy iPhone 4.'"
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.280]   And that, you know, people trust consumer reports,
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.960]   and that sounds horrible, that really sounds terrible.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.640]   It says, you know, "Consumer reports, don't buy iPhone 4."
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.800]   CNN.com then the next day, put up a thing that said,
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.680]   "Fix your iPhone 4 with duct tape."
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.640]   Right, I mean, this is totally, now that's--
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.400]   - Now you could blame consumer reports for that,
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.640]   'cause they went on the Today Show with "Duct tape"
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.480]   and said, "Look, this is--" - Right,
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.960]   because it makes a great demo, it's a fantastic story.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.840]   I mean, you could totally see why people were eating it up,
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.240]   but it's really not necessary.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:13.400]   And just by coincidence, when that story was breaking,
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.440]   I was on vacation for a few days in Vegas with my wife.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.200]   And I happen to see, I saw a lot of people
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.160]   with iPhone 4s out there, I'd be waiting for coffee
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.560]   in the morning or going to the bar
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.120]   and after gonna get a cocktail or something like that,
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.640]   take out my iPhone, there'd be a guy next to me
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.560]   with an iPhone 4.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.560]   And we'd say, "Hey, hey, how you doing?"
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.640]   And are you having people, I had no idea who I am.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.960]   It's not like, "Oh, there's John Gruber.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.400]   "There's just--" I had another guy with an iPhone.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.880]   They'd say, "Hey, you having problems with the antenna?"
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:40.880]   And I'd say, "Nope, you."
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.400]   And they'd say, "Nope, you know, this is, you know,
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.520]   "over and over and over again."
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.840]   Or people who didn't have one yet and saw me with mine out,
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.360]   you know, and they would say, "Hey, is that an iPhone 4?
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.200]   "How do you like it?"
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.040]   And I'd say, "I love it."
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.720]   And they'd say, "You know, what about that antenna thing?"
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.560]   And I'd say, "I don't know."
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.320]   And I'd hold it, you know, put my finger,
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.640]   put it in my left hand and, you know,
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.400]   didn't drop any bars and they'd say, "Where?
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.080]   "Why is everybody saying it, you know?"
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.800]   "Wait a minute, you're saying it doesn't drop bars?
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.080]   "Because every iPhone I've used dropped bars.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:08.920]   "Every single one."
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.760]   Sometimes it does.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.600]   Sometimes it doesn't.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.440]   Sometimes it doesn't.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.280]   I mean--
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.120]   It drops bars.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:13.960]   It drops.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.400]   I can't believe you're not having that experience.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.720]   I do think probably you're in a very strong signal area.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.560]   But--
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.960]   And by the way, I don't think dropping--
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.960]   I don't equate dropping bars with dropping calls.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.480]   And I don't care if it drops bars,
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.880]   if it doesn't drop calls.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.920]   In my case, I drop calls to the point
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.320]   where I couldn't use it anymore.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.440]   Well, it is different.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.720]   I will say that it's different with the new software update,
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.040]   where the bars are re-jiggered.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.760]   Well, but the bars is not the point.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.760]   I mean, who cares?
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.440]   But I'm just saying for the little,
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.520]   like, you're in line for coffee and someone comes up
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.200]   and asks you for a 30-second demo of your iPhone 4,
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.400]   it almost never ever does it for me.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.400]   Really?
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.240]   No, it really doesn't.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.240]   It must be geographic then.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.240]   Oh, does it do it for you?
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:50.920]   Absolutely.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.600]   I mean, it's pretty reliable.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.080]   I felt as though Apple missed the mark a little bit
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.800]   during the press conference by--
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.760]   By equating the problems that the iPhone 4 is having
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.800]   with the problems that every single other phone has.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.120]   I don't think it's the same thing.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.000]   I do have--
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.760]   Oh boy, Nokia and Blackberry were very quick to say.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.280]   Oh, not us.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.960]   It was a mistake on a couple levels.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.560]   For one, it really does--
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.480]   he should put up a slide saying,
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.640]   Nokia, please produce videos proving
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.240]   that I'm just full of crap here.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.800]   Because I mean, he basically asked for it.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.560]   He wasn't attacking other products,
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.760]   but that's an opportunity for HTC, Nokia,
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.040]   and Samsung, everybody to say, well, here
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.160]   is a shot of our phones not doing that.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.800]   But for me, the difficulty is that it's
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.680]   such a different type of problem with the iPhone 4.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.160]   If I hold it in a way that is natural for me,
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.920]   when I'm just-- look, checking my email
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.360]   or just waiting in line someplace,
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.840]   want to just check out some news fees or something,
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.840]   it's easy for me to hold it in such a way
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.240]   that I can't get a signal or I can't get communications
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:52.960]   elsewhere.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.320]   It's also very easy for me to hold it in a way
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.280]   that that problem does not occur.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.920]   But the thing is, though, when I'm doing this with--
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.400]   again, the Samsung phones, the HTC phones,
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.800]   I can hold it in such a way that I will lose a bar or two.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.200]   But it will never be so dramatic that the difference
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.040]   between holding it like this and holding it like this
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.680]   is that I can get a signal like this,
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.680]   I can get nothing like the other way.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.280]   So I really thought that I think it was Glenn Fleischman,
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.040]   who said it best, that in retrospect--
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.880]   and they could only really realize this in retrospect--
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.120]   the best thing for Apple to have done,
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:29.440]   if they had the benefit of knowing about this a few months
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.480]   in advance.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.600]   During the rollout, simply saying,
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.240]   we've got this great new design that puts the antenna back
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.480]   on the outside because when you put it on the inside,
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.400]   you automatically lose two bars of coverage.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.520]   There's no way around that.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.040]   So we put it on the outside now.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.240]   Ben, here are the tests in which we
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.960]   show that every single situation,
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.200]   it will give you better coverage, better situation,
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.880]   especially in dodgy areas.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.720]   You couldn't get a signal, you couldn't make a phone call
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.320]   before.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.480]   Now you get rough goods, solid two bars of coverage.
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.160]   Now, of course, there's only one problem with that.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.400]   Is that by putting it on the outside?
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.840]   There is this one place right here that if you touch it,
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.440]   maybe you'll lose some signal for technical reasons.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.160]   But of course, we put this little black bar here
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.600]   so you know where that is.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.840]   Just know that's going in.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.840]   I mean, I'm a lefty.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.520]   And I do hold it that way.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.400]   I think one of the things Steve said
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.920]   that I thought was a little bit disingenuous is,
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.240]   oh, by putting the black bar there,
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.240]   we really just gave them a place to look for the error.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.480]   And try it.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.520]   But this is how I hold my phone.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.880]   I mean, it's just how I hold my phone.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.160]   And again, I don't care about bars.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.400]   It's fine if the bars drop.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.120]   I'm not looking at the bars and they're dropping.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.120]   I don't think that's the story.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.200]   I think if the media did misrepresent it,
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.640]   it would be that, well, the bar,
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.960]   they equated bars dropping with something else.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.400]   But if you drop calls and I drop calls way too much,
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.880]   more than on the other phone,
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.160]   then it's not an acceptable phone.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.200]   That's to me all that matters.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.640]   Do you drop calls?
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.120]   Do you drop calls?
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.400]   Oh, yeah, I'm giving up the iPhone.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.360]   I can't use it.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:47.840]   I've dropped.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:51.920]   But the final straw was dropping a single call five times
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.040]   and five different calls in two days.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.520]   I'm using an Android run for Verizon I love.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.640]   OK.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.880]   But here's my question.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.800]   Number one, it is literally a case.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:07.320]   And actually, here's where the zoom lens comes in.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:12.000]   It really is a difference between if I hold it like this,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.480]   I lose signal.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.360]   If I hold it like this, I don't lose signal.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.640]   So that to me is not that big of a difference.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.120]   Also, if I put it in any kind of a case,
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.920]   the problem goes away completely.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.200]   And the other advantages of the iPhone 4
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:29.080]   are so great, including better coverage, better reception
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.320]   in every other usage consideration.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.000]   And we're not even talking about the camera.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.800]   We're not even talking about the 4 to 10 times greater
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.040]   download upload space.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.040]   We're not even talking about the better Wi-Fi.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.600]   We're not even talking about the better GPS on and on and on
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.360]   and on.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.400]   I'm simply not willing to get rid of a phone that's
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.720]   this fantastic because of a problem that is so easy to not
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.160]   encounter.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.160]   Well, clearly, you're not alone.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.800]   As Steve pointed out, the return rate on the iPhone 4
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.640]   is significantly lower than that on the iPhone 3GS
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.640]   in the same time period.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.240]   I will double back, though, and just say that I totally
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.480]   agree with Andy there.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.560]   Jean-Louis Gase had his own hypothetical.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.960]   Here's what Jobs could have said at the keynote WWDC about it.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.240]   And there was even a time--
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.960]   Jobs even specifically mentioned when he unveiled the design.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.520]   And he said it was the whole, perhaps, you've seen this
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.520]   before, a little joke to the gizmodo thing, and said, look,
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.480]   people even looked at this, and they
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.640]   saw these little black lines, and some of them
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.560]   thought it was fake, because they thought, well, why would
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.400]   Apple put those black lines in this otherwise perfect thing?
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.760]   Well, here's the explanation.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:34.640]   And then the next slide was of the antenna system,
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.360]   and which is, in fact, the frame.
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.160]   And he talked about the advantages of this,
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.040]   that it's because it's stainless steel.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.040]   It gives the phone increased structural rigidity.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.960]   Because the antenna is not internal,
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.240]   it creates a lot more internal room for other things,
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.240]   which they have filled up with battery.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.320]   So it literally, by putting the phone,
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.440]   the antenna on the outside--
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.800]   Lots of advantages.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.880]   --in your lead to increased battery.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.560]   And then there's that point where he could say,
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:04.480]   but here's why the black lines are there, don't touch.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.240]   And it's like why--
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.320]   Is that a bit effective?
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.840]   I mean, wouldn't that just--
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.480]   I think it would have.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.440]   I mean, I'm sure he could come up with a better way
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.280]   to say that I could.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.120]   I'm not Steve Jobs.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.960]   And you have to think that they spent a lot of time--
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.560]   Apple's smart.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.480]   They thought about these approaches, right?
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.520]   Oh, I definitely think so.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.520]   I mean, and that was the absolutely the subtext
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:29.680]   of the whole tour of this $100 million lab and all this stuff
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:33.080]   is to come out and say, if you thought we didn't know what
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.160]   happened, then you touched that.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:34.680]   You got it.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.800]   And I know there's so many people out there.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.400]   I get this email every single day, over and over and over again,
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:44.360]   where people say, hey, everybody knows
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.520]   that when this great pal guy lost this phone,
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.720]   that it was encased.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.120]   And it was in a case.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.280]   And that's when they were doing this testing.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.600]   So if that's how they tested them all off campus,
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.360]   isn't that why this ship?
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.040]   Because the only testing they did outside of Apple's campus
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.440]   was in a case.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.200]   That's really relevant to the testing of the design.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.880]   And it's also pretty clear that Apple's not that stupid.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.640]   Right.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.920]   But there's so many people who believe that.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.920]   That's why they gave us the tour of this facility.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.040]   And you see what they do.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.640]   I mean, and they literally run these tests for 24 hours each.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.520]   I mean, one test in that thing, spinning around with us,
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.480]   what if we test it with this much signal?
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:20.840]   Right.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:24.600]   24 hours for each of these things.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.000]   Is the case a good solution?
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.960]   Given that they didn't make that statement upfront,
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.400]   they didn't at WWDC spin it and position it appropriately,
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.800]   they clearly had a PR problem.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.480]   Whether it's the media's fault or not,
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.000]   I think blaming the media whether true or not
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.680]   is not a good strategy.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.840]   Nor do I think saying every other phone has this problem
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.920]   is not a good strategy.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.320]   But at the end,
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.280]   well, see, I'll, you think so?
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.640]   Let me just point two things out there.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:56.160]   One, I think you have a very good point about
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.920]   whether it's true or not that blaming the media
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.120]   was a poor strategy.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.160]   We can come back to that.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.640]   And I do agree with that.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.600]   And in fact, I actually think jobs probably shouldn't have been
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.280]   the guy making their case.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.360]   Maybe.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.720]   But we can come back to that.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.040]   The second point, what was your second point?
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.920]   That saying other phone companies have the same problem.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.760]   Right.
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.440]   That was actually the brilliant part of the thing.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.720]   And you can say that it's nasty and you can say that it
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.560]   opened them up to this.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.560]   But I think the main problem they had last week,
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.480]   and if there was any kind of debate inside Apple of,
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.120]   do we need to do something big?
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.960]   Do we need to have like a press event and have people come out
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.680]   here and go nuclear on this in a response?
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.520]   I think that if they, I think that if there was any debate,
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:42.040]   the ultimate reason why was that the iPhone 4 was subject
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:42.800]   to ridicule.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.720]   And ridicule is really, really bad PR problem.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.640]   They are Letterman top 10 lists.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.680]   Yep.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.320]   Stewart, everybody.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:50.560]   Right.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.320]   And effectively.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.480]   And you can say that they complete the case
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.400]   that they were being serious.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.080]   But when CNN puts up a front page story on their website
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.080]   and says you can fix the iPhone 4 with duckies,
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.680]   that's the way the news media ridicules a product.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.640]   I mean, they're not--
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.640]   that's not necessarily a joke, but it's ridicule.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.120]   It's like in politics, like when there was a week,
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.960]   when there was during the election,
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.320]   the last presidential election, when there was a week full of
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.320]   stories about John Edwards getting a $300 haircut.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.200]   It's ridicule.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.400]   And it's about--
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.360]   Ridicules are wrong.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.200]   Do you think it's the wrong word?
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.920]   It's completely the wrong word.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.560]   Ridicule would indicate that someone has--
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.720]   someone thinks, wouldn't it be funny if we stuck it to Apple
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.160]   by doing it by reporting the story this way?
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.280]   It's a legitimate problem with the phone.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.040]   It's demonstrable and it affects the usage of the phone.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:39.440]   It's also a bigger story with Apple than with other products
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.080]   because Apple does such a really good job
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.080]   designing their hardware.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.320]   It's almost unheard of that an Apple product would have a
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:49.480]   problem this big and this loud, so to speak.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:52.400]   So yeah, that becomes a very easy story to pitch and a very,
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.320]   very easy-- especially something that's so easy to
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.560]   demonstrate.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:00.120]   As someone who talks to producers regularly about ideas
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.720]   for doing things on the--
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.560]   They love the visual of that--
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.720]   Why did you say it was wrong to report it?
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.360]   I'm not saying it was wrong to report.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:08.440]   I'm not saying it was wrong to report.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.360]   I disagree with the term ridicule.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.360]   Really?
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.480]   One of the areas in which I thought that Apple screwed up is
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.120]   I really think that they should have done their canned
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.760]   presentation for 20 minutes and done no Q&A.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.720]   Because to my ear, every place in which they kind of messed up
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.000]   their message and kind of diluted what they were doing
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.960]   was when they took questions and said things.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.000]   And basically pretended like the prom queen who says, oh,
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.320]   it's so horrible.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.160]   Everyone always wants to be-- it's so horrible being so
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:36.600]   beautiful and smart and loved by everybody because you'll get
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.360]   this sort of thing.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.760]   And nobody likes it when the prom queen makes statements
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.080]   like that.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.880]   Even if it's true, and it is true that people want to see
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.760]   Apple fail because they've been so successful.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.200]   So you can-- I mean, it's true.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.680]   I understand why that's in Steve Jobs' heart,
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.200]   but you don't say it.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:52.680]   Right.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:56.840]   And I think I agree with John in the sense that whatever word
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.400]   you use-- and I think ridicule is appropriate-- whatever word
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:03.440]   you use, Apple had a serious problem because of this stuff
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:04.240]   like duct tape.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.360]   And it was so easy to--
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.680]   Apple did have to really take the bull by the horns
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:11.040]   because they had a John Edwards style problem.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:11.560]   They were--
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:15.880]   And I think it was effectively like if the Edwards campaign
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.320]   had been able to say how much other candidates had
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.520]   spent on haircuts, and it was similar or something.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.720]   That would have been effective, I suppose.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:22.720]   It's really important--
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.000]   It's a really important thing to spin your way out of it.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.640]   People were making jokes that the iPhone 4 can't even
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:27.960]   make a phone call.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:33.120]   And that was the 10-word summary of the situation.
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.800]   And I think showing the other phones, whether--
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.400]   and clearly, it's not the same thing,
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:40.560]   that the other phones because the antennas are internal,
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.800]   it's physical interference.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.680]   It's a big bag of water, the palm of your hand
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.000]   blocking the antenna.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.480]   Whereas the iPhone, which is also susceptible to that,
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.200]   just like all previous iPhones, is unique in that it's also
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.800]   susceptible to some kind of capacitance, some kind of--
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:55.720]   It's detuning it.
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.920]   It's detuning the antenna because your hand becomes
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.680]   part of the antenna.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.000]   Right.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.320]   But their argument more or less--
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.240]   and I think they could have made it more clearly, though,
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.640]   is that while it's technically different,
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.160]   it's effectively the same.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.720]   That if you put your hand on a certain spot in a certain way,
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.320]   you lose--
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.760]   I did hear them saying--
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.800]   I think that's where I thought they blew it.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:16.480]   Again, I don't have the big spiky and echoeych chamber
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.480]   in my house here.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.680]   But I do have five or six different working
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.680]   phones from three different manufacturers.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.840]   And when you test the problem of, well,
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.800]   do certain phones have hots-- have dead spots,
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.080]   that's something that I can demonstrate.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.080]   And usually, it's by saying, well, here is an HTC phone
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.480]   made two months ago.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:37.040]   If I hold it like this, my signal degrades slightly.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.120]   And because it's an Android phone,
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.600]   you can actually figure out exactly how much.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.560]   And it's a significant percentage.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.360]   But I can still get my email with it.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.760]   If I want to make sure that my email client will just
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.880]   completely hang because it can't get a signal,
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.800]   I just got to just sandbag it completely.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.120]   I have to really work hard to cover up
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:59.480]   enough of that antenna so that it's dead to the outside world.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.240]   My difficulty is that that's not the same situation
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:05.040]   as what I personally had been seeing with the iPhone, where,
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:08.440]   again, hold it in the-- hold it one way where there's
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.680]   where there's enough contact in the meaty part of your hand
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.000]   and it's dead, put a little bit of gap there,
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.840]   and it's perfectly fine.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.160]   So that's the only place where I had a major disagreement
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.080]   with the way they did that.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.280]   Because by equating it to an unsolvable engineering
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.680]   problem that affects every phone equally,
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.960]   that's the one place where you can't point to the numbers
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.720]   and say, no, I don't agree with that.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.880]   What you said in this presentation
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.680]   does not agree with what's happening outside
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.520]   of the presentation problem.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.400]   And they did open themselves up to further ridicule
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:41.480]   the CEOs-- well, actually, Nokia's people said,
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:42.760]   and this is ridicule.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:46.840]   Well, if there is an antenna design issue versus how it
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.240]   look and feel, we're always going to go with a better antenna.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:53.040]   And that was subtle ridicule saying Apple's always
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.400]   going to go for the cooler.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.440]   And the natural thing to say back is, yeah, we knew that just
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.000]   by looking at the Nokia phone and you could tell this.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:00.520]   That's absolutely--
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.960]   Easier joke for the week.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:02.960]   Easiest joke for the week.
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:06.000]   We're really going to trade 20% of Apple looks 5% of signal.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.200]   Now, and you know what though, but that's not true either.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.600]   I think all of those companies that respond--
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.400]   I think all of those companies should have just kept their mouths
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:11.920]   shut, man.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.920]   I think they should--
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:13.440]   Oh, I know.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:14.440]   --was somebody else having a problem?
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.120]   I think you'd let them dig their own hole
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.000]   and you just look the other way.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.560]   Well, it doesn't hurt BlackBerry or Nokia
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:20.320]   that they responded.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.080]   Does it or HTC?
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.720]   No, because I do because I think that's a dare to people
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.320]   to make videos with their phones.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.200]   Ah, that's true.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.280]   And we have seen quite a few--
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:27.280]   I really do.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.240]   I think that--
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.480]   I think you just stay out of it and let it be said.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:32.600]   Because here's the thing.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:36.120]   At that point, it was only Apple had shown these videos.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.760]   And everybody knows, obviously, Apple
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:41.120]   is not the most unbiased source of information
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:44.040]   about the reception of Nokia and BlackBerry phones.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.880]   So it's somebody who's everybody.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:51.280]   Even the most strident art Apple fan
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:54.640]   is going to know that Apple isn't exactly the best unbiased
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.480]   source of information for a reception of competing phones.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.200]   But by stepping into it and saying--
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:02.280]   Now you're inviting a landslide.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.600]   I think when somebody else is-- when your competitor is having--
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.600]   and this goes for tech, it goes for any industry,
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.440]   it goes for politics-- when your competitor is having a PR
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.120]   problem, you just stay away.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.080]   Don't say anything.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.320]   Just say, hey, I got no comment on that.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:18.360]   So the case, good free cases, free bumpers, good solution,
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.320]   refunds on bumpers.
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.400]   I mean, I think Apple actually-- that was about as good
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:21.960]   as you're going to get.
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.040]   You're not going to get a recall, I don't think.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.960]   No, because that would have been absolute.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.720]   No reason to, and also that would have been absolute death.
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:30.720]   You do not come back from a recall.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.360]   That's something you do.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.800]   It's something I said a couple times, first on a blog,
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:38.640]   and then elsewhere, where barring the presence of video
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.800]   of adorable baby dolphins struggling for air
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.280]   because they're covered in spilled iPhone 4s,
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.440]   Apple was not going to take that extreme step.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.520]   I think you're right.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.000]   And no one was being killed and was an easy problem to work
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.600]   around, so there's no need to do that.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.640]   And it really shows the difference.
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.240]   It's like the flip side of the difference of Apple's strategy.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.400]   So Apple, very different than almost every,
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.120]   probably every single one of their competitors,
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:06.800]   maybe the closest is Palm, bet big with one new phone per year.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   That's a good point.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.080]   The iPhone 4 is the new thing.
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:14.040]   And clearly, internally, they are set up for one new phone a year.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.480]   They've got to live with that for a year.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.960]   You're absolutely right.
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:22.760]   If rim had to recall the BlackBerry 9650,
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.720]   it would be a big deal.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:24.800]   It would be bad press.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:28.680]   But that's one phone and it's on one carrier.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:32.320]   It's not going to-- it's not at all the same as--
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.720]   even if it's their best new phone, their single bet,
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.200]   the top of the line new phone.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.800]   That's not like if Apple had to do it.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:38.920]   I mean, Apple--
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:42.320]   I think they reap tremendous benefits from this strategy.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.560]   But on the other hand, they also are--
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:47.680]   this shows you that they're taking a tremendous risk.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.720]   Yeah, you definitely see that in phones
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:54.160]   like the Droid X, which has just huge software problems with it
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.000]   that are evident the very first time you charge it up
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:57.920]   and try to activate it.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:01.920]   You just see the chugginess of the UI, certain buttons
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.720]   that just don't work, although bloke wear.
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:04.240]   Really?
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.080]   I haven't had that problem.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.680]   You've had problems?
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.600]   I see that that's why I've had it for a few weeks
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:10.880]   and I haven't finished my review yet
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.200]   because I'm trying to figure out how much of it
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.760]   is really a problem and how much of it
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:19.280]   is something that I had blown into consumer reports
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.600]   all over the designers' butt about it.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.800]   Just when you have the unlock screen, for instance,
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:28.520]   I don't-- unfortunately, I'm not walled in by lights
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.240]   and screens right now.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.000]   I'll just go up and get it for you.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.680]   When I hit the unlock screen, on an iPhone,
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:37.160]   you're used to-- you get a full slide from left to right
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.560]   and a click saying, OK, you've done that.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.480]   Great, let's start using your iPhone.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.800]   I'm using this other lock screen.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.640]   So I'll turn that other one on.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:49.200]   But on the Droid X, it will suddenly jump about 1/3 of the way
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.320]   and that's its way of saying, OK, no, you
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.320]   don't have to continue swiping.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.440]   We understand you want to unlock it.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.720]   That's good enough for us.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.760]   And you really want to see that smooth--
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:58.480]   smoothness of work.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.120]   A couple of weeks ago, I spent--
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.040]   I took a nice long walk through Boston
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:06.240]   with five different camera phones and a real camera
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.280]   shooting the exact same scene six different times
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.480]   to do sort of a photo comparison.
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:15.800]   And the Droid X by far was the biggest pain in the butt
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.440]   to get that camera application working properly from--
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:22.600]   it has a dedicated picture-taking button on the top of it,
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.880]   which is something I actually wish that the iPhone 4 had
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.640]   since it has such a really great thing.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:31.920]   But there's just no point in taking the Droid X out of your pocket
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.080]   and trying to take a picture--
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:33.840]   It's very slow.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.880]   It's very slow to get the camera to run.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.840]   It will take at least 15 seconds for it to do anything.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.560]   And you can actually take the picture faster
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.600]   if you manually launch the camera app.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:43.520]   And then it's just--
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:44.440]   Oh, dear.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:45.480]   But there's some nice features.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.640]   And it's an excellent camera.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:47.840]   I have to say--
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.400]   I've been very happy with the camera.
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:50.200]   It's an excellent camera.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.520]   It's not as good as the iPhones.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:54.440]   The light is way better than the iPhone's LED light.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.840]   I mean, it has a lot of good things to recommend about it.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.320]   That's why, again, I didn't want to rush out
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:01.000]   with first impressions about, oh, man, this software--
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.880]   especially when you talk about software that can be fixed
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.120]   with an upgrade, especially-- and especially when you consider
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.360]   that Android 2.2 is coming out soon.
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.840]   But to go back to John's original point,
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.800]   the fact that this is not a Waterloo situation,
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.320]   it's certainly not a Waterloo situation for Verizon.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.440]   It's definitely a Waterloo situation for Google,
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.040]   because if you have one phone with a lot of bad problems--
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.360]   Right, but just another one comes out.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.960]   It's just another bad phone.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.520]   Oh, did we lose you, Andy?
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.400]   You started to break up.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:28.920]   No.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:29.640]   So they're good, OK.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.160]   I'm still here.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.160]   No, that is-- at disadvantage, Apple's
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.840]   got this kind of crown jewel once a year.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:35.960]   And that's it.
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:39.240]   I think Apple's response with the case is sufficient.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.320]   Yeah, also it solves the problem.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.360]   I think in some ways it may be more generous.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.320]   They're giving refunds to people who bought bumpers
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:44.920]   previously.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:46.320]   They didn't have to do that.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:46.720]   Right.
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.720]   I mean, it's also-- I thought that they missed two opportunities,
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.040]   though.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:53.840]   The morning of, I basically went through-- here's
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:55.520]   what I thought they were talking about.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.480]   I did definitely think that they would spend some time
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:01.600]   talking about putting that problem in the context
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.600]   of the entire phone.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:05.640]   Like I said earlier in the show, there's
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.440]   a huge laundry list of great new features with the iPhone 4,
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.360]   including the feature that it actually gets much better
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:14.320]   signal than the 3GS.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.120]   So I really thought that they would say, well,
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.760]   take a look at the entire phone and see
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:20.920]   if this is such a big problem that you're not willing to simply
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.720]   adjust the phone one half of a centimeter in your hand
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.120]   or put it in a case, which is something
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.400]   that you probably should do to protect your 200-dollar investment.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.320]   But the other thing that they should have talked about
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.080]   is Apple's customer service.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:35.240]   I'm preparing a story right now about their--
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.600]   there's things that they are legally obligated
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:41.400]   to do for their customers by virtue of the warranty policy
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:43.120]   that they have attached to all their products.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.600]   But then there's the tremendous amount of latitude
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.560]   that Apple gives a genius bar on--
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.120]   Apple Store managers and even Apple Store employees
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.120]   to make customers happy.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.600]   And this is actually backed up in ways
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:57.200]   that are pretty surprising.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.320]   I mean, my advice--
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.760]   I haven't finished researching and writing this yet.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.440]   But honestly, my advice is that if you have a new--
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:06.280]   if you have a new anything, especially if it's
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:08.960]   a mobile device like an iPad or an iPhone,
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:12.320]   and anything happens to it within the first two weeks,
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.480]   don't even stop to think, oh, well, geez,
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:18.120]   they're not going to replace this because I did something--
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.240]   that's something unfortunate happened to it.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.280]   Chances are, they're not going to replace it for you.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.600]   But all I'm saying is it's worth coming in
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.720]   to see what they're going to say about it.
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:32.000]   I was actually-- as a little test case,
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.120]   after I was embarrassed to admit over the past couple of weeks,
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:40.480]   I did drop one of my loaner phones and broke it on the first day.
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.080]   And I was trying to find out-- and of course,
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.160]   I took it back to the Apple store,
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.800]   and they just swapped it out immediately.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.760]   And I thought that I was either getting the--
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:48.040]   well, this belongs to Apple.
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.720]   So obviously, we're going to place an Apple's property
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.000]   with a brand new phone.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.800]   And failing that, I thought this was the OK.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:55.040]   This guy's writing reviews, so we
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:57.280]   want to make sure that he gets-- he has a really good positive
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.600]   experience taking his phone back.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.920]   So as an experiment, I just put a call out to Twitter
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.920]   primarily to get more information about people who
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:05.720]   have dropped their phones.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:06.240]   Did it break?
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:06.920]   Did it not break?
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:07.400]   Did it broke?
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:07.880]   What happened?
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.600]   Was it the screen?
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:09.760]   Was it the back glass?
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.160]   And so I got-- started talking about 12 or 13 people who
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.800]   had dropped and broken their phones.
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:16.920]   And I-- two or three of them had been fairly recent.
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:20.040]   And I said, just for fun, why don't you just go back
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.160]   to the Apple store and explain what happened?
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.400]   I won't tell you to do anything.
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.160]   I'm saying, just for fun, go back there and see what happens.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:28.160]   Both of them got their phone swapped out.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:29.040]   Wow.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:29.840]   That's pretty good.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.080]   You don't see that.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.600]   They weren't making a wacky YouTube video,
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:34.680]   and that's how they broke it.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:36.400]   It was just accidental where they're--
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:38.920]   like me, I was just sort of fumbling
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:40.920]   with it on a table at a restaurant.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:42.160]   It just slipped out of my hands.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.680]   So obviously, that's not a warrant--
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:44.720]   that's not a warranty issue.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.600]   They're not legally obligated to do that.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.600]   But Apple is really, really good at making sure
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:51.120]   that if you buy an Apple product, you
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:52.120]   will have an Apple store--
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.600]   They're not so good at telling me
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.440]   where to get my free case, though.
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:56.240]   Do you know where I should--
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.680]   I don't think they figured it out yet.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:58.180]   Oh.
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.320]   I mean, it's going to be on the website,
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:00.320]   but they haven't--
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:00.760]   It's not here.
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.000]   It's not here yet, so--
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   OK.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.640]   It's considering that they were out of stock
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:07.320]   and all those bumper cases, even before this was an issue.
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:09.360]   They got to do some real tooling up
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.960]   to make everyone happy.
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:11.800]   Steve did say that people--
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.200]   I'm surprised they didn't make more bumper cases,
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:16.800]   because this got to be a $29.95 profit in those bumper cases.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:17.560]   It's all.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.840]   Well, it's not like a live strong bracelet.
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:22.360]   It's actually really well made.
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.200]   It almost looks like when you have it's all--
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:24.640]   Handy.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.520]   It's a plastic.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:27.640]   Injection molds it.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.120]   Anyways, but--
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:28.960]   Anyways, but--
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.800]   I think it's safe to say they got $20 in profit on them, right?
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:32.280]   I mean, they don't--
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:35.800]   It did not cost them $10 to make that piece of crap.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.560]   Well, I didn't say it cost them $10.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.280]   Also, I didn't say it's a piece of crap.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:39.760]   I think--
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:43.000]   It's a piece of plastic that covers the antenna.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   You're going to work with that--
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.800]   That gets the point of what jobs and assets are.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:46.320]   Right?
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.960]   Give it to me, because it's a piece of crap.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:51.840]   It's not about charging $30 for something that cannot possibly--
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:52.480]   I don't know.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:53.440]   Let's call I supply.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.360]   Could not possibly cost them more than $50 today.
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.640]   I do agree that if you look at it,
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:00.680]   it looks like more of a $15 item, maybe a $19.99 item.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.480]   Well, anyway, they're losing all the profit,
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.640]   because it gives all the money back.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:04.720]   I think that's really interesting,
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:07.760]   and it gets to the point of when jobs announced it.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.760]   And he's like, well, people said,
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:11.760]   so why don't you give out free cases?
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:12.480]   Fine.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.040]   Fine.
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.520]   Free cases for everybody.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:17.800]   And I do think the tone--
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:18.880]   I think he was being honest.
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:21.120]   I've always said this, and I thought this press conference
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:23.120]   was maybe the best example in history.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.400]   That Steve Jobs is not an actor.
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:26.680]   He is a terrible liar.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:27.560]   He's who he is.
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:28.080]   Yep.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:28.640]   Steve--
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.200]   Now, he may tell you things that aren't true,
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.200]   but he believes something.
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:33.960]   Oh, he will lie to you.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:35.080]   He will-- oh, no, come on, wait a minute.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.680]   When he says nobody's going to watch a video on a small screen,
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.160]   nobody's going to want to read a book on a portable device.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.320]   I mean, he's a liar in that respect.
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.160]   Well, he's talking about future products.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.840]   I think-- OK, lying strong.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:48.960]   He's-- whatever it is business people do when they don't
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.200]   tell you the truth, whatever that's called.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:51.240]   But it's so transparent.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:55.040]   And the whole media criticism angle of this, this whole--
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.720]   this is so overblown.
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:57.600]   It's incredible.
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.240]   I think that those were his words.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.280]   You know, you could tell that that's what he believes.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:02.800]   He honestly believes.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.480]   Yes, I would agree with you on that.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.480]   And it came out-- so with the case, right?
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.200]   And so the guy for Slate, his headline was,
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.480]   here's your free cases, jerks, right?
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.280]   And it's not unfair.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:17.120]   That's sort of the way he said it, right?
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.120]   It's kind of the end.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.880]   I said that I think it's going to be
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.720]   like a special custom bumper case that says, here you go.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.920]   You big babies.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:24.920]   Stop whining.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.720]   No more whining.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:26.520]   Happy now.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.800]   And now the world is perfect because now you
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.520]   got a free bumper case.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.680]   Are you happy now?
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.400]   And it'll be pink with the ponies on it.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.920]   I think I know why he was P.D.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.720]   I think he explained it later on when
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.200]   he was talking about the statistics, the hard data
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:39.960]   that they revealed.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.560]   And he said, so look, I do have to report to you
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.640]   that when it comes to dropped calls, according to AT&T,
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:49.880]   the iPhone 4 does have less than one more dropped call
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.080]   per 100 calls than the iPhone 3GS.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.520]   And then he said, now I have a pet theory about this
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.720]   as to why this is.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.320]   I don't have any data to back this up.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.280]   We're going to investigate it.
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:00.720]   We'll let you know.
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.600]   But here's my theory.
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.200]   My theory is that when we sold the iPhone 3GS,
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.320]   because it was the exact same shape as the iPhone 3G,
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.440]   there was already a gazillion cases that fit it.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:15.000]   And in our stores, 80% of people who, in the first month,
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.720]   who bought an iPhone 3GS, walked out with a case with it.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:23.320]   And only 20% of people buying iPhone 4s
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.680]   are buying a case because we can't make these bumpers fast
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:27.320]   enough.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.840]   Well, there's your explanation for why they're
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:29.920]   making the bumpers.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.080]   Because there are no third party cases for this.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.800]   If they could make these bumpers fast enough,
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.920]   I think that they'd be selling even before the antenna
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.520]   gate, just because people like to buy cases for their iPhone,
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.000]   they had the market all to themselves.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.600]   And they're selling them for $30 a pop.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.120]   I don't think it's a stretch at all
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.760]   to say that they could have made $100 million in profit
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.800]   on these bumpers.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.440]   Say $20 in profit and sell $5 million of them
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.280]   by the end of September, which is what
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.600]   they're going to give them out for.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.120]   That is absolutely reasonable number.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.120]   That's $100 million in profit.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.800]   Now, to put that in context, $100 million in profit,
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:08.040]   that's exactly how much jobs brag
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.640]   that they'd spent on those fancy pants and antenna labs.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.640]   It pays for the labs.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.320]   That's right.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.080]   I mean, these cases-- $100 million is $100 million.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.160]   I mean, sure, they're a billion dollar company,
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.560]   and they make billions every year.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.200]   But part of the reason they make billions of dollars
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.200]   every year, part of the reason they're doing so well
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.840]   financially, and their results today
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.840]   are going to probably be fantastic,
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:31.200]   is that when there's $100 million opportunity,
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.840]   yeah, they take it.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.960]   It's like the old thing about millionaires
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:39.040]   and driving 1978 Ford pickup trucks.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.400]   It's like the reason they're millionaires
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.280]   that they're still driving a 1978 Ford pickup truck.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.040]   So take the tone of what he says,
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.600]   you want a free case, fine.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.600]   Have a free case.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.200]   Replace free case with $100 million.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.200]   You want us to give away $100 million?
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:53.720]   Fine.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.220]   Fine.
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:55.640]   Here's $100 million.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.440]   Now, will you shut up?
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:57.960]   Right?
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.360]   I think that explains his attitude.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:02.120]   And that, to me, is why Steve Jobs shouldn't have been up there.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.480]   I think he had to be there.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.040]   I think he should have come out.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.440]   He should have introduced at the stage, and then Jaws.
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.360]   Jaws, what did that go?
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.440]   No, Jaws should have come out.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.600]   I think you needed to have Steve Jobs up there,
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:17.200]   because unnamed Apple Vice President of Marketing
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.320]   does not get into a two-minute package on the prime time news,
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.640]   or does not get onto the regular rotation on a 24-hour news
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.320]   station.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.640]   Steve Jobs, the celebrity, whatever he says--
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.240]   I'm going to tell you, though.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.000]   There was huge news interest in this.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.400]   In fact, our own Becky Worley, who was scheduled to cover it
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.680]   for ABC News, was bumped, because ABC decided
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.520]   to send an anchor instead.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.240]   And I don't know.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.600]   They didn't know that Steve was going to take the stage or not.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:41.560]   This was a big story.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.920]   And I think it's one of the reasons Apple
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.880]   did have to take the bull by the horns
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.520]   and have a serious press conference over this.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:51.200]   I can't remember Apple ever doing anything like this before.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.000]   And I'm sure they pray.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.160]   They're never going to have to do anything like this again.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.000]   And as far as I'm concerned, that case is closed.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.520]   I mean, with the case, you give them a case.
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:04.080]   I'll say that John, you became like my ultimate hero.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:08.160]   I was watching reading Jason Stell's live by Life Coverage.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.240]   And so he was writing about how you asked the question,
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.240]   do any of you guys up on stage keep your iPhones and cases?
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.160]   And he wrote that everybody took off their iPhones.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.160]   No.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.640]   Not once a matter of a case.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.080]   That's the only shame about this.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.320]   And maybe one of the reasons they didn't sell a lot of cases
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.840]   is you don't want to put it in the case.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.880]   It's a beautiful phone.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.680]   But on the other hand, at least for those of us
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:30.440]   retches who live in poor AT&T country,
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.120]   if you don't have a case, you don't have a phone.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.560]   I also thought that was another little mistake
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.360]   that he made because it's the first time he could fight this
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.520]   with hard numbers by saying, here is the percentage of iPhone
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:44.120]   4s that got returned over the past three weeks.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.400]   Here's the percentage of iPhone 3GS
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.000]   that got returned the exact same period
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.160]   after its first release.
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.040]   Here's the number of drop calls we have.
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.040]   That's all, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.440]   I got to point out that all those numbers were useless.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.360]   First of all, you don't know that people
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.560]   were not returning their phones
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.480]   because they were waiting to see what Apple had to say.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.800]   And second, one more drop call is that really
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.800]   doesn't have any meaning unless you know how many drop calls
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.680]   the 3GS had.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:10.120]   If it had 1 per 100 and the iPhone 4 has 2 per 100,
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.040]   that's doubled the rate.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.600]   If it had 50 per 100 and the iPhone 4 had 51 100,
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.280]   it's a small increase and yet it's still far too many.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.600]   So, I mean, we don't know those numbers are meaningless.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.440]   We don't know.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.920]   - I think meaningless is a part of it.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.400]   - It's pretty beautiful that they were saying
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.000]   that calls to the Apple Care line
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.360]   that were specifically about the iPhone 4
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.240]   and a tiny percentage were about it,
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.000]   antenna and reception issues.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.640]   So that should show you how many people
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.240]   are actually having problems with it in that way.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.920]   - I think, you know, I really believe
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.600]   that the iPhone owner is so beat down by dropped calls
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.720]   that they no longer even notice.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:44.800]   - Eh.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.160]   - No, I noticed.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.280]   - I can tell you, I noticed when I went to Verizon
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.720]   and I stopped dropping calls, that really was a nice,
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.080]   I didn't know I was reading a sigh of relief.
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.040]   - John, I've got one, me now.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.320]   - Often a huff.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:59.280]   When I see, realize that like when I test out
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.760]   like some of these Verizon, some of these Android phones,
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.720]   I actually have to purge, sometimes I have to purge
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.240]   my knowledge of iPhone, you know,
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.400]   so I'll be using this Verizon phone
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.560]   as my main phone for a week and a half.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.600]   And if you give me the choice between
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.120]   not having to complain about AT&T anymore
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.600]   and now having to complain about this awful Android
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.480]   operating system and this awful HTC phone,
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.200]   I'll deal with a drop call every now and once in a while,
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.960]   just please give me my I/O.
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:24.960]   - Oh, and mine is different.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.960]   - I'm a guy.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.320]   - I couldn't disagree more.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:30.280]   I am so happy with Android, but that's the,
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.880]   I think the bottom line on that is,
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.040]   and this is I think good news in the long run,
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:38.160]   you have a choice now and you can choose your carrier,
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.640]   say I want this carrier and there are good phones,
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:43.320]   very good phones and I would say, I know you disagree,
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.280]   but I would say phones equal to the iPhone or better.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.200]   I think Android's far superior at this point to the iPhone.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.280]   - I know, I know, I think I'm sure gentlemen disagree too,
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.960]   but I definitely agree that Android is now performing
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:58.120]   at the same level as the iPhone 4.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.760]   And that's been true as of 2.1.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.600]   - It's a personal thing.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.120]   - 2.2 is gonna be a big deal.
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.560]   I just happen to think that in my opinion,
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.880]   and this is not the opinion of a user,
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.160]   but as someone who uses all, just like you,
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.000]   to try everything, I can really see the differences
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.640]   in the quality of the hardware
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.160]   and the quality of the software.
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.320]   - It's, I think one of the things that's very true
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:20.440]   about these portable devices is they are the most personal
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.440]   devices, most personal computing devices we have,
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.960]   and it's a personal choice.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:25.880]   I'm glad there's choice.
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.880]   For three years, your choice was the iPhone
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.640]   or basically crap.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:32.280]   Thanks to Apple, there are now good choices
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.200]   and I'm of the opinion, and by the way,
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.320]   there is a Droid X update.
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.600]   You might wanna check out that just came out minutes ago,
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.400]   but I'm of the opinion that Android's superior.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.840]   I know you and John completely disagree,
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.880]   but that's the beauty of it.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.640]   We now have a choice, and I far prefer Verizon as a carrier,
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.640]   at least where I am.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.880]   Love said.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.120]   - I do think there's something interesting though,
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.960]   and I have like a half written piece about it.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.000]   I mean, I don't know what I missed when I was faded out there,
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.840]   probably something really good about it.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.480]   - No, you missed me saying I like my Android phone
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.360]   and saying I'm so happy with Verizon
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.800]   'cause I don't drop calls.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.600]   - I do think, I think that there was an interesting period
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.200]   up through, let's say, around the release of the Nexus One,
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:16.200]   where Android was more or less going entirely more iPhone-like.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.080]   You know, from what their original concept was,
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.040]   which was very, very blackberry-ish,
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.320]   in terms of form factor and screen size,
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:25.680]   and it wasn't about touch.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:26.960]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:30.000]   - And they spent like three years making it more iPhone-like.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.360]   I'm not gonna say that it was ripping it off.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.120]   I'm just saying it was like their eyes were opened,
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.320]   like wow, look at that, it went in that direction.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.960]   And I think in the last six months,
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:40.160]   it's very interesting 'cause I feel like they're diverging more.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.160]   I mean, just look at the physical size of it, right?
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:46.160]   So the iPhone 4 has gone smaller, it's thinner,
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.240]   it just feels a lot smaller in your hand,
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:53.240]   whereas the flagship Android phones of the summer
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.160]   have gotten bigger.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:56.720]   - And I like that, I love these 4.3 inch screens.
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:57.920]   I'm big fan of that. - Yeah, so I,
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.000]   and I think in terms of what it means for the market,
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.640]   I do think it is sort of the competition
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.240]   begets good things for people.
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.640]   You know, the people who really do want a bigger phone.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:09.480]   - Have a choice.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.520]   - There's, you know, obviously,
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.120]   if you watch a lot of video on your phone,
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:15.400]   obviously a physically bigger display is absolutely better.
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:16.360]   There's no doubt about it.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.120]   I mean, if you watch video, if you fly a lot
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.640]   and watch video on your phone, on the plane,
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.880]   the bigger the screen, the better.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.440]   - Well, other things get better too,
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.680]   like the keyboard, I find it much easier
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.680]   to use a touchscreen keyboard,
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.360]   with just a scotch more room, things like that.
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:29.960]   Anyway, it's a personal decision,
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.120]   and I don't even, you know, when I talk on the radio show
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:35.920]   to the unwashed messes, if I may use that phrase,
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:40.200]   I never say, you know, this is the phone you should have.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.560]   I'm always very careful to say, it's a very personal choice.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.080]   Here's the pros, here's the cons,
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.040]   here's what you might like about the iPhone,
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.680]   here's what you might like about the Android phone,
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.880]   but you've got to go try it
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.760]   and you've got to go and make a decision.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:53.120]   I will say that for me, the best phone out there right now
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.760]   is not an iPhone, and that's the first time
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:57.240]   it's been that way quite and quite some time.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:59.080]   But moving on to less controversial,
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.880]   and I think happier subjects, really thrilled
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.040]   that Apple has donated the MacPaint source code
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.320]   to the Computer History Museum, and I was looking at it.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.280]   I mean, this is, you know, Donald Knuth,
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.880]   the great computer scientist,
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:15.640]   said that the best program ever written was MacPaint,
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.960]   and a program written by the amazing Bill Atkinson,
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.200]   along with Quickdraw, and the Quickdraw routines,
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.560]   and the MacPaint routines in Apple Pascal
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.200]   and 68,000 assembler are now available for download
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.120]   from the Computer History Museum, and it is a thrill.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:34.320]   Yeah, it's also, I was, this is,
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.240]   oh god, not that I have to explain that I'm a nerd by now.
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.440]   But this is a very nerdy thrill, I admit.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.640]   I was just like recreationally looking
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.800]   at the Pascal code for MacPaint,
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.800]   and it is just a beautiful thing to read through.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.280]   It's not like it's heavily commented with funny,
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.320]   like little comments in it,
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.000]   all the comments are really technically oriented
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.080]   about how, well, here's the default corner radius
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.960]   for these rounded rectangles, and here's this,
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.160]   and here's this, but especially,
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:06.600]   it was really wonderful to see that kind of linear programming
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.680]   code again.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.680]   Absolutely.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.400]   When you look at what's not object oriented, boy,
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.680]   that's for sure.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.680]   Holy cow.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.360]   Right, so you go to read to the end, and there's the main,
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.560]   you know, and at the bottom, calling back all the routines,
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.880]   and it's one file, it's amazing.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:24.200]   And it almost reads like a story, like this is a story
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.760]   of a paint program.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.560]   And let's start, this is our cast of characters.
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.000]   We have a rounded rectangle, and we have a heapspin,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.680]   we have an address space, and our story begins
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.680]   by initializing the user interface.
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:35.680]   Right.
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:36.880]   And it's, oh, good.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.400]   And it was just a real treasure to read.
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.560]   And also, I really can't wait to see,
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.480]   it's in Pascal, so God knows what people can actually do
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.640]   with this code, if it's going to be anything more
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.800]   than a curiosity, but the first person to,
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:52.520]   some people misunderstood the last time I used this sort
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:55.160]   of statement, so I have to clarify that the first person
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.120]   to create MacPane for the iPhone--
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.120]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:01.840]   I'll give you $10, not as your fee for writing the program,
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.440]   because I know your time is worth more than that.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.200]   But I want to buy you at least one premium beer
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:09.520]   or three really crummy ones, because everybody--
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.560]   even if it doesn't work really, really well,
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.040]   everybody wants to use MacPane on the iPhone.
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.560]   It's black and white, too.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.160]   No color.
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:16.560]   I want--
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:17.160]   Oh, no.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:17.720]   I want--
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.040]   --in the exact port, yep, with fat bits and everything.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:21.520]   Yes.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.600]   Now, John, you're a bit of a programmer, I think.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.360]   Yes.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.280]   A little bit.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:31.800]   So I think, and I wrote a few Apple programs in this era.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:35.920]   So it was really fun to see the traps that you have to make
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:41.840]   to call Apple ROM routines and Bill's kind of comments
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.800]   about this crazy trap number and that.
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:45.520]   And it's just really fun to look at it.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.600]   Did you get the same thrill out of it?
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.280]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:48.960]   It was a huge thrill.
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.800]   I mean, it's the sort of thing I never really--
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.040]   I mean, it's, again, super nerdy.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.160]   I mean, people--
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.320]   I mean, but people listening to the show,
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:54.920]   I'd appreciate it.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.920]   I think anybody who's in to Mac is going to love this.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.480]   It's the sort of thing that you just never
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:02.560]   thought you were going to see unless somebody like burgled it
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:03.560]   out of Apple.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.840]   Well, and quick draw, too.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.360]   That's the other thing, too.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.760]   Let's go to quick draw.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.360]   It's amazing, because quick draw
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.000]   was the most amazing part of the original Mac system software.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.520]   It was the thing, the way that it drew on screen,
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.520]   and it was everything seemed so fast.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:24.160]   And it really was a thing that nobody--
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:27.280]   it was a huge technical advantage over everybody else.
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.720]   No other computer could do this sort of--
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.440]   Focal things.
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.480]   And--
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.560]   This guy was a genius.
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:33.360]   He's a genius.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.040]   I mean, I really do think it's--
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:35.920]   like I wrote on site.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.920]   It's not hyperbole to say that as of 1984,
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:40.200]   that the source code to quick draw
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.840]   was the most valuable source code in the world.
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:43.880]   At least, line for line.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:46.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.520]   There's this story that they tell--
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:51.840]   I think Andy Hertzfeld tells us in his folklore.org
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.640]   about, at one point, towards the end of the Lisa development
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:56.920]   cycle, middle managers got involved
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.000]   and started asking programmers to turn in time sheets every week
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.880]   saying, how many lines of code they had written?
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:05.080]   Which is just--
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.840]   I mean, when you think of these great artists,
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.640]   we look back and now.
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.120]   These are the da Vinci's of the computer era
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:16.040]   asking, well, how many pounds of marble did you chisel this week?
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.240]   It's like just crazy.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:21.120]   So at one point, Atkinson rewrites the quick draw stuff
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:24.400]   to be 2,000 lines faster, 2,000 lines fewer
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.160]   to do the same amount of stuff.
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:31.640]   And he writes on his time sheet that week, minus 2,000.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.360]   Apparently, that was sufficient to get them to stop asking
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:35.760]   for that information.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:36.260]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:37.440]   Just brilliant.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:38.440]   My favorite was--
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.440]   My favorite was--
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:43.920]   there was an-- at a Mac hack where it was a landmark
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.840]   university of the release of the Mac.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:48.440]   I think it might have been 15 year or 20 or whatever.
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:50.680]   And so they had the original members of the--
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:54.760]   all the original members of the Mac team, minus Steve Jobs,
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.240]   up there with a three hour discussion
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:58.840]   and just panel discussion.
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:01.960]   And there's a lot of stories about Steve Jobs
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.640]   that maybe are not very favorable towards the CEO.
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.760]   And so Bill feels-- obviously, feels as though, well,
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:09.040]   I don't think that at some point he feels
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.440]   as though I don't think everyone's getting
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.360]   the right impression by Steve.
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:14.440]   He tells this beautiful story about how he's ran quick draw.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:17.920]   And Steve says, you know what?
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.440]   I think you should have a quick draw
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.280]   primitive for rounded rectangles.
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.280]   And then Atkins says, oh, for God's sake,
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:26.080]   tell them we're already-- like, we have no room
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.000]   for even straight lines anymore.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.440]   There's so little room in here.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.600]   And we'll never use it.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.000]   It will never get-- it will never be important.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.960]   And then Steve simply says, come on, come on with me.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:35.840]   Let's take a walk.
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.200]   And we went for a little walk.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.040]   I walked on the neighborhood.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.440]   And he showed me license plates and traffic signs
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:41.960]   and every single place in nature
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:43.880]   where you saw a rounded rectangle.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.880]   And by the time I got back, I realized, my god,
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.040]   he's absolutely right.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.920]   We absolutely have to have a rounded rectangle.
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.120]   And Joseph wanted up the story by saying, well,
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.320]   and so that's what you've got to understand that Steve
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.320]   has these insights.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.520]   And there's a reason why he is that way.
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:57.840]   And then there's an, oh, that's nice,
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:58.680]   little applause.
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.000]   Another member of the team is a, oh, I don't think you ever
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000]   told you, I'm the guy who had that walk with him a day
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.320]   before he had it used.
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:14.120]   Steve is nothing if not absolutely persistent and adamant
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.800]   and dogged in his determination.
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.200]   And he wins those arguments, I guarantee you.
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.040]   Go ahead, John.
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.640]   You were starting to say something about the source code.
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:24.040]   - Well, it's just, it just is, it really reads well.
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:26.360]   And you read all of those folklore stories
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:27.880]   that Andy Hertzfeld collected.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:29.840]   And you realize what incredible time pressure
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.040]   that that team was under to ship
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:34.840]   and how just the mountain of work they had to do.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.400]   And then you look at this source code
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.160]   and you realize that no matter what pressure they were
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.960]   on to, they were doing things the right way.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:42.240]   I mean, this was, you want to talk about maintainable code.
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:46.160]   It reads, you know, it's, and you know,
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.360]   object oriented programming.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:50.080]   I think it's, you know, you don't need object
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.040]   oriented programming in advance, you know,
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.480]   modern languages to write source code
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.760]   that is very, very logically structured
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:01.200]   and just, you know, readable.
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.040]   - Remember those--
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:02.880]   - Because he's even harder.
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.600]   I think it's a testimony to just how good these guys were
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:07.200]   that they wrote code that was as beautiful
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.360]   as the software that it produced.
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:10.400]   - And not heavily common it, as you said, Andy.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.840]   And yet, he always said it's got to be readable
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:14.680]   or it's not correct.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.240]   - Well, the assembler stuff though is,
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:21.240]   the 68K assembler is really well commented.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:25.480]   I mean, effectively the comments are like a plain English.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.040]   I think there's a lot more of the assembler
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.200]   in the quick draw stuff.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.280]   But--
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.800]   - Yeah, they're, it's interesting.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.240]   They optimized the stuff, the low level stuff in assembler.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.560]   So yeah, you had to read this.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.400]   And having written also quite a bit of 68,000 assembler,
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:39.600]   it's really fun.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.080]   Yeah, he's line by line commenting this,
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.960]   but you kind of have to an assembler.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:43.800]   - Well, you should.
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.000]   And you know, but if you read it,
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.240]   it's really, but they're really, really good comments
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.200]   in terms of if you've ever been a programmer
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:51.960]   who has to fix somebody else's code.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.080]   The comments really aren't just like,
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.960]   well, my boss told me I have to comment everything.
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.240]   It really is like a plain English version
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.680]   of what is going on.
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:01.720]   - Yep, yeah.
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.200]   And brings back great memories of things
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.720]   that you had to do in the old days
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.720]   and the director's commentary on the code.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:07.560]   - Yeah, and I've--
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.760]   - And BBEdit by the way still has syntax coloring
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.080]   for some kind of-- - I know, I know.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.320]   I have it in BBEdit at home and it was really fun to read.
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:14.320]   I'm reading it text edit.
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.160]   - It's just, yeah.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.320]   - As a matter of fact, I got a text message
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:19.840]   like after making that comment about an iPhone version
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:23.640]   of MacPaid, I got a text message from Rich Seagull
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.120]   like the head of Bearabodes.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.360]   It's like if only you knew someone
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.520]   who was writing Pascal way back then
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.880]   'cause he's one of the guys who actually wrote
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.640]   the Think Pascal compiler.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.000]   - Ah, ah.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.280]   - One of the only non-apple ways to write software
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.360]   for the original Macintosh.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.360]   - Well, I have two requests.
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:40.240]   One for Rich Seagull to port this to the iPhone.
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:42.200]   - I did up to, for him personally,
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.880]   I updated it to 20 bucks.
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.520]   (laughing)
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.240]   - And you know what, if you give Rich a really nice watch,
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.760]   he's a wristwatch fan.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:50.600]   He'll be happy.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.480]   And then there's another request
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.400]   and we'll see if this happens.
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:56.160]   And by the way, a lot of credit to Andy Hertzfeld
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:58.000]   who has kept the flame alive.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.760]   He, with folklore.org, he was the one
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:03.160]   who made the connection between Donna Dubinsky
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:05.920]   who found her palm and it was on the board
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:08.760]   at the Computer History Museum and former Apple executive.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:12.160]   She made the initial contact with Apple's general counsel
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:15.960]   and then Andy called Steve and said, "Steve, help us out."
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.320]   It was Andy who kind of pushed this, pushed this, pushed this
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:21.040]   and finally got donated to the Computer History Museum.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:25.920]   One more request, Andy, if you don't mind, hypercard.
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.240]   - Oh yeah, hypercard.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:29.160]   - Well, it's interesting though that the,
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:32.520]   I don't know what limit to which it was donated
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.240]   because it's still copyrighted by Apple.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.600]   You see, before you download it, it says,
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.720]   "Oh, by the way, this is still copyrighted software."
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.040]   So I'm not sure if you'll have the right--
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.440]   - Not for non-commercial purposes, right?
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.280]   - Yeah.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:42.640]   - It's not open sourced by any means
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.880]   and I think that's a mistake if you read it that way.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:47.280]   - I wonder if that includes, I suppose, writing it
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.360]   and then giving it away would also be commercial.
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.600]   Also, as the people who control the App Store,
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.840]   they find out pretty quickly whether we're not there,
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:56.400]   okay, with the idea of a Mac paid for it.
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:57.440]   - That's interesting, yeah.
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.280]   - For Apple.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.320]   - All right, well, then write it for Android.
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:01.240]   Ah!
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:04.080]   Oh, good, there you go.
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:08.600]   Leo made a funny, Leo made a funny, Leo is a comedian.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.440]   You can distribute it.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.440]   - You don't have to get approval.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:15.760]   See, you just asked your own question earlier.
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:18.000]   Rich likes really big expensive watches
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.200]   and unless he wants to start buying the sort of watches
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.760]   that I buy at the drugstore,
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.200]   I don't think he doesn't want to pull the package.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:25.040]   - He's not gonna do that one.
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:25.880]   - No, okay.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:26.680]   (laughs)
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:30.680]   Anyway, Andy and Bill are just geniuses.
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:32.240]   Bill, of course, is a great photographer now,
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.880]   does a lot of wonderful photography
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.600]   and that's his profession these days.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.960]   Andy seems to have made it his, among other things,
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:38.800]   he's doing a lot of stuff.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.840]   Andy's working at Google now.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.960]   But yeah, I think he's also made it his business
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.360]   to keep the flame alive and to get things like this app.
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.320]   These guys, absolute geniuses,
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.120]   and it's really great to see this
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.440]   and just have it in your collection.
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.360]   He says he had to go upstairs in the attic
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:58.400]   and find an old Lisa and it was on one of the old
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.880]   discets or something.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:02.360]   This story is kind of amazing that this could have been
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.600]   even lost, you know?
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.280]   Would be a terrible shame.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:10.840]   So I'm so grateful, thank you, Andy, for resurrecting this.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:13.200]   Quite a few other Apple stories.
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.320]   Let's do, I guess, a lightning round of stories
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.040]   'cause otherwise we're not gonna have time to get to
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.040]   everything and get to our picks of the week,
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.440]   which of course I know many of you think
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:24.360]   is the best part of this silly show.
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:27.760]   I Life 2010.
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:33.040]   Any word, John, you're pretty good on the rumor front.
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:35.520]   We're seeing on the unofficial Apple web blog
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.880]   that there's a book in Amazon, France,
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:41.840]   called "I Life 2010" for Les New,
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:44.960]   which I guess means dummies in French.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.520]   Are we gonna see in "I Life 2010"?
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:47.880]   It's been 17 months.
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.040]   - I've heard nothing.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.000]   I mean, it sounds like it's due,
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.080]   but I've heard nothing, I don't know.
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:57.520]   - I can answer to that because book companies
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.600]   and I have specific experience with Wiley
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:01.800]   will often put a book on the list
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:04.000]   and put a book in the catalogs that they don't know
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.360]   that they're gonna do yet or even that they've signed yet.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:09.160]   I was kind of unplus to find that there was
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:12.360]   a blackberry fully loaded in the book series
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.400]   because even though you've never written such a thing.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.520]   - Even though I haven't written it
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.960]   and they're supposed to run all those through things
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:21.640]   by me before and I found out that they
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:22.760]   and other companies will do that.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:25.720]   They'll simply say, Justin, it makes logical sense
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:27.400]   that there will be a "I Life 2010".
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:30.120]   Let's put that in the catalog so that all we can,
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.760]   we can just cancel it later on if we don't need it,
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:33.680]   but if we do need it, we won't have to
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:34.920]   make that sort of run.
[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:36.760]   - It's equivalent to finding an obituary
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:40.120]   for somebody who's living in the New York Times morgue.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:40.960]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:42.800]   - You know, I almost think in just thinking about it right here
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:45.320]   it almost makes more sense to me that the next version,
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.920]   even if it's announced, say, in August or September
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:48.960]   or something like that, I mean,
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.480]   and they don't really announce things in August.
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.880]   So you'd think it wouldn't be announced until September.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.240]   I think they would probably call that 2011
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:56.080]   if they're gonna be here.
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:58.120]   - Why use 2010? Absolutely, that's crazy.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.120]   - I mean, I always feel like anything that happens
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:01.320]   after July you start--
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.160]   - Right.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:04.040]   - After February, it's 2011.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.680]   - Ah, sorry, I don't know.
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:06.840]   I wouldn't read too much into that.
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.520]   - Yeah, but I wouldn't be surprised if there is.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.800]   - We're due.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:10.640]   We certainly do.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.120]   There's no question about it.
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.000]   Mysterious new Bluetooth Apple product,
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.240]   given FCC approval, the FCC on Monday
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:20.120]   listed a new device from Apple on their website,
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:25.120]   a Bluetooth trackpad, a rectangular shaped device
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:29.680]   with an FCC label on the bottom, A1339.
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:31.720]   Any thoughts?
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:35.920]   It'll be really difficult for me to not put my drink
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.320]   on top of it, so for that reason,
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:40.000]   I've got real problems with a wireless Apple device.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:40.840]   - No, and you know what?
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.240]   They have a feature for that, I believe,
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:43.360]   'cause if you look at the picture,
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.640]   it's like the wireless keyboard,
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:47.200]   so it's permanently at an angle.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.280]   There's like a little light.
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.120]   - Oh, so don't--
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.520]   - I presumably worry you put the AAA batteries
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.640]   or double AAA batteries.
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:54.520]   So it's at, it's candid, I think,
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:57.560]   that at like a 10 or 15 degree angle.
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.400]   - So if you--
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.920]   - For stopping the force, or--
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:01.360]   - Yeah, well no, it's a guarantee
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.600]   that if you put a drink on it, it will spill.
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:04.440]   - Right.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:05.800]   - So that's kind of what--
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.360]   - That's what we're looking for.
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.200]   - I heard about this a year ago.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:12.000]   - If it's real, I actually put it in my snarky headline,
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.080]   like a thing where, I don't know,
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.240]   fig Steve Jobs had a thing about,
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.640]   it was like a rumor of Apple stuff coming the next day
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.320]   that I had actually heard about all of it,
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.200]   and he had like a thing like,
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.520]   Gruber doesn't even know about it,
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.520]   and so I broke.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.360]   (laughing)
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:28.320]   - The N-line is things you truly doesn't know about,
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.120]   and this is all in the headline,
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.480]   whatever it was, a new iMac,
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.080]   and this and that, and this and that,
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:36.120]   and maybe even the only mention,
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:39.000]   mention nowhere else other than in this very headline,
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   a mysterious standalone touchpad for desktop Macs,
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.080]   that I'm not even sure I believe myself.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.680]   - And even, you know, the bamboo's great,
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.000]   I don't know if there's any demand for this or not,
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.160]   but you know, it's a interesting thing.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:54.640]   It does give them like sort of a gateway
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:56.880]   to putting multi-touch on the Mac OS.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:57.720]   - Right.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:00.600]   - But we don't know whether that's just simply an idea of,
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:03.240]   gee, you know, it seems like a really interesting device
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:04.960]   to have, and it wouldn't cost us that much to make,
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:06.800]   so let's make it as opposed to,
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.640]   we're gonna start to make the next version of Mac OS
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:11.240]   a lot more gesture dependent,
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:13.040]   and this would be a good way to get them on the desktop.
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.800]   So some rumors, interesting thing.
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:17.440]   - Some rumors that the HP tablet,
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:20.320]   which will obviously run WebOS if they ever release it,
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:23.680]   will support, have a Wacom digitizer built into the screen,
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:27.200]   so it'll support a stylus as well as touch.
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.040]   - You think that's a good thing?
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.280]   - Does the HP or was that the Palm?
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.360]   I thought that was the Palm.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:31.400]   - Are you sure it was the HP?
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.440]   - Well, Palm, HP owns Palm, they're the same now, so.
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:35.260]   - Oh, that's right.
[01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:36.100]   - You mean the Dell?
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:37.120]   - Oh, all right, yeah, it was the Palm,
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:39.440]   or whatever you'd call it.
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.400]   It's probably not gonna use, I don't know,
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:42.840]   do you think HP will use the name Palm?
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.560]   I don't know, it doesn't seem like,
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:45.400]   it seems like not.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.240]   - I don't know, but didn't they say
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.360]   that they were gonna call it the Palm Pad,
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.440]   or was that something somebody made up?
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:49.280]   - That was somebody who made it up.
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:50.600]   They said, "Until we have a better name,
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:51.440]   we'll call it the Palm Pad."
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.560]   I think it was a way to-- - Oh, it sounds like a great feature.
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.320]   I know there's a lot of artists' types
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:57.120]   who really wish that the iPad had--
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.040]   - That silly capacity, it's pen, it's hard.
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.680]   It's like writing with a cotton ball.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:03.480]   It's just-- - Well, I use it.
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:06.400]   - But it's one of those features
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:07.880]   where it would make it a lot more awesome,
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:09.520]   but it would also make it a lot more expensive.
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:10.520]   - Well, that's the question, yeah.
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:11.360]   - I'm not sure.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:14.760]   I think that even HP is gonna be of the mindset
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:18.400]   that we have a hard top of 500 bucks for this pad,
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.160]   and we don't wanna hit 500 bucks.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:22.760]   We'll do it if we have to, but we want 399.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.360]   And I think that a pressure sensitive
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.600]   or even a stylus sensitive top
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.800]   will be really the first thing to go off the whiteboard.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:31.800]   - It's an interesting thing,
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:33.080]   because it opens new markets
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.680]   because of people who, you know, in medicine and so forth,
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.120]   wanna have handwriting recognition
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.680]   or have note-taking, that kind of thing.
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:40.520]   So-- - Like one thing
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:43.880]   that's really different about this whole mobile market,
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.640]   not just the iPhone and the iPad,
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:47.360]   but with the Android devices,
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.680]   and this whole sort of, you know,
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:52.720]   if you wanna call it the post-PC computer industry,
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:56.000]   is a very, very conscious, obviously everybody,
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.080]   that not just Apple, everybody seems focused
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:01.120]   on low, low price points, right?
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:02.720]   It's not like computers at all.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.720]   Like in the PC industry, you've always been able to go high-end,
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:06.920]   you know, and buy a computer
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:08.600]   that a typical person would never buy.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:12.240]   I mean, like a Mac Pro with a 30-inch sentiment display,
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.920]   most people would think, well, that's, you know,
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:16.360]   I should buy 20 computers for that much money.
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.920]   And in the old days, if you wanna go all the way back to,
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.280]   you know, talking about that source code
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:22.400]   that was released in the '80s,
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:23.600]   I mean, you could buy stuff like that.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.560]   It wasn't the Mac 2FX, like a $14,000--
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.080]   - Hugely expensive, yeah.
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.080]   - I mean, it was like-- - Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.360]   - For two freaking expensive was what is stood for.
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.200]   - But you could do that.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:37.200]   So like imagine if Apple made a $1,500 iPad,
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.680]   or, you know, if you wanted to, if they had like a separate,
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.200]   you know, here's the $500, $600, $700 model.
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:43.680]   And by the way, if you want to,
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.440]   here's one that's $2,000, you know,
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:47.280]   they make MacBooks for $2,000.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:50.800]   And you could, maybe we'd already have like a retinid display,
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.800]   you know, pixel size and--
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:53.720]   - That's what I wanna see.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:56.080]   I wanna see an iPad with that kind of resolution.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:56.920]   That would be exciting.
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:58.960]   - But that's obviously, the industry has obviously decided
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:01.800]   that that's really just not a profitable way to go
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:02.840]   with these devices, you know.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:04.200]   - They want them to be cheap.
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.040]   - Right, yeah. - Now Lenovo's
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:08.680]   gonna be shipping its pad they've announced now.
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:12.920]   And I imagine Lenovo, given the business focus,
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.040]   is able to charge a little bit more.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:18.480]   They're gonna call it the pad.
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.840]   Nah, not a great name.
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:23.040]   By the end of the year, you wrote in a day like,
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:27.920]   during Fireball about all these pads coming out now,
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:29.680]   like January of next year.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:33.840]   But I think there's, we were waiting for the other shoe
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:36.960]   to drop, a lot of companies wanna put out pads,
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.000]   remains to be seen whether they can compete with the iPad.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.160]   It took about two or three years before
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.920]   we saw a real competition for the iPhone.
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:45.320]   I wouldn't be surprised if it takes that long
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.760]   on the iPad.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.720]   - And I think that actually Android is lost ground.
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:51.640]   And a lot of pad makers are gonna start
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:54.040]   to really rethink their Android based devices
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:57.600]   because HP buying Palm totally upset the table.
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.640]   It just took one of those legs right under the table.
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:01.120]   - You're right.
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.840]   - My position on Android has always been
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:05.680]   that an Android tablet would be a lot like an Android phone
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:08.560]   in that it'll be functional, it'll be very useful,
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.960]   it'll be less expensive, it will be more open
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:13.160]   to software and to hardware expansion.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:16.600]   But it won't be as easy to use or as attractive
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.840]   in the large sense of the world as an iPad.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:23.560]   WebOS, which I really didn't like on the Palm pre,
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:24.680]   the only reason why I didn't like it was
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:25.800]   'cause I didn't like the hardware.
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.280]   - You didn't like the bit of hardware, yeah.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.120]   - Right.
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:29.000]   - And when you put that on a tablet,
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.080]   the more I look at it, the more I think about it,
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:33.240]   the more I think I am really itching to see
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.200]   what they're gonna do, what HP is gonna do
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.680]   with a tablet form factor webOS device.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:41.040]   So I think that a lot, I really think that's the second time
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:44.920]   that makers of these Nvidia 2-based, Android 2.2-based
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:47.560]   tablets have had to really take four steps back,
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:49.000]   take another look at that big web board,
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.400]   the conference room and figure out
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.120]   what the smartest way to do this is gonna be.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.240]   Number one was when Apple decided to sell their pad
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:58.360]   for 500 bucks and now that HP, the biggest manufacturer
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:00.920]   of consumer computing devices in the world,
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:04.600]   is has a really, with one stroke by writing one check,
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:07.000]   suddenly has the only operating system
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.880]   that I think can really compare with iOS
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:11.200]   and a tablet or a phone form factor.
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:14.440]   That's definitely took them into wait and see position.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.440]   - And I definitely think HP has a much better opportunity.
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:20.120]   I hope they don't, I certainly hope that HP
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:22.040]   is not out of the phone game,
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:25.400]   that they're gonna come back with a new round of phones too,
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:28.080]   but it's in the iPad competitive sense
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.520]   where they have a unique opportunity
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:33.880]   to step into a market where there's only Apple right now.
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.160]   - I think you guys are though really ignoring a key element
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:38.720]   which is that developers did not flock to webOS
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:40.680]   and there's a dearth of applications for it.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:43.640]   You got close to 100,000 apps now on Android,
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:45.480]   quarter of a million plus on iPhone
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:47.840]   and what is it, 1000 for webOS?
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:48.840]   - That's important.
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:52.000]   - Okay, but webOS has had one device that flunked almost.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.080]   - No, I understand, but you're coming out of the gate
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:55.240]   with nothing.
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:31:00.240]   - Yeah, but it doesn't, I absolutely see your point.
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:03.160]   WebOS has to be seen as a brand new thing
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.960]   without even the legacy of the previous years
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:05.960]   worth of development.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:09.800]   But I think that the person who wants to do a Twitter client
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:13.720]   for iOS, but realizes that there are 40 iPhone,
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.120]   there are 40 Twitter clients on it
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:17.120]   and there are 30 word processors now
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.880]   and there are 20 different photo apps.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.440]   I think there might be some interest in saying,
[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:23.080]   "Let's be the first company, first people to write
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:24.720]   "the definitive photo editor,
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:28.960]   "the definitive Twitter client for this webOS-based HP device,
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:32.160]   "especially with HP putting so much muscle behind this."
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:35.000]   - I'll tell you what the answer is.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.720]   WebOS is the BOS of the future.
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:38.760]   (laughing)
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.600]   Android is the windows of the future
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:42.680]   and iOS is the Macintosh of the future.
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:45.720]   You're gonna see a huge market share go to Android
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:50.040]   and Google-based phones, literally 80 or 90%.
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.520]   There's still gonna be the people like you
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:53.520]   who want this fancy iPhone.
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:54.360]   (laughing)
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.600]   And I think that webOS is a BOS.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.800]   - Okay, now, when you go, I'm sorry.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:01.160]   At that point I have to say Leo.
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:02.160]   - No, no, it looks antiquated.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.160]   I'm serious, it looks antiquated.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.400]   - I'm feeling some smell as coffee.
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:07.000]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.480]   I'm sorry, I have to say this is looking antiquated.
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:12.720]   I think Apple is falling,
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:15.000]   falling by the wayside rapidly.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.120]   - I put four looking antiquated.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:17.960]   Oh, my, oh.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.520]   (laughing)
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:21.760]   - You don't know how much time I spent
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.720]   setting up lights and microphones.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.160]   What does the ear use say that you think the iPhone 4
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:27.000]   is an antiquated?
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.800]   - I'll give you three bases.
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:33.240]   Notifications on the iPhone still subpar for everybody.
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:35.240]   What are they thinking?
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:37.800]   I do believe the lack of widgets on the screen
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:38.640]   is hurting them.
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:41.600]   I think this is archaic to have just this stack of icons.
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:42.920]   Yeah, you added folders.
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:46.320]   Okay, finally, multitasking, I'm sorry,
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.240]   this is not good multitasking on the iPhone.
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:49.840]   They blew it totally multitasking.
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:53.040]   And finally, things like Google Voice Integration on Android
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.720]   put it way ahead of the iPhone.
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:58.240]   - All right, let's take them backwards.
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:00.560]   - We don't have to analyze it.
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:01.960]   - But I think they're-- - If you want to, we can.
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:02.800]   All right, go ahead.
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:04.400]   - Interesting theory, just to throw it out there
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:05.600]   on the Google Voice, right?
[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:08.720]   Now, number one, I think it's,
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:10.360]   I don't think anybody would really argue
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:13.080]   that there's like a pissing match going on
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:17.440]   between Apple and Google about Android.
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.640]   Not Apple and Google overall, and in fact--
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.000]   - Oh, that's interesting, isn't it?
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:21.840]   - Yeah.
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:24.440]   - He said, you know, about kicking a company when they're up,
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:25.600]   you know, and trying to rip them down.
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.520]   And he was like, look at what they're,
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:27.840]   I see what people are doing to Google.
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.200]   Google is a fantastic company.
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:30.040]   They're a great company.
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:31.440]   Why are people trying to tear them down?
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.880]   It's great thing to say about Google.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:35.840]   But Android in particular is, you know,
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:37.240]   clearly there's contention there.
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:39.200]   And so I think that you could just say, look,
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:41.600]   the reason Apple doesn't want good Google Voice integration
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.360]   on the iPhone is that they just don't want
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.640]   Google phone stuff on the iPhone.
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:47.040]   But here's another idea.
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.920]   Google or Google Voice doesn't work with FaceTime.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.800]   People who, you know, are trying to use FaceTime
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.400]   and they give their Google Voice number out,
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.440]   it doesn't work.
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:59.200]   So what if that's part of the reason why they didn't do this
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.200]   is that, you know, and you can say again,
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.880]   I'm also, by the way, FaceTime Denier,
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:05.480]   as long as we're talking about it.
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:06.760]   Well, Apple obviously isn't.
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:09.440]   Though Apple obviously sees it as the primary selling feature
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:10.440]   of the device.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.280]   It defines me.
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:12.360]   Do you see a lot of people using FaceTime?
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:13.720]   I haven't seen anybody use FaceTime.
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.720]   I would use it.
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:17.600]   I would use it every time I travel with my wife already
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:18.800]   had the iPhone 4.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:19.880]   Absolutely.
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:20.880]   You use it, Andy, what?
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:21.840]   You use it?
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:24.000]   I've used it more often than I thought I would.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.800]   I don't think that the iPhone, that FaceTime becomes a replacement
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:30.840]   for text messaging, email, regular voice calls.
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:34.200]   I think it becomes important that two really important people
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:37.120]   in your life have devices that can support FaceTime
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:39.600]   and then you become the biggest fan in the world.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.960]   What will I use this?
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:43.800]   Just wait until the new iPods come out this fall
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:44.640]   that have front-face.
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:47.200]   I think if Apple supports an open stack,
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:50.400]   as they claim they are and others can write FaceTime applications
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:52.800]   and more phones have front-facing cameras, perhaps.
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:53.640]   Perhaps.
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:55.880]   That's what happens when you're a college student
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:57.360]   and you have this new iPod touch
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.400]   and you live your whole life on a college campus
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:00.920]   with you, be good as Wi-Fi.
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:01.760]   Well, we'll see.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:05.320]   My daughter's going to college with an iPhone 4, so we'll see.
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:06.320]   Oh, you wait and see.
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.320]   So what was the one--
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:08.720]   And then the first time the iPhone 4--
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:11.520]   she shows you her new boyfriend and their so in love
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.560]   and they're getting married and Leo's crying and Leo's--
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:16.240]   You watch too many Apple ads, Andy.
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:16.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:19.920]   And then they'll have a child that you'll see his first steps
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:22.520]   and then you'll buy four more iPhones, iPhone 4s,
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:25.000]   and give them to your phone.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:25.840]   It'll kind of you.
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.280]   It'll take a star movie.
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:29.480]   There's a scene that just makes you think.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.720]   You like the multitasking.
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:31.240]   I love it.
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:31.920]   I think it's great.
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.360]   But I think the reason you don't like it
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.320]   is that it's not at all PC multitasking.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.160]   Because it's not real multitasking.
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.200]   Android is sort of evolving in the direction
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.600]   of being a better PC than one of those.
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.960]   That's why I really think that the Android--
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:46.480]   That's why I think there's that analogy is very close,
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:49.680]   that Android is Windows and iOS 4 is Macintosh.
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.160]   And if you go--
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:52.640]   It's been back 10 years.
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.600]   And Apple, by the way, seeded its lead with the Macintosh
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:01.200]   and let Microsoft steal its thunder back in 1995.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.640]   And I think the same thing has actually
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:03.920]   started to happen right now.
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:07.240]   Android phones are way outselling iPhones.
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:09.320]   Well, I do agree with you that I think
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:11.560]   that there's going to be an else and an inevitable point
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:14.320]   in which there are more Android phones--
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:16.560]   Android phones out in the field than iPhones, if that hasn't--
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:17.280]   We already crossed it.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:19.520]   No, no, we already crossed that point a long ago.
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:24.440]   I mean, but only because of overwhelming--
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.400]   Well, yeah, you're going to become
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:27.960]   just like we were--
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:31.720]   We Apple fanatics in the late '80s, early '90s saying,
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:34.640]   well, yeah, we're the minority, but we're the best.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:35.760]   I think that there's--
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:37.160]   It's up for the beta weather.
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:38.800]   And that's talking-- you're talking unit sales.
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:40.720]   I think it's very much still up for debate
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:47.160]   whether there's going to be a cohesive developer
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:53.160]   target for Android users that is bigger than the iOS market.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:54.240]   Because I think--
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:56.800]   And it's not that I think Android is too--
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:59.880]   what's the word that everybody keeps saying fractured or--
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:00.680]   Fragmented.
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:00.840]   Yeah.
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:01.720]   Fragmented.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:02.720]   But it is fragmented.
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.920]   And it is debated over screen sizes and stuff like that.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.400]   And so--
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:10.000]   Although we see fragmentation in the iOS market as well
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.240]   with the iPad and the iOS.
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:13.920]   I think that's a real difference in the Windows
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:19.080]   to Mac versus Android to iPhone analogy,
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:23.560]   is that a PC running Windows really
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:24.920]   is a PC running Windows.
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:28.120]   I mean, if you wrote something for Windows version blank,
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:29.920]   it's probably going to run on any computer
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:32.040]   with that version of Windows.
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:36.600]   Whereas I don't know how cohesive it is for Android to work.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:40.640]   Currently, you don't-- the only issue is screen resolution.
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:41.080]   And that's--
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:42.000]   Well, there's other--
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.200]   And there's other things too, though.
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.000]   I mean, we could go on and on about it.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.920]   But I also think, for example, there's a really good reason
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.160]   why you don't see a lot of good Android games.
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:53.200]   And that's the drawing model on Android at the OS.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:55.320]   The OS level is really not that good.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.960]   Now, on the other end, Microsoft--
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.800]   Microsoft, say what you want about their user interface
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:01.520]   design, right?
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.880]   I could, you know, we could really give it to them on that.
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:06.720]   But when it comes to technically to drawing really
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:09.320]   fast on screen, Microsoft has always
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:13.000]   had excellent, excellent drawing support and graphic support.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.080]   And Windows mobile might prove to be a dark horse in this.
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:16.400]   Right.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:20.280]   I think Windows Phone 7, if they have something up their sleeve,
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.360]   if their best chance, I think is to roll out
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:23.360]   with some killer games--
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:24.040]   Great games.
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:26.200]   --and I phone caliber games for this.
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:27.560]   And I've talked to developers.
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:30.240]   I can't say who, but I've talked to iPhone developers
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.520]   who've considered porting games to Android.
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:34.080]   And it really is a technical problem
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:37.000]   that, like the OpenGL stuff and how fast you can just slam
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.040]   pixels to the screen.
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.480]   It's a real problem on Android.
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.080]   And Windows never had that.
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:45.480]   And in fact, it was the opposite, where games were and still
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:48.600]   are better on Windows than they are on the Mac,
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:49.560]   at a technically level.
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:54.840]   Not just in terms of developers going to where the market is.
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:56.040]   And I think games for these things,
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:57.480]   it's a huge, huge business.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.160]   That is probably the only thing that
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:02.160]   is the kind of a flip flop of the Windows Mac thing, isn't it?
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:08.000]   It is the thing where the games are much, much better on the Mac.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.640]   I think it's interesting, though, that Android really
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:12.440]   isn't a brand on any of these phones.
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:16.120]   Because if I put three Android phones side by side by side,
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:18.840]   I can't tell you that the HTC Incredible
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:23.320]   is the same experience as the Droid X, which is the same experience
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.800]   as HTC Evo.
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.840]   Because every single carrier will outfit it
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:29.560]   with a different set of a different build
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:32.400]   and a different set of widgets and a different layout of icons.
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:34.320]   I think that's very comparable to the PC market,
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.760]   where you have different--
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:38.560]   But I don't know if that's so very different.
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:42.400]   Well, they all say power by Google on them.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.760]   In the case of the Droid X--
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:47.040]   It really is a case of it being a very, very different kind
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:47.560]   of phone.
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:49.840]   In terms of reliability and usability.
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:52.680]   You know, every single--
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:54.360]   As I'm preparing the Droid X review,
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:57.560]   I'm thinking that I really have to say that step one of any new Android
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:02.360]   phone is delete every shortcut and every widget that comes pre-installed on it.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:06.480]   Add it back in later on from the home page if you really want to use it.
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:09.600]   But that makes it instantly more usable and more clear.
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.120]   I think it's actually the Droid X. We're actually going to flip three pages
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:17.280]   before I found the browser button, a shortcut to the browser.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:22.560]   And you compare that to a Froyo 2.2, where there are three buttons on the screen.
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:26.720]   Button one for a phone call, button two for the application stock,
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.000]   and button three for the browser.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.560]   And so am I going to tell people that the hardware is great,
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:36.400]   but you have to start by downloading and reinstalling 2.2 from this pirate site,
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:41.400]   because it's not available yet, but from the manufacturer for this device yet?
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:42.640]   I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention.
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:45.400]   I'm playing Need for Speed on my Android phone.
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:48.680]   I understand you're waiting a while for it to boot up and stuff like that, yes.
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:50.240]   It's about the same as on the iPad.
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:52.600]   Actually, it looks pretty much about as good as on the iPad.
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:54.040]   Seems pretty responsive, boy.
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:55.880]   This is such a crappy gaming platform.
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:58.680]   I just can't understand why anybody would buy this.
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:04.160]   I mean, maybe we'll see how many games show up for it by...
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:05.120]   Well, it is a big deal.
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:06.080]   I agree with you, John.
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:06.560]   No, no.
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:09.200]   And when you said that, it really hit home because it's true.
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:11.000]   There are not any good games.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.200]   I don't know if it's a structural problem or if it's...
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:18.560]   Something else, because I mean, I've cracked my windshield shoot.
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:21.760]   But here, this game is running at a...
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:24.000]   Maybe it's just that it was the early phones were underpowered?
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000]   I don't know.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.840]   But this is EA has made a very good port of Need for Speed
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:31.280]   that plays absolutely as well as it does on the iPhone.
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:33.320]   In fact, maybe better.
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:36.280]   Also, it should be said that phones are different from desktop machines.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:38.720]   People don't necessarily need to have 20,000 apps.
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:41.000]   They just want to find the six that they want.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:41.400]   Right.
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:45.600]   So it's not necessary just because the iPhone has more applications available for it.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.680]   Well, by the time you've got 100,000, you presumably have the choices that people want.
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:50.320]   Except for gaming.
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.600]   I'd say there is a dearth of good games on the...
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.960]   The disappointment for me on Android is that I will...
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:58.840]   On the iPhone, I will find almost exactly the application that I want
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:01.480]   from the 7, 8 or 9 professional apps that are available.
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:04.560]   With Android, there are two and need of them are very good.
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:07.240]   But this one is a little bit less, not very good than the other.
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:08.800]   So, okay, I'll follow by this one.
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:16.800]   First message I just got from a friend of mine who is listening live and a developer of one
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:21.440]   of the developers of very popular iPhone games.
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:23.520]   Not going to say it, but trust me.
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:29.160]   So he says about Android, "Buggie GL hardware and drivers make Android a bitch to target.
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.160]   That makes sense.
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:31.160]   Each phone has different bugs."
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:31.680]   Yeah.
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:34.720]   I mean, so there is sort of a fragmentation in there.
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:36.880]   And it gets to the point where the iPhone...
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:45.720]   I keep saying the best way to think of the iPhone or the whole iOS is as an app console.
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:51.880]   That what like the stuff that Nintendo makes as a game console, the iPhone sort of...
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:55.640]   A whole iOS sort of abstracts that out to the app level.
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:58.200]   Part of the apps are games, but it could be all sorts of other things.
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:03.080]   But that it's run the way that the console makers run their stuff in terms of everything
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:10.240]   from the control over the software and approval to the limited number of hardware references
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.120]   for developers to target.
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:18.000]   Whereas Android is evolving much more like a pocket-sized PC.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000]   And that's...
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000]   It has...
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000]   Both sides have...
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.560]   They're absolutely advantages and disadvantages to both.
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:28.680]   But I think that for game developers, the similarity of the iOS to game platforms is
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:29.680]   a huge win.
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:31.480]   Always easier to develop for one.
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:32.480]   For sure.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:36.120]   Amazon Kindle sales continue to rise every month in Q2.
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:38.560]   Amazon had a great...
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:42.560]   A surprisingly good quarter for Kindle.
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:44.400]   Perhaps because they dropped the prices.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:50.840]   They also for the first time yesterday sold more Kindle books than hardcoverbooks on Amazon.com.
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:52.880]   I think we thought maybe the iPad would hurt the Kindle.
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.800]   It doesn't seem to have.
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:55.800]   Right.
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:00.520]   Well, while the iPhone and the iPad are available to the Kindle marketplace.
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:01.520]   So that's not...
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:04.120]   If anything, it would have helped sales.
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:07.080]   It's an interesting statistic because they don't mention all books.
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:09.080]   They simply mention hardcoverbooks.
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:13.760]   So those are just that segment of new releases that have come out the past few weeks.
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:14.760]   They're being sold at the console.
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:16.480]   I think there are a lot of people who still want a Kindle.
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:17.480]   They may even have an iPad.
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:20.880]   My wife has an iPad but likes the Kindle for its lightness.
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:21.880]   Absolutely.
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:23.200]   And that price is a killer.
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:24.880]   That's exactly the price that should be.
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:28.000]   It needs to be not just under 200 but significantly enough.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.040]   Under 200 that doesn't feel like you're spending 200 for it.
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:32.040]   Is it a Kindle, John?
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:33.160]   No, I do not.
[01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:34.680]   But it's funny because...
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:38.720]   And the thing that always turned me off about it was the refresh between pages.
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:39.960]   And it still really would.
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:42.720]   But I was always an e-booked outer.
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:47.760]   I mean, just for me personally, I just really never thought that I would enjoy e-books enough.
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:49.760]   I mean, because I just love the way a real book looks.
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:50.760]   And I still do.
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:53.280]   Even now that I have the iPad and I've read a ton of e-books.
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:55.920]   But I will say that the convenience has simply won out.
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:58.840]   I mean, it's just so convenient that I do.
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:05.640]   And I honestly could think I've read more books since I got my iPad total than any...
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:06.640]   What is it?
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:07.640]   Three-month stretch?
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:08.640]   Whatever month stretch that is.
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.160]   Since I got on the internet.
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:11.160]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:16.720]   I think the key phrase is if you love books, you're not going to be happy with a Kindle.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:20.280]   If you love reading, you're going to be ecstatically happy with a Kindle or an iPad.
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:21.280]   Good fact.
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:26.720]   So if I went back in time now to before the iPad and the Kindle just came out, I guess
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:31.520]   I would buy one in hindsight because I know that I would use it.
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:32.520]   And I do think...
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:34.040]   I think the hardware is getting smarter.
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:39.200]   I think switching to dark plastic, which they've done for the new DX model, is obviously smart.
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:42.400]   Because one of the problems they made, one of the big mistakes they made with the first
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:47.120]   ones, was they made the plastic lighter than the screen.
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:49.920]   So it only served to emphasize that the screen wasn't really white.
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:54.440]   Now that they've shifted to this dark plastic, it makes the screen, which still isn't white,
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:56.980]   more like it's white.
[01:45:56.980 --> 01:45:59.800]   I just think they're getting a little bit smarter.
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:03.320]   The digital entertainment content ecosystem.
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:04.320]   D.E.S.
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:06.400]   What a terrible name.
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.720]   Those boys know how to market the consumers.
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:09.720]   D.E.C.
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:11.520]   I don't smell success all over this acronym.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:13.580]   They're clearly not marketing the consumers.
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:16.920]   They're marketing to the people who make digital content because they don't want consumers
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:20.160]   to pay attention to the fact that there is a new DRM in town.
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:22.760]   It's called ultra-violet.
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:27.040]   And it does answer one thing consumers want, which is the ability to buy content once and
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:28.760]   put it on a variety of devices.
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:34.280]   If they can get everybody to go along and they have 60 entertainment companies on board,
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:37.640]   you'll be able to buy it once and use it on a variety of platforms.
[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:42.320]   Unfortunately, despite getting companies like Paramount Pictures, Warner Brothers, Sony,
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:47.560]   Comcast, Netflix and Microsoft, no Disney and no Apple.
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:49.560]   Is that the nail in the coffin for ultra-violet?
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:51.400]   Yeah, pretty much.
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:53.080]   It's an interesting idea.
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:58.400]   Not only is it's DRM, yes, but the big idea is that you sort of have a central storage
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:02.120]   house for who owns what and who has permission to do what.
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:06.800]   So the idea is not only designed to foster purchase of digital content, but also hopefully
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:10.960]   to encourage people to get back out there and buy more Blu-ray discs and buy more DVDs
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:16.680]   because part of this system is that if you buy the DVD and take it home through some mojo,
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:20.840]   you'll be able to essentially, it's under this DRM register that, oh, by the way, that
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:25.480]   guy has actually purchased a $20 DVD of this movie and therefore he should have access
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:27.800]   to digital copies of this wherever he goes.
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:32.800]   So on that basis, it's kind of cool and kind of consumer-y and okay, that's interesting,
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:36.040]   but I really, you know how this will play out.
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:40.200]   You know that there will be software updates every three days because some kid in Belgium
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:45.960]   found out how to break a Jean-Claude Vanda movie from 10 years ago.
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.080]   So basically it will be just three days of every single time you boot up, they'll be
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:52.840]   saying, "I'm sorry I can't play this content because your DRM signature is out of date,
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:58.680]   contact this website and update your keys and it's just not going to work."
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.680]   So much for ultraviolet.
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:02.840]   We just buried it and it just got, was born.
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:06.080]   I'm glad I have that power.
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:07.440]   No white iPhones yet.
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:11.400]   Apparently they can't get them white enough.
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:17.280]   According to industry sources and in gadget, the company that's making these white iPhones
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:22.760]   lens can only meet about half of Apple's demand and Apple won't sell the white iPhone
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:27.520]   until they can get them up to spec.
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:32.320]   They were hoping for a white iPhone before now.
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.360]   I'm not sure when the white iPhone will be available.
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:36.720]   Does anybody really want a white iPhone?
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:37.720]   Oh, definitely.
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:38.720]   My wife's waiting for one.
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:40.120]   Oh, it's a, I know a lot of people.
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:42.020]   Is it girls?
[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:44.440]   I know some guys who are waiting for a white iPhone.
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:45.440]   They look very great.
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:46.440]   You know, I saw a few of them on campus.
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:49.240]   I saw them on my mom when I was there for the press event on Friday.
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:52.560]   They're all the place at Apple and people at Apple have them.
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:53.560]   And they look great.
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:54.560]   You know what they look like?
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:55.560]   They look a lot to me.
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.560]   They look like the old iPods back from the...
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:58.560]   Oh, okay.
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:48:59.560]   Now I understand the appeal.
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:00.560]   It's like an iPod.
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:05.560]   The thing that I never liked, I mean, I always just, whenever I'm buying anything, a shirt,
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:09.400]   a car, a phone, anything, I just pick black and that way I don't have to worry about it.
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:10.400]   You're a guy.
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:11.400]   Yeah, we want girls to know.
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:15.320]   I just, I picked like 15 years ago black is my color and if I can get it in black, I
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:16.320]   get it in black.
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:17.320]   All right.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:18.320]   You don't have to match it with anything.
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:20.720]   Of course, I'm the guy wearing a pink shirt right now.
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:21.720]   So I...
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:26.680]   The thing I never liked about the white iPhones, the 3G and the 3GS is that the front was black.
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:30.080]   And I always thought that just looked like they took half of a, you know, almost looked
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:33.240]   like something that you'd buy like third party, you know, like take your black iPhone
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:34.480]   and turn it into a white back.
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:36.160]   Well, it's this front I think that's hard to make.
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:37.160]   They could make the backs very easily.
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:38.160]   It's just a piece of glass.
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:39.880]   It's this front that's so different.
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:42.760]   But you look at the, you look at these, the people walking around with these white ones.
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:48.680]   And I saw them at the press event when, you know, WWDC too, really, really looks like,
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:53.840]   to me it just feels like a really, really thin futuristic iPod, you know, from, from
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:54.840]   10 years ago.
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:50:00.520]   And it's a really, I think it's a very, very nice, uh, uh, feel to it.
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:04.360]   One thing I will say is I think this, the design of the iPhone 4 is gorgeous, uh, best
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:05.360]   they've ever done.
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:06.360]   And so...
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:07.360]   What happens?
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:08.600]   Here's the thing I, one of the things I'm, I'm thinking about.
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:11.280]   I mean, who knows if this report about the paint stuff is true?
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:13.000]   Sounds like that could be the hold up.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000]   Sounds, sounds plausible.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000]   Right.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.000]   What if the, what if these white ones come out and you put your finger on the spot and
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.800]   there's no nothing happens?
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:24.360]   Oh, maybe that's what they're waiting for.
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:29.000]   September 30th is the end of this case giveaway and I asked Steve about that and he said,
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.920]   well, we just, we want to keep our options open.
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:35.560]   But it did kind of imply that maybe we could, I don't know, anodize the steel, for instance,
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:36.920]   and, and solve the problem.
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:39.960]   And maybe I'm sure right now they're trying all sorts of things.
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:43.080]   There's a lot of ways to read into that and I thought that that was in just another angle
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:46.280]   where it was like just not, not out.
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:48.920]   You know, I don't think they were, I think that you could tell that they'd rush that
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:49.920]   whole thing.
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:51.640]   Yeah, they left too many loose ends.
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:55.520]   Yeah, that whole explanation of the 30, September 30th deadline.
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:59.640]   So obviously a lot of people are reading into that thinking, uh, that, that what he said
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:04.000]   was that by, by September or by October 1st that they're going to have this problem
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.960]   like that phones running off their production line are not going to have the problem.
[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:12.440]   The other way I thought to read into it is just to go back to all the money they want
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:16.320]   to make from selling these bumpers and that maybe if everybody is shut up, shut up by
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:18.880]   then, then for Christmas, then for them.
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:23.480]   Right, for the Christmas buying season, which will start around October, that they can go
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:25.320]   back to making money from these bumpers.
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:28.520]   I think Steve Jobs wants that bumper money.
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:30.600]   I think he really wants it.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:32.960]   You know, that's why that, so why September 30th?
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:37.280]   I think because October is when people start buying Christmas iPhones and if, and if everybody
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:41.280]   is shut up by about it by then and they can go back to selling them for 29 bucks, then
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:43.880]   he gets his, he gets his hundred million dollars in bumper money.
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:47.280]   I think that's about, I think that's about the time the back to school buyers stop buying
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:48.680]   things for back to school.
[01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:50.320]   I think it's just an arbitrary date.
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:53.920]   At that point, they'll either decide that it's no longer perceived as an issue and then
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:57.920]   need to extend the program or that they will have found a software fix for the problem or
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:51:59.440]   hardware fix the problem.
[01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:01.720]   I think that's just to say, let's not leave it open ended.
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:05.600]   Let's just make sure that we're going to say that on and maybe on September 25th, we'll
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:08.400]   say, okay, by the way, we'll extend that to the end of the year.
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:10.000]   Of course, then that starts the whole thing up.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.360]   Oh, Apple hasn't solved the problem.
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:12.800]   They still have the problem.
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:14.200]   So there does kind of put them on the spot.
[01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:15.960]   I, here's my conspiracy theory.
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:17.160]   Apple left all these loose ends.
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:20.760]   So we'd stop worrying about the antenna and start thinking about, oh, I wonder what is
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:21.760]   going on there.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:29.680]   921, Apple's iTunes 921 came out today, a maintenance update, a number of bug fixes,
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:30.760]   nothing to read into that.
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:32.120]   I don't think.
[01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:35.040]   File maker go.
[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:38.880]   I don't want to steal anybody's pick, so I won't go on too long, but we'll allow you
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:41.600]   to run file maker databases on your iPad and iPhone.
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:42.600]   I like bento a lot.
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:46.520]   I think that's a good choice for people who don't need more complicated databases.
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:48.920]   Another app store, really?
[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:49.920]   Yeah.
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:50.920]   Because it is, isn't it?
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:52.120]   A file maker app store.
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:53.120]   You're right.
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:54.120]   I didn't even think of that.
[01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:57.200]   Because there's a ton of file maker apps.
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:58.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:01.440]   PC World Yanks, the iPhone 4 from the top spot and smartphone chart.
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:03.000]   I don't know what that means.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.240]   It's kind of like the Consumer Reports thing.
[01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:08.280]   Hey, how come they're getting all the page views?
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:10.480]   We want to be on the Today Show, too.
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:12.200]   We got that tape, too.
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:13.600]   There is somebody on Etsy selling.
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:15.160]   I think this might be a good product.
[01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:17.360]   The iPhone Band-Aid.
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:22.600]   It goes right on the bottom there in six beautiful designer colors.
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:23.680]   And it's kind of cheap.
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:27.160]   It's only $4.99 for a six pack.
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:31.000]   But it did make me think, though, can you think about all the different case manufacturers
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:35.280]   that are going to be really cheesed off now because they've probably invested a lot of
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:38.260]   money in tooling up to design these new cases.
[01:53:38.260 --> 01:53:41.560]   Now they know that nobody's going to want to buy a $30 case from them if they're going
[01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:43.580]   to get one for free from Apple for the next three months.
[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:44.580]   You have to make it nicer.
[01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:46.320]   You can make a nicer case, a leather case.
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:47.320]   Well, here's the thing though.
[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:49.460]   They're not just, Apple isn't just giving out its own bumpers.
[01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:51.400]   It's going to be because it can't make them fast enough.
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:52.400]   So they're--
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.400]   It's a good source for the brain factors.
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:56.280]   I think that there might be jostling to get in on that.
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:59.620]   I mean, and who knows what the negotiations are and what Apple's actually going to pay
[01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:00.620]   these third party guys.
[01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:08.420]   But if you have a low cost case and if Apple says, "Look, we'll give you $10 each for--"
[01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:10.620]   I don't know what it's going to be.
[01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:15.440]   Might be very good for a certain number of case makers to get on that list of free ones
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:16.980]   that they're going to give out.
[01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:18.620]   Do we have a date that this stuff is going to happen?
[01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:19.620]   Because I want a case.
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:20.620]   I thought they did next week.
[01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:23.460]   I think they said sometime late this week.
[01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:24.460]   Okay.
[01:54:24.460 --> 01:54:25.460]   All right.
[01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:26.460]   I'll be looking for my case, man.
[01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:30.620]   We're going to take a break, come back with our picks of the week in just a moment.
[01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:33.820]   But right now, it's time to tell you about our picks from audible.com.
[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:43.020]   We're big fans of audible.com, that great bookstore of audio entertainment, 75,000 strong.
[01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:46.820]   I am just a huge audible fan, as everybody knows.
[01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:48.740]   I don't go anywhere without listening to audible.
[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:50.900]   I'm still working on the contortionist's handbook, Andy.
[01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:51.900]   Haven't got to the end.
[01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:52.900]   Don't tell me no spoilers.
[01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:53.900]   No spoilers.
[01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:56.500]   I was listening to it on the exercise bike.
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:59.940]   I listen to different books now in different venues because I have so many books.
[01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:01.900]   I'm back on so much.
[01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:09.980]   In the car, I'm listening to Paolo Bacheco-Lupi's The Wind Up Girl, which is a great science
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:11.540]   fiction story.
[01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:14.220]   At the gym, I'm listening to the contortionist's handbook.
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:17.740]   When I go to bed at night, I listen to Count Amani Christo.
[01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:19.780]   That's probably what I'm going to be listening to for the next eight years because all three
[01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:20.940]   of them are fairly long books.
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:26.100]   Audible has just kind of an endless supply of great literature waiting for you.
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:29.940]   Now with the iPhone app that is just stunning, stellar, they updated it.
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:32.260]   I think it's at 101 now.
[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:35.980]   The download problems have seemed to have all gone away.
[01:55:35.980 --> 01:55:40.860]   If you've been having trouble downloading Audible books on the iPhone, go at it.
[01:55:40.860 --> 01:55:41.860]   Go at it.
[01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:43.740]   It's a great way to do it.
[01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:44.740]   75,000 titles.
[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:49.660]   You can get your first one free by going to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:52.700]   The only trouble you'll have is picking just one.
[01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:56.220]   That's why we have Andy and Naco with this today.
[01:55:56.220 --> 01:55:57.220]   Not the only reason.
[01:55:57.220 --> 01:55:58.220]   Exactly.
[01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:01.020]   What's your pick of the week?
[01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:04.300]   My pick is a book that someone actually gave me like three months ago, but I didn't get
[01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:08.620]   around to reading until like a week and a half, two weeks ago.
[01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:12.460]   It's called You're Lucky, You're Funny by Philip Rosenthal.
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:15.820]   He was one of the co-creators of Everybody Loves Raymond.
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:22.100]   And that TV show was very, very successful.
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:26.340]   Leaving him with his what could be termed blank you money.
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:31.140]   And so now that the show is over and he had time on his hands, he decided, I don't really
[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:35.380]   care what everybody thinks about every single TV executive and the personality I've worked
[01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:38.620]   with over the past 15 to 20 years of my career.
[01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:44.340]   And I'm a comedy and I've just spent 10 years writing a sitcom about a writer who converts
[01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:46.620]   funny experiences into his column.
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:52.620]   So as you might imagine, it's a really funny, just nice story about where here's what it's
[01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:57.540]   like to not only be a comedy writer, but also what it's like to get business done in the
[01:56:57.540 --> 01:56:58.540]   TV industry.
[01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:05.260]   So it's not just and then Ray Romano, he parked across two parking spaces, including the place
[01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:09.540]   with an ice cream truck for the sick kids was going to go and they told us all to go
[01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:10.540]   screw ourselves.
[01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:11.540]   And that's what's right.
[01:57:11.540 --> 01:57:12.540]   It's not stuff like that.
[01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:15.380]   It's more interesting, interesting stories well told.
[01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:19.820]   And of course, if you like stories about network executive bozos, he tells a story about how
[01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:23.900]   he was developing a sitcom for Peter O tool.
[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:29.220]   And the idea of like a weekly show for Peter O tool, you're like, I don't even work for
[01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:32.220]   the industry, but I'm willing to sign you to a contract to just have him at my house
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:34.660]   doing that for 20 minutes a week.
[01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:38.340]   And he got a turned down from an executive who said, we'd rather not have people with
[01:57:38.340 --> 01:57:40.340]   accents on our network.
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:43.620]   So it's a seven hours long.
[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:48.900]   I think it's a great summer book because you'll get through it like in plenty of time to be
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:51.060]   ready for back to school shopping.
[01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:55.300]   But it was a gift a few months ago from a friend.
[01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:57.500]   And sometimes you get a book and it looks interesting.
[01:57:57.500 --> 01:58:00.420]   You put it on the shelf and I don't know why I happen to pull it down.
[01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:04.820]   But I just decided to just read it for just the first three or four pages before I knew
[01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:05.820]   it.
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:07.780]   That was the book I was reading for the next two or three days.
[01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:12.300]   So it's just a funny book really well written and a great pick.
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:13.460]   Well, a wonderful pick.
[01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:14.460]   Thank you.
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:15.460]   You're lucky.
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:19.180]   You're funny how life becomes a sitcom Phil Rosenthal.
[01:58:19.180 --> 01:58:21.060]   Now that's just one of 75,000 titles.
[01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:22.860]   Go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:24.380]   Sign up for that gold account.
[01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:25.380]   Pick your book.
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:29.900]   It plays back on all the Apple devices, including the iPad.
[01:58:29.900 --> 01:58:32.980]   And there's that great, as I said, iPhone app now, which really it makes it a lot of
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:33.980]   fun.
[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:37.420]   Your whole library is available to you and you can download it mostly by a Wi-Fi because
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:40.340]   most of these books are over 20 megabytes.
[01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:44.860]   Really just a wonderful addition to the iPhone, I think.
[01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:45.860]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:58:45.860 --> 01:58:50.940]   We thank you so much for your support Audible and now it's time for our picks of the week,
[01:58:50.940 --> 01:58:51.940]   John.
[01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:52.940]   I warned you at the beginning of the show.
[01:58:52.940 --> 01:58:55.180]   I've given you now like 15 hours.
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:57.740]   It's a long show to think about.
[01:58:57.740 --> 01:59:00.580]   I've come up with a good one, I think.
[01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:03.020]   All right.
[01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:08.420]   When I got my iPad, one of the things I definitely wanted to do with it is use it sort of as
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:12.820]   a, you know, from traveling, this is the computer I'm going to take.
[01:59:12.820 --> 01:59:15.700]   And in practice, it actually has turned out that way.
[01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:19.500]   My main computer, the one I'm communicating to you with right now, is still a MacBook
[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:20.500]   Pro.
[01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:24.660]   But my MacBook Pro, to me, now feels sort of like a portable workstation.
[01:59:24.660 --> 01:59:27.340]   A fantastically portable workstation.
[01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:30.380]   And I do take it with me like I took it with me to Apple last week because I was going
[01:59:30.380 --> 01:59:32.740]   to try to do serious work while I was out there.
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:36.500]   But I almost all only ever opened my MacBook now on a desk.
[01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:40.620]   I'm either at my desk at home or if I'm in a hotel, I'm going to sit down and work,
[01:59:40.620 --> 01:59:41.620]   I'm at a desk.
[01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:45.580]   Anywhere else where I want to use a computer, the couch, the airplane, anywhere else, I
[01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:47.220]   use the iPad.
[01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:50.580]   But if you're going to take it out of the house like that, you need a bag, right?
[01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:55.540]   And so for example, another great, great instance was when I was at WWDC last month,
[01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:57.940]   I had my MacBook with me, but it stayed in the hotel.
[01:59:57.940 --> 02:00:01.380]   And all day, every day when I was actually at the conference, I had my iPad.
[02:00:01.380 --> 02:00:02.460]   So what bag to get?
[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:06.260]   And there's a whole bunch of people coming out with it, it's a big market.
[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:08.740]   But I'm really, really happy with the one that I bought.
[02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:11.740]   It's the from Tom Bin, T-O-N-B-H.
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:14.380]   Oh, I love the Bin tags.
[02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:15.380]   Yeah.
[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:16.380]   .com.
[02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:20.140]   And they call it the Ristretto for netbooks.
[02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:25.220]   Or now I think if they've renamed it, it's the Ristretto for iPad/netbooks.
[02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:27.220]   It's $110.
[02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:29.700]   I, of course, bought mine in black.
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:32.260]   So it probably won't show up very well.
[02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:34.260]   So it's kind of like a backpack.
[02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:35.260]   Sort of.
[02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:37.940]   It is, but it's a single strap.
[02:00:37.940 --> 02:00:40.460]   And it goes over your shoulder.
[02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:41.700]   I bought the upgrade.
[02:00:41.700 --> 02:00:43.180]   I think it's like $15.
[02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:44.700]   Or no, it's actually $30.
[02:00:44.700 --> 02:00:45.700]   Sorry.
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:50.020]   For the absolute shoulder strap, which I think is a little, I think for $110 bag, they
[02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:52.900]   could give you the nice shoulder strap with it.
[02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:54.340]   But it actually is.
[02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:56.780]   It is a nicer strap.
[02:00:56.780 --> 02:01:01.100]   And it's just, to me, it really, it's hard to believe that they had this out before the
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:02.100]   iPad shipped.
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:05.660]   You know, it was originally the Ristretto for netbooks.
[02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:09.300]   It is the absolute perfect size for an iPad.
[02:01:09.300 --> 02:01:12.100]   Let me just show you this.
[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:15.020]   It also has a separate pouch in front.
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:16.660]   Back here is where you put your iPad.
[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:17.660]   And then right in front.
[02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:18.660]   Is it?
[02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:19.660]   There goes the keyboard.
[02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:20.660]   That's cool.
[02:01:20.660 --> 02:01:23.260]   Or it's just, could not be a better height.
[02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:29.620]   I mean, you just, it's, they must have been like, they must have, it's just amazing how
[02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:30.860]   perfect it seems for the iPad.
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:32.700]   I love it.
[02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:34.220]   And yeah, it's 100 and 10 bucks.
[02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:37.580]   Everybody I know, I've never had a Tom Bin bag before, but everybody I know who has them
[02:01:37.580 --> 02:01:38.580]   absolutely loves them.
[02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:43.300]   So I expect it to be my iPad bag for, I don't know, the next 10 years.
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:44.300]   It's great.
[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:45.300]   I really, really, really, really.
[02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:48.780]   I am a big, all my laptop bags come from Tom Bin.
[02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:50.780]   I don't have that one that yet though.
[02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:51.780]   I'm going to have to buy that one.
[02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:53.940]   But I'm a big, you know, and just everything else you'd want to buy.
[02:01:53.940 --> 02:01:57.780]   A little, little pocket for pants, just the right number, you know, not too many zipper
[02:01:57.780 --> 02:02:02.540]   packs, but enough that you, you know, you just, nice little pocket that fits my camera.
[02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:04.980]   It's just really, really a nice bag.
[02:02:04.980 --> 02:02:05.980]   Right.
[02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:06.980]   Pick.
[02:02:06.980 --> 02:02:07.980]   And just perfect for the iPad.
[02:02:07.980 --> 02:02:08.980]   A little bit.
[02:02:08.980 --> 02:02:12.180]   Andy and not co, your pick of the week, sir.
[02:02:12.180 --> 02:02:16.260]   My pick of the week is actually a book that just arrived.
[02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:19.100]   My house like three, four, three, four days ago.
[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:21.820]   It's Photoshop CS5, the missing manual.
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:26.260]   I should mention that the author is a friend of mine, Lisa Snyder.
[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:29.540]   As a matter of fact, I married this woman before you get excited.
[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:31.700]   I married her to another man.
[02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:35.940]   Oh, it's been a, it's been a, I thought we had a big announcement here, Andy.
[02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:36.940]   Holy cow.
[02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:42.100]   That's like when Wozniak came on our show and said, oh yeah, I'm in like a, and like
[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:43.540]   announced that he'd gotten married.
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:44.540]   Wow.
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:45.540]   Andy.
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:46.540]   You're the one who's married to yourself.
[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:48.100]   I married her only as minister.
[02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:49.100]   I see.
[02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:57.420]   So, so I like it a lot because I'm in that really, really tough place with Photoshop where I,
[02:02:57.420 --> 02:03:00.100]   I use it and I like it, but I don't make money from it.
[02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:02.580]   So I'm not really motivated to learn properly.
[02:03:02.580 --> 02:03:07.180]   And Photoshop for all of its complexity and its expense is easy enough to use that you
[02:03:07.180 --> 02:03:12.220]   can use 75% of its most useful and popular features without reading a manual and without
[02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:14.340]   having to learn the right way to do anything.
[02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:18.580]   But there are, there are right ways to do things and you find yourself banging your head against
[02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:22.860]   the, against the floor because you're doing something the really difficult manual way when
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:28.340]   there's actually a tool that will make things really, really easy to manage.
[02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:34.180]   And so it's a really well written, well illustrated book that takes every single, it really breaks
[02:03:34.180 --> 02:03:36.820]   it down into things that you want to accomplish with Photoshop.
[02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:39.980]   Like if you want to learn how to really use layers, the whole section on layers that would
[02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:43.740]   break it down into, well, here's a way that you want to really add a really nice, add pop
[02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:44.980]   to a sunset behind you.
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:49.300]   Or here's a way that you want to fix a photo so that you're just affecting just the blacks
[02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:53.100]   and nothing else just to give it a little bit of extra contrast.
[02:03:53.100 --> 02:04:00.700]   There's a, there's a section on selective blur that she's in which she's showing you
[02:04:00.700 --> 02:04:05.140]   how to take a photo of someone who has like really, really like prominent freckles and
[02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:07.660]   I just softened the freckles without moving details.
[02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:11.180]   What I'm covering up is that she is also on the opposite page.
[02:04:11.180 --> 02:04:14.060]   She's a guy with like a kind of a big butt.
[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:16.060]   And so here's a lesson on how to reduce justice.
[02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:17.060]   I need that.
[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:18.060]   Reducing butt size.
[02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:19.060]   That's the page.
[02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:20.060]   Exactly.
[02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:26.220]   I was leaving through it because she showed me a personal photo that she had used that
[02:04:26.220 --> 02:04:30.180]   I was actually in from one of the parties that we were at.
[02:04:30.180 --> 02:04:32.740]   So I was trying to figure out if I was actually in one of these, I think she must have, she
[02:04:32.740 --> 02:04:37.420]   must have, her editors said that no, people do not want to see this in a book that costs
[02:04:37.420 --> 02:04:38.420]   29 bucks.
[02:04:38.420 --> 02:04:39.620]   I'm sorry, 49 bucks.
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:44.260]   But it is very well done again.
[02:04:44.260 --> 02:04:47.900]   It's just over the past three or four days, I'm editing like about 100, 200 different
[02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:52.500]   photos because I did something kind of already a couple of weeks ago, the public garden.
[02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:55.340]   And now I'm like, oh, I'm not just taking stop shots here.
[02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:56.340]   This one is a photograph.
[02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.900]   I need to treat it accordingly in Photoshop.
[02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:02.740]   And every time I get into the point of, ah, dang it, how come I really want to just duplicate
[02:05:02.740 --> 02:05:06.620]   this section and patch it over this section of railing so that we don't see that stupid
[02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:07.820]   piece of graffiti.
[02:05:07.820 --> 02:05:10.300]   But I know how to do it, but it's not coming out well.
[02:05:10.300 --> 02:05:13.700]   And then I simply look, let's actually read up on how you would actually do that in this
[02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:17.540]   and I realized that yes, Andy, the reason why you can't do it correctly is because you're
[02:05:17.540 --> 02:05:18.540]   an idiot.
[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:20.140]   But this will make you less of an idiot.
[02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:24.740]   So for, so for God's sake, you already spent hundreds of bucks on Photoshop, 50 bucks for
[02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:28.860]   for a manual that actually shows you how to use it and how to actually get more use out
[02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:33.500]   of it than you would out of $100 share where photo editor, I think is a good buy.
[02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:34.700]   And I really like this a lot.
[02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:35.700]   So that's why I'm recommending it.
[02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:39.020]   I'm not going to upgrade it, so I'm going to get it because I need the manual.
[02:05:39.020 --> 02:05:40.900]   Because you know what I'm missing?
[02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:44.500]   My problem with Photoshop is that I got really, I feel like I really, really mastered like
[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:45.500]   Photoshop 3.0.
[02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:46.500]   Right.
[02:05:46.500 --> 02:05:47.500]   Exactly.
[02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:51.100]   And I really felt like I knew like almost everything there was in Obama and I could really do
[02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:52.100]   stuff.
[02:05:52.100 --> 02:05:54.660]   And then I'm like, you know, I don't really need it on a day basis.
[02:05:54.660 --> 02:05:57.860]   And then here it is like, you know, 11 years later or 10 years later.
[02:05:57.860 --> 02:06:00.660]   And it's like, I'm still doing things to Photoshop 3.0 way.
[02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:03.500]   And now there's like a button that you want to like cut somebody's head out from the background
[02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:06.500]   and I'm like, hey, just click this button.
[02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:11.660]   And I'm like, oh my God, I was like zoomed in to 8,000 percent and doing it pixel by pixel.
[02:06:11.660 --> 02:06:14.700]   Like I used to back in 1993.
[02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:17.140]   It's incredible because this has been updated for CS5.
[02:06:17.140 --> 02:06:20.940]   I think this is the second edition of her version of the Photoshop missing manual.
[02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:24.740]   And I'm leaving through and I'm like, wow, I didn't know that because I'm also scanning
[02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:26.740]   in like old prints and old stuff from either.
[02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:30.220]   Wow, there's a new feature where you don't have to like individually scan each one and
[02:06:30.220 --> 02:06:31.220]   then straighten it.
[02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:33.820]   And then you can just flap them all down on the flat bed and press the scan button and
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:36.060]   it will automatically find all those square corners.
[02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:37.060]   And well, that's great.
[02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:38.060]   That's a great CS5 feature.
[02:06:38.060 --> 02:06:40.740]   Oh, no, that's actually been in there for quite a while.
[02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:42.780]   I just never actually knew about it.
[02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:44.220]   Okay, good to know.
[02:06:44.220 --> 02:06:45.220]   Thank you, Lisa.
[02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:49.820]   You know, the first time you use the layers tool properly, the first time I showed someone
[02:06:49.820 --> 02:06:54.020]   how to use the layers tool so that, yeah, instead of actually like making a destructive
[02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:58.060]   edit to lighten the background, here is a way to do it so that you can then two days
[02:06:58.060 --> 02:07:01.020]   later decide that no, actually that was a stupid thing to do.
[02:07:01.020 --> 02:07:02.780]   I want to make it a little bit lighter than that.
[02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:06.580]   And because you use an adjustment layer instead of actually using the burn and dodge tool,
[02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:10.740]   that nice big tool with a big icon on the tool palette, you realize that, uh, that was
[02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:11.740]   $50.
[02:07:11.740 --> 02:07:12.740]   Well spent again.
[02:07:12.740 --> 02:07:13.740]   Well done, Lisa.
[02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:16.140]   Well, thank you for that pick.
[02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:17.300]   My pick is an iPad.
[02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:19.100]   Oh, we lost John again.
[02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:20.100]   Should I call him?
[02:07:20.100 --> 02:07:21.100]   I'll get him.
[02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:22.100]   What the heck?
[02:07:22.100 --> 02:07:23.100]   What the heck?
[02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:25.540]   He has to join us in the big kick line at the end of the show.
[02:07:25.540 --> 02:07:26.540]   The end.
[02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:29.100]   There's no business like Mac, business.
[02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:32.940]   We've had a lot of fun, but now we are done.
[02:07:32.940 --> 02:07:36.540]   So here we say goodbye from Twitter.
[02:07:36.540 --> 02:07:43.500]   My pick is the, uh, ill gotten spawn of two former Bing engineers and an ex Google news
[02:07:43.500 --> 02:07:44.500]   staffer.
[02:07:44.500 --> 02:07:45.500]   Can you imagine?
[02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:47.180]   Can you imagine what would come of that?
[02:07:47.180 --> 02:07:49.180]   Richard Hiles, scum and villainy.
[02:07:49.180 --> 02:07:50.180]   Yes.
[02:07:50.180 --> 02:07:51.180]   I got John back.
[02:07:51.180 --> 02:07:52.180]   There we go.
[02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:53.260]   Uh, this actually though is very cool.
[02:07:53.260 --> 02:07:55.140]   It's called Apollo.
[02:07:55.140 --> 02:07:56.540]   It's a news reader for the iPad.
[02:07:56.540 --> 02:07:59.080]   You know, I am always looking at different news readers on the iPad mostly because he
[02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:02.620]   iPad is such a, you know, a great place to read news.
[02:08:02.620 --> 02:08:05.780]   Um, this is, this has an interesting idea.
[02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:09.660]   It starts you out with some feeds, but then watches what you read and then as you read
[02:08:09.660 --> 02:08:14.240]   things starts to recommend news sources and new content.
[02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:18.700]   Uh, so helping you kind of discover new stuff.
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:21.780]   Uh, I guess my web is loading a little bit slowly here.
[02:08:21.780 --> 02:08:26.620]   So we're seeing a lot of, uh, news readers that have the kind of this metaphor of the
[02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:27.620]   scroll.
[02:08:27.620 --> 02:08:28.620]   Um, you know,
[02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:29.880]   people read your sad that didn't they?
[02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:30.880]   Yeah, they did.
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:33.840]   They added a new, a new reader feature that I really liked.
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:35.320]   It kind of is a slideshow thing.
[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:38.120]   Um, we talked a lot before about plus.
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:42.560]   Um, and so this is a kind of similar idea, but I think what's going to be interesting
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:48.280]   about this is, uh, how it adds new content based on the stuff that you read or pick.
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:50.400]   It's a very nice, easy to read layout.
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:54.440]   If I have, uh, any objection about it and I object about, about this to on a lot of
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:55.720]   these is it doesn't have delicious.
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:57.960]   It has Facebook, Twitter, you can email links.
[02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:02.680]   I wish every news reader would include a delicious, maybe we're the only people still using delicious.
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:06.240]   I suspect that might be part of the process and insta paper and insta paper.
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:07.240]   Yeah.
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:08.240]   Now you gotta have insta paper.
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:09.920]   If that's, that's something I'm sure that they'll add.
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:11.280]   Uh, you can favorite these.
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:13.040]   You can thumbs up and thumbs down it.
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:16.600]   You can see if I'm reading this story, Supreme court or Supreme committee approves Kagan
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:17.600]   for Supreme court.
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:21.040]   I can click this button for related and I can see related stories.
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:26.960]   So it's, it starts to give you, well, it's almost like a web like experience of cross
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:28.480]   linking and browsing.
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:30.840]   Um, I think it's, it's very pretty.
[02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:33.200]   I'm very interested to see what they, what they do.
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:35.680]   They are calling it the newspaper of the future.
[02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:40.880]   Uh, TechCrunch says it will deliver the final blow to the newspaper industry, but I don't
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:43.000]   know if that's, that sounds like hyperbole.
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.240]   $2.99 brand new.
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:45.240]   From cat crunch.
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:46.240]   Yeah.
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:47.240]   Yeah.
[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:48.240]   Hyperbole.
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:49.240]   What?
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:50.240]   What a shock.
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:51.600]   Uh, I, I, but I like it a lot.
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:55.280]   And you know, as you, as you, if you look at my, uh, iPad screen, you'll see that I have
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:58.120]   a ton of different news readers on here.
[02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:02.620]   I can't decide, you know, a news rack reader, pulse, sky grid, all of these have been
[02:10:02.620 --> 02:10:05.360]   recommendations on the Mac break with the, at one point or another.
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:06.360]   Yeah.
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:11.600]   I, I think that, I think that news readers on the iPad or what Twitter clients were for
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:17.160]   the iPhone, yeah, we're going to have to work over with the leading playground for like,
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:20.640]   just messing around with the ideas of what the, the UI should be like.
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:21.640]   Yeah.
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:23.120]   It's a very good point.
[02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:27.840]   So it's where you're starting to see, uh, such, such an event, so much innovation.
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:28.840]   Yeah.
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:29.840]   Yeah.
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:34.000]   I mean, the obvious way to do it is sort of to make it look like Apple's iPad mail app,
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.600]   which is what, you know, I still use net news wire a lot on the iPad, but that's sort
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:38.600]   of that as well.
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:39.600]   Yeah.
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:40.600]   Yeah.
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:43.440]   And that's sort of like the obvious way to go with just a column of sources on the left
[02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:46.320]   and you click on a source and you get the items on the right and it fills in.
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:50.360]   Uh, and, and, but you're, we're seeing a lot of stuff, you know, I hadn't seen this
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:51.360]   Apollo before.
[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:52.360]   It looks great.
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:56.600]   So many of these feed readers and they're very, very, very original takes lots of original
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:57.600]   UI design work.
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:10:58.600]   I love their calls.
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:10:59.920]   I really love Paul said.
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:03.640]   I'm glad that that survived the, uh, the New York Times take down a request.
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:04.640]   Yeah.
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:05.640]   You're showing something there.
[02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:06.640]   What did you want to say?
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:07.640]   Oh, no, no.
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:09.280]   I was just showing news rack, which is my, which is my favorite reader.
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:13.680]   I was just, I was just saying that I've had sort of a, like, I love the fact that no matter
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:16.640]   how long I've been writing about technology, I still have these.
[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:20.400]   I'm so glad that I live in the 21st century moments and I have, I was having one of those
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:25.520]   moments at Panera bread yesterday, the day before, cause I'm just on my iPad and I'm
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:29.560]   looking at, and I'm looking at these, all these news, going through my, my daily news
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:30.760]   from a hundred different sources.
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:34.560]   And every time I hit an article that's a little bit too long for me to read while I'm
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:37.360]   at Panera bread, I tap one button to send it to Instagram.
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:40.760]   And immediately becomes an ebook that I can read, whether I'm online or not.
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:44.300]   And I realized that this is something that I could never have imagined existing five
[02:11:44.300 --> 02:11:48.840]   years ago, either these services or the device that I'm really using it on or I would, I
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:53.720]   would get like 50% of what the system works, how the system works and what it does.
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:58.320]   And it's, it really is the case study of, you want to explain to somebody why a tablet
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:03.600]   form factor and especially an operating system that really works well and can create beautiful
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:06.640]   software, why you would spend $500 for advice like this.
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:10.800]   I really think that it's a news reader that shows off the iPad to its ultimate, because
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:11.800]   advantage.
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:16.260]   We're getting early Apple quarterly results in that the, I guess the call began right
[02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:20.020]   after the close of the stock market, which is 25 minutes ago.
[02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:27.440]   Apple posts core Q three price per share earnings per share, rather $3.51 revenue, 15.7 billion,
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:31.340]   exactly what the analyst said above the Apple predictions.
[02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:37.660]   So it looks like it's very close to what people thought shares go up on this news quite a
[02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:38.980]   bit, 3.2%.
[02:12:38.980 --> 02:12:44.220]   So there you have it, the latest earnings coming out right now as we speak from Apple.
[02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:45.220]   There's John Gruber.
[02:12:45.220 --> 02:12:46.620]   John, we're going to let you go.
[02:12:46.620 --> 02:12:48.420]   We called you back and let you go.
[02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:49.420]   All right.
[02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:50.420]   That's a very nice view.
[02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:51.420]   I love that.
[02:12:51.420 --> 02:12:53.460]   That's a life on 18 T2.
[02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:54.820]   It's always great to talk to you, John.
[02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:58.340]   John Gruber is really the blogger you got to read if you are following Apple.
[02:12:58.340 --> 02:13:02.800]   Frankly, if you're following anything that's going on, your little snippets, your snarky
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:10.540]   little comments are a must read on every news reader I have, daring fireball.net.
[02:13:10.540 --> 02:13:14.740]   And by the way, that Bill Murray interview was fascinating, wasn't it?
[02:13:14.740 --> 02:13:15.740]   Oh, man, he's the best.
[02:13:15.740 --> 02:13:16.740]   He really is.
[02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:17.740]   Just really, really good.
[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:20.780]   But anyway, this is so you see he talks about all sorts of things.
[02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:21.780]   Daring fireball.
[02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:23.220]   We'll get you on again real soon, John.
[02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:24.220]   Enjoy your day.
[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:25.220]   All right, man.
[02:13:25.220 --> 02:13:26.220]   Thank you.
[02:13:26.220 --> 02:13:27.220]   Great to talk to you.
[02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:33.580]   Andy Inaco is, of course, the tech guy at the Chicago Sun Times and his blog is www.cwob.com.
[02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:34.580]   Any new books out?
[02:13:34.580 --> 02:13:35.580]   You want a plug?
[02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:41.260]   I'm going to have a whole bunch of them read the end of 2010 and started 2011.
[02:13:41.260 --> 02:13:46.340]   Unfortunately, I think my production schedule really starts the crank and overdrive starting
[02:13:46.340 --> 02:13:48.140]   in like three days from now.
[02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:51.740]   So it's going to be from the iPad book should be out by the time you're ready to find out
[02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:53.220]   how to spend all that holiday money.
[02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:54.980]   Ah ha, good timing.
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:55.980]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:13:55.980 --> 02:13:56.980]   We'll see you again real soon.
[02:13:56.980 --> 02:13:57.980]   Thank you all for joining us.
