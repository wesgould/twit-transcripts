[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.280]   I'm Renee Ritchie doing my absolute worst
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.040]   Leo Laport imitation.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.560]   But better news, we have Andy and not
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.000]   co-with us from Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   How are you, Andy?
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.400]   Hello, Renee.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.320]   You've caused me to do two-damn dollar comics yesterday, sir.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.600]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.320]   I have to offset the-- Amazon's having this huge incredible sale
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.760]   on Marvel-collected comics and trade paperbacks.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.760]   And the prices are still like $20 trade paperbacks.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.480]   They're digital down to $2, in some sense.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.360]   It's like when you go to a yard sale in October
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.840]   and you realize that somebody's mother, someone who just
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.360]   went to college, their mother is just saying,
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.240]   oh, look at all these boxes of all these old comics.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.480]   Do we just cluttering around the room and the garage?
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.160]   Well, just get rid of them for, I don't know, like $10 a box.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.600]   And you feel guilty for spending so little money for so much.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.960]   But then you can prevent you from buying about 20 graphic notes.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.840]   So yes, that's my problem.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.880]   I spent one Alex Lindsey on those.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.840]   Speaking of Alex Lindsey joining us from--
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.840]   I don't think it's parts unknown.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.880]   I think it's parts European, Alex himself.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.960]   How are you, Alex?
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.880]   Hi, hi from-- I'm in Brussels.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.760]   I was in Amsterdam this morning, but came down to see
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.520]   some friends down here.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.240]   And I'm at a place called Alice Productions.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.080]   They do a ton of the video for a lot of the broadcasters here
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.040]   and the EU.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.440]   And the EU is actually-- I think over there.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.200]   So anyway, but I definitely want to thank Alice, Alice Productions,
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.600]   for allowing me to use up there one of their conference
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.840]   rooms for this.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.720]   Do you have beer, chocolate, or waffles with you?
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.200]   And I just alienated the entire audience.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.320]   I have had all of those things in the last 24 hours.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.320]   So it's like, I'm in--
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.040]   it turns out that I'm in the right place.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.160]   I will admit that I'm trying to lose weight,
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.680]   but doing it in Amsterdam in Brussels is very difficult.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.840]   Very difficult.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.760]   Well, I could talk about Belgium and comic books
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.520]   with you gentlemen for hours, literally.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.040]   But we have an Apple event to recapitulate.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.160]   You guys did an amazing job covering it last week.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.520]   I was there, so I can talk to you about the facilities,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.720]   if you're curious about what the bathrooms look like
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.920]   in the Steve Jobs Theater.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.840]   I mean, that's--
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.280]   How are the bathrooms?
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.800]   That is what everyone wants to know.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.040]   How are the bathrooms in the Steve Jobs Theater?
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.840]   I bet you they are--
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.000]   For every bit of detail.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.520]   First question I think about the bathrooms
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.480]   would be, how do you dry your hands?
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.560]   Either they're going to say--
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.000]   you're going to get one of those really horrible,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.600]   institutional, brown, corrugated paper pull down dispensers,
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.960]   or they're going to say, no, no, no.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.560]   You're going to get those wonderful things
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.680]   that are like lens cloths that are in a little pile
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.480]   by this sink.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.040]   Or they're going to say, no, no, we're all hippy friendly.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.880]   You only get one of those dice and wind blade things
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.640]   that makes you do an incantation over a fire for 10 minutes
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.840]   to get your hands mildly dry.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.560]   So how do you dry your hands at the Steve Jobs Theater?
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.760]   There is a towel dispenser right near the exit.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.440]   So you just pull out the paper towel
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.520]   from underneath it, dry your hands,
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.680]   and put it in the receptacle that's located immediately
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.840]   underneath the towel dispenser.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.000]   So you never have an urge to throw it on the floor.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.640]   I got to try to, though, there was facilities
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.120]   at the parking lot where we all went in.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.240]   And then there was also in the visitor's center.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   And they have these enormous wall to--
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.040]   ceiling to floor wooden doors in front of the cabinets.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.480]   I don't know what the right word for this.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.040]   The small rooms, the vestibules that you close completely.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.000]   And then they have--
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   couple-- I'm assuming Johnny and I have designed urinals.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.440]   And then they have the sinks.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.200]   Not everything looked 100% finished.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.280]   It looked like they really rushed to get those things up
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.600]   and operational.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.240]   And if I could, I would be filing radars
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.760]   with the facilities team, if they let outsiders do that.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.280]   But it was super interesting.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.640]   It was an interesting configuration,
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.120]   because infinite loop is so small.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.000]   You go to infinite loop, you go around a little bit,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.640]   you're at Town Hall, and you're basically doing this.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.880]   But here, you come down Tantau Street,
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.440]   and you go to the visitor's center, and you go in there,
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.000]   and then you walk up, and they have a very unique cafe--
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.480]   well, a unique cafe max, and that mostly looks like a coffee
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.680]   bar, not a full-on cafeteria.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.600]   And on the other side of that is Apple Store, Apple Park.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.520]   And they're sort of fused into one building.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.160]   And you can walk upstairs and get a terraced view
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.920]   of the entire campus.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.320]   And then you have to walk over some rolling hills
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.920]   to get to the Steve Jobs Theater.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.120]   And it's almost Japanese in that sometimes you
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.680]   don't see Apple Park, the big loop at all.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.880]   And other times you turn around a corner,
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.600]   and then suddenly this immense--
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.360]   it looks like suborbital structure
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.960]   is just blotting out part of your field of view.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.840]   But Andy, it's a lot more exercise than the previous campus
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.400]   was.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   At some point, is there somebody in a polo shirt
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.080]   whispering in your ear as you walk, remember that art mortal.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.520]   Remember that art mortal.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.520]   Remember that art mortal.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.080]   Every 3 feet, because it rains.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.680]   It rains every time I go to Cupertino.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.120]   I don't know what it is, but it rained.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.840]   And the tiles were a little slick.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.120]   So I believe it's Apple retail staff who
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.560]   mans a lot of these events.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.120]   And about every 3 feet, there was someone greeting you
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.720]   and making sure you successfully made it to the next 3 feet.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.320]   Now, is the Cafe Max and the Apple Store
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.360]   are those open to the public?
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.960]   So someone wants to make a pill rummage to the mothership.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.000]   There is a place where they could just simply park the car,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.160]   go in, buy a t-shirt, buy a cup of coffee.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.800]   They will be.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.760]   They are not open yet.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   They did a sort of a faux opening just for people
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.920]   who were there at the event.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.320]   And that included Apple people who were lining up for stuff.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.920]   Because they had t-shirts for Apple Park and playing cards.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.960]   They took the stuff from the Apple Design book
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.880]   and they had postcard versions of that.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.560]   And they had a few other things.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.720]   The biggest news for me, the biggest product when
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.800]   they got the least attention was the return of the Apple
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.160]   onesies, which we haven't seen since the old Infinite Loop
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.400]   Store.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.120]   Yeah, so I saw your Instagram where your family members are now
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.120]   being appropriately imprinted at an early age.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.320]   There were no Alex sized onesies.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.800]   I did check.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.520]   Dang, no.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.400]   And still know who he is.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.240]   Expect the behavior hoodies.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.680]   If I could get every morning put on a clean t-shirt
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.520]   and clean underwear with just one garment,
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.160]   that could save me some time.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.560]   Especially a beautifully engineered Apple aluminium garment.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.840]   But I mean, the place was gorgeous.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.480]   It looks like the latest, like the Apple Union Square Apple
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.040]   Store, the World Trade Center Apple Store.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.720]   It is very much in that austere aesthetic with the woods
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.600]   and a lot of nature.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.440]   They have a lot of nature both inside.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.560]   And outside.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.840]   And the Steve Jobs Theater is incredibly impressive
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.760]   because there is no structure inside it.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.880]   It's this giant round glass building
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.680]   with not a single pillar or column inside.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.640]   All there is is this roof on top of you.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.720]   And you sort of look up every once in a while
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.280]   to make sure the roof is still above you.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.360]   It's a very strange feeling.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.520]   Just so big and open.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.920]   Yeah, that seems like this is so basically overall,
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   this feels like another Apple product.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.720]   A totally 100% an Apple product.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.680]   And they had, I'm sure you guys discussed it during the event.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.520]   But this was sort of like Steve Jobs's final public product.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.960]   And this was his theater and named after him.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.040]   And it was architected in a way that it's very,
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.600]   like there's no trick missed here.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.760]   Like we didn't get to use it because it wasn't online yet.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.120]   But we elevator when you go down to the Steve Jobs Theater,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.880]   you don't go in one side and come out the other.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.400]   The elevator apparently actually turns as you're going down
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.480]   so that you only have to worry about one one exit
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.600]   and one entrance.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.080]   And when you sit down, it just looks like a normal place.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.160]   But then these pod bay doors close
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.040]   with what I think is a sweet and sound of like ch-chink
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.360]   when they actually finish.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.480]   And then when they open up again,
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.920]   the entire demo area is there.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.080]   So someone pulled the cloth off and it was just,
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.520]   "Doh, all the products."
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.160]   A lot of stagecraft.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160]   Is it nice and comfy?
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.040]   We were there for a while sitting on those seats.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.040]   I hear the seats they spent no expense spared on the chairs.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.400]   They were very square.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.240]   They're leather.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.200]   Rumor was they spent thousands of dollars on them.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.080]   If you follow the armrest down,
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.760]   you got to a little power outlet.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.600]   And they were comfy and there's no bad view in the house.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.560]   You had two sort of, there's no middle row.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.240]   There's like two, there's a left middle, right middle,
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.480]   and then two side rows.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.520]   And they all face in towards the stage.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.960]   And the acoustics, I don't know any of this stuff, Alex.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.680]   I need you to infiltrate and get all the actual details.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.200]   But apparently the acoustics are the same
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.160]   no matter where you're sitting.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.200]   They mauled it after some of the big theaters in San Francisco
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.800]   where you can hear the same regardless of where you're sitting.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.040]   And then they had, I believe it was two Dolby vision projectors
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.640]   in full HDR.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.920]   And I'm guessing they had Dolby engineers sitting on top
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.840]   of them, calibrating them by the second
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.240]   to make sure that everything looked perfect
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.320]   for the entire show.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.800]   - And did it look perfect for the entire show?
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.520]   - People said it was for that two hours,
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.800]   it was the best theater in the world,
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.560]   the best calibrated theater in the world I don't doubt.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.440]   - I know probably 4K at the maximum,
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.960]   perfect brightness HDR.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.840]   I don't think it's gonna get me than that.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.880]   - P3, so you get, that's the thing is like
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.080]   the 4K stuff is really interesting,
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.960]   but when you get P3 for the much wider range of colors
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.080]   and then you get HDR for the much wider range of luminance,
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.280]   when Eddie Cute took the stage
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.760]   and he started showing you the difference
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.520]   and he said, we built this projector,
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.640]   or we got this projector so you could actually see the difference,
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.320]   you can actually see the difference.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.480]   It's almost like colors you never see before.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.520]   Like someone brought a squeegee out
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.680]   and cleaned up the glass you've been looking through
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.480]   and everything is losing the layer of gray
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.000]   and just looks very bright all of a sudden.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.960]   - Now how about things like,
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.240]   let's talk about amenities and stress items
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.480]   for people who have to attend events there.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.600]   So the two things that have always sort of bothered me
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.040]   about Apple events, one doesn't matter
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.240]   when sites kind of matters.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.600]   What doesn't matter is the food has always been very much,
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.000]   I suppose legally we have to give you water
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.960]   because we're making you wait for an hour and a half.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.880]   And there's always been so many,
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.760]   even at the Apple campus,
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.160]   like choke points where it's like,
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.320]   okay, I'm standing within eight inches
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.920]   of every other human who is at this event
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.280]   while I'm waiting for the demo area
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.880]   or waiting for the doors to open.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.720]   Like have they improved either of those two things?
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.120]   - The food was good.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:14.960]   The food was good.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.960]   I think the food for the last couple of events
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.400]   has been good and they have like vegan food now as well
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   as food like chicken and beef and they had sandwiches
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.560]   both at the, before the event
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.160]   and then in the cafe max.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.080]   I don't actually call it that,
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.320]   but whatever the cafeteria is called at the visitor center.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.480]   And both of it was pretty good.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.160]   They had those Apple fruit drinks.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.760]   I forget which one's like a carrot powered drink
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.920]   and a beet powered drink.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.440]   And that was all good.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.360]   And those were in tables.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.720]   Originally they were in tables
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.160]   surrounding the Steve Jobs theater
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.280]   so you could walk around sort of taking the view
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.440]   and then much as you wanted.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.040]   And people did glom on them immediately
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.120]   because reporters don't eat their very poor,
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.120]   as all of us know.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.320]   And you want to get as much re-apple food as you can
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.600]   and partially joking.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.000]   So they were all on those very quickly
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.440]   to get the coffee and the beverages and stuff.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.760]   And then it sort of they spread out
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.120]   and people wanted to photograph,
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.440]   walk around and sort of photograph
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.440]   the Apple buildings as much as they could.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.920]   - So are they controlling security
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.120]   as to making sure that people don't wander off
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.920]   and get pictures or look at things
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.640]   they're not supposed to look at?
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.880]   - It's so far away.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.720]   Like when you, the building is so big.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.120]   So it makes it look like it's close,
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.240]   but like it's probably a 10 or 15 minute,
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.760]   it was like a minute walk just to get to the broadcast platform.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.680]   You had to go around two paths and then up
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.000]   to get to the broadcast platform.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.440]   And then it must have been a 10 or 15 minute walk.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.960]   I'm guessing because I didn't get a chance to try it.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.760]   But it's a pretty, it's a bit of a walk
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.080]   to get to the Steve Jobs Theater,
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.520]   then a bit of a walk to get the actual campus.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.040]   So I don't know that there are stun gun stipers
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.480]   sitting on the top ring of that building.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.720]   I don't think you get very far
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.680]   'cause there's very little cover still.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.200]   - So it's more like Disney World where,
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.880]   yes, there are people who can take you out
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.040]   if you start to act funny,
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.920]   but they're meant to be invisible as they do so.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.280]   You won't even see the red dot before you're tranked.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.200]   - They were very happy, very nice.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.800]   And there was a big no drones.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.720]   This is a drone, no drone area sign when we walked in.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.840]   So what would you say to people that are,
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.160]   that may be coming to like the Bay Area
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.120]   or maybe coming to San Jose in January or February or March?
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.680]   Like is it, do you think it's gonna be easy
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.120]   to get to the visitor center?
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.480]   Like where it's a, would it be like a detour for a visitor
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.880]   or would it be a destination where you, yes,
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.320]   you can, it's open the public, yes,
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.160]   you can definitely get a coffee there
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.000]   and get a t-shirt there.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.720]   But it's so much trouble to get there
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.920]   and to get to the visitor center
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.080]   that maybe you want to play on a lot of time for it.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.120]   - And budget for it.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.320]   - Yeah, so I'm guessing it'll be similar to Infinite Loop.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.560]   I just don't know what the traffic is gonna be like next,
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.640]   yet because they had a lot of the roads closed for the event
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.640]   and they were very careful about directing everything.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.480]   But when you have thousands and thousands of Apple employees
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.080]   trying to get in and out and everyone else who works
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.440]   in the area trying to get in and out
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.320]   and Bay Area traffic being what it is.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.760]   I mean, I would try to go there off hours
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.480]   and then enjoy your coffee, enjoy your t-shirt.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.600]   So take your photos and then get out
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   before the traffic starts again.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.920]   One thing to always tell people about Infinite Loop
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.400]   is that yes, the Snapple store, yes, anybody can go there,
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:09.000]   but realize that there are burly men in black polo shirts
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.360]   who are definitely know that you're there
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.040]   who have a mental stopwatch going.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.240]   And if you take more than 12 seconds to take that selfie,
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.640]   you will be spoken to.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:22.440]   And advise at how long will Surbe or Madam be standing
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.760]   in front of this building taking pictures of the sign
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.360]   and make sure that you don't take pictures
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.880]   of anything that has two legs on it.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.960]   Like, okay.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.240]   - Yeah, no, I think they've built this sufficiently far
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.120]   from where the actual business gets taken place.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.920]   That you'll have a good time.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.480]   I don't know if there'll be that much to interest you
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.200]   after you bought your t-shirt and beverage holder,
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.640]   but it's a nice place to visit
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.640]   and people wanna make the pilgrim a jandy.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.480]   - Yeah.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.800]   - So, I mean, the other part that was interesting
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.880]   is the demo area because those are always different
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.440]   because Apple usually has them in a wide range of venues.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.760]   Like at the old town hall, it was in the piano bar.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.680]   And when they had it at some of the bigger,
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.000]   like Yerba Buena or the Flint Center,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.480]   they would convert part of the facilities
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.560]   into the demo area.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.560]   This year, they got to build their own.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.240]   And that's kind of cool because we've heard these stories
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.000]   about like a million dollar podium
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   that they only use once that sort of brings a thing up
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.640]   and turns it around and shows it off to you.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.800]   And this demo area, they had to assemble it.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.640]   I'm guessing while we were in,
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.920]   while we were watching the show,
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.480]   so it couldn't be overly complicated,
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.360]   but it was still, it filled sort of,
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.400]   they were round tables and they had iPhone 8
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.000]   on some of the tables and Apple Watch,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.240]   three on some of the tables and iPhone 10
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.040]   sort of strategically placed in between.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.960]   And I think that was a balancing act for them
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.680]   because if you had too many iPhone 10s,
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.480]   nobody would have looked at anything else.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.440]   But if you didn't have enough,
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.280]   you ended up having people waiting for a long time
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.160]   to get their hands on an iPhone 10.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.480]   So I'm interested to see how they sort of
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.920]   adjust that going forward.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.120]   - Was there really much interest in the eight
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.560]   or was there pretty much everyone just waiting
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.240]   to play with the 10?
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.680]   - There were people glomming around the 10,
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.640]   realizing it would be a while and then sort of moving out
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.800]   to look at the eight.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.920]   - That sounds like that's how the order process is going as well.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.640]   - Did they have enough demo units out there?
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.400]   - No, I would say no, like I think in their view,
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.120]   they did because they didn't want that
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.520]   to take all the attention.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.920]   But you know, after a while, you're looking at your watch
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.480]   and you're wondering if David Pozano started singing
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.120]   anytime soon so you can get your.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.360]   (laughing)
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.040]   - So what about the, I also wanted to know
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.640]   if the iPhone Xs that they had out there,
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.400]   were they functional or were they,
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.840]   you know, like the first iPhone,
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.240]   the only like a dozen people got to actually handle
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.560]   the demo ones backstage afterward.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.840]   And the ones that are out in public were in a tube
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.840]   that you could not get through,
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.520]   so you couldn't see what was working
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.400]   and what was like the bomb icon.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.320]   - No, we got to use them.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.960]   I mean, Trinity got to be a space alien.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.560]   I got to be a Poo emoji.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.920]   We got to try out the true depth camera to take selfies.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.200]   And it's kind of wild seeing a single camera
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.640]   delivering an image that you expect to see
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.680]   off the old dual camera system.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.040]   And we got to try out the swipe to go up.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.720]   We couldn't try Face ID because Face ID
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.960]   is locked to only one person.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.600]   You can't have multiple Face IDs where you can touch IDs
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.120]   and it was locked to the Apple representative
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.280]   who had the phone, but they would do like,
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.160]   they were very, I wanna say like, means their job,
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.160]   but they were still very patient.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.640]   People were like telling them like a dancing monkey,
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.040]   I'm locking again, I'm locking again, I'm locking again.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.160]   It's been around it, I'm locking again.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.880]   And it was working really fast for them.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.480]   They did a whole range of demos
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.400]   from just like the basic unlock to what if this?
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.920]   And it's got two modes.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.440]   It's got the regular mode which has a tension enabled,
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.240]   which means that it has to see you looking at it.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.000]   Like it knows that you wanna look at it
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.600]   so that it doesn't make any mistake and unlock
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.760]   when it just happens to glance at your face.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.560]   But if for any reason you wanna turn that off,
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.520]   so for example, for accessibility reasons,
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.280]   if you're a lower note site, you can turn it off.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.640]   Then all it has to do is see sort of from your eyes
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.600]   down to your mouth area from any angle and it'll open,
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.480]   which is better for convenience, but worse for security.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.240]   So we gotta see some of the demos of that stuff.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.520]   And Face ID, it's also possible that after the event,
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.520]   people at Apple were less relaxed,
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.960]   were less concerned about using it
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.800]   when they were out and about.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.200]   And if you were at a coffee shop,
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.080]   you could see people come up and very quickly use Apple Pay
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.680]   off those devices and it was very quick every time.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.440]   So I'm a little bit less concerned about Face ID
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.880]   than it was last week.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.520]   - Did the demonstrator people try to like trick Face ID
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.600]   by like putting on sunglasses, taking them off?
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.680]   That sort of stuff.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.480]   - Yeah, so it was amazing to hear them talk about it
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.520]   because it was kind of scary too,
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.280]   'cause they talked about it like they were training a pet,
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.680]   not like it was a computer.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.920]   'Cause they were saying like we did all these,
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.440]   we did like a billion photos and we trained it,
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.600]   we got people in Hollywood to make masks
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.000]   and to make prosthetics.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.880]   And we made 3D video and tried to hold it
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.000]   at the right direction.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.160]   And it's not like they programmed it.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.600]   Like it's like literally machine learning,
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.440]   Tinder for computers, yes, yes, no, no, no, yes, yes.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.880]   Good Face ID, good Face ID, no, no, no, bad Face ID,
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.240]   bad Face ID.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.200]   And it trained it and it got better and better.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.960]   So it can see through a lot of sunglasses.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.120]   If the sunglasses are AR filtered,
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.560]   so IR filtered, if it blocks infrared light,
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.640]   which I think some high end beach sunglasses do,
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.720]   then it can't see through them.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.000]   They're utterly opaque to them.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.520]   But as long as they're regular sunglasses polarized or not,
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.400]   as long as they don't block IR,
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.480]   they're just like regular glasses,
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.800]   they can go right through them.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.000]   And that's sort of the whole thing.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.960]   It's got to get enough points to work.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.000]   So if you're wearing like a Canadian bell of clava
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.240]   with your ski goggles or a ninja mask,
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.080]   probably won't work.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.560]   But if you're wearing a hat, a scarf,
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.200]   if your facial hair changes,
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.480]   it can mostly adapt to all of those things.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.320]   Wow.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.760]   And it adapts, which is crazy.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.280]   That's the thing that was really keen to see.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.760]   I know that they said during the presentation that,
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.760]   hey, we're at such IDs, our random fingerprint
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.240]   has a one in 35,000 chance of unlocking your phone
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.960]   with face ID, it's one in a million.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.040]   But I'm gonna talk about like brothers and sisters
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.720]   and identical twins,
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.480]   like anybody who works in a large office
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.840]   for more than four years at one point,
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.680]   I said, do you know, there's a guy in accounting
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.840]   who looks so much like three times,
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.240]   I almost came up to him and said,
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.480]   hey, Josh, and it would turn out to be Carl.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.520]   And what if Carl, like who's a known Wiesenheimer,
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.320]   is passing by your cubicle and sees
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.840]   that you've left your iPhone out charging?
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.200]   I say, yeah, I wonder if my face will unlock it.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.120]   And I'm curious to see if touch it.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.160]   If face ID is smart enough to know the difference
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.400]   between Carl and Josh or Rilla think,
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.720]   oh, I guess Josh just suddenly sprouted a mustache
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.640]   in the past three hours.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.560]   Okay, I will learn the mustache.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.400]   - There was a,
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.720]   we talk about 30,000 for the fingerprint
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.880]   and we talk about a million for the face.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.920]   There was a time when like four cars,
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.600]   you know, had a very small number of different keys.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.040]   So much smaller than 30,000.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.560]   And the reason I know that is because I have gotten
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.880]   into the wrong Ford Explorer.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.840]   Like literally was like looking around,
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.800]   I saw a Ford Explorer, same color, I went in,
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.960]   I turned in the key, I got in there,
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.360]   I was like, this is not my car.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.200]   You know, it was just like, and that's when I did a little
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.440]   research and I was like, there's not that many keys,
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.800]   you know, for the things.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.040]   When we think about security, I mean,
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.360]   the level of security that we're getting now
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.600]   is so much higher than, you know,
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.320]   many other things we've had, you know,
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.280]   in the past, whether it's been a long progression.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.280]   Yeah, and it was, they said like if you had an evil twin,
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.560]   that would be more problematic,
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.200]   but it seems like it's pretty good.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.720]   And they've done all sorts of tests to try to prove it.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.680]   Oh, well, a good twin.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.560]   I mean, then, we never, we never try to open your phone.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.840]   We'd never do that to your phone is trying to open it.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.200]   I think if you have an evil thing,
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.640]   you have bigger problems than what happens
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.120]   with your new phones unlocking.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.600]   Well, they have a go to you and that button
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.160]   that destroys people like Spock had.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.960]   So you have a lot different, or maybe Spock had face
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.640]   that he for that, but they did, they tested it
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.240]   in a wide variety of circumstances.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.680]   And it sounds like the biggest,
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.040]   the biggest drawbacks are, again,
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.800]   it's one face as opposed to five fingers.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.280]   So it's, if you're used to sharing it with a spouse
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.320]   or a partner or an employee or someone,
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.440]   you're not gonna be able to do that anymore.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.160]   Also for people who are just have facial,
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.040]   you know, facialist morphe, I just don't want,
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.120]   there's something that's don't like the idea
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.360]   of a machine scanning their face
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.920]   and they just will not be comfortable with this.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.560]   And that's, there's very little you can do about that,
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.840]   except for, you know, kindly suggest
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.320]   a different phone to them.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.840]   And then there are people who just will have
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.960]   to learn new use cases.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.800]   So if you're used to using Apple Pay
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.320]   by clicking twice on the home button,
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.560]   then tapping the terminal, all you'll do
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.720]   is click twice on the side button
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.280]   and tap the terminal is just as fast.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.680]   If you're used to tapping the terminal first,
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.880]   then putting your finger on touch ID.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.080]   With this you touch the terminal
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.320]   and then have to bring it back to your face,
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.920]   which is a slower process.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.560]   So there'll be a little bit of tuning into it,
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.680]   but other than that, it seems like it's comparable,
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.480]   if not slightly faster system.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.040]   But again, I only got a chance to see people
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.280]   using it, I have to try it.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.560]   We all have to try it ourselves.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.440]   - I know you didn't, I know, I'm guessing.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.840]   I'm guessing you have not been assigned a loader,
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.040]   a hard piece of hardware yet.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.920]   But if you have pretended you haven't,
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.320]   so how do you imagine that like,
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.480]   I mean, at this point though,
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.640]   the home button is such a basic part
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.840]   of the vocabulary of the iPhone,
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.040]   if you've been using it since day one.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.560]   Like is there anything that's kind of off putting to you
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.720]   about not having a home button,
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.720]   like a function that hasn't been remapped
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.760]   to something else really well?
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.360]   How quickly do you think you're gonna,
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.160]   it's gonna take for you to get used to not having a home button?
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.240]   - I've heard from people who have been using it for a while
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.800]   that it took less than a day,
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.280]   and then it's just swipe up as such a natural gesture,
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.160]   and many of us remember it from WebOS anyway,
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.280]   that you just swipe up and it feels totally normal.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.280]   And they did have to remap stuff like the accessibility,
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.200]   shortcut, the application,
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.680]   shortcut, all of that is on the side button.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.320]   Control center is now at the top right
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.440]   because there would be too much gesture collision
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.920]   if they left it at the bottom.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.120]   So there's a couple of concessions there,
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.880]   but swiping up, it just feels really natural,
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.000]   and it feels like, it feels like I'm about WebOS,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.880]   Andy, it's the best way I could say it.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.920]   I actually really like that gesture.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.440]   - Yeah, I know, though, but I'm glad you had a week
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.400]   because I've assumed that by now,
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.400]   after physical therapy and emotional therapy,
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.680]   your eyes and your psyche have healed
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.680]   from the experience of having to look at an iPhone screen
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.880]   with a black notch at the top.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.600]   I hope I haven't triggered you
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.840]   'cause I know it's a really emotionally devastating thing
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.920]   for so many people that there is a notch
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.160]   at the top of the screen.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.080]   Now, you're in a place of peace and love.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.760]   Nothing will happen here that you do not want to happen.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.000]   So you're completely in control.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.400]   But if you can possibly walk us through
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.400]   the harrowing experience of using an iPhone
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.480]   that has a black notch at the top of the screen, we love it.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.800]   - My experience is not a normal one
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.080]   because you're so excited when there's a brand new product
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.520]   that just like that excitement level
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.840]   lets you tolerate a lot of things
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.120]   that in the day-to-day average use you may not.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.400]   So I saw them, I could not unsee it.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.440]   I call it the horns.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.920]   I like that term because Craig better eat
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.280]   he's really good at flashing those.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.960]   Some people call it the forehead and the ears,
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.640]   whatever floats your boat.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.640]   I can't unsee it.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.040]   Like I did notice it, especially when I turned it landscape,
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.040]   you can shrink down things.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.440]   Like if you fill the screen with a movie,
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.880]   like I filmed it with Wonder Woman.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.200]   And at first I'm like, "Holy hell,
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.920]   "this is the world's first real HDR device, HDR
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.920]   "from color management, all the way to screen.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.520]   "This is blowing my eyeballs out."
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.080]   Then I'm like, "What's this thing on the left?"
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.680]   So you can't not see it.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.840]   When it's in portrait mode, it does sort of fade away.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.640]   But when it's in landscape and you see it sort of encroaching
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.800]   on apps and the apps have to be extra padded to go on the side,
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.400]   then you absolutely do notice it.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.920]   Will I notice it a week after using it?
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.400]   I think so.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.680]   I think that's the sort of thing that I'm just,
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.760]   like there's different kinds of people.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.600]   Some people could care less.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.160]   I think I'm the kind of person that it will always bother me.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.680]   I would love to be proven wrong by that,
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.440]   but I just think Andy, I'm not gonna get over it.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.280]   I'll put up with it, but I won't get over it.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.480]   Over Macho Grande?
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.440]   Well, I'm never over Macho Grande.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.400]   (laughs)
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.720]   But when watching video, doesn't it?
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.400]   Like black out the, when you go full screen,
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.040]   doesn't it accommodate it somehow?
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:40.880]   Like black out?
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.720]   Full screen you see the notch.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.240]   Full screen it goes around the notch.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.160]   When it's, sorry, when you go, when you fill up the display,
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.720]   like when you tap on it, you make everything big,
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.960]   so it fills up the display.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.760]   Then the notch, or the horns are really apparent.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.240]   When you shrink it back down, not so much.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.160]   Like it sort of goes end to end the way you'd expect.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.960]   Some developers were posting on Twitter,
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.280]   after, particularly after Apple posted user interface guidelines
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.880]   for developers on how to embrace the notch, so to speak.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.640]   But with the mock-ups of how, it seemed,
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.920]   I had a hard time not having seen the iPhone X in person yet.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.200]   I had a hard time thinking that was gonna be that big a deal.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.880]   Maybe part of it is that I have,
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.200]   I am a veteran of the Moto 360 watch,
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.240]   that has the infamous flat tire at the bottom,
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.320]   but that had that little archway at the bottom
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.280]   for the same reason why the notch is on the iPhone,
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.880]   because both the watch and the phone,
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.720]   they wanted to have no bezel whatsoever,
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.800]   and the cost of no bezel is you still have to put
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.400]   a sensor somewhere that's not being covered up by the screen.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.520]   And I found that it, yeah, it would have been better
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.120]   to not have it there, but I kind of ignored it
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.160]   after about the first half a day or something.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.000]   But it seemed to me like-
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.400]   - Like the turn it sideways half the time?
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.920]   Like if it was at the bottom half the time,
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.280]   it's like it's half the time.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.720]   - I mean, see it's, with some of these mockups,
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.520]   it just seemed like, well, what if Apple,
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.720]   between now and November, when they ship this thing,
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.760]   they just added a system preference that says,
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.480]   just make the top, just make the status bar black
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.120]   all the time, in which case,
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.440]   partly because this is an OLED screen,
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.760]   it will just simply look like your same black status bar,
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.080]   only now you don't have something in the middle of it,
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.360]   you have things to the left and the right of it.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.720]   I'd be more concerned if it were,
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.120]   I'd be more concerned if it were something
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.040]   that really affected the day to day use of it.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.600]   And I have a hard time seeing the notch as something
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.800]   that can't be adjusted with a software update later on,
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.720]   or something that I won't kind of get used to.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.320]   So I mean, I've kind of-
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.120]   - Yeah, they tried that.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.640]   I'm pretty sure they internally,
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.800]   they've had this for a long time
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.440]   and they've tried everything, they've hidden the notch,
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.440]   they've embraced the notch, they've done various the notch,
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.280]   they've done sometimes, notch, sometimes no notch.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.160]   And again, I think that they just made a decision.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.440]   I don't know if it was a marketing decision,
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.960]   Marco Armand had a really good article yesterday
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.640]   saying that it allows Apple to have an iconic shape again
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.880]   because the home button is gone.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.520]   And now when they make that sort of icon or that glyph
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.120]   showing the iPhone, it's unmistakable.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.400]   It doesn't look like an Android phone,
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.520]   it doesn't look like a generic phone,
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.200]   it looks like you tell immediately,
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.520]   "Oh, horns, it's an iPhone."
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.640]   And I don't know if marketing is the right place
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.480]   to make that decision.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.320]   - Yeah, attaching horns to the iPhone
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.200]   is a necessarily a great marketing decision,
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.280]   that's all I'm saying, you know.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.360]   - Yeah, also the essential phone also has a notch.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.000]   So it does look like an other thing.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.760]   - Yeah, but again, any time you see a design on Twitter
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.880]   or anywhere else, Apple's engineers have done
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.720]   20 variations of that and decided
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.920]   whether it's because of other issues
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.200]   or because of personal taste
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.560]   that they didn't want to go with that.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.560]   Some people have said maybe that it would affect burn-in,
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.320]   but like Samsung has shown,
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.760]   you can, I forget, shake the interface slightly,
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.040]   like wiggle it so that the pixels change
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:47.920]   and you don't burn them in.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.000]   So there's always workarounds for all these things.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.480]   I think ultimately it's just that they decided
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.360]   they wanted to embrace the horns.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.800]   - Yeah, I mean, if Apple wants to do something
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.080]   that's designed-designed-wise,
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.800]   it's not as though they don't care about usability,
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.920]   but there are, that's not a third rail to them.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.200]   It's like we will take some heat from this,
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.640]   but people are not going to buy an iPhone X
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.200]   because of the notch.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.560]   And if they work, if they aren't gonna buy it
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.280]   because of the notch, they would have gotten upset
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.120]   about something else.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.200]   So we can't really make everybody happy.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.920]   - I'm super curious about is the display,
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.240]   because the display is OLED.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.960]   It's a Samsung panel.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.840]   And no one ever called it Pentile,
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.160]   'cause I think that's a Samsung trademark,
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.640]   but it is a diamond RGB-B, whatever,
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.000]   a five pixel arrangement instead of the standard RGB
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.040]   that we're all used to.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.200]   I couldn't see, I looked at it.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.240]   I did not have my loop with me,
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.000]   so I couldn't, I didn't have a macro with me,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.640]   so I couldn't really get in there and look at it.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.040]   But I couldn't tell to the naked eye,
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.320]   and again, that might be the excitement
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.000]   of just seeing HDR Wonder Woman on a phone
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.360]   for the first time.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.840]   But apparently Apple's also doing a lot of things.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.280]   Like it's not that they bought the screen from Samsung
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.040]   and it's gonna be identical to the screen you get
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.120]   on a Galaxy S8.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.200]   It might be better, might be worse,
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.200]   but it's like, you know, Samsung manufacturers,
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.840]   their chips, but their chips are unique to Apple,
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.800]   and other people manufacture other components.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.720]   But they're unique to Apple.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.200]   And Apple sandwiched this together
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.440]   and did a lot of stuff from the sub-pixel
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.160]   to the color management, to the true tone,
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.000]   to everything to sort of make this their version of OLED.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.400]   And that's sort of the thing I'm most curious about
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.120]   is to figure out what Apple Display Team
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.080]   managed to do with OLED.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.480]   - Now, what about the rest of the phone overall?
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:25.120]   Does it feel like the Lux product compared to the iPhone 8,
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.760]   or does it just feel like a different design?
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:33.240]   Like the difference between like the ceramic watch edition
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.680]   versus the regular aluminum one,
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.880]   it really does feel like a premium version of that other one.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.520]   Does it, you get that sort of effect with the iPhone X?
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.000]   - The stainless steel feels better.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.240]   Like it just feels better than the aluminum.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.400]   That's probably a personal thing.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.760]   But, and the black one has a vapor treatment,
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.280]   which is sort of like DLC.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.360]   I don't know the chemistry exactly,
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.920]   but it's sort of like DLC on the black Apple watch.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.760]   So it feels harder, but also it just has
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.880]   a different feeling to it.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.520]   The black ones always feel like some sort of weird
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.080]   Kryptonite or Batman material to me.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.400]   They don't feel like a natural material.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.000]   They kind of look a bit like plastic,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.600]   but feel like steel.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.800]   And it's really grippy because it's a small phone.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.120]   It's about the size of an iPhone, a 4.7 inch iPhone.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.000]   But then your eyes are filled with that screen.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.560]   And it was impossible for me at least in the demo area
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.680]   to separate the experience of seeing it from holding it.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.320]   And so that sort of colored my judgment.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.000]   But the back is plastic, but on the black version,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.600]   especially the space gray version,
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.280]   it's almost seamless with the antenna band.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.440]   It's a very stark difference.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.000]   It's a shiny, shiny silver with like a pearl white
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.600]   on the silver version.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.000]   But the space gray version is black on black.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.320]   And that, I really like what the look and feel of that one.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.160]   - What's the back minute?
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.840]   - The back is glass because it does the inductive part.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.680]   - Same way.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.040]   - It's a thrice and plastic.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:44.880]   It's a no idea.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:48.720]   - No, it just feels like the DLC coating,
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.840]   the black Apple watch does not feel like metal.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.600]   It feels like a weird space material.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.200]   And this sort of has a little bit of that same feeling.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.280]   And it's matte.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.840]   Oh, the silver one is super shiny
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:31:59.880]   and the black one is not quite as,
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.640]   I mean, they did a good job at materials team.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.880]   - Awesome.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.760]   - Should we kick it over to Uncle Leo
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.680]   for a couple minutes?
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.040]   We can tell us about something wonderful
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.040]   before I just go on.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.640]   (laughing)
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.320]   - See that this is the price
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.280]   when you're the only one who gets to see the Apple campus
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.200]   and you're the only one who gets to see the iPhone 10.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.480]   You are the interview subject as much as you are the host
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.560]   at least until we think that something else.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.400]   - Absolutely.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.240]   Well, Carson, if we have it ready,
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.000]   can Leo tell us about something great?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.480]   - Let me interrupt for just a moment.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.920]   Yeah, I'm here, I'm back.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.720]   Well, not really, but I'm here anyway.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.640]   To tell you about FreshBooks.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.520]   FreshBooks makes running your business easy, fast,
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.720]   and secure with FreshBooks,
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.600]   all new versions of their cloud accounting software.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:43.480]   You'll never be at mystery as to how you're doing.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.720]   Let me tell you, I know about FreshBooks
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.720]   'cause I used FreshBooks for years
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.680]   when I was a freelancer, and this was a while ago.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.440]   FreshBooks started in, I think, 2004.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.400]   That's when I started using them anyway.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:58.160]   Since that 10 million people used them, including me,
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.360]   the first thing I did was use them for doing invoices
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.680]   'cause it made it so much easier.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.000]   It was a very painful task every month
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.280]   to send out those invoices.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.600]   And I was billing for expenses,
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.160]   so I put the expenses together.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.240]   If you're doing hours of even more complicated,
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.240]   FreshBooks takes all the pain out of it.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.280]   Use the FreshBooks app, you take a picture of the receipt,
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.080]   boom, it goes right in the invoice.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:23.680]   You bill for time and hours, or bill per project,
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.600]   or per team, or per client.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.560]   You can do all of that with the FreshBooks software
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.800]   or on the FreshBooks website.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.880]   You start the timer and the timer,
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.560]   and then boom, it goes right into the invoice.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.040]   And the thing is when they're sending out the invoices,
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.320]   that's your accounts receivable.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.560]   When they get paid, that's your accounts payable.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.320]   And all of a sudden, without you doing anything,
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.520]   you're keeping books and you can look at any time
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.680]   at your dashboard and say, "I made a profit,
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.440]   "I'm making a profit, or I'm losing money."
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.920]   You can adjust it on the fly.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.200]   Most entrepreneurs, I know certainly me,
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.520]   when I was doing this as a freelancer,
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.960]   you don't really know until tax time.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.920]   Did I make money this year?
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.440]   How much did I make?
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.720]   With FreshBooks, there's no mysteries.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.480]   You know everything, and that really means
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.240]   you can do business better.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.240]   They're constantly improving FreshBooks too.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.280]   I think that's so cool.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.160]   Time entries now are sort of chronologically
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.560]   on the invoice for you automatically.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.200]   You can see receipt attachments when you view invoices
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.200]   and the iOS app, employees can log into
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.120]   the FreshBooks mobile app for iOS
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.120]   so they can take care of business.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.240]   You don't have to do it all.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.240]   You can access FAQ articles with FreshBooks
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.360]   who help widget, just click on the blue question mark
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.720]   in the bottom right of your desktop
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.320]   and anything you need to know.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.200]   The beauty of this is, look, you didn't get into business
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.280]   to learn double entry accounting.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.280]   That's not, you know, I wasn't anything I was interested in
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.600]   unless you're, I guess, if your business
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.280]   is a bookkeeping business.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.880]   But even then, it's nice to have somebody
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.200]   doing the work for you.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.600]   FreshBooks does it all without you having to know
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.600]   anything about accounting, just in the process
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.600]   of your business, you get this hat, this is done for you,
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.000]   and man, you're gonna love it.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.920]   FreshBooks was included this year
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.720]   in the Forbes Small Giants list of 2017
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.720]   because they're not, you know,
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.760]   they're not a startup anymore, I guess,
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.600]   anymore than I'm a startup, they've been around a long time,
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.920]   but they just get better and better.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.880]   And every day, this seems like they've got a new feature
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.920]   on their dashboard.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:17.000]   The beauty part of this is, if you are using FreshBooks
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.960]   to send those professional looking invoices,
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.320]   it's easy for you, it's easier for your clients,
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.000]   they pay you faster, on average 11 days faster.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.960]   So it's a win all round.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.800]   You could try it free, you don't have to take my word for it.

[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.360]   - Thanks, Lee, I hope you're enjoying your vacation.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.600]   If you're interested in what Leo's doing,
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.000]   you can follow him on Instagram.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.280]   He will make you very jealous with his pictures.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.320]   I'm Renee Ritchie, I am here with Andy Naco
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.080]   from the Chicago Sun Times and Alex Lindsey
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.440]   from the Pixel Core.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.320]   And we are re-disecting what Apple announced at their event.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.600]   And Alex, I have a question for you.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.720]   Apple really went all in on displays this year.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.160]   Like even more than they had DCIP 3 before,
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.800]   they had Rec 2020, which I understand is like the next generation
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.520]   of color, wide gamut color support.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.360]   But now they've got their first real HDR display.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.080]   Previously, Samsung had HDR displays,
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:37.120]   but their color management was never great
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.760]   and they had to manually manage profiles.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.440]   And there's really not a lot of content for it.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.040]   Apple is doing everything from the chipset,
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:48.560]   supporting HEVC and HDR 10 and Dolby Vision,
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.160]   all the way up to the display,
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.760]   having a million to one contrast ratio to really show it.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.440]   And I didn't, I always knew that I liked HDR more than 4K,
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.600]   but I was really amazed with what you could do
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.680]   even on a small iPhone screen with HDR.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.400]   - Yeah, yeah, I think that,
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.240]   I think Apple had to do that when they did the update,
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.760]   because I think that you,
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.520]   they had been a little behind on the 4K process,
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.440]   not really behind.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.960]   I mean, there's really not that much people
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.040]   are watching in 4K yet.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.160]   But, you know, a lot of the TVs are all 4K.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.680]   Apple TV was like the last one, really go 4K.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.320]   The, I think that there's a lot of things
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.680]   that they had to catch up and if you're gonna do it,
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.760]   you know, you're not gonna do it again for another year.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.640]   It's kind of time to just handle all of those things
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.480]   at the same time.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.080]   At the, you know, also the HDR is really,
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.680]   is the distinguishing factor.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.920]   I mean, when you really start to see a great show shot
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.080]   in, you know, shot with HDR.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.600]   And when we think about how shows are shot in HDR,
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.720]   a lot of times what's happening is,
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.920]   is that these, a lot of stuff is shot in what's called log,
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.880]   rather than linear.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.200]   And so it's just a different way that the,
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.480]   it allows for a lot more data to be caught into it.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.360]   It looks when you actually look at a log file,
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.760]   it's very low contrast.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.480]   And so when we put it back to linear,
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.960]   you know, we can actually grab, you know,
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.400]   grab onto a little bit more of that.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.840]   And I think that's not exactly what we would think of
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.400]   as HDR most of the time.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.680]   I know I have some technical friends
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.560]   that will probably hate what I just said.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.600]   But, but, but a lot of times that's the easiest way
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.000]   to get to something that has a wider gamut
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.400]   than what we would normally have in video.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.000]   So a lot of times what you're seeing is,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.560]   is that kind of conversion.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.840]   But the, but it is gonna give you this,
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.160]   this wider gamut that you haven't,
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.880]   that you haven't seen before.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.320]   And when you combine it with high resolution,
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.120]   with 4K, it is stunning.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.240]   Like we do a lot of, like even if we're not,
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.120]   even if we're streaming 720p or 1080p,
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.360]   a lot of times our video system, you know,
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.920]   is recording at 4K.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.680]   And when you see the 4K itself, oftentimes, you know,
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.440]   it looks a mate, it looks almost better than 3D sometimes,
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.200]   you know, like more 3D than 3D.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.760]   But when you start adding that higher gamut,
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.200]   you know, I actually don't have an HDR TV,
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.440]   but I have a friend that has one.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.320]   And I've been over at her house watching, watching shows.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:09.440]   And it's, it is, I mean, amazing.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.920]   And I think that, you know, as we go into higher frame rates,
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:16.560]   as we go into HDR 4K, I was looking today,
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.600]   I was at IBC, which is the kind of the NAB of Europe
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.040]   for the last couple of days.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:26.160]   And they actually, NHK has the 8K TVs.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.280]   So just when you think that it was, it was over,
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:33.280]   when you thought that 4K was over, it was it.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.320]   There's 8K TVs, they're already there.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.520]   You know, they're already looking at them.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.400]   And I have to admit, the hard part is getting over,
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.680]   you know, a lot of the Japanese manufacturers
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.240]   like sharpening, they turn the sharpening up.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.680]   And so I actually found it to be too sharp.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.520]   (laughs)
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.840]   So it was, you know, it was like, it was hard to watch.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.720]   Maybe it was the content or whatever.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.680]   But the 4K, I think, is gonna be the right thing.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:59.000]   And I think we're gonna see 4K for probably the next,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.360]   you know, Brian next 10 years,
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.800]   is really where we're gonna see 4K next 10 to 15 years.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.880]   There's rumors that one of the Olympics is gonna be,
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.440]   the next Olympics, definitely gonna be 4K,
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.480]   but the Olympics after that, maybe an 8K,
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.480]   at least in some of the source files.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.320]   But I think that's--
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.800]   - And they were explaining there's two different HDRs,
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.960]   there's HDR 10, which is just sort of a spec
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.360]   and then Dolby Vision, which does frame by frame
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.440]   and gives you sort of targets to hit.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.000]   I don't know if I'm explaining that, right?
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.080]   - Yeah, Dolby, you know, the Dolby Vision is definitely,
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.840]   I think, a much better solution.
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:33.320]   It's just, it's not as adopted as, you know,
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.720]   as some of the other formats 'cause it's harder.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.280]   It's, you know, it's harder.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.480]   When it's harder, people are like, oh, that's really hard.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:43.560]   You know, so, so, you know, so you tend to,
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.400]   but it is, I think Dolby has really gone, you know,
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.960]   it's really interesting how they've moved
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.880]   from being known as audio to really spending a lot of time
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.680]   thinking really hard about everything from, you know,
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.800]   VR to HDR to, you know, they're really not, you know,
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.240]   they're really looking at total media science.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:05.760]   You know, if you're feeling it or watching it,
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.320]   yeah, I can imagine somewhere down the road,
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.880]   it's gonna be like Dolby smell.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.080]   You know, like it's like, it's like,
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.160]   it really smells like I'm there
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.360]   and I know that they're using Dolby smell for this.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.080]   - Dolby tactile.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:17.200]   - Yeah, yeah, Dolby tactile.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.000]   That just feels like the Adobe.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.800]   Not Adobe, but Dolby, this feels like the Dolby effect.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.680]   So it's good.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.560]   And I think that, you know, the big thing for Apple
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.920]   going all the way in, what's good for us as consumers
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.680]   is that that, of course, helps drive the market.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.360]   You know, so now we're gonna get,
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.000]   I think we're gonna see a lot of people just assuming
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.320]   that I wouldn't buy a new TV now that was an HDR.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.840]   Like I might have a Vizio that's a year and a half old
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.680]   or whatever.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.960]   But I wouldn't buy another one that isn't 4K,
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.560]   doesn't do HDR, that would be W absurd.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.280]   You know, so in that what that means for you,
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.520]   if you are gonna buy that,
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.240]   it means what's great for you is that this Christmas,
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.840]   it's going to be cheap.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.880]   And especially on December 25th to the January 2nd,
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:10.520]   you're probably gonna be able to get a 70 inch non HDR
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.120]   for like 600 bucks.
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.480]   You know, that's kind of coming
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.840]   because all these manufacturers that had HDR,
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.320]   and it's not, what's interesting is not because Apple has a
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.040]   majority position, 'cause they don't.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.640]   Roku has the majority position,
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.560]   there's other, you know, Amazon's got better penetration.
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:32.560]   But Apple has this kind of the thought leadership
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.240]   that when they say this is where we're going,
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.960]   it devalues everything that isn't going that way
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.960]   or isn't as much.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.880]   It doesn't devalue the stuff that's more,
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.240]   but there isn't that much more than what they announce.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.920]   - People who have seen iTunes 4K with HDR say
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.680]   that Apple did a really good job.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.720]   Like encoding it, it looks really, really good,
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.120]   even compared to some of the other HDR out there.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.240]   - Yeah, it'll be interesting to see, you know,
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.520]   I think that you may have to get back to a point
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.840]   where people start thinking about people who are using Wi-Fi
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:04.280]   for their Apple TVs may wanna get that Ethernet out
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.880]   and figure out how they're gonna get it over there,
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:09.240]   because I think that those UHDs are gonna be,
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.240]   they're gonna be big.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.520]   (laughs)
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.480]   - No more USB, but not gigabit Ethernet.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.760]   - Yeah, yeah, you need a good Ethernet.
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.040]   I'm gonna guess that you're gonna need a good Ethernet connection
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.440]   to watch those, or at least let them buffer for a little while
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.960]   to pick up.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:25.800]   - Yeah, and display-
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.080]   - I saw Jessica Jones intro Andy, and it was like night and day,
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.560]   because previously when I saw him on regular TV,
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.960]   it looked sort of muddy and washed out,
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.560]   but when I saw it in HDR, the yellows and the reds,
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:34.760]   it was like a feast from my eyes.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.760]   It was amazing at the difference.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:40.360]   - Yeah, I mean, my first, I've had all kinds of like,
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.920]   all kinds of like closed room demos of new screens
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.720]   for the past like five or 10 years,
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.480]   and there's always, it's always,
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.880]   hey, now it's HD, and here's the Parisian street scene,
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.360]   and now, hey, here's 4K,
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.440]   and here's a new Parisian street scene,
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.880]   where now you can see what kind of sunglasses
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.800]   people are wearing, and that's fine,
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.960]   but it's the HDR demos that really blew me away.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.800]   That they're seeing the sort of detail
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:07.320]   that I typically would only see on like a $4,000, $5,000,
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:10.680]   $6,000 screen, and I'd ask, well,
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.600]   how much is, what's the price point of this gonna be
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:13.800]   when you chip it next year?
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.000]   And they're saying, no, it's gonna be sort of a midline
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.080]   priced $1,500 screen, and before long,
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:22.760]   what makes screen technology unique is that
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.600]   there really is no good better,
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.880]   the good better best sales technique
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.480]   is isn't quite so dramatic.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.400]   At some point, the 4K HDR screen
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.800]   stops being the thing that, oh, your person who has a,
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.920]   who turned the kids room into a home theater two years ago
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.800]   has, and it becomes something where it's so,
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.200]   it'd be a lot more trouble to find a TV
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.600]   within your price range that does not have 4K and HDR,
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.080]   and we're gonna see that starting this year and next year,
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.960]   it really is gonna be just like a standard HD set
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.760]   where you just can't find 720p anymore.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.520]   It's everything, 'cause every single manufacturing line
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.280]   is now set up to create 4K screens
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.600]   and not just regular HD screens,
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:11.160]   and soon enough, every manufacturing line is set up
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.600]   to sell HDR as opposed to anything else,
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.160]   and you're just essentially gonna get that stuff for free.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.520]   And even this year, if you are,
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:24.520]   I've accidentally being a frugal bastard
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:28.760]   have played this exactly right because in my living room,
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.600]   I have a 1080 HD screen that I bought something
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.200]   like seven or eight years ago, and it works perfectly fine.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.800]   There's nothing wrong with it.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.920]   It's just that the back illumination,
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:43.440]   I'm getting that sort of dark halo
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.280]   around the edges of the screen,
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.920]   where if I'm watching Star Wars,
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.400]   it's like an Instagram vignette filter,
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.960]   I can see around it, so I keep telling myself that,
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.280]   okay, well, I guess that's becoming more and more annoying,
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.080]   and I should probably replace that,
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.480]   shouldn't I, and then thinking,
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.240]   but it still works fine, it's just a little thing,
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.920]   but now that I've, again, put it off
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.920]   for an extra couple of years,
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.800]   it's gonna be worth it to upgrade to 4K and HDR,
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.920]   whereas upgrade to just 4K would have been nice,
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.080]   but not great, so you'll see some difference.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.040]   - I also, I think that one of the parts of this announcement
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.920]   that made as much of a difference as Apple's saying,
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.600]   oh, we're doing 4K, was the deal that they struck,
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.280]   that all of us who have our HD content
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.440]   are automatically gonna get older HD,
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.360]   because what that's gonna do is put a huge demand
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.400]   on getting a new Apple TV,
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.320]   and a huge demand on getting new TVs,
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.800]   because it's not something that,
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.560]   I have a lot of movies.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.880]   I don't know exactly how many, but it's hundreds,
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:45.960]   of movies on Apple TV that now are automatic,
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.200]   this is the first time I think I can remember,
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.360]   when we went from one format to another,
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.320]   whether it was cassettes and albums to CDs,
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:55.880]   or CDs, and DVDs and DVDs to Blu-ray,
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.040]   and where I didn't have to go buy
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.640]   all my favorite movies again.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.240]   And so I think that that is,
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.760]   I don't have to buy the Matrix one more time,
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.760]   'cause I've got, I have an DVD.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.600]   - Except for David E.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.600]   (laughs)
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.400]   - Right, right, exactly.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.200]   So anyway, yeah, but I think that that is a,
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:17.160]   I think that that's gonna be a huge bump
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.800]   for the whole industry, for 4K production, for now,
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.800]   and most of our, most of the folks that we,
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.440]   Netflix and Amazon and all of these folks,
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:27.960]   that has been a requirement,
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.360]   since they started creating the content.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.480]   It's all been 4K, you know.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:37.560]   So that stuff is gonna be, you know,
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:40.680]   continue to be, you just give some somewhere to go.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.160]   - And I like that they're doing it across their line,
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.880]   because once you see it, like they mentioned that
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.960]   with the True Tone, is once you see True Tone,
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.960]   it's hard to go back, the other screen sort of look blue,
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.680]   and seeing the combination on iPhone X
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.680]   was especially interesting,
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.400]   because you've got so much going on,
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.800]   Apple's doing internal things to make sure that
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.400]   OLED white looks white, because when the media type changes,
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.400]   if you've ever done manual management of color profiles
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.520]   and other devices, you can sometimes have to recalibrate it
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.120]   for photos as opposed to web pages as opposed to other stuff,
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.840]   but they're doing a lot of that internally,
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:15.080]   and then they're also matching the environment with True Tone.
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:18.080]   So you get this sort of, it's hard to photograph,
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.200]   because sometimes the photograph,
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.480]   the camera does not pick up what your eyes picking up,
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.320]   but it looks like white, it looks like a piece of white paper,
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.240]   and not an overly cool sort of bluish display
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.120]   that you'd think you'd get.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.160]   And all of that going on at the same time,
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:34.240]   like managing the OLED process, managing the internal color.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.560]   So developers, for example,
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.600]   they don't have to make different color profiles for their app.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.400]   You talk to Sebastian DeWitt, formerly of Apple,
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.920]   and Double Twist about how hard it was
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.120]   to just get his app to look even passingly good
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.280]   on eight or nine different display technologies
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.760]   with different kinds of sub pixels,
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.760]   and he had to invent his own anti-aliasing at one point.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.920]   Just getting that for free,
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:56.440]   so you deploy an app on an iPhone X,
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.800]   or you deploy it on an iPhone 8,
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.200]   and it just looks great, Andy,
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.920]   and I think that is sort of heavy lifting
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.400]   that Apple had to deliver for this.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:09.880]   Yeah, it's all in all the next wave of iPads
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.720]   is gonna be just even greater,
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.160]   both with iOS 11,
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:18.040]   which I just finished installing before the commercial,
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.680]   and also this display technology.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:23.400]   It really is gonna become much more than something
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.480]   that can possibly replace your laptop
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.320]   for some people, for some circumstances.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.320]   For a lot of people, it's gonna be the preferred way
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.760]   to watch a movie,
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.040]   and also the preferred way to get things done,
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.840]   because it really is the integration,
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:36.680]   just like you said,
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:39.840]   of so many little technical flares
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.160]   and the display being not the least of it.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.160]   Yeah, and you have,
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.600]   but it's the same as previously.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.000]   Like, I always think that at some level,
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:47.960]   Apple's ID department,
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:50.600]   their industry and design department is trolling us.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.200]   Like, for example, they'll have touch ID on the iPhone,
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.040]   but not the iPad,
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.080]   so you sit there with your finger on it
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.080]   for five minutes and wondering why it doesn't open,
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.880]   and then they move the power button on the iPhone,
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.720]   but not the iPad,
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.760]   so you're holding down the volume button on the iPad,
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.480]   wondering why you're not going into sleep mode,
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.000]   or you're not turning off the screen.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.840]   And now they have Face ID on one,
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.280]   and touch ID on another,
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.120]   but not only that,
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.960]   they have these different gestures on one,
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.720]   and now you have promotion on the iPad, Andy,
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.560]   but you don't have it on the iPhone.
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:16.920]   You have True Tone on both of them now,
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.480]   but I wanna see promotion.
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.720]   It's just, I never get everything on one device.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.320]   You know, I think that we're gonna have
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.280]   to really challenge Apple now,
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.440]   because if there was ever a Face ID on the phone,
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.600]   it's really, really nice,
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:33.120]   but the iMac is screaming for Face ID,
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:36.160]   something where you sit down in front of something,
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.600]   and you've got plenty of,
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.320]   you don't have to put a notch in the screen
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.520]   in order to put that apparatus.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.720]   And so I think that if the next iMac,
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.640]   I mean, the next regular consumer iMac
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.880]   does not have Face ID,
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.280]   I think that that is the official it's done.
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:55.040]   Apple's, the Mac is, the fuse has been lit.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.880]   We just don't know how long until it reaches
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.480]   the barrels of barrels of this.
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:59.640]   - What if it has a notch though?
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.040]   What if it's edge to edge iMac with a notch?
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:05.040]   - You know, Apple is fickle sometimes,
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.320]   and sometimes they have like the holder grudge.
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.480]   I wouldn't put a pass them to,
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.000]   on the next iMac, we'll have a notch,
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.120]   but no Face ID, it'll just be a notch,
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.160]   just to mess with this.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.400]   - Yeah, you know, I, you obviously,
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.000]   like I realized when you were talking about that,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:20.840]   I was like, I haven't,
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.920]   the last time I logged into my iMac,
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.840]   because I have a watch.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:25.680]   You know, like, you know,
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.560]   as I just walk into the room,
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.760]   and I'm just kind of, I walk up to it,
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:28.640]   and it just kind of opens up.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.280]   I don't realize I haven't thought about that for a long time.
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.120]   So it's, you know,
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:33.640]   it's a, I wouldn't notice it.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.120]   - Yeah, it's a race now.
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.160]   It's a race on my, on my,
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.600]   my touch bar MacBook.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.440]   It's a race to see if I hit the Touch ID sensor first,
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.360]   on my watch unlocks it.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.040]   And sometimes one win, sometimes the other wins,
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.400]   but it's interesting that we have multiple vectors.
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:47.080]   There was a really good explanation.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:49.080]   I forget if it was, I forget who had it,
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.120]   whether it was Panzino or Gruber,
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.640]   but they were asking Craig Federicki,
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:54.360]   one of my longstanding requests was to have multiple vectors
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.200]   for unlock.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.560]   Like, I don't want Touch ID or passcode.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.520]   I want both because that way it's something,
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.360]   you know, it's multi-factor,
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.000]   something I know plus something I am.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.520]   And he answered, well, you know,
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.520]   we've thought about that,
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.880]   but what happens when, for whatever reason,
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.680]   your thumb, your thumb print fails.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.240]   Like you get D rolled, your hands are, are wet,
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.440]   you burn yourself something,
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.440]   and now you no longer have one of those factors.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:15.960]   We'd have to enable an emergency mode,
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:18.040]   and then you'd have to have like a long password or something.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.000]   And then suddenly you have to deal
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.720]   with three different tokens to get in.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.760]   And so it's all stuff that I get to thought about,
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.320]   and I confess, I hadn't thought about it that deep.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:26.760]   I just, I want, I just want things.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.360]   I leave at Apple, I figured out the details.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.200]   I just want them all,
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.960]   but it seems like to Andy's point,
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.760]   this is the ideal solution for many things.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.280]   And I know internally at Apple, it wasn't,
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:38.160]   we can't get Touch ID, what can we settle for it?
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.720]   We think Face ID is better,
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.440]   and we're gonna put it on this phone.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.440]   And if it really is better,
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.000]   then I would expect to see it on an iMac
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.680]   because once they can manufacture
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.840]   those true-depth cameras at scale,
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:48.880]   I just wanna have it everywhere.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.680]   I don't ever think about it again.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:52.480]   - I don't have any insight information
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.680]   about what the thought process was,
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:56.640]   but if I had to bet,
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.400]   I would say that step one is,
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.320]   we gotta get rid of that home button.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:02.720]   We gotta get rid of that bottom bezel.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.280]   How can we do that?
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:07.000]   And if it's a, well, we could do Face ID,
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.360]   but we would have to add this incredible
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.840]   3D projector array and find a way
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.160]   to stick that on the screen.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.120]   And we'd have to have some sort of like,
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:21.520]   we have to add neural net capability built into the CPU
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.680]   so that it could do all the math to make it work.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:26.360]   And someone said, no, we hate the idea
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.640]   of having a physical button taking up that much space
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.640]   so much that we would indeed prefer
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.360]   to perfect triangular wheel technology
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:39.720]   over around the technology to make this happen for us.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.600]   And, but the other thing is that,
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:46.000]   I think that it's kind of a misunderstanding
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.600]   that biometric security is about improving security.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:49.440]   It isn't.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:52.200]   It's almost always about improving convenience.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:56.760]   It's a way to give you a way to get access to a device
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.280]   that is secure enough,
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:03.480]   but never going to be as secure as a good password.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.200]   And so that's why, in my coverage,
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:10.440]   I'm certainly more open and more forgiving of Face ID,
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:13.200]   particularly because, as we talked about in the show before,
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.920]   Touch ID has its own problems of convenience
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:19.400]   and anybody who lives in the Northeast or Chicago.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.440]   Anyplace where it's cold and you like to wear,
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:25.520]   you need to wear gloves several months out of the year.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.200]   That's one obvious problem that Face ID corrects.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:33.200]   So I wouldn't be so keen on having a biometric stacked
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.640]   on top of a password.
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.040]   I like the idea that I can be in a situation
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.560]   where I can decide that I trust,
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:42.280]   I trust this specific environment enough
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.280]   to just rely on fingerprint ID,
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.880]   or even in the case of my home,
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:49.920]   I trust this environment enough to have my phone simply say,
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.080]   if you see this Wi-Fi base station
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.880]   and you can see these devices on the network,
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:56.360]   then don't even require any sort of unlocking whatsoever
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.520]   to just keep the thing unlocked.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:01.240]   But also when I'm traveling, now it has to go to a,
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:04.480]   for me, I actually have a password, not a pin,
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.920]   and it's so many words long
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.200]   that it is legitimately a pain in the butt.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:13.200]   It's like you have to decide, do you want,
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.520]   you really have to think that choice
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.920]   between convenience and security.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:19.360]   I put my bike ride and got it, went out to get a sandwich.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.600]   And for some reason, my Pixel phone decided
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:25.800]   that as I was stepping up to pay for it,
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.240]   that's when it decided that it wanted my password
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.640]   and not a fingerprint ID.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:35.400]   And I wish my password were only a four pin unlock code
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.440]   as it was last year.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.840]   Why did it have to, why did I have to make
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:40.720]   like an 18 character thing that I have to type?
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.200]   As people are giving, but they're sandwiches
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.400]   and they're pizza, they're giving me the stink guy behind me.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.080]   I'm like, new phone.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.080]   Sorry.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.880]   - Paul, Steve Gibson, type it in for you.
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:50.240]   - That's how secure it is.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.080]   - But that's exactly it.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.480]   You have to decide, do you want convenience?
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.360]   Do you want security?
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.640]   I think the best solutions always give you the choice
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:56:00.200]   of situational choices of how you want to secure your phone.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.360]   - I think they're really like Alex
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.680]   that I was asking for a while is that I wish that Apple
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.520]   would demand Touch ID before they do Safari Web Fill
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.960]   or iCloud Keychain Fill, because if there's someone
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:11.120]   in an emergency or just a friend who wants to use my phone,
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.520]   I don't want to give them all my credit cards
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.360]   and all my passwords just in case.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.400]   And they're starting to do that a little bit
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.920]   with iOS 11 where in apps, if you want to use your banking app,
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.960]   you can fill it with your Safari credentials,
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:22.800]   but you need to touch ID.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:25.280]   But my understanding is that Face ID is so fast,
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.400]   they're going to let you do that everywhere
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.160]   so that you'll have like sort of secure iCloud keychain
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.640]   on every device, on everywhere now.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:32.800]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that,
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:36.400]   I do think that the future of passwords is all going
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.840]   to be biometric because it is so insecure
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.320]   to make us remember all these.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.360]   You don't want to have a different password
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.480]   for everything that you put in.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:46.240]   So if something like the Equifax thing happens,
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.880]   it's not, they didn't have the same password that you had
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.800]   and six other things like your bank account
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.840]   'cause you thought that was important.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.560]   All of those things are, I think important.
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.120]   I've gotten to the point where I make these long
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:58.720]   was I have to admit that if I,
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.680]   half the time of my biometric doesn't work,
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.440]   I can't remember what my password was.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.600]   (laughing)
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:06.240]   What did I do with that?
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:09.520]   And especially the whole for me is really that,
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:12.480]   my last pass is on my, I don't let any browser
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.200]   touch my password.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.400]   So last pass has my passwords.
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.760]   And if I, but if I log in on a phone
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.800]   and I make a new password,
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.480]   it's like an extra step for me to figure out,
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:23.880]   you put the password into the thing
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:26.880]   and it's not as automatic as it is on my browser.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.920]   And so a lot of times I try to make sure
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:30.760]   that I'm on the browser to set my password
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:33.760]   so that I can, you know, so that it's somewhere,
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.200]   you know, that it actually exists
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.520]   'cause a lot of times I'll be like a mad
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.440]   and trying to get into something
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.560]   and I'll just reset my password
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:40.400]   and then I'm stuck.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:41.720]   You know, and I remember it for that day
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:43.120]   and then I don't remember what I did with that.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:44.960]   And so, so I, but the good news is
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.120]   I'm changing my password all the time.
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:48.040]   I'm constantly like, oh, I gotta change my password again.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.680]   And, you know, if I forgot it.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:53.680]   And so, but I think that, you know,
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:57.520]   I do think one of Apple's big selling points.
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:59.200]   I mean, I think they're very focused on it
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:02.000]   is the privacy, you know, whether it's, you know,
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.520]   not being followed by cookies or whether it's being,
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.600]   you know, our biometric.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:07.400]   I think that they're gonna keep on tightening those,
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.840]   those things ever so slightly.
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.400]   And I think that they don't go so far
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:14.840]   to get more government attention than they need to.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.240]   They're gonna get some resistance at every level,
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:20.400]   but if they jumped all the way where they could go with it,
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.400]   I think people will be a lot more upset.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:23.760]   But I think they're gonna keep on turning that up
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:24.760]   'cause that's a, you know,
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:26.600]   that is a differentiating factor
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.280]   because they don't, because they're not selling ads
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:32.240]   against you, they don't need that data, you know,
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:34.200]   and they don't have any really, any reason
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.520]   to help anybody who needs that data.
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:40.240]   That actually undermines everybody else's business plan.
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:41.240]   - They're not storing your face.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:42.720]   People worry that they were storing your face,
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.120]   they're not storing anybody's face.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:44.960]   - Yeah, they don't want that.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:46.360]   They don't want to store your face.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.760]   They want to do everything they can.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:48.680]   I mean, I think that that's the,
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:50.520]   and that, I think that Apple users,
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.000]   I think a lot of times are,
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.120]   there's a certain level of them that are,
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:57.600]   that don't want to be, you know, that are buying this
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:00.320]   because they know that Apple doesn't have a vested interest
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.160]   in doing it.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:02.000]   In fact, Apple's gonna do everything they can
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:02.960]   to make sure that there's no way
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.720]   that they could even be subpoenaed
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.800]   to give you any of the data.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:10.400]   You know, and so, you know, I think that it's gonna be,
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.680]   I am excited to see that they are least letting the,
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:16.200]   you know, the depth map, the grayscale depth map out
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.680]   so that people like me can have fun with it,
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:19.880]   or Snapchat, or other things like that.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.160]   - Well, that's super interesting.
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.760]   So they take the face data and they convert it
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.160]   with the neural engine block on the chip,
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.280]   converse that into math.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.760]   Math, it cannot be reconverted back into a face.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:32.040]   And then it stores that and it compares that
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.520]   with machine learning because it understands
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:35.960]   that it changes over time with the registered face
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.120]   and then we'll send an unlock, a yes or no token
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.080]   for the unlock.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.440]   But they also give, like we said,
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:44.560]   that a non-identifying depth map information to developers
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.720]   so they can do basically what Apple did with the emoji.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.760]   Like I became a poop emoji at the show.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.440]   And when I turned my head and when I spoke
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.920]   and it does a really good job mirroring what you said
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.640]   and it doesn't have to be the registered face.
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:58.960]   Any face, it'll just sort of reflect the movement patterns
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.960]   and the expressions that I made like grumpy faces
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.720]   and happy faces and I shook my head.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.440]   And that poop emoji has stuck with me,
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.360]   like completely tracked on to what I was doing
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.680]   for a good long time.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.120]   And that's available to every developer Alex.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.480]   You can make any app you want that does
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.040]   a sort of face tracking technology when they are kids.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:15.880]   - I'm really honest with you.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.800]   The tracking was better than some of the face tracking.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.880]   We've gone in the past where we have all these cameras
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.520]   and we've got dots all over someone's face.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.800]   And there's also, I was like, you know,
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.880]   I can just get a headset and just put an iPhone X
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.720]   like hang it in front of me and then put the mocap suit on.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.520]   And that might be the, and when you think about,
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:35.400]   I think I was looking at the iPhone X
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.040]   from a filmmaker's perspective of a lot of times
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.240]   we're doing all these storyboards and, you know,
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.520]   I could imagine having, and there's apps
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.240]   that let you do 3D storyboards.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.720]   So you can put a whole bunch of people in there
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:48.360]   and I can just imagine being able to connect to that,
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.280]   like having my iPhone have all my storyboards
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.000]   and I touch on someone's face and I just start talking.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.960]   Like I just start, you know, expressing myself.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.640]   And then it, you know, that the script lines
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.200]   or whatever I wanted to say,
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.920]   I think we're gonna end up with a whole bunch
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.920]   of these little like web cartoons
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:08.440]   that are done by creators, not by big studios,
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.600]   where, you know, the body doesn't move very much,
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.800]   but the head, you know, saying everything it wants to say
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.120]   and does everything it wants, you know, like,
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.080]   and it's putting all those out.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.000]   And they're gonna be funny little, you know,
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.880]   they're almost the next sketches of cartoons
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.680]   where someone could literally pick up their iPhone
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.840]   and do a whole little one minute, two minute,
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.840]   three minute sketch about some situation
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.680]   and it's that easy, like it's just boom.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.760]   And I don't think, you know, I'm the first person
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:34.600]   to think about that.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.440]   I think there's gonna be a lot of people
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.320]   who are making all kinds of apps
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:40.280]   that let us express ourselves through,
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.200]   hopefully not always doggy do-do,
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.880]   but, you know, whether it's characters
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.960]   or, you know, in the scarier version of that, of course,
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.840]   is that driving 3D models of people that we know,
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.760]   (laughs)
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.520]   you know, not necessarily through the phone.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.320]   You get a couple photos of a political figure
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.560]   or an actor, you can build a model of their face.
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.600]   And so I think that the, and then you'd be able to,
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.360]   you know, shape form that pretty quickly.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.280]   A lot of those technologies are very close to,
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.360]   or either close to the surface or on the surface
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.200]   at this point.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.320]   So being able to get people to say funny things,
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.120]   whether it's Donald Trump or, you know,
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.960]   or someone else is probably less than a year away.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.600]   - I didn't attribute it at the event
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:21.960]   because I didn't think the person would want me to,
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.280]   but there was someone who I'm guessing
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.160]   was a high-end videographer at the event.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.000]   And he sort of mentioned to one of the Apple people
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   in passing, he's like, to the effect of,
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.920]   why do you idiots still sell this as a phone?
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.640]   No one's gonna pay $1,000 for a phone,
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.200]   but I would pay $1,500 to $2,000 for this,
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.600]   just as a high, as a, you know,
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.400]   as a really awesome technological camera.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.480]   And you know, my guess is that, no,
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.400]   there's not that many people who would pay that much
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.840]   for a camera, but it did sort of switch around
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:45.920]   the way I was viewing this,
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.040]   is that it is a phone and where you switch it as a phone.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.280]   But his point was that I can't get these features
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.440]   on cameras and I want them.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.840]   And I think you're dumb to charge
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.080]   to sort of make it as a phone for people.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.880]   - Well, that's what consultants are for.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.760]   Those are the people who buy the iPhone for $1,000,
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:06.120]   write a $3,000 app for it and then charge $2,000
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.880]   for it in a custom case.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.720]   - So.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:11.840]   - And I think that, you know, I watch a lot of people say
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:13.280]   that people aren't gonna spend $1,000,
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.760]   but I mean, a lot of people have been spending,
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.600]   I think Apple has a pretty good sense of the fact
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.920]   that a lot of people are spending very close to $1,000
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.600]   for their phones as it is.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.640]   You know, like the, you know, like the,
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.280]   you know, if you look at the popularity
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:27.320]   of kind of a decked out eight or seven or six,
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.960]   it's not really that big of a jump.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.040]   So you get a fair idea of what that's gonna be.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.520]   And I think if Apple looks at the productivity
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:38.000]   of the iPhone X, how many they can actually make,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.480]   I think that, you know, they're definitely in that zone
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.480]   of that they know that it can't make enough
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:49.600]   to fulfill the, you know, the demand probably for six months.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.440]   Maybe it'd be--
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.640]   - They want people to buy iPhone 8
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.840]   to take pressure off iPhone 10 right now.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.080]   - No, I think that they just, you know,
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.840]   they put the iPhone 8 out because I think
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.480]   if they only bid the 10, it would have been,
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.320]   oh, Apple has jumped the shark, it's $1,000 or whatever.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.200]   But Apple said, okay, we're gonna give you the same thing
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:09.200]   you've been buying before, but then we're gonna give you
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:13.520]   another, you know, this is where we're going
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.600]   for the next round and we're not gonna be too contained
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.040]   about how much it costs, you know.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.800]   And I think that, I think they probably at $1,500
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.080]   a phone, people would go crazy and the press would be nuts,
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.240]   but they still sell as many as they can buy.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.280]   Because remember, a lot of people, if you're smart,
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.760]   shouldn't say this 'cause now I'm gonna have to compete
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.920]   with everybody, but if you bought two iPhone 10s,
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.240]   which I think will probably be the max, right?
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.280]   You'll probably be able to get to buy,
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.400]   I think you'll get to buy two phones.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.000]   Usually you get to buy two phones.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.400]   You'll be able to sell one for the first,
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.200]   no, like literally for the first three months,
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.520]   you would be able to buy one and sell one for,
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:50.160]   and get in, and basically get your iPhone 10 for free.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.000]   - Yeah, I was just thinking, I don't,
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.040]   I never assumed that Apple is going to send me review hardware,
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.920]   like day in date when it ships.
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:01.640]   And I do wanna make sure I get zonked out
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.480]   if I have to buy one.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.240]   So I will be up at 3 a.m. to buy one,
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.640]   like as soon as it opens.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.160]   And I was just reflecting on the fact that
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:14.000]   after the review is over, I might be able to make more money
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.400]   reselling the phone than I will from the column,
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.360]   that I review that I write about this thing.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.760]   (laughing)
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:24.360]   But there's a lot, there was so much to like about things
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:29.200]   that weren't actually products in those announcements.
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.600]   Yeah, I think that it would have been a huge mistake
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.880]   if Apple said that the top of the line phone
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.280]   is now going to be at least $200 more
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.480]   than what it's always been.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.480]   Where the minimum buying for the latest iPhone
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.600]   is always going to be $1,000 from now on.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.480]   I think that's gonna be problematic,
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:48.920]   particularly given that the trend is kind of
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:52.600]   to give you such a super phone for $1,000
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.640]   that it really is more like a tablet
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.080]   or to give you something that's practically as good
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.760]   as an iPhone 6 or an iPhone 7 for $400 or $500
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:01.720]   on the Android side of things.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.320]   So I think that would have been problematic,
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:06.160]   both as a marketing sort of thing
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.200]   and also as a battle for Apple's soul sort of thing.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.240]   But at the same, but it's worth noting that
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:15.800]   at the same time that Apple introduced a $1,000 high end phone,
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.440]   they also have kept pretty much the entire line
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.880]   in acting and knocked down the prices.
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.000]   So we finally have something that I've always wanted
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.840]   to see in Apple where if you want to have,
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.040]   basically if you want to buy it,
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.800]   if you want a $350 iPhone, you can buy a $350 iPhone
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:35.040]   or you can buy a $450 iPhone or $500 or $600 iPhone
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.800]   because you can still buy an iPhone 7
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.880]   and iPhone 6 all the way down to,
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.520]   I think that iPhone 5S is still there or is it?
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.080]   - I don't know, thank you.
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.400]   I didn't know whether they kept it going.
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:50.160]   But so you're not necessarily getting 2019 component,
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.640]   excuse me, 2017 quality components,
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.360]   but it's still an iPhone SE is still an exceptional phone
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.920]   and still compares exceptionally well
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:02.720]   with any Android phone that goes from between $150
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.960]   and $400.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:09.080]   So we finally, they kind of backed their way into it,
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.440]   but if you're complaining about the prices of iPhones,
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.360]   all you're complaining about is that I'm complaining
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:16.840]   that I can't get the exact, the highest end device
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.280]   that Apple makes for the price that I want to pay for it.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:22.160]   My problem with Apple pricing has always been,
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.280]   yes, but what if someone comes to you
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.840]   where they want a laptop, but they don't have $1,000
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:30.720]   and say, well, sorry, go again, go be poor, someplace else.
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.560]   I'm glad that if someone wants an iPhone,
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.440]   they want the benefits of an iPhone,
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.840]   pretty much if they have any practical amount of money
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.920]   to spend on a phone, except for the very lowest end
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.720]   of the price range, they can walk out with an iPhone
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:45.680]   that runs the latest version of the operating system.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.960]   - All right, so on that note, I'm going to once again,
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:51.360]   pick it to our vacationing leader in Chief Leo LePorte
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.160]   because I have a feeling, I have just a strong hunch,
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.080]   that he has another wonderful product and or service
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:57.920]   to tell us about.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.400]   - It will be back with more MacPray Weekly
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.000]   and just a sec starting to interrupt guys,
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.560]   but first a word from Capeterra.
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:08.280]   This solved a huge problem for me every week
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.880]   on the radio show, people would call up
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.480]   as if I were some sort of business software guru
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:16.760]   and say things like, you know, I have a doggy,
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:20.920]   dog setting business or I have a dentist's office
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.840]   and I need software to run it.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.120]   And what do you recommend Leo?
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.800]   I don't know.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.800]   You know what I do now, I send him to Capeterra.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:32.800]   C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A, Capeterra.com.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.040]   It's a free site.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.520]   It's a directory of all the business software,
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.480]   all the business, all the business,
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:43.040]   400 categories, thousands of programs
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.440]   and best of all, they're all ranked, rated
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.920]   and have real user reviews,
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.880]   hundreds of thousands of user reviews
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.400]   from people like you.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:53.920]   You know, people actually use the software.
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:57.880]   So this is much better than asking Leo or Googling it.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:01.400]   You know, you Google, you know, dog walking software
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:02.840]   and you're gonna find, you know,
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.440]   a bunch of stuff kind of random order.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.160]   Capeterra makes it easy.
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.960]   You go to Capeterra.com, you can pick the category,
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.640]   let's say, I don't know, medical office, okay?
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.600]   I meant it, you tell it, you can narrow it down.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.000]   You see already we got hundreds of programs,
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:18.840]   you can narrow it down.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.760]   So I only wanna see four star reviews
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.880]   and I wanna see stuff that's not web hosted,
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:26.000]   that's HIPAA compliant, let's me manage patients
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.600]   and I have 10 docs or whatever.
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.640]   You know, you set the parameters
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:33.080]   and then it'll narrow it, filter it down
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.000]   to just those apps that do what you need to do
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.160]   in the way you need to do it.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.920]   And then you look at them, read the capsule reviews,
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.640]   look at the starred ratings, look at the reviews
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.440]   and then say, let me look,
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.640]   I wanna dig deeper on this one, this one,
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.440]   this one, you can make a comparison chart.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:47.920]   It tells you everything you need to know
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:51.200]   and narrow it down to the right software for you.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.520]   Whether you're a startup looking to keep better track
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.760]   of customers and nonprofit,
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:57.440]   I hope you have a record fundraising year or a business
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.280]   that simply needs better payroll software,
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.480]   you'll can find the software you need at Capeterra.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.800]   Capeterra's got you covered.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.720]   And this is, I'm telling you, it's free.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:10.720]   There are no follow up emails, there are no phone calls,
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.720]   free as in free, no cost, no obligation.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.720]   It's a service from Capeterra that you've gotta know
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.040]   about, join the millions of people who use Capeterra
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:23.480]   every month, yes millions every month.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.240]   And that's why they've got so many great reviews,
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.120]   it's so useful, it gets better all the time,
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.440]   capeterra.com/macbreak.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.920]   Don't call the tech guy, don't search the web,
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:35.680]   go to capeterra and find the software you need,
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.480]   capeterra.com/macbreak.
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:41.200]   Thanks guys, on with Macbreak Weekly.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.200]   - Thank you Leo, I hope you're having a blast.
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:47.720]   I am here with Andy Nocko from the Chicago Sun Times
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.720]   and with Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.080]   And we are talking about just a little tiny
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.800]   slight bit in you from the last week or so.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.160]   One of the things that fascinated me, Andy,
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.000]   is going into the show,
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.320]   Srinity Caldwell, mutual friend,
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.600]   she was not convinced about the new Apple Watch,
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.160]   she wasn't sure what to make of it.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.120]   We were discussing anything,
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.400]   I don't really want LTE on my watch,
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.120]   I'd much rather they didn't always on display
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:08.960]   or something.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.440]   And by the end of the show,
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:13.200]   that watch had eclipsed iPhone 10 in her eyes.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.160]   And to her it was the standout hit.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.280]   And just, I don't know exactly what it was,
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:18.640]   I have to quiz her on this more deeply,
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.880]   but there was some combination of just the freedom
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.720]   that the LTE will allow
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.680]   or just Apple's continued focus on.
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.040]   Like they added skating workouts,
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:26.960]   so that's huge for her.
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.680]   But what was your sense of Apple Watch
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.600]   as maturing as a product?
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:35.200]   - I think that, I agree, I think that as easily as important,
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.440]   a piece of a new size, the iPhone 10,
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.960]   even though the watch with LTE,
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.880]   it's an incremental thing.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.560]   It's not gonna be a breakthrough for many people,
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.360]   given that you're still gonna have to,
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.120]   it's gonna cost you 10 bucks more a month,
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.480]   and a lot of people have to ask
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.040]   if it's gonna be worth 10 bucks a month.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:56.160]   Apple, I haven't talked to my Apple people yet about it,
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.200]   but during the presentation,
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.920]   they didn't highlight,
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:03.000]   and now it allows you to use the Apple Watch completely
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.040]   divorced from your phone.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.040]   Any time they talked about the LTE,
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.520]   it was within the context of,
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:12.800]   now when you go out for your run for half hour
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.080]   to maybe 82 minutes,
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.480]   you don't have to have your phone with you.
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:19.280]   And maybe if you go for a swim in the pool,
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.160]   you can have your iPhone back at the car
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.920]   and then come back to your phone and the car.
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.800]   They seem to be talking about it
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.480]   as a convenience feature
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:30.720]   so that you don't have to have your phone with you always,
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.160]   as opposed to something that lets you
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.600]   have a completely phone free day.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.040]   But it's such a great thing that it works
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.280]   just like the iPad where if you wanna,
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:42.800]   it seems to me like it's worth the extra 50 or 60 bucks
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:45.360]   to have the LTE option in there,
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:48.640]   given that it doesn't really make the watch any bigger,
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.920]   the presence of the hardware doesn't drain the battery,
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:54.920]   and you can just, just as with the iPad,
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.640]   you can elect to have the hardware,
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:57.840]   but not turn on the service,
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.280]   and just in several months in the future,
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:03.440]   if it turns out that LTE is something that works for you,
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.040]   then you can then activate the service.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:09.840]   But it's dazzling to me to see what to me
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.960]   is one of the biggest turnarounds
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.960]   that Apple has done in any one product.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.960]   This was every single time with us from last year onward,
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:21.040]   they have totally reversed that really horrible introduction
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.640]   they did with this device where it's like,
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.080]   I will never get over the,
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.840]   and look, I'm opening my garage door with my watch.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:33.280]   Look, you can actually watch the garage door opening,
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:35.640]   and you're like, there's never been,
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:38.320]   I've never been in a room where it was so easy
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.160]   to tell the difference between the actual press
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.480]   and like the people, between the Apple employees
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.800]   and the people who were either invited guests or press
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.520]   or analysts because Apple people who are excited
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.560]   about like new stuff, yay, well, that's great.
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.880]   Everyone else was like,
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:56.080]   huh? (laughs)
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.520]   Why would I want to watch my garage door open
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:59.520]   with my watch?
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.920]   It's not, it really did underscore for me that,
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.320]   to make a really great product,
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:08.200]   you do need great software, you do need great hardware,
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.720]   but the one thing you can't succeed without
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:13.000]   is a clear mission, a clear purpose,
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.640]   something, a target that your team is working towards.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:16.880]   And I think it was pretty obvious to me
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.800]   that with the Apple Watch team,
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:21.000]   they did not have a goal they were working towards
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.400]   until about a year and a half after release.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.840]   It became clear that they're either through
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.840]   customer conversations or just internally
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.280]   that decided that, okay, this is a fitness watch.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.440]   This is a fitness device, it's a health device.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.600]   And it has cool features that get notifications
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.400]   from your phone and stuff like that and for navigation,
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.240]   but primarily every feature, everything we do
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.120]   for this device is going to be to help out people
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.160]   who care about their health and care about their fitness.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.640]   And just that level of focus has revolution.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:52.920]   Even if you have like, this my watch is a series one watch
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.280]   and really just this change in focus
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.680]   and the ways that the watch OS has been sharpened
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:02.000]   in the past few years is it made this watch so much better
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.320]   and so much more useful than even the waterproofness
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.480]   and the GPS and the LTE has.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.240]   And just like with the phone, I think it's wonderful
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:14.720]   that they have chosen to keep the Apple Watch series one
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.200]   in the product line and now cut the price all the way down
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.360]   to $250 as the minimum buy-in.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:23.920]   And that puts it smack dab in the heart,
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:27.200]   in the zone of every other really good health
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:28.840]   and fitness smartwatch.
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:32.000]   So it's totally competitive with a Fitbit,
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.600]   it's totally competitive with a Garmin fitness watch.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:37.720]   It's certainly not as cheap as a $110 fitness band,
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:39.520]   which are also really, really nice,
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.640]   but it's no longer really competing
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.520]   with the right target price range.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.720]   I think there are always going to be a lot of people
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.720]   who just can't figure out $400 for a watch,
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.880]   let alone a gadget watch.
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.080]   But when you say that here is for about the amount of money
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:58.760]   you would spend on a decent wristwatch of any stripe,
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:02.480]   how about you choose as you offer as, excuse me,
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:05.400]   you consider as one of your options this Apple Watch,
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:09.760]   which even if you don't care about its digital things,
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:13.480]   is still in and of itself a very cool watch.
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:16.880]   And this is, I'm not like you,
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:21.320]   this is only my third band, including the one that came
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:22.920]   with it. - Okay, you're there.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:25.840]   - Your Instagram will wear me down, I'm sure.
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:26.680]   - Yes.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.080]   - But even just something as simple as now they have
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:33.280]   these not that are not terribly expensive, they're 50 bucks,
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.040]   but they are for a user like me,
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.120]   this is exactly the band that I was hoping to see,
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:42.960]   because it's more formal than the plastic band.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.560]   It also doesn't rip my big Russian,
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:48.440]   it doesn't rip hairs out of my wrist every time,
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.160]   I put it on and take it off.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:52.440]   And so it looks nice, it looks dressier,
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:56.960]   but I still can't justify $500 for a stainless steel bracelet.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.160]   And so it's these little things that have made this
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.520]   such a compelling thing.
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.000]   Really the best, the highest compliment I can pay
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.920]   the Apple Watch is that, remember that my phone
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.240]   is an Android phone.
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:11.880]   It can do Jack squat with the Apple Watch,
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:15.160]   but I still choose to wear this just as a cool watch
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.400]   that I like to put on every day.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.520]   - No, it's interesting to me, like,
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:21.240]   so the cellular thing, they're doing it the way they did GPS,
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.200]   and that is it really to conserve power,
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.400]   because I think it has just an hour of talk time
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:28.000]   on its own because it's got a tiny, tiny little battery still,
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   and they did everything they could,
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.560]   they put the antennas around the screen,
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:33.280]   but the thing is like, if it can use your iPhone,
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.160]   it will use your iPhone because that's much more power
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:37.120]   efficient, but for things exactly like what you said,
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.520]   when your iPhone just isn't there,
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.600]   when you're swimming, when you're out running,
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.600]   if you leave it in your car and you just want to buy something,
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.240]   you just want to answer a text message,
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:46.520]   it can do all that now, and it'll do it as efficiently
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.480]   as possible, it'll wait to get updates,
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.880]   when the network signal is really good,
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.560]   and it'll do as many updates as it can,
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.720]   and it'll do a conversation if it really has to.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.360]   There's a couple caveats, Alex, and some of these affect us,
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:01.440]   like for example in Canada, only one carrier has it at launch,
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.200]   there's only Bell support, there's no tellers,
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:06.120]   there's no Rogers, but also it doesn't roam,
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:09.120]   so if you get your Apple Watch with LTE set up in the US,
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.440]   once you leave the US, none of that functionality
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:14.320]   is going to work anymore because it can't reassign itself
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.720]   dynamically as you swap SIMs.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:18.480]   >> Yeah, and I think that, I mean, obviously for me,
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.800]   that'll probably impact me a little bit more than
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:25.680]   a lot of other people, but I think that's also why
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:28.840]   they're not selling it as a standalone device,
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:31.200]   it is something that is an add-on to what you're doing.
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.760]   I think that there are some prize and power considerations
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:36.800]   that I bet you it does very gracefully switch over to,
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:37.920]   oh, I'm back near the watch,
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:41.200]   I'm just going to use the watch rather than use my antenna,
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.800]   and so I think that I bet you doesn't,
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:47.640]   I'm sure we'll test it, one of us will test it very quickly,
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.960]   but I bet you doesn't last very long
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:52.400]   if you just leave it on LTE, then my guess,
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.720]   my bet is two hours.
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:56.560]   (laughs)
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:57.840]   And it's dead.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.800]   >> And if you're rolling it worse because it's not optimized.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.240]   >> Yeah, so I bet you it's a very short lifespan
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.600]   for a watch that's trying to do LTE,
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:09.480]   so I mean, given what it does to the phone,
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.880]   when it can't find LTE or what's working hard,
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:16.880]   so I mean, as soon as you turn off LTE on your phone,
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.080]   it'll last forever.
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:22.120]   So we know how it kind of affects that.
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:25.680]   So I think that, but I love it, we were already,
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.120]   I was at, again, at this video conference,
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.880]   and I walked up to the folks that make our intercom.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:33.360]   When you're doing live events,
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.040]   your comm system is everything,
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.400]   like how you talk to everybody,
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.240]   and there's PLs, and there's people,
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.120]   and there's direct lines,
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.520]   and there's all this stuff in four wire and two wire,
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.600]   and clear comm is the company we use for all of our comms,
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.440]   and I walked up and I was like,
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.640]   "So when are we getting the clear comm on our watch?"
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.360]   'Cause I was like, "Now I can put my little air pods in,
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:52.120]   "and I can have my watch, and I can just walk around
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.320]   "and talk to people on comms."
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.200]   And their whole thing was battery,
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:57.440]   and of course all of them said,
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.040]   "We're gonna talk to our boss, I think we really need
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.720]   "to start testing it, which means we all have to get new watches."
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.400]   And they were very excited about the fact
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:04.800]   that a customer was actually asking.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:09.320]   But I think that that's gonna be,
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:10.880]   there are so many really interesting things
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.720]   we're gonna be able to do with it,
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:17.200]   that I think, and I'm just happy,
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.520]   I think that they really struck on something
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:20.920]   that is a pain point,
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.640]   which is that you go to the beach,
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.640]   or you go to the pool,
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.160]   and you don't wanna jump in the pool
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.600]   and leave your phone in a public area,
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.480]   but you also don't wanna not be able to connect
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:31.320]   and talk to people.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.840]   And so I think the kind of examples that they had there
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.480]   were perfect.
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:40.480]   - Yeah, I really do hope that Apple does make the Apple watch
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:43.720]   either multi-platform or something that is perfectly usable
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:45.480]   as a standalone device,
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:49.480]   because I really think that this is above,
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:51.520]   of all the things that Apple makes,
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.960]   of all the pieces of hardware that Apple makes,
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:56.160]   it has the greatest potential to really help human lives
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.520]   by improving human lives, improving human health,
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.240]   and extended human life,
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.080]   and to limit it just as an iPhone accessory
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:08.080]   really puts the brakes on the potential of this device.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.320]   And I don't think they would have to do a whole lot
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.440]   either.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:14.440]   I mean, even just one of the things I found that,
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:18.200]   of course, because this doesn't connect to a phone,
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:19.400]   so I keep it in airplane mode.
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.960]   And if you keep this in airplane mode,
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.400]   you get at least two days out of it,
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.040]   like two and a half days.
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:28.760]   And so if I just, if I had the ability,
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:31.560]   even if they couldn't make it multi-platform,
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:34.600]   if I just had the ability that when I take it back home
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.920]   and turn on Wi-Fi and it sees my Mac,
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:39.800]   it could at least sync my health data to my Mac
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.800]   or to my iPad or something like that.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.360]   There's so much they could do with this
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.680]   by making a standalone device and multi-platform device.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:49.080]   And you just think about how the iPod
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:50.360]   or the iPhone would have been limited
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.080]   if you could only use it with,
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:55.200]   if you had to have a Mac in order to take advantage of it.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.360]   I do think that that's where Apple's going with it.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:00.600]   I think that the LTE is one step towards that.
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:02.120]   But if they really,
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.960]   what we've seen over the past couple of years
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:07.200]   really does prove that Apple has incredible amounts of faith
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:09.760]   and incredible hopes for the Apple Watch.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.400]   And so if that is true,
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.760]   then I think that they're definitely going to try
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:14.760]   to make it multi-platform.
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.120]   - Or just you have your Apple Watch,
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:18.160]   you have your AirPods and you have whatever the monocle,
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:20.560]   the Apple monocle that you need to get an AR screen
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.240]   in front of you and that's all you need to leave the house
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:23.400]   with anymore.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.160]   - Yeah, it really does, it does make all the reasons
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:29.520]   Apple had for getting rid of the iPods.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.440]   When you, I also own a pair of AirPods
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:37.440]   and this plus AirPods, it really is a terrific music solution
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:41.520]   particularly when they, with a new update to WatchOS,
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.520]   lets me have like more than one playlist.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:45.800]   That's going to be pretty cool.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.840]   When Apple music comes to the watch as well,
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:51.240]   that's going to be, okay, maybe,
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:54.960]   I wouldn't have spent necessarily five or $600
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.800]   going, walking in and out of a store
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.760]   to have a replacement for an iPod
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.600]   that consists of a watch and AirPods.
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.760]   But okay, I was, I had the watch anyway
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.680]   and I was going to buy the AirPods anyway.
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:07.320]   And now we're just realizing that
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:11.000]   if I want to walk around with my usual like cycling music
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000]   and just not have to worry about taking up storage
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.760]   on my phone or taking up battery on my phone,
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:16.680]   this really is a great solution.
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:17.520]   - There are a couple of things.
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:19.000]   You mentioned Apple music is coming later.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.280]   A person to person Apple Pay is coming later.
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.040]   iMessage sync is coming later.
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.400]   Also that air power, that little pad they have
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:27.320]   that lets you charge one or two iPhones
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:29.120]   and up to a total of like an iPhone,
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:32.200]   a AirPods with a case that's coming later,
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.680]   an inductive charging case is coming later
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.520]   and an Apple watch all at once.
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.880]   That's coming I think next year.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.880]   But it's interesting to see Apple sort of pushing,
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.200]   you know, they are announcing still ahead.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.480]   We haven't seen the HomePod yet,
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:45.000]   we haven't seen the iMac Pro yet,
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.160]   but now we have other new products to look forward to as well.
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:51.800]   It's going to be such an expensive Christmas.
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.160]   - Yeah, that's--
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:54.000]   - Yeah, we haven't even, I mean,
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.400]   with the iMac Pro and with the speaker,
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.760]   I think that we're still kind of in the thick of it.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:00.920]   And that's when, you know, I think that some of the stuff
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:03.560]   that I, that the kind of the coated stuff
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:04.880]   that you get from Tim Cook, you know,
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.160]   a year ago, he's like, we're really excited
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.080]   about what's coming up.
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:09.920]   And he stares at him.
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:10.760]   (laughs)
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:12.320]   Like, we're not, like, we're not,
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:13.920]   I know that you all think that it's over,
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:16.720]   but we're really excited about what we got.
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:18.800]   Because all of these products that we're looking at today,
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.120]   they didn't start, they didn't start working
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.560]   on them last spring, they started working on them
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:22.760]   two years ago, you know?
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:25.200]   And so, so when they're looking at what they're,
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.960]   what they're rolling out, you know,
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:29.680]   these are very long curves that they worked on
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:31.360]   for two years or three years or four years.
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.000]   - That's why on a chipset was three years in the making,
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.640]   they said the Neural Engine block
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:36.280]   was three years in the making.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.320]   - Yeah, so, you know, it's, there's a, you know,
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:40.120]   I think that they're really hitting on all,
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:41.480]   at this point, I think they're hitting
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:43.600]   from a product perspective on all cylinders.
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:46.240]   And it'll be interesting to see, you know,
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.400]   of course, I look down the path and go ahead.
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.480]   So I wonder what the new Mac Pro's gonna look like.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:52.160]   - Yeah, I'm not into next year yet.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.000]   The next one.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.560]   - I hate to, again, I hate to be Debbie Downer here,
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:59.480]   but I want you to think about the genuine excitement
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:02.040]   in their eyes and in what they chose to talk about
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.360]   the iPhones and the genuine excitement
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.480]   in which they just talked about the charger
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:09.880]   for the new iPhone and for the Apple Watch and everything.
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:12.640]   And I want you to compare it to everything they've said
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.880]   when they've announced new stuff about the Mac.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:19.080]   And then we'll put, let's pour ourselves a glass
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.600]   of something, of something alcoholic.
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.840]   And then we can talk about whether or not Apple
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:26.160]   is really excited about the Mac or not.
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:28.040]   - Well, I think the one, I mean, that bionic,
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.880]   I think it's three inches, click a Mac.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:33.360]   - I think that, I think that the thing that is interesting
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.880]   is the ecosystem that they have to support.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.400]   So if you look at, Apple is now, I mean,
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:41.080]   they're, with their Pro, you can do some development
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:44.080]   in VR, or the iMac and the iMac Pro,
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:46.440]   you'll be able to do some development in VR.
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:47.800]   I think that the problem they get into is
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:51.840]   because they felt, because the Pro specifically fell behind,
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:54.440]   you watched Oculus move off of something
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:57.040]   that was originally developed on a Mac,
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.880]   moved to Windows.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:04.880]   Now that's an ecosystem moving away from you.
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:07.560]   And I think that that is the one part
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:11.120]   that Apple may or may not wanna necessarily lose traction on.
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.320]   So I think the one argument that they,
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:14.120]   you may make, I mean, I think the iMac Pro,
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:15.600]   maybe all they need.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.520]   But when you talk about being able to have the extendability
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:21.000]   to be able to do some of the stuff that you want,
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.680]   it's more than just losing a product line
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:29.240]   that maybe is 1% of your business.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.360]   It's that product line is also being sold to the folks
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.680]   that are deciding what platform they're gonna develop,
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:36.160]   the next consumer market on.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:40.640]   And I think that's the only reason that they stay in it.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:42.320]   I mean, you've got editors, you've got people,
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.760]   you've got a lot of creative professionals
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:47.560]   that are, that when you go into a press room,
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.120]   you don't see a lot of PCs.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:52.840]   You know, and so anyway, so I think that,
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:57.280]   that ecosystem is important for a lot of other reasons
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.840]   rather than just pure direct sales to consumers.
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.640]   - Yeah, that's also important.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.640]   But again, the message from WWDC is that we love the Mac.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:12.760]   We think the Mac is a really important platform
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.560]   for developing software and content for iOS devices.
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:19.440]   They're not, the fact that they went to,
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.960]   they spent a whole hunk of WWDC talking about
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:24.640]   their commitment to the Mac without once mentioning
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.080]   the Mac mini.
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:32.120]   Wolf, I mean, that's an omission of note.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:36.920]   Whether it means that they now have no interest
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.720]   in making consumer, they have less interest
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.280]   in making consumer grade Macs,
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:43.280]   or it means that they tend to replace the iMac
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:45.680]   with something that can complete the mission
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:49.520]   of a low cost entry level desktop headless Mac
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:50.480]   in a different form factor,
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:52.280]   like something like an Apple TV form factor
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:57.280]   that just has USB 3 and an SSD built in
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.560]   and wireless and that's it, remains to be seen.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:04.040]   But I'm just saying that I'm very, very concerned
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.480]   at this point.
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.400]   - You're not dead to be down to your Andy anxiety
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:08.920]   and I feel it with you Andy.
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:11.120]   - I'm Randy Reelis, that's what I know.
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.640]   - Randy Reelis, no, I mean, it's absolutely legitimate,
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.400]   especially now when you're on your iOS device high,
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.800]   is all these people using Macs, it just,
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:18.640]   don't have to.
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.960]   - I still think, I'll repeat that I think that Apple
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:24.280]   is gonna, I think that they will, but they,
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.680]   if I was Apple, if I was running the show,
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:29.160]   let me tell you, I would get to a point
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.920]   where I was comfortable with that iOS is really all I need
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:34.600]   and I'd keep on merging these two things together
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:38.600]   and then I would release OS 10 for free
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:40.600]   so that people can put it on, I'd say this is the spec
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.760]   that we only promise it's gonna work on these computers,
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.720]   but if you wanna put it on PCs, you can.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:47.160]   And that would be like, I've now left the house
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:49.600]   and I'm going to burn it to the ground.
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.480]   Because it's, I think that that would be the easiest way
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:55.840]   to burn most of the PC market to the ground is to just say,
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.680]   we're gonna let everybody use it.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:01.320]   We don't need that for our revenue anymore.
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:03.560]   - And on the next day, you ship the iOS Mac
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:06.160]   on these bionic chip.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:10.760]   - Yeah, no, like when you decide that I don't need
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:13.600]   this house anymore, I've got, maybe I'll,
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:18.720]   and you can do your development on your iPad Pro
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.160]   and you can do everything where the iMac now ships
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:23.200]   with iOS or whatever that is.
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:25.400]   Like we've decided that this is the new operating system.
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:27.000]   You just dump the other one out there and just say,
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.160]   "Yeah, everybody can use that too.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.840]   It's not connected to a chip."
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:34.520]   And watch the swirling insanity.
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:36.000]   'Cause there's so many people that would love to have
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.960]   a Mac on their super powerful for GPU PCs.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.000]   - On their quantum computers.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.920]   On that note, I'm gonna kick it to Leo one more time
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:47.200]   and then I come back and ruthlessly interrogate
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:49.560]   both Andy and Alex on their picks of the week,
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.920]   ruthlessly interrogate.
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:53.000]   - I will tell you nothing, Nazi swine.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.560]   (laughing)
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:55.640]   - I hate to interrupt again.
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:59.680]   I'm on a boat right now, floating up the river.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:04.360]   But I wanted to tell you that I am confident
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:08.320]   that I have not lost my camera, my wallet, my keys,
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:13.320]   my luggage, because I track it all with the tracker.
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:15.000]   I love the tracker.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.160]   I have put on my keys now, the tracker pixel
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:19.720]   fact the other day, it kind of is embarrassing.
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:22.480]   I thought I lost my keys and I was wearing a Scotty vest,
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:24.880]   and I has all those pockets.
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:26.760]   And I don't know if you've ever had this happen to you,
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:29.640]   but I actually lost my keys in my jacket.
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:32.600]   'Cause there's, I've had the usual pockets
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:35.680]   that weren't there and I was at a rock show.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:39.440]   We were seeing a Led Zeppelin tribute band.
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:42.480]   And I'm looking at, I said, "Oh, at least I lost my keys."
[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.520]   Maybe I left him in the bar.
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.200]   Next door where we went for a drink before the show.
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.320]   So I went next door to the bar and I asked the bartender
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.080]   and he just said, "Hey, keys, no.
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.720]   I'm looking around and I'm like,
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:53.760]   oh wait a minute, I have tracker."
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.280]   There's a tracker on the keys, of course.
[01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:59.320]   So I opened up my phone, I opened the tracker app.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.520]   It said, "They're right here, but I said, 'Well, I don't see 'em."
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:03.680]   So I pressed, there's a button on it.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:05.440]   I love this, there's a button on the app.
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:09.560]   It makes the tracker a 90 decibel, (imitates a noise)
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:10.960]   yeah, it sounds like this.
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.960]   And this is nice 'cause this is the pixel.
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:19.880]   So it's also lighting up, which is awesome.
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:23.800]   Okay, I was embarrassed, but no one saw my embarrassment
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:26.360]   and I went back to the show and I didn't tell anybody.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.000]   I had them all along.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:28.840]   But that's awesome.
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:32.040]   Now Harry left him at the bar and had gone home.
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.440]   I could then look at the map and say, on the tracker app,
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:35.520]   this is where you left your keys.
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:36.760]   Last time we saw them.
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:39.680]   This is a Bluetooth, it does not GPS in the dongle.
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:41.080]   It's just a little tiny thing.
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:44.240]   This is the world's smallest Bluetooth tracker.
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:46.680]   But it only works when your phone is nearby.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:48.840]   Once your phone has gotten 100 feet away
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:52.160]   from the tracker device, they're about 100, 150 feet away.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:55.560]   It's lost contact with it, but that's okay
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:59.720]   because tracker has the world's largest crowd GPS network.
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:01.800]   Anybody with the tracker software in their phone,
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:04.840]   when they walk by your keys, they ping you.
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.000]   You can see it if you turn on notifications,
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.520]   like you lose something, you turn on the notifications,
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.880]   they let me know if anybody sees it
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:11.160]   and you'll get these notifications.
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:12.560]   Oh yeah, your keys, they were just seen
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.240]   in Madagascar or whatever.
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:16.840]   I also, I love the separation alerts.
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:20.200]   So if I leave my phone behind, the tracker makes noise.
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:22.320]   If I leave my keys or whatever the tracker's attached to
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:23.680]   behind, the phone makes noise.
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:26.280]   If I can't find my phone and press the button on the tracker
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:30.840]   and then even if my phone is silenced, which it is,
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:32.600]   it's gonna ring.
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.080]   I love this.
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:37.320]   The tracker never lose anything again.
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:41.040]   Put it on your pets, T-H-E-T-R-A-C-K-R,
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:44.360]   thetracker.com with a promo code Mac break.
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:47.080]   We've sold 5 million of these so far.
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:50.320]   And I love, you know, you could change the battery
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:52.840]   so you never have to worry about running out of battery.
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.080]   I can go on and on.
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:58.320]   Just go there and get some 30-day money back guarantee
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:00.960]   so there's nothing to lose, no risk.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:03.680]   Thetracker.com with the offer code Mac break.
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:06.320]   Now back to Mac break weekly, I haven't lost 'em, have I?
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:07.520]   Where are you guys?
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:10.000]   Hello.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.240]   Wait a minute, let me press the tracker button.
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:14.040]   See if they're around here.
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:14.880]   Guys?
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:17.560]   Oh, there they are.
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:20.400]   (laughing)
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:24.160]   We're looking for a perimeter breach on Leo Laporte at this point.
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:27.000]   It's a good, can we find out, can we find out exactly
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.640]   like where in Monaco he is at any one given point?
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:32.480]   I guess I got a target.
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:33.480]   I'm gonna start.
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:34.440]   (laughing)
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:37.400]   Yeah, I keep, I'm worried that if I,
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:38.880]   I do have one of those trackers,
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:41.280]   I worry that if I have too many of them,
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:45.200]   it will cause me to lose my ability to remember
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:47.880]   where I've put anything just like GPS
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:51.840]   has caused me to lose like 25 years of map skills.
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.080]   So that's the only downside.
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:54.400]   Yeah, I just want that functionality everywhere.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.240]   I just want, I want trackers on everything Andy.
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:57.760]   That's gotten to the point where I can't even find
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:01.320]   the cap to my pen anymore and it wants to get tracker on it.
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:04.400]   Well, I suppose that some,
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:05.680]   (laughing)
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:07.680]   that's when you know that the passive aggressiveness
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:11.080]   at the, in the office like break room fridge
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.960]   has gone from Kurt notes up to.
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:18.440]   So why is your waste basket pinging Debbie?
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:20.760]   Is it because that there is a piece of Tupperware
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:25.760]   that once held my daughter's bacon tofu salad?
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:27.560]   Ah ha!
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:30.760]   No, so, Andy, since we already have you
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:32.760]   on full swing, what is your pick of the week?
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:35.000]   What are you going to tantalize with us with this week?
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.800]   Oh, this is such a dangerous pick of the week.
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:40.920]   For some reason, Amazon is having a colossal
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:44.880]   and aggressively stupid sale on Marvel Comics
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:45.720]   trade paperbacks.
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:48.040]   These are collections of complete storylines
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:50.920]   and just like complete numbered runs of Marvel Comics.
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:53.320]   And we're talking about like books that normally cost
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:58.320]   10, 15, $20 digitally going for a buck 42 bucks, three bucks.
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:02.240]   And unfortunately, this, I have not been able to find
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:05.160]   like a portal that says that here is all the Marvel books
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:08.240]   we have on sale, but if you just do a search
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:13.240]   for Marvel Kindle, especially Marvel Kindle graphic novel,
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:17.600]   you will just get 400 pages of which
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:20.920]   at least half of everything on that page will be a really,
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:24.720]   something really, really good at phenomenally stupid prices.
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:29.720]   And it's so hard to spend just a minute recommending
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:32.000]   stuff broadly speaking.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.640]   If you do a search for a series called Marvel Masterworks,
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:38.120]   this is a series that they've been doing for a long,
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:39.680]   long time where they are just simply,
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:41.360]   they will start reprinting Fantastic Four
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.160]   from issue one forward.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:45.920]   So you can get the classic 1960s stories
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:48.320]   and they have them for Spider-Man, for the Hulk,
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:49.360]   for the Avengers.
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:51.080]   And they've been around long enough
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.440]   that a lot of these things aren't that old,
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:57.080]   but they also have the latest issues.
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:59.960]   As soon as about a, once they're about a year old,
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:02.560]   they start getting collected into these trades.
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:05.520]   And a few that I would recommend is a version
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:07.960]   of the Hulk called the Totally Awesome Hulk.
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:12.440]   It's a totally new take on the Incredible Hulk
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:15.760]   with a younger person retaining his intellect
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:17.360]   and being a super genius.
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:18.200]   And it's so fun.
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:22.680]   I really reinvent the entire thing, Squirrel Girl,
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:26.640]   which is, yes, you heard me correctly, Squirrel Girl,
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:31.160]   which is just goofy, joyful, fun comics.
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:34.800]   Superior Spider-Man is what is one of my favorite
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:38.560]   recent runs on Spider-Man with a really great premise
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:41.920]   where you'll roll your eyes at the basic idea that,
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:45.800]   oh, well, one of his super villain takes control,
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.640]   takes control of Spider-Man's body and becomes Spider-Man.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:53.000]   And no, it's more like a villain sort of has this fight
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.120]   with Peter Parker to take over his body.
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:59.640]   And in doing so, learns everything about why he's not,
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:01.720]   why this villain, he's never been the victim.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:02.640]   He's just a jerk.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:04.920]   He had a bad, he had a bad childhood,
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:07.080]   but everybody has had a bad childhood.
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:10.800]   And it's sort of, when he started this little campaign,
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.640]   he thought, well, I'm going to live again
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.800]   through the body of my enemy.
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:16.320]   Basically, he comes at the end of this
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.080]   having achieved his goal, but thinking,
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:20.400]   I am a total pile of crap.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.960]   I am not gonna just take over his body.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:24.320]   I'm going to be Spider-Man now,
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.080]   and I'm gonna be an even better Spider-Man
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:28.400]   than Peter Parker ever was.
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:32.400]   And it's, again, I'll go on for 10, 20, 30 minutes
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.240]   if I keep going.
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:35.680]   But really, it really is worth your spending some time
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:37.480]   just scrolling through and looking for things
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:41.600]   because for a buck 40 for $2.30 for $3,
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:44.000]   this is the sort of pricing where you can just buy something
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.640]   that looks interesting and know that you will get
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:51.000]   six to 10 issues of something being a complete storyline.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.560]   And even if you'll probably like it,
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:55.280]   and if you don't, you're out a buck 40.
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.440]   That's not even a cup of coffee for heaven's sake.
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.760]   So I think that it's gonna be going on for a few days.
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.720]   So by the time you listen to this,
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.840]   it should be still going on.
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:05.120]   It's worth me telling you this right now.
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:07.440]   Whether that's true or not,
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:09.280]   because I've been reading comics forever,
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:12.280]   and I don't wanna tell you how much money I spent last night
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:15.280]   buying these things, both to fill out parts of my collection
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:18.560]   and also a lot of storylines that people have been
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:21.440]   recommending to me, but I haven't gotten around to.
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.240]   But for a buck 40, I will buy it.
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:25.080]   It will be on my iPad.
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:28.600]   And I'll just, next time I have a flight or a long train ride,
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.200]   it'll be there for me to read.
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:32.320]   - There goes my iPad, my iPhone 10 money Andy.
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:33.640]   I knocked the door. - Yeah.
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:35.800]   That's why I bought the 128 gig iPad
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:37.400]   and I have the 64 gig iPad.
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.640]   - Smart, what about you Alex?
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:42.560]   Do you have something that is perhaps more expensive?
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:46.840]   - I know you're really depending on that.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:49.280]   And so I've been, but it doesn't have to be,
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:52.080]   you can start off without spending any money, which is great.
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:55.840]   So there's a thing that I've been playing with for,
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:58.960]   almost 25 years, called photogrammetry.
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:00.720]   And photogrammetry is really the process
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:04.080]   of taking a bunch of photos and turning them into a 3D model.
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:07.400]   And this, I gotta tell you, over the last two decades,
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:10.080]   it's gotten to be from just downright painful
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.440]   to downright fun.
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:15.080]   And I think it's worth folks just giving it a shot
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:17.400]   because it's something you can do with your phone.
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:19.800]   Well, your phone and your Mac can't really do.
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:21.160]   I mean, you can do a little bit of on your phone,
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:23.320]   but you need a Mac to have the most fun.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:25.800]   So it's called PhotoScan.
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:30.800]   And so PhotoScan is a, it's a piece of software.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:32.400]   And you don't wanna get scared of it,
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:34.800]   it'll look kind of technical and have all this stuff.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:37.760]   But literally you can take this app,
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.200]   go out and find a statue or find a building
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:43.520]   or something like that and just take your iPhone out
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:44.760]   and just shoot a whole bunch of photos of it.
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:47.320]   Now we can talk about how to take those photos
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:48.920]   and everything else and actually something
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:52.800]   that we're gonna start doing in the Pixel Core membership again
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:55.160]   that we're doing, that we're launching sometimes soon
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:58.400]   is tomorrow, I'm quite finished one of the pages.
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:03.360]   So, but one of the things that you wanna do is
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:06.280]   go out and take a bunch from all the different sides
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.720]   of as high as you can, as low as you can.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:10.680]   I mean, a great thing to test is like a fire hydrant
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:13.520]   'cause it's kind of the right thing to just kind of play with.
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.800]   Anyway, take all those photos.
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:16.840]   You just drag them in.
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:18.600]   Just drag them in and say, "Hey, go find a bunch of points.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.640]   Go figure out where all these cameras were."
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:21.920]   So it finds a whole bunch of points.
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:23.880]   And then you say, "Yeah, why don't you build up
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:25.320]   what we call a dense point cloud?"
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:26.360]   And boom, it does that.
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:30.040]   And why don't we turn that into some geometry
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:32.760]   and turn that into polygons and it'll do that for you.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.280]   And there's really not, there's not a lot to do
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:35.960]   other than find the drop down to do that.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:37.680]   And you'll end up with this little model.
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:42.000]   And it's amazing how much data is in that little model.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.280]   And I gotta tell you, it was not always this easy.
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:46.280]   (laughs)
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:51.280]   And then you're gonna, I have lost many nights
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:55.960]   and fingers and blood and everything else
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:57.760]   trying to get models that look like this
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.160]   out of photographs.
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:02.200]   And so what we're seeing right here is not,
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.600]   what you're seeing on the thing is not stuff
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:05.520]   that has been someone painstakingly modeled.
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.040]   They just took a bunch of photos and they said,
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:08.560]   "Well, make me a model."
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:12.200]   And so I think that it's just something fun
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:14.000]   and it's a great little past time of mine.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.400]   I walk around all the time and I go,
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:17.320]   "I wonder what that would look like if I did a photo scan with it.
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:19.520]   So I take a bunch of pictures with my iPhone or my,
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:24.160]   so and I throw them together.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.600]   I have a DXO that shoots a slightly higher resolution.
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:27.440]   So that works well.
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:28.760]   If you've got a really high resolution camera,
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:30.520]   it goes, it's slower.
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:31.640]   And it does take a while.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:33.680]   Like if you put, if you, just in case you wonder,
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:35.560]   and if you take 180 photos and you throw it in there
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:38.280]   of an object, it will take a couple hours
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.240]   for it to get all this stuff done.
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.560]   But it's something you can do in the background.
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:42.560]   You just kind of throw it in,
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.040]   let your computer work on it all night
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:46.200]   and you come in and see what it's like.
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:47.600]   Now, the great thing about it is
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.360]   they've got a really good kind of,
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:52.880]   you know what I would say, cocaine marketing for you.
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.560]   We used to call that cocaine marketing
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:56.400]   when I was in Sony, you know,
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:58.680]   you had to get a couple hits before someone
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:01.200]   would be willing to buy a whole album.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:04.480]   And so what you can do is you can download this thing
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:05.320]   and put it in demo mode
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.360]   and you can just see what it does
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:08.000]   and take a bunch of photos, you see it,
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.520]   you can't save it, but you can see it.
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:11.640]   You can see how effective it was
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:13.720]   and what it does and everything else.
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.080]   And that's great.
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:16.400]   Do that for a little while.
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:19.120]   Don't ask for the demo code immediately.
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:22.000]   Just play with it in demo mode.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.640]   Then you can go there and you can say,
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:25.360]   hey, give me the demo code
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:26.920]   and they'll give you a 30-day pass
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:28.800]   and now you can actually save models.
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.440]   And if you have something like Cinema 4D
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.720]   or some other Armaya or something else,
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:35.080]   you can actually throw those in there.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:36.360]   Then when you're done, you know,
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:37.760]   when that gets, if you decided
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:39.240]   that you're actually producing something
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:41.200]   and you think you could actually turn this into a business,
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.320]   you can get kind of their base version
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:46.360]   and that base version's about 350 bucks or something like that.
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:48.960]   And then if you get really serious and you decide,
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:50.800]   I really want to be able to model from spheres.
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:53.520]   Like I want to use my Theta or something bigger
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:57.520]   to create 3D models or I want to be able to take a,
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.640]   you know, build a geodetic network, you know, from a drone,
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.280]   you know, those kinds of pro things,
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:04.200]   then you start spending $3,500 on it
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:06.480]   and but you've turned it into a business.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.320]   And so you don't have to do any of that first
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:11.720]   and it's just everybody listening to you.
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:13.920]   Just if you got a Mac and you got a phone,
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:14.760]   go download this thing.
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:15.600]   It's just fun.
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.440]   It's just like magic.
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:17.280]   You're like, you took a bunch of photos
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:18.640]   and now you have a 3D model, you know?
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:22.680]   And anyway, there's a lot of good business reasons
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:27.080]   to know how to use it, but it is fun enough to do
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:31.040]   that is just worth doodling with.
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:34.560]   And I can't wait to see if Andy decides to doodle with it
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:37.320]   'cause Andy, I think he'll have a lot of fun with it.
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:40.560]   So anyway, I'm expecting 3D squirrels.
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:42.240]   (laughing)
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:43.400]   - No, anyway.
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:46.120]   I've been looking at all kinds of apps like this
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:48.440]   that I will add yours to the list with great interest
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:50.200]   because I do want to,
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:53.760]   I've been planning an art heist for several years.
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:54.840]   - Yeah.
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:56.480]   - There's a piece of sculpture that you might have heard
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.280]   we talked about once or twice that was once the most famous
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:02.600]   piece of sculpture in the world in 1893.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:04.640]   And I've been trying to figure out,
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:06.280]   and there are examples, there are copies of it
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:08.400]   in lots of museums around the world.
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:10.920]   And I keep with photogrammetry and other things,
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:12.800]   there must be a way that with a phone
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:17.160]   or by getting access to a museum that will let me
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:20.280]   basically have full access to it in a back room somewhere,
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:22.440]   there must be a way that I can do photogrammetry,
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:25.040]   create a good 3D model that I will almost certainly have
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:27.280]   to fix up a little bit on the computer,
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:29.120]   but then make a 3D print.
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:32.720]   So instead of buying a reproduction of this
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:36.280]   made 100 years ago that would cost me $15,000 at auction,
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:39.760]   I can simply 3D print my own version of it.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:41.480]   And but it would give me great satisfaction
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.440]   to just go into the Metropolitan Museum of Art
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:45.280]   without any authority, without any permission,
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.840]   without breaking any rules,
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:50.480]   and essentially steal a piece of art
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:52.280]   simply by spending 10 minutes
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:53.480]   taking the right pictures around it.
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:55.040]   So I'm really interested in this.
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:55.920]   - Well, the crazy thing is,
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:57.600]   is that with not very much correction,
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:59.480]   you can make your model airtight.
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:01.120]   So a lot of times you get all this stuff working,
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:03.160]   and once it's airtight, you can print it, right?
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:07.760]   And so as soon as you can get rid of all the holes,
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.240]   and there's all kinds of little filters
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:10.520]   that will go in and find the holes,
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:12.440]   and fill them in, and so on and so forth.
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:15.640]   And so you really can go shoot something
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:18.240]   and then build a 3D model of it,
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:20.440]   or print it, and it can be done over a weekend.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:22.280]   Like you could shoot something on Saturday morning
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:25.200]   and have a model by the time you get up on Monday.
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:29.080]   It's a brave new world.
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:30.520]   Anyway, it's really, really fun.
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:31.640]   It's worth playing with.
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:35.280]   I did it with the Lincoln Memorial several years ago.
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:37.960]   It was like a three foot original bronze reproduction,
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:40.400]   but it was perfectly set up in the museum
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:43.560]   where it was about at eye level,
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:46.680]   and with like eight feet of nothing around it.
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:49.400]   So I could really take comprehensive pictures
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:52.880]   up down all around, and also the Lincoln Memorial,
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:55.720]   it's not like someone putting their hand above their head.
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:57.400]   So there's like a hole here,
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:45:58.560]   and someone's wearing headphones,
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:00.480]   so there's all this little detail there.
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:02.160]   And I wasn't even trying very hard
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:03.760]   when I got it home through it on the 3D printer,
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:06.400]   and my God, I've got the Lincoln Memorial,
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.760]   no, after only four hours of waiting.
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:11.280]   And yeah, that really does blow your mind
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:13.920]   that you can come home from a museum,
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:15.480]   or not even like doing photogrammetry.
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.080]   The Smithsonian, they're making 3D models
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:19.920]   of so much of their sculpture,
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:20.960]   and so many of their artifacts.
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:23.400]   Then you can simply download this thing
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:24.480]   and print out your own copy of it.
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:26.480]   So imagine, again, an art heist,
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:29.720]   where it's like, that bust would make such a statement
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:33.160]   in my foyer, and then instead of simply like putting,
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:35.880]   instead of sticking in your laptop bag,
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:38.360]   and perhaps going to jail for a long time,
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:41.440]   you simply download a file or collect data,
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:42.920]   and then spend a long time
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.320]   having to restart your 3D prints,
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:46.120]   'cause you're not very good at making 3D prints.
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.160]   And the other thing is, is that you start shooting this stuff,
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:50.160]   and there's companies called Shapeways
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.800]   that will print this stuff out of metal.
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:54.720]   You know, like not like a little printer.
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:55.840]   And so when you started thinking about,
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:57.760]   if you wanna have the Lincoln Memorial
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:59.040]   hanging around a little bracelet,
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:00.160]   you could do that too.
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:01.640]   You know, like you just upload it,
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.320]   you build your little model and you upload it,
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:07.040]   and you say, I wanna make this out of metal.
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:08.560]   I always like, every time I see there stuff,
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.400]   I'm like, it makes things go down.
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:13.920]   - Exactly, both the JLums Garage and Tested.com,
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:14.920]   their YouTube channels.
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:16.760]   They have really great stuff where they will show you,
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:18.440]   they will model or something,
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:21.280]   either just from scratch in 3D,
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:24.680]   or they'll use a photogrammetry to capture something,
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:27.280]   do a 3D print of it, and then like with JLums Garage,
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:32.200]   they've got like a engine block from 1903, whatever,
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:34.000]   that's cracked and useless,
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.960]   but they managed to make it out of plastic,
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:37.880]   they've bolted it onto the rest of the engine,
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:39.920]   make sure it fits, and then they simply send this
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:43.120]   to a foundry that can make a traditional mold out of it,
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:44.920]   and then pour actual steel into it.
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:49.920]   So yeah, the ability to, it's, I'm really fascinated by this.
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:52.520]   I've made so many attempts before
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:53.640]   with this piece of sculpture.
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:56.880]   I haven't found the right copy of the sculpture
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:59.120]   in the right environment.
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:02.960]   I did talk to a museum that would be more than happy to,
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:06.240]   they have a copy of it that's not on display,
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:09.200]   but they're certainly willing to let me go into the research area,
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:10.440]   they'll set it up for me,
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.600]   now it can have a few hours with lights and everything
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:14.960]   doing whatever I want with as long as I don't touch it.
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:18.320]   But it's a basically doing that.
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:19.480]   - Yeah.
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:23.920]   - Unfortunately, there was a funny story.
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:28.280]   They reported, and they, in Boston, they reported
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:30.200]   what could have, what might have been an art theft
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:33.280]   of like an important $200 and something thousand dollar
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:35.320]   piece of art in their collection.
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:38.440]   And then it turned out that it wasn't, it was never stolen,
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:42.800]   it was just like, they misplaced it in a desk or someplace,
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:45.520]   which led a whole bunch of people to change jobs
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:47.320]   and then them to say, tell you what,
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:50.080]   we're closing down the entire art department,
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:53.320]   we're barricading it until we empty out every closet,
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:56.400]   every drawer, every shelf, create a catalog of everything
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:57.440]   in a new system.
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:00.280]   So unfortunately, that happened like a month after
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:02.960]   I got this permission and before I'd managed to set up
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:04.040]   a day at a time.
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:05.840]   But the, because the,
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.560]   - The photograph, which is great, but I have even better tools.
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:11.520]   - You know, if you get open access to something,
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:12.960]   the photograph is stealing stuff.
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:15.760]   It's, if you have the access, there's a,
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:17.960]   there's a thing called a laser scan.
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:19.400]   - I, you know, yeah.
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:20.720]   - Like a Faro unit?
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:21.560]   - Yeah.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.880]   - Well, I was, I was even like a ZNF.
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:27.240]   Like the Faro unit, the Faro unit is kind of like the Chivette
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:28.520]   and the ZNF.
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:30.160]   - We're gonna talk, we're gonna talk a little bit
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.080]   about this later.
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:32.400]   But there was, I was even thinking that,
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:35.600]   so I know we should wrap up on Orverle and I'm sorry,
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:38.480]   but there's a, one of the most beautiful piece,
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:41.080]   my favorite piece of public sculpture in the world
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:41.960]   is in Boston.
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:45.480]   It's in the corner, far off corner of the public garden.
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:49.160]   It's called, it's a,
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:51.720]   a statue of an angel by Daniel Chester French,
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:53.880]   who also did the Lincoln Memorial.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:57.520]   And it's just the most beautiful thing you've ever seen.
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:02.240]   And it's, it's special, precious because it's not in a place
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:05.200]   of the public garden where if you're taking a regular walk,
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:06.680]   you'll probably encounter it.
[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:10.200]   And also it used to be very poorly tended
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:12.720]   where there's so many, the landscaping around it kind of
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:14.960]   made it into this sort of like private garden
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:16.800]   that was very hard to see.
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:19.400]   But recently they totally re-lancaped it,
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:20.880]   so you can see it in 360,
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.720]   which suddenly got me thinking,
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:27.720]   I could fly a drone around it and get the 3D photogrammetry.
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:30.120]   'Cause I was so in love with that statue
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:33.520]   that when I had a once in a lifetime opportunity,
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:38.000]   there's a, the artists estate was being renovated
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.040]   and for a limited amount of time,
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:43.000]   artifacts from the sculptor's studio were being displayed
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.040]   in this tiny museum and conquered.
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:46.920]   So that the MacKet for it,
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:48.600]   which would have been my only opportunity
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:50.360]   to get up down all around it.
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:51.840]   And so I was, yeah, anyway,
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:54.760]   it's pretty exciting the idea that you can come home,
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:58.840]   not with just a watercolor painting that you made or photograph,
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:00.800]   but I've got 3D data.
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:03.680]   I can have one of these in my room if I want.
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:05.520]   I can make a Christmas ornament out of it.
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:07.280]   I can make a cake topper out of this
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:09.880]   if I'd like out of out of sponge sugar.
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:12.040]   All I gotta do is take it up pictures.
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:13.040]   - There's something about laser scanner.
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:14.560]   I don't own a laser scanner,
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.920]   but I have a good friend who has a lot of them.
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:20.080]   And there's something about when you have access
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:23.160]   to a laser scanner, you just wanna scan everything.
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:24.720]   You're like, I think I got a new job.
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:25.920]   And when you talk to the clients,
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:28.280]   you're like, can I, do you mind if I bring something with me?
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:29.280]   And they're like, stop,
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:30.480]   or do you know you don't have enough Alex?
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:33.320]   Is that a real concern if the kids stop moving for long enough?
[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:34.680]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:36.440]   - They just learn how the kids.
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:37.280]   - Yeah, they, the--
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:39.240]   - Keep moving your dowels, keep moving.
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:43.600]   - My kids have been scanned a few times.
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:44.440]   - Yeah, I got it.
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:46.480]   - So I'm gonna wrap us up quickly with just,
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:48.600]   I only have a few things to say about my pick of the week.
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:51.280]   And it is the LG, I'm gonna get this right,
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:54.320]   a six, six, sorry, C6P.
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:57.320]   And that is LG's current generation mid-range
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:03.240]   OLED, DCI P3, HDR panel.
[01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:05.680]   I picked one of these up earlier this week
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:08.600]   in preparation for the Apple TV for K launch.
[01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:10.680]   And there's not a lot of content for it yet,
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:11.560]   but I did set it up.
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:14.600]   It has, it runs WebOS, which is always near and dear to my heart.
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:16.000]   And it has built-in Netflix.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.520]   So even absent the Apple TV box,
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:19.800]   I can still watch 4K HDR Netflix.
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:21.680]   And it looks stunning.
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:24.640]   There is 4K content, lots of 4K content.
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:27.000]   HDR content is mostly the Marvel stuff,
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.560]   still the Netflix and Marvel stuff,
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:30.000]   some Amazon Prime stuff.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.960]   But you can see reds, you can see yellows.
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:33.120]   The DCI P3 is really,
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:35.200]   if you have an iPhone with DCI P3,
[01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:36.840]   it's just, it's so much more colorful.
[01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:38.720]   And the HDR, even in murky shows,
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:41.120]   like the Marvel Netflix shows tend to be,
[01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:43.280]   you can just see so much more detail
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:45.840]   in the highlights, in the shadows.
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:48.000]   And even regular TV, regular upscale TV,
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.880]   you watch the end of Guardians of the Galaxy 2,
[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:52.120]   and you watch the celebration at the end,
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:53.400]   the funeral at the end.
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:54.720]   And it's just, it's so beautiful
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:58.160]   because all the colors are just popping out of your eyes.
[01:52:58.160 --> 01:52:59.840]   So it is expensive.
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:02.400]   If like me, your job entails you no life
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:03.920]   where you can actually go out and spend money
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:08.240]   on things like vacations and other things
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:09.800]   that people buy, I imagine.
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:11.680]   You might have enough money squirreled away for this.
[01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:13.760]   But like Alex mentioned before the show,
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:15.600]   now that this stuff is going primetime,
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:17.000]   it's going mass market.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.800]   It's hard to make OLED panels.
[01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:21.680]   So Samsung and other manufacturers are doing QLED,
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:23.560]   which is Quantum Dot, which isn't the same,
[01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:25.960]   but you will be able to get more HDR
[01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:28.200]   and you'll certainly be able to get more 4K
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:29.440]   come this holiday season.
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:31.240]   And if you do wanna take the plunge,
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:33.320]   I spoke to a lot of people in the industry
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:35.600]   and a lot of people who really know their panels.
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:37.800]   And this is the affordable option.
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:39.560]   You don't have to go to the 10K panel,
[01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:42.160]   I mean, and you don't have to go to the dirt cheap panel,
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:43.840]   but if you want a good middle ground,
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:45.760]   I've been using it for three, four days
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:47.920]   and my eyes will just, I can never unsee it.
[01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:51.280]   It's just really, really gorgeous television.
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:53.760]   So I spent several Alex's there, Alex.
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:54.520]   Couldn't help myself.
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:55.960]   - Very nice.
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:57.360]   I am a jealous.
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:59.760]   So like I say, I'm officially jealous.
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:01.720]   - I saw people, when I was at the store,
[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:03.520]   there were people buying, I think this is in Montreal,
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:04.960]   I saw people buying two or three of them,
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:06.760]   so I don't know what they're doing with all those panels.
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:07.600]   - Oh man.
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:09.360]   - Somebody's obviously enjoying the sales.
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:10.560]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:12.680]   - All right, well, I want to thank everybody for joining us.
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:16.560]   I know I'm just a pale shade of a fully rendered 3D Lio
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:19.400]   Laport, but I did try to soldier on for the good of humanity
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:20.720]   and the Macbake Weekly audience.
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:22.960]   I want to thank Alex Lindsey for joining us
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:23.800]   from the Pixel Core.
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:24.880]   Alex, where are you going?
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:28.200]   Where are you going to be and how can people follow you?
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:31.520]   - I am in Brussels.
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:34.120]   I'll be in Bertilin by the weekend.
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:36.040]   There's a little little Schindig there.
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:37.680]   And so I'm going to be working there.
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:40.760]   And then I am back in the United States.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.920]   But the best thing to do right now is,
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:45.120]   I've been doing so much work.
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:47.280]   I haven't finished a little bit that I have to do
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:48.720]   for the membership, but if people are interested
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:50.720]   in the Pixel Core, the stuff we talked about,
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:53.000]   photogrammetry and LiDAR, and then also live streaming
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.760]   and video production and all that stuff.
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:56.800]   We're going to be, this week I promise,
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:58.960]   I said this week last week, but I'm like,
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:01.360]   literally we were testing all the e-commerce
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:02.640]   to make sure it all worked.
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:05.040]   But sign up to the interest list.
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:06.800]   We're going to send a little coupon for that
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:08.320]   because the interest list tells me whether
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:09.240]   I've worked with you before,
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:10.800]   whether you listen to one of the shows.
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:12.920]   So sign up to the interest list for the membership
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:15.880]   and we'll be sending that out in the next, by Friday.
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:16.880]   They'll be coming out in a little bit
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:19.280]   so as we slowly test all the e-commerce,
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:21.360]   make sure that we're not going to actually join.
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:22.240]   But we're going to be, you know,
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:25.720]   just going to be a big fun fest of computer graphics
[01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:28.160]   and videos, so hopefully some people listening
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:29.200]   might find that interesting.
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:30.040]   Anyway, that's it.
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:32.400]   - And Alex Lindsey on Twitter.
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:34.200]   - Yes, Alex Lindsey on Twitter.
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.040]   - All the time.
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:36.760]   And Dionaco, what are you up to?
[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:38.680]   - Many, many podcasts, many, many columns.
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:40.640]   - Many, many podcasts, many, many columns.
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:43.280]   I'm still doing my coverage of last week.
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:46.600]   You know, you know me, I'm less the person
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:48.640]   who needs to get the breaking news out that same day
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:51.640]   at much rather, you know, put on my fake beards
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:55.160]   by something to stroke while I puff on my fake pipe
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:58.440]   and consider a muse about things.
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:01.280]   So that's starting to be published on the Sun Time site
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:02.080]   this week.
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:05.160]   As usual, I'll spell my last name to SQL stuff on Twitter,
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:08.160]   including a lot of recommendations of comic books
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:10.000]   to buy during the Marvel sale.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.040]   I'm also an ad go on Instagram.
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:16.360]   And got my material, my material Google podcast,
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:18.040]   Google is being very mean to a lot of people.
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:20.320]   So if you don't like, so if you're anti-Google,
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:22.040]   it's becoming a very, very good,
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:23.760]   it's becoming a very, very fun podcast
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:26.120]   for people who hate Google because there's a lot of them,
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:28.000]   a lot of stories about Google doing bad stuff
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.240]   that we also like to talk about there.
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:32.360]   And that's on really.fm.
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:33.200]   - Awesome.
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:35.080]   And I want to thank you, the awesome audience,
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:38.400]   the awesome chat room, everybody for watching us.
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:41.200]   I'm not sure if Leo is back next week or the week after,
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:42.040]   but he is returning.
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:42.880]   He did not abandon us.
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:43.800]   He will be back.
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.080]   The show will go to it.
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:47.120]   He'll be back in Leo's capable hands.
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:48.600]   But I want to thank you guys for joining us.
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:49.960]   And that's it.
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:52.680]   Mac Break Weekly is over.
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:55.720]   - Get back to work, get go bricks.
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:57.280]   - Get back to work, get go bricks.
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:56:58.120]   - That's right.
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:56:58.960]   Mac Break.
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:00.320]   - What are you doing?
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:01.920]   - No, he's still here.
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:03.720]   - Why are you here?
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:06.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:08.880]   (upbeat music)
