[00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.420]   Jason Snell is here, Andy Inako, Alex, Lindsey.
[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.680]   There's lots to talk about.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.280]   No one knows how many people are watching Severance.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.440]   That kind of bugs Ben Stiller.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.200]   It's still a success, I think.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.640]   We'll also talk about the iPhone 14.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.200]   It's on track for a September release
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.440]   and the passing of the man who designed
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.280]   the Steve Jobs Turtle Neck.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.880]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.480]   poor approval rates and high chargebacks with New Vay,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.240]   the platform fast forwarding to the next generation of payments.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.160]   Turn payments into powerful accelerators

[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.520]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.200]   the latest news from Apple and as usual.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.000]   We are just waiting for a big event
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.360]   in the next few weeks.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.600]   Jason Snell is here, six colors.com.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.440]   Hello, Jason.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.800]   Good to see you.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.640]   Good to be here.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.280]   We were gassing before the show
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.120]   and you produced a podcast.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.200]   So you're very good.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.880]   It's a life of an independent worker.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.200]   If you're a big multitasking, that's my secret multitasking.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.240]   And another downstream hits the streams.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.880]   That's right. That's wonderful.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.960]   Caught in the middle of an ocean,
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.880]   breaking down the business of binging.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.760]   This is the show you were talking about that you did.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.200]   Yeah, with Julia Alexander and I got to pick her brain
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.160]   for an hour about what the heck is going on
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.800]   with Warner Brothers Discovery.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   I'm going to ask you about that.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.960]   I know it's not an Apple subject, except it kind of is.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.920]   Apple's very much in the streaming business.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.480]   That's Alex Lindsey of 090.media.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.360]   They call it 090 and Office Hours.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.800]   That global.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.520]   There are a bunch of us are watching the Discovery thing
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.360]   just eating popcorn like what is going on?
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.360]   Oh my God.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.200]   Oh my God.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.120]   So much drama.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.520]   So much drama over there.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.440]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.440]   So I'll be right.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.800]   Alex, you can see who's right.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.080]   We'll get your take on this too.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.880]   But first, let's say hello to Andy and not go.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.080]   WGBH in Boston.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.600]   Hello.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.680]   Who is the only one who has no dog in the streaming hunt?
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.360]   I guess.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.880]   I can't have pets.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.160]   It's probably--
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.720]   I have enough trouble taking care of myself, frankly.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.840]   So there-- once upon a time, there was HBO.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.960]   There was--
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.920]   HBO was owned, it was started originally by whom.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.040]   Well, it's Warner, right?
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.960]   Was it always Warner?
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.080]   I think so.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.200]   Warner Communications.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.920]   I think so.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.920]   I think it's always been part of that.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.920]   And then there was Discovery, which
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.400]   was a cable channel that's kind of morphed
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.280]   into a monster in streaming.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.000]   Founded by sharks.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.840]   Founded by sharks.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.520]   And it took a week.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.880]   Sharks.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.840]   Shark Week.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.720]   Then there was Warner Media and Warner Brothers Film.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.480]   And then along comes AT&T and smooshes them all
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.040]   to a giant meatball.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.240]   And now the latest is that, weirdly, HBO, which
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.480]   turned into HBO Max, which meant it
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.160]   added a whole bunch of additional content
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.760]   to the kind of slim HBO--
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.960]   slim but prestige HBO library.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.640]   And then now they're going to merge Discovery Plus.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.920]   We talked about this on Sunday.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.720]   Christina Warren had, as you might imagine,
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.120]   a lot to say about it.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.800]   Discovery Plus, which is mostly reality TV,
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.440]   is now going to be merged with Prestige TV
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.680]   into this ball, which we don't know what the name will be.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.000]   Nick, what did Julie Alexander say about this?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.600]   She follows us.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.360]   Yeah, you know, it's like Zazlav--
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.760]   the problem is last week, David Zazlav, who's the CEO.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.160]   And he's sort of like responsible for this merger.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.800]   He was the one who came to AT&T.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.920]   And they made this deal.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.880]   And they subbed the company with a lot of debt.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.960]   And he's the guy who killed CNN Plus as well.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.460]   First thing--
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.480]   First thing he did.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.120]   Very quickly.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.400]   He came in with his chain saw and basically said,
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.560]   I got to get this company to be hitting our revenue targets.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.680]   He came from Discovery.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.160]   He was at Discovery when it were--
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.400]   Yeah, he basically built the modern Discovery channel
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.040]   that after Warner Media, again, was fused with Time Magazine
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.600]   for a long time, infused with AOL, then bought by AT&T.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.880]   And now we get to--
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.000]   the AT&T put this basically in the hands of Discovery.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.520]   And Zazlav, a lot of the bad media last week
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.200]   was about--
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.960]   they were canceling things and cutting things.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.840]   And also, they did a shareholder call.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.720]   And everybody sort of expects the shareholder call.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.080]   Julia said it on that podcast.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.800]   They expect it to be like a Disney product in Vail
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.160]   or something.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.760]   And no, it's an analyst call about financials.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.880]   And so they were talking about financial stuff
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.160]   and not about the rest of it.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.320]   So I think that their challenge is getting the message out
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.080]   that to the creative side of Hollywood,
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.080]   its show, business.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.520]   The business side and the show side are different.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.600]   And they need to be kind of communicated with differently.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.720]   So the show side of it, they need to communicate
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.200]   a little bit better because nobody
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.800]   likes hearing that a bunch of stuff's getting canceled
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.080]   and movies are being stopped just short of release.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.400]   And--
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.080]   Batgirl.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.040]   And put in the--
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.560]   Yeah, and put in the basement to never be seen
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.360]   and written off for tax purposes.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.400]   So there's a bunch of challenges there.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.840]   But I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about exactly--
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.840]   I mean, like they're not on fire.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.160]   He's a quintessential suit.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.320]   That's the thing.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.680]   He is not a creative.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.280]   He's a suit.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.440]   He's a lawyer.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.080]   He's not.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.720]   And he's fortunate because they actually
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.360]   have, in Casey Bloys, who is the guy who runs HBO,
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.240]   they have one of, if not the best,
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.280]   creative executive in Hollywood.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.960]   And so I think they're going to be OK,
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.200]   especially on the TV side.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.240]   I think that it's easy for people on the internet,
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.040]   especially to run away and say, oh no, this means,
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.360]   are they going to bring back succession?
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.640]   It's like, yeah, they are.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.640]   Are they going to bring back Westworld?
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.680]   Probably they are.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.200]   It's not like that.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.240]   But they are scrutinizing some stuff.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.280]   Like the previous CEO was Jason Kilar, who we all
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.760]   remember from Hulu.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.280]   And his job was basically to spend as much money as possible
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.800]   to get HBO Max launched.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.120]   And he did it.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.080]   And that was not going to be tenable over the long haul.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.360]   But he probably would have kept it going for a little while.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.360]   And with him out in Zaslav's goal is not to do that.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.400]   He looks at HBO Max and says, OK, this is pretty good,
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.440]   but it's real expensive.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.160]   And I've got all this discovery stuff.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.120]   I can merge in to make something that's
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.680]   got kind of broad appeal, but also a little bit cheaper,
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.080]   like mixing your Guy Fieri with your Game of Thrones
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.200]   to get whatever you get with that.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.120]   I don't know what that is.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.840]   There is it.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.360]   There is.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.360]   Rashes of bacon with cheese on top.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.280]   I know.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.400]   They don't seem to go together.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.160]   But we showed this on Sunday.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.840]   The deck Zaslav showed it that call,
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.120]   showing the synergy between the two, which is basically
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.480]   their complete opposites.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.080]   But anyway, it's fascinating.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.480]   There is a tie into this because HBO
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.600]   was run very successfully under the eages of Richard
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:52.120]   Pepler, who left HBO when all of this happened
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.680]   and has produced a show for Apple TV.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.840]   Plus, it's doing very well, Blackbird.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.920]   He's got a first look deal with Apple, I believe.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.440]   Yes.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.600]   I believe he was a refugee.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.040]   It's a pretty stuff to Apple.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.680]   And it's interesting because Apple is now
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.480]   becoming the home of prestige productions, right?
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.400]   And Apple doesn't need to have--
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.480]   we've talked about this before-- the giant catalog
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.200]   to keep people engaged.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.720]   Apple is happy if they just--
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:21.800]   in fact, there's a great article about Ted Lasso with the--
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.280]   Hannah Whaddington and the guy who plays Roy.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.360]   And they had-- they thought they were making a great show
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.400]   that no one would watch.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.160]   Right, because who has Apple TV Plus?
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:34.680]   Right.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.120]   And there's that other story that I know
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.760]   we have it in our list, too, which is about--
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.440]   there's a great interview with Ben Stiller, who's
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.320]   the executive producer of--
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:42.960]   Severance.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.920]   --on Apple TV Plus.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.840]   An amazing show that everybody should watch.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.680]   But it's not a new phenomenon, but it is also true of Apple.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.240]   But it's true of all the streamers, really, which is--
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.120]   the interviewer says, so what information
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.360]   did you get from Apple about how well succession did?
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.400]   And he says, honestly, until I went to Comic-Con
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.520]   and we filled a room of people who were excited,
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.880]   I wasn't sure that anybody actually saw it.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.960]   Because all Apple does is show you a little chart
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.920]   and with bumps and--
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.960]   A typical Apple chart.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.920]   That's good.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.760]   That's it.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.200]   Like, what does it even mean?
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.560]   It's one of those Apple charts that Stiller even says this,
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.920]   where you don't know is there's a lot of growth.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.200]   Is it growth from zero or growth from 100 million?
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.400]   What is the-- and that's going to be a problem, I think,
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.800]   because I think a lot of creatives want ratings.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.560]   They're used to having ratings.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.160]   They're used to it.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.520]   I don't know if they're going to get it.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.320]   The big thing is that a lot of them are clamoring for it,
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.480]   because partially they want to get paid for that.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.240]   They want to get paid for the success of their events.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.280]   One of the reasons that no one wants to talk about numbers
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.680]   is they don't want to start having that conversation.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.600]   There's a bunch of reasons not to share the numbers.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.120]   Number one is that knowing what's working and not working
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.040]   is part of the secret sauce to a lot of these streamers.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.760]   And so knowing that this one is doing exceptionally well
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.520]   and this one isn't doing as well,
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.880]   and all the math related to that
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.280]   is something that is how they generate what they're
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:00.960]   going to do next.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.040]   And they don't want to necessarily give that away.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.520]   So they generally only do it when they want to show--
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.320]   the reason that you talk about how many people are watching it
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.520]   is mostly so that you can attract more creators.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.280]   You don't think, hey, this went really well.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.200]   And look at how many millions of people watched it.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.240]   And imagine if that had gone out to the theaters.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.800]   And all those other things to try to get more talent.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.720]   But they don't usually want to give up the data.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.680]   They don't want to give the data,
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.280]   so they don't have to negotiate about it.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.280]   They also don't want to give up the data to show others what's
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:28.600]   working.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.880]   And then finally, they don't want to give the data
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.880]   because they don't want to be compared to each other.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.040]   You know, Apple has a lot less people than Netflix.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.680]   And so they don't want to-- if Apple says,
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.000]   well, we got 8 million people watching it or whatever,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.720]   and Netflix goes, well, that's like our smallest show,
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.680]   then that makes Apple look small.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.880]   So there's a lot of reasons that they don't want to share
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.120]   those raw numbers.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.720]   But it's going to be really interesting
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.960]   to see what happens with HBO.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.520]   I mean, I think that he's right in a lot of ways.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.440]   I think that everybody has to figure out
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.520]   how to-- we're going to see some more discipline.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.640]   Are you thinking consumers don't want to subscribe
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.040]   to many, many services?
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.880]   They just want one.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.440]   Not one, but I think that we've reached--
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.880]   I think that Peacock and Paramount are really struggling
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.440]   because they came into late.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.680]   And a lot of people have kind of decided, well,
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.400]   I got a lot of content right now.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.320]   So a lot of people seem to be having
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:31.160]   Disney Plus HBO Max, Disney Plus, Netflix, Apple,
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.200]   and maybe one more.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.680]   And then once you get to those, they have so much content--
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.960]   oh, Amazon Prime comes with a lot of people's Prime things.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.400]   So that's the fifth one.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.520]   You have so much content in front of you to choose from
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.720]   that I think that everybody else is now
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.760]   having a hard time figuring.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.000]   I think you're going to end up a shake up
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.760]   where you see more acquisitions buying up Paramount
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.120]   or other things because I just don't think they can make the turn.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.320]   They don't-- that's the problem.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.080]   The market thing--
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.160]   Netflix is over.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.640]   I think that's less--
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.880]   I mean, hyperbole, I think.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.120]   That's like saying that Windows is over.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.000]   It still has 80% of that.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.720]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.760]   No one's going to use Facebook.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.320]   Yeah, like--
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.880]   When you see the analyst chart about--
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.120]   it's only speculation, but this is an analyst speculation
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.400]   on what the numbers are.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.600]   The chart goes like this.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.960]   There's Netflix, and then there's every--
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.840]   there's Netflix, there's Disney Plus,
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.240]   and the Disney Plus part of the graph has just jumped up
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.480]   in recent years because, of course, it's just Disney.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.040]   But underneath-- even underneath Disney,
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.640]   there's just a big clump of people, including Apple,
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.840]   including everybody else.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.480]   So no, Netflix isn't going anywhere.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.920]   Netflix stock has down 62% since the beginning of the year.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.240]   Well, that reason is--
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.680]   The growth has tailed off.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.520]   And they were priced as a tech stock,
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.560]   and everybody's realizing they're an entertainment company
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.240]   and should be priced accordingly.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.200]   And I think that one of the challenges Netflix will have
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.200]   is that because one thing that we don't talk about a lot
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.440]   with a lot of these is the cost of sending--
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.800]   distributing all of these.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.520]   And one of the things that Netflix does
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:10.000]   is they compress their footage more than everybody else.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.640]   And they've done it in a couple of different ways.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.600]   And like, for instance, I found that Grey Man in portions
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.560]   were-- I mean, in portions it was unwatchable
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.520]   because of the dialogue.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.080]   And in other portions it was unwatchable
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.840]   because of the compression.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.040]   And I think that that's going to be a real challenge
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.320]   is because Apple and Disney+ are--
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.560]   I mean, they are clearly providing better quality content.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.160]   Like, what I mean by that is better quality compression.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.160]   And I only bring that up because you
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.840]   feel like you're in a better place when you watch stuff that
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.280]   doesn't have-- most people don't consciously
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.520]   notice the little blocks that are appearing in the dark areas.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.560]   But it feels cheaper when there's a lot of that there.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.560]   And I think that we have to pay attention
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.240]   to how consumers feel.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.560]   Are they going into a nice place?
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.080]   Or are they going into kind of McDonald's?
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.560]   And I think that the problem that Netflix has right now
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.320]   is that a lot of the content feels like you're going to be
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.040]   McDonald's because no matter how much money they spend
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.560]   on producing it, it looks bad.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.840]   Right now, though, you watch it.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.800]   Or maybe this has changed.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.840]   But for a long time, Netflix--
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.600]   you wanted to watch Netflix on Apple TV
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.480]   because Apple was doing the back end for Apple TV
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.640]   versions of Netflix.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.520]   So it looked better on an Apple TV.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.440]   So that's changed, or is that--
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.600]   I don't think that that's the case.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.400]   But I mean, the case--
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.160]   I mean, the case it looks significantly better.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.640]   Maybe before Apple had its own service.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.960]   Yeah, now they don't want it, right?
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.760]   They would just assume not compete with Netflix.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.560]   Let them do what they're going to do.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.720]   But I always wonder how much that--
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.200]   how big an effect that kind of stuff
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.760]   has on the bottom line.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.960]   Because look, if I want to see better call Saul,
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.160]   I wouldn't even particularly care
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.760]   if it's only being shown in HD compared
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.040]   with absolute 4K, 120 frame per second HDR presentation
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.080]   of a show that I couldn't give less of a damn about.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.080]   It's just a matter of--
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.080]   It's a lot off.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.160]   It has to be good enough, I think.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.040]   I think that it has to be good enough.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.360]   The problem really gets into is when I decide,
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.000]   oh, I'm going to look at something else.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.400]   It's just people-- how people feel about that brand.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.280]   I know what you're saying.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.800]   It's like if you're in a neighborhood,
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:18.240]   you're manicured lawns and beautiful streets and trees
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.040]   versus a rundown neighborhood.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.640]   You feel better in a nice neighborhood, right?
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.760]   Even if the content--
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.560]   Just because a lot of cars have four wheels,
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.440]   but there's a lot of different feel
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.760]   that you have when you're in different ones.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.880]   And so I think that that's the--
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.560]   I mean, but I think that it can be--
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.000]   because you kind of--
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.600]   Netflix, again, kind of feels like the cheaper version
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.480]   of a lot of this stuff.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.360]   And so when you go into it, if you
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.800]   have to make some hard decisions about what you're
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.280]   going to keep as a subscription service,
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.480]   for me, Netflix is on the outer edge.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.000]   If I decided I needed to cut back,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Netflix would be the first thing I got rid of.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.960]   We watched-- this was a perfect example.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.920]   We watched a show that is being made by Showtime,
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.240]   but we watched on Amazon Prime the first episode
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.280]   in the season because Amazon Prime had a Showtime deal
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.840]   or maybe they were offering it for me.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.000]   And then I realized, oh, we should
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.320]   be watching this on Showtime where it was 4K,
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.320]   and it's a different show.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.320]   Even though it's not my favorite show in the world.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.000]   It's a much better show.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.440]   It reduces the stickiness of the show.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.640]   It also-- again, it just--
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.320]   and also it affects creators.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.840]   I can't believe the Russo brothers
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.920]   would be happy with what ended up showing up on--
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.760]   showing-- I mean, they should be unhappy about them again.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.640]   Some of the dialogue and some of the video effects in Greyman.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.720]   But I can't believe that they'd be happy with the level
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.240]   of visual quality that they ended up with with Netflix.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.960]   I mean, they spent all that time and money
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.160]   on something that there's no other place to see it
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.480]   and the place that you can see it looks--
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.880]   It's interesting because Game of Thrones
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.720]   was streamed up by HBO and HD.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.040]   They're now redoing it in 4K.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.320]   Now, recently, I started watching it.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.320]   It's a big difference.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.520]   It's a huge difference.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.760]   So they have it now in 4K because they had another--
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.640]   Yeah, they had a real compression problem, too.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.000]   Remember with that last episode eight in the last season,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.920]   it was just blocky, block, block, block.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.960]   So I haven't gotten the last season.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.960]   I just watched the first episode.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.040]   But it is remarkably better that people
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.040]   who had the Blu-ray DVD or seeing it in 4K.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.200]   But Netflix-- I mean, HBO never streamed it that way.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.320]   They're only doing that because they have a prequel
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.280]   that they're going to let go in the next month.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.280]   I think that they'll stop it.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.120]   They should just stop at season five
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.400]   so that we don't remember how bad the rest was.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:24.840]   So--
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.800]   I'm still dealing with the scars of that.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.400]   I hadn't even really thought about that.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.800]   But that's a significant increase in their cost to go to--
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.560]   Go to-- that's the whole thing.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.280]   And the hard part is that you're not paying per show.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.960]   And when you do it when you pay $15 to download it,
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.360]   I can give you a much higher quality
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.720]   because it's a cost per unit.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.480]   But if the show is a gigabyte more--
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.800]   now that may not seem like a lot.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.600]   Like if it's a gigabyte more to deliver it to you
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.720]   at a higher quality, that may not be a lot.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.360]   But it's still, let's say, $0.03 a gig
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.360]   that is now multiplied by a million.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.800]   Well, remember, I don't know more than--
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.800]   But HBO--
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.720]   Actually had streaming problems when,
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.200]   on the last episode of the very last episode,
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.920]   I remember that people couldn't watch it
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.360]   because their streams are down.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.280]   You had to watch it on the cable.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.760]   Ooh.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.480]   I hope Apple TV, though, does not suffer.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.320]   And I wonder if it might from this Ben Stiller problem
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.360]   where-- or the Hannah Waddington problem,
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.400]   where we don't really know if anybody's watching this
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.800]   until we go to a Comic Con.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.640]   That's not really a good--
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.840]   it could make Apple TV plus kind of a refuge.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.320]   Notice the new movie that they're promoting quite heavily.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.560]   That's how they responded this.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.200]   Well, we're going to promote you like crazy.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:41.200]   "Luck," which was-- it took over the front page on Apple TV,
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.240]   is actually a John Lasseter movie.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.480]   He was forced out of Pixar for--
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.240]   they claimed inappropriate behavior.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.080]   I'm a friend of John's.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.920]   I know John, but then I will just say he's a cuddly kind of guy.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.920]   But-- so I don't know if that was a completely--
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.440]   I don't know what happened there.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:02.120]   But reviews aren't great for "Luck" right now.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.080]   But this is the next--
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.280]   they're trying to do-- Skydance is going to try
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.760]   to do what Pixar did.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.160]   I think the problem-- the hard part is
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.320]   that you got John Lasseter, who is an amazing talent
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.640]   when it really has to storytelling.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.640]   Yes.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.640]   But the infrastructure of Pixar and how they manage
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.000]   every single scene is so--
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   it is a cut-throat, every scene--
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.320]   every word is attacked, every sentence is attacked,
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.880]   every scene is attacked.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.800]   And so it's--
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.480]   I don't know if Skydance has-- and he's
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.200]   the one that designed that.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.160]   But I don't know if they have that yet where they're--
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.480]   This is--
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.520]   and it just makes a huge difference.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.200]   Or telling.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.240]   If there is a story that the script was finished before
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.960]   Lasseter joined Skydance, he worked on it.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.680]   But really, the next--
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.920]   I heard that he ripped it all up.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.800]   But the next one will be the one where we'll see
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.080]   if he starts from scratch, whether he can get the next--
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.280]   or magic.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.640]   Anyway, yeah, I would hope that Apple TV doesn't become
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.240]   a refuge.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.080]   Apple's doing its best not to--
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.760]   I think it would only be that way if other companies
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.080]   start giving everybody the numbers,
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.880]   then that becomes--
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.760]   So you get numbers from HBO, though.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.680]   I think--
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.640]   Nobody's giving streaming numbers out.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.640]   Not even HBO.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.160]   Nobody wants to do that.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.440]   Netflix has their ratings charts.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.600]   But they're not real numbers.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.480]   They're like hours viewed.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.160]   Nobody's really giving it away because they do believe
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.840]   that it's trade secrets and it's the crown jewels.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.920]   So you end up--
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.720]   the problem is not the ego.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.800]   I mean, ego boosts are part of it, right?
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.200]   Knowing people love your thing is
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.560]   going to make you as an artist, probably more
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.120]   excited about doing the next thing,
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.680]   instead of just shouting into the void.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.360]   But also, you got to negotiate your next gig.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.600]   And if you can say, look at this huge hit, that's one thing.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.480]   And if you can say, they tell me that the charts were good,
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.640]   that's not necessarily going to be clear about what
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.280]   you should be paid for your next gig.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.680]   I do think that an Apple is definitely one,
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.560]   but it's not alone.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.680]   Things like awards into being a proxy in some cases.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.560]   So like Ted Lasso, they may not know what their numbers are,
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.920]   but they know what the awards they've gotten.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.440]   And Severance is a great example of that.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.240]   There's the Comic Con audience, sure.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.440]   But I would argue that the real good thing for the makers
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.480]   of Severance is they got all those Emmy nominations.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.640]   And so it's like somebody--
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.960]   they are getting their ego stroked, at least a little bit,
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.200]   that people appreciate the work that they're doing.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.800]   But we do listen--
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.960]   I would love for there to be some sort of detente
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.360]   where everybody gets some number that they release
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.000]   that they agree on, because that's my problem with it.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.560]   My biggest problem with it is it actually suppresses
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.200]   people's earning potential.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.520]   If nobody knows how well that show did.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.400]   I mean, that's typical for Hollywood.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.560]   They're generous with awards, generous with prestige,
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.120]   generous with praise.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.560]   If it comes down to data that would help you come back
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.120]   in a contract negotiation with them and saying, hey, look,
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.000]   we know that we're generating 18% of the revenue
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.280]   for your entire channel.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.600]   We want to be paid commensurate with the value
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.640]   that we're delivering.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.200]   They don't want to give you that.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:21:59.880]   The friends, the friends.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.080]   That's the problem, you know?
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.280]   Yeah, and I think that's why you see a lot of shows
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.280]   that do very well get canceled in their third season,
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:11.280]   because it's going to cost a lot more for talent.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.560]   Yeah, as a matter of fact, Jason knows, Babylon 5,
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.320]   the creator of Babylon 5 was brilliant,
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.440]   because he was had an experience in the TV industry
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.080]   to know that if he wants this thing to end after five seasons,
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.760]   if he had a five season story to tell,
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.760]   he designed all the contracts so that the show would implode
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.440]   after season five, that if it were so successful
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.600]   that they wanted to renew it after season six,
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.120]   everybody would have to negotiate all at once,
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.600]   and then that would cost too much money.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.000]   And the friends is a great example.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.400]   The reason why they all got so much money was because
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.440]   they decided to essentially form a union,
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.720]   form a friends leading cast union,
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.840]   and say you negotiate with us as a group.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.840]   You can't single out one of us for stardom
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.520]   and basically put us, the rest of us, at one tenth wages.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.080]   This is why labor, labor, labor,
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.760]   the moral workforce, no matter at what level,
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.560]   gets to organize, understand how much they get paid,
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.080]   and understand their contribution materially to the company,
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.120]   the better off those workers are gonna be.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.560]   - This is why I hate suits.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.520]   I mean, I have some experience with this.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.880]   TV executives wanna make stars, they don't wanna pay stars.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.640]   So there's this tension between,
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.000]   stars drive ratings, ratings drive revenue,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.520]   then stars ask for more money, now we got a problem.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.680]   And there's this constant tension.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.520]   As suits have no, this is all for them,
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.920]   this is all financial calculation.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.960]   This is not about content creation or anything like it.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.280]   It's about how can we make more money?
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.840]   - And that's the great advantage that Apple and Amazon have
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.000]   doing their ecosystem play,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.040]   where the money doesn't kind of matter
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.760]   'cause it's part of a larger picture thing.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.840]   Is it allows Amazon and Apple to say,
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.640]   "We love you and we'll pay you money."
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.680]   Whereas at HBO Max, they all know that Casey Bloys
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.600]   has David Zazlav right behind him saying,
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.240]   "Your budget is what for that?"
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.040]   And that is an advantage that you had
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.880]   if you're not playing the same game as everybody else.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.920]   And Amazon and Apple are there.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.920]   - Apple, we know is looking to acquire properties
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.640]   like the NFL Sunday ticket.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.920]   They're in the running for that $2.5 billion deal next year.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.400]   Now news, Apple's in talks to acquire streaming rights
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.200]   for big 10 college athletics.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.360]   That's interesting.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.840]   - One of the many, right?
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.360]   - That headline is a little bit misleading
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.520]   'cause they're in the talks along with Amazon
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.840]   and ESPN and there are others too.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.040]   It sounds like, not to get too far on the weeds
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.320]   for people that don't care about sports,
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.000]   but basically Fox and ESPN are the big players
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.760]   in terms of televised college sports in the US.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.920]   And ESPN has a deal with the SEC now,
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.560]   which is the one number one college conference for football.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.680]   And so Fox has the number two deal,
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.320]   which is with the big 10.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.240]   And so this is basically the scraps.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.600]   Fox is literally leading the negotiations
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.840]   with their competitors here
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.120]   to sell sub packages out of their package.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:08.960]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.640]   - It'll be scraps, but one of the things
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:15.640]   that all the college football consortia are talking about
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.000]   is is there sweet, sweet streaming money to be had?
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.240]   And if you're not in the package with ESPN,
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.640]   which the big 10 seems to not be,
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.120]   if that doesn't come to pass,
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.200]   where do you put that stuff?
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.680]   'Cause ESPN has ESPN plus.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.760]   They've got infinite inventory for your college football.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.200]   If you're not there though, where do you go?
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.680]   And the answer might be Apple or Amazon or Peacock
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.600]   or Paramount plus or some other streamer
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.760]   for not the marquee games, but college conferences,
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.680]   you're talking about a lot of football games every weekend.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.880]   There's plenty to go around.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.840]   - Yeah.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.120]   Yeah, this is just Big 10.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.080]   This is not, I mean, there's the SEC.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.040]   Which is probably arguably more popular.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:26:01.200]   I love it though that Apple's playing ball, so to speak.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.040]   - Yeah.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.760]   - And we'll continue to see this.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.800]   I mean, the reality is, is that within the next decade,
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.200]   the broadcasters are not viable,
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.560]   like to be able to keep on competing with these streamers.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.120]   You know, the streamers are just dipping their toes in
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.120]   and playing with it.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.480]   These are not big budgets for them.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:21.320]   And for broadcast, they are becoming bigger and bigger budgets
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.400]   because they're, they're cut of making money
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.600]   is getting smaller and smaller.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.200]   So broadcast is shrinking.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.320]   These streamers are getting bigger
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.320]   and the streamers have, you know, much more money than they do.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.120]   So it's really a matter of the streamers proving
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.160]   that their market's big enough,
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.280]   that they're not gonna get blowback
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.480]   for taking over the big stuff.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.040]   And that's probably still three to five years away.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.040]   But you'll probably see, you know, a lot of the,
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.640]   it'll be nice for a little while,
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.720]   but within the next 10 years,
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.320]   if we have any on broadcast, I'd be pretty surprised.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.160]   - Yeah.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.520]   - I would disagree only in the sense that Disney
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.480]   is a major player in sports in America
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.440]   because they own ESPN and they have the advantage
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.440]   of having broadcast and cable and streaming.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.240]   And so they can, they can dole it out
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.120]   and they can, they can sort of section it off.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.240]   And that gives them some luxury that a player like Fox,
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.400]   it's a harder sell, right?
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.440]   But Disney has got all the bases covered.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.200]   And I think that that allows them to put a tiered kind
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.800]   of package together where it's streaming.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.640]   - They're running a skateboard.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.880]   - Yes, but it's also on ABC or it's on ESPN.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.400]   - And let's not forget ESPN has a Ocho
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.760]   and the big XL championship.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.560]   If you are a spreadsheet, I missed this.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.720]   I'm so sad that I did not see this.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.800]   XL e-sports, I guess last weekend,
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.920]   ESPN did the El Ocho, the Ocho,
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.560]   which was the joke in the dodge ball, the movie dodge ball.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:44.600]   And among other things, they had XL spreadsheet,
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.680]   e-sports, all-star battle.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.920]   I wanna play this so bad,
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.640]   but I know they'll just take us down if I do.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.920]   A tournament in which an unexpected full column flash fill
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.080]   is announced like a 50 yard Hail Mary,
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.960]   according to Kevin Purdy writing in ours, Technica.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.520]   (laughs)
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.320]   The Financial Modeling World Cup, which is actually real.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.960]   In fact, I remember we reported on it
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.880]   when it was going on, I guess this is a edited version
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.360]   of the championship, which was a few months ago, but still.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.680]   It's actually engaging.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.480]   It's not like, okay, create a chart that does this.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.840]   It is, here is like a gigabyte of raw information.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.160]   They'll give you the presses of, there is a company
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.080]   that is trying to build a brand new factory
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.480]   in three new competing markets.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.120]   They don't know what they should do
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.880]   regarding putting money in A, B and C.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.600]   Here is again, an enormous pile of data.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.240]   We need you to generate information
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.520]   and reports for A, B, C and D.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.320]   And then you see people like, I understand the trick
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.360]   where you can highlight a list of numbers
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.160]   and then click a cell to make it put the sum in there,
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.040]   but the way that it got that automation going,
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.760]   you know that there are extreme athletes
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.800]   in every possible operation
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.640]   that people who know that that ends completely locked.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.320]   This is the, it is funny, but I like the idea of,
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.960]   there should be more than five sports on TV,
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.680]   whether it's streaming or broadcast.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.280]   I like the idea that at some point
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.600]   you're going to see high diving in Acapulco.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.040]   I like the idea that at some point
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:22.960]   you're going to see the organized
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.320]   speed climbing competition,
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.520]   side by side speed climbing competitions.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.080]   Stuff where I don't know what the rules are.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.120]   I don't know who, I have no dog in this hunt.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.160]   I'm just blown away that humans are doing something
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.600]   that the apex of what humans can possibly do.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.200]   And I hope that all these streaming channels
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.880]   give opportunities for individualized sports programs
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.040]   to find homes.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.520]   - That has happened.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.320]   And I think I agree with you.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.680]   I think that's already happening
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.600]   and will continue to happen.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.160]   The Olympic sports, especially anything
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.560]   that's got the imprint of the Olympic sports,
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.280]   those things tend now to be available
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.280]   on streaming year round.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.920]   And if you've, I don't know if you've got ESPN+ Andy,
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.960]   but boy, whoa, there's some stuff on ESPN+
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.680]   that you're like, that's a thing.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.000]   And it's like, yes, that is a thing,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.320]   whether it's like Irish hurling or, I mean like,
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.520]   there are so many.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.000]   - Irish hurling has nothing to do,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.160]   I might I with a hot dog eating championship.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.320]   That's a completely-- - No, that's a different
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.160]   kind of hurling.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.480]   Irish hurling is sort of like soccer and field hockey,
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.800]   except you hit each other with sticks.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.640]   It's amazing.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.480]   (laughing)
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.280]   Yeah, or something like curling,
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.320]   which is an Olympic sport,
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.040]   which is those are always on or lacrosse.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.880]   And like, yeah, there's a lot of smaller niche sports
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.640]   that are finding their way on streaming,
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.200]   because right, like other than the cost to produce it,
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.360]   you can make it available.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.280]   And there will be hopefully a fervent audience
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.640]   that loves it that will find it.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.480]   - Yeah.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.840]   - Excel maybe going a little too far.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.120]   - Yeah, well, be careful too,
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.600]   because if you trip on a pivot table, you might hurt yourself.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.880]   - Ooh, ow.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.000]   So the second round, the semi-finals,
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.840]   simulating a yacht regatta, an Excel,
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.680]   and then the finals, an entirely Excel-based,
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.480]   retro-style 2D platform.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.520]   And they had to create a score tracking mechanic.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.760]   Wow.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.480]   Now, if you feel like maybe you have some skills
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:12.480]   to be in Excel, October, the big FMWC Open 2022,
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.720]   Excel e-sports for all, it's open.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.280]   That means anybody can compete.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.600]   So just, you know, you might wanna,
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.680]   it's the FM Financial Modeling World Cup,
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.760]   FMworldcup.com, and it will be live streamed.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.280]   (laughs)
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.480]   Probably not by ESPN.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.200]   - There should be a pro-M in front of it,
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.400]   just like the US Open for golf.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.440]   This is a pro-M, this is an AM.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.800]   In other words, because it's open, anybody can compete
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.120]   at pros and amateurs, but with a $10,000 prize fund,
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.960]   imagine there'll be some pros in there as well, I don't know.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.040]   (laughs)
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.440]   What will I be solving?
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.880]   The game tasks will be testing your Excel
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.000]   and logical thinking skills.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.240]   There's a card game, there's a share of the ride,
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.800]   there's, it's a snake.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.280]   I think this is hysterical.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.720]   And you can, I think you could do it from your home.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.920]   I don't think you have to go anywhere to participate.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.200]   Final round, we'll be covering the grand finale
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:19.040]   November 12th, one session, eight players live streamed.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:23.560]   No time limits, no substitutions, it's battle to the death.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.600]   Just like for a little ball.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.240]   For enter the octagon, only one emerges.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.440]   Let's take a little break.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.520]   We actually have some Apple news.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.960]   I swear to God, I swear to God.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.880]   We said the word Apple a lot.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.720]   Anytime that's, there's 20 minutes.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.040]   Yeah, we did a whole segment word.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.800]   We're just trying to jam the word Apple into things
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.800]   that weren't Apple.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.800]   Apple Apple, Apple Apple Apple Apple Apple.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.640]   See you happy now?
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.480]   We did fine.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.640]   You can use Excel on that.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.080]   If you look at word cloud, you'll see Apple
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.320]   as one of the largest words.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.680]   There you go.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.680]   I show, you know what, one of the big words in my life,
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:59.240]   and it's a puffy little cloud is sleep.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:04.080]   Getting a good night's sleep is the ultimate game changer.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.520]   It natures gentle nurse.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:10.600]   In fact, consistently good sleep can reduce the likelihood
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.880]   of serious health issues, decrease the risk of heart disease,
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.840]   lower blood pressure, even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:20.120]   I notice having a good night's sleep reduces my appetite,
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.120]   so I don't have to overeat.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.680]   And yet still more than 30% of Americans struggle with sleep.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.840]   One of the number one reasons right now,
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.800]   especially feeling hot at night.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.680]   Sweaty, tossing and turning, looking for some refreshment.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.120]   That is a problem.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:40.960]   That's why I love our eight sleep pod pro cover.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.320]   We got it almost a year ago.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.360]   So we went through winter with it,
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.160]   which is nice 'cause the pod pro cover
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.520]   can warm up to as hot as 110 degrees.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.800]   So it can really be nice and warm.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.480]   But it also can go as cool as 55 degrees.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.200]   So it can cool you off as well.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.400]   And what's great with the eight sleep pod pro cover
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.200]   is it does it dynamically.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.400]   It monitors the room temperature.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.240]   It monitors your temperature, your restlessness,
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.560]   and maintains the optimal sleeping temperature
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.200]   for what your body needs.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.280]   It turns out that when it cools down,
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.360]   you go into a deeper sleep.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.000]   That cleansing deep sleep is so important.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.520]   Dynamic cooling and heating with biometric tracking.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.400]   That's the secret of the eight sleep pod pro cover.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.280]   And by the way, it's got two sides
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.200]   'cause Lisa, my wife has a very different need
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.480]   for warmth and coolness.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.200]   So it does it separately.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.320]   Her side gets quite hot in fact, but mine does not.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.560]   I like to go to bed where it's kind of warm,
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.080]   cool off at night, even in the wintertime I did this,
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.920]   and then warm up to wake me up.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.200]   It's got a little vibration too.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.560]   So you can have a very subtle alarm
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.240]   if you want to get you up in the morning.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.000]   I thought it's, I don't even need the vibration.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.840]   I just need the subtle warming is enough to say,
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.320]   "Oh yeah, morning time to get up."
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.560]   With more deep sleep, you can be confident.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.200]   Your mind and body are getting those restorative
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.400]   sleep stages vital for physical recovery,
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.600]   hormone regulation, mental clarity.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.120]   Now this is the new one by the way.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.400]   They just launched the next generation of the pod,
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.920]   the pod three, which enables more accurate sleep
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.240]   and health tracking, double the amount of sensors.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.440]   So you get the best sleep experience on earth.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.840]   The pod pro cover from eight sleep, it's not magic,
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.640]   but it feels like it, and I love it.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.880]   Go to eightsleep.com/macbreak,
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.360]   start sleeping cool this summer.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.360]   You'll save $150 on checkout on the pod pro cover.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.600]   And eight sleep good news ships within the US, Canada,
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.400]   the UK, and now select countries in the EU and Australia.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.120]   So our overseas listeners, our international listeners,
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.880]   you can get it to eightsleep.com/macbreak,
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:54.880]   E-I-G-H-T-S-L-E-E-P.com/macbreak.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.200]   Lisa and I love it, I have to say the cats love it too.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.520]   They really like it when it's warm.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.680]   Our cat Paris is under the covers right now
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.000]   on our eight sleep, nice and toasty warm.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.400]   I made the bed and I heard this meowing and I went,
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.320]   what's the second I muffled meowing?
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.320]   Then there's all lump.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.480]   (laughs)
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.280]   I said, oh, oh, that's Paris under there.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.440]   Very happy with the eight sleep cover.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.760]   Cat approved.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.120]   All right, Apple news, I promised you Apple news.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:28.440]   There's actually, the headline story was gonna be,
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:34.840]   iOS 16 now adds a percentage for your battery.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:39.280]   Woo hoo!
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.080]   But you know, we can't have nice things
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.640]   because already people are saying, oh,
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.040]   maybe you don't want this.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.400]   What?
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.120]   Again, do we use to have this?
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.040]   Yeah, we used to have that and then they took it away
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.720]   and now you can put it back.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.560]   If you want.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.000]   Now you can have something that the precision
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.240]   is greater than the accuracy.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.600]   (laughs)
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.600]   It doesn't really, I mean, like the--
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.960]   It's not that, you know what I'm saying?
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.800]   I like that line.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.120]   The precision exceeds the accuracy.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.040]   That happens all the time.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.640]   People tell you that this is 0.1, and that's like,
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.560]   okay, well, that is not accurate enough
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.040]   to be that precise and so--
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.720]   Yeah, it's the Friday night baseball
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:17.920]   where they say his chance,
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.480]   the first few weeks it was on the chance
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.720]   of getting on base was like 52.33%.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.000]   And it's like, that's way too much precision.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.880]   You don't actually know the percentage that way.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.000]   And this is like that too.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.760]   I talked to a battery engineer once who works at Apple.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.120]   This was a few years ago.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.400]   And the fact is they're measuring the power
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.280]   that's coming out of the battery and making an estimate.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.560]   Like it's not a real percentage.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.400]   Like none of these batteries are--
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.240]   None of these batteries are--
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.240]   And it's 82 and then it's like,
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.080]   yeah, it depends on what you're doing with it.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:44.920]   None of them--
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.000]   Exactly, and in fact, they lie to you.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.600]   I don't know if people know this.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.160]   Since the battery health thing,
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.240]   Apple has tried to be a little more above board
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.200]   about what it's doing here.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.600]   But like, there are times when Apple will tell you
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.080]   that it's full, but it won't recharge it
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:37:59.960]   all the way to full.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.760]   It'll stop because it's trying to extend your battery health.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.400]   And now they try to do it where they then charge it
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.200]   when they think you're going to be leaving in the morning
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.160]   so that it's up at 100%.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.560]   But they-- you know, for a long time there,
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.480]   you'd lay it down.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.680]   You'd be checking in the evening and say it was at 100%.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.120]   And you're like, good, good.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.280]   It's charging at 100%.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.640]   And it would stop charging and still say it was charging
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.960]   at 100% because it's trying to outwit you
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.160]   because what you want to do with your phone's battery
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.000]   is bad for your phone's battery.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.040]   So it's all just kind of--
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.400]   It's like your car telling you're out of gas.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.920]   And I've proven that you can drive it still quite some ways
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.360]   after it's--
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.400]   I have to say, though, I hate it when I wake up
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.280]   in the middle of the night and I see an alert that says,
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.040]   my phone's only charged 50%.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:43.840]   It'll be fully charged by 7 AM, really bugs the hell out of me.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.640]   Just fill it up.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.440]   Will you please?
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:49.120]   I don't-- what's this dribbling it out over a period of time?
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.760]   What if I got up and I had to go somewhere?
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.200]   Come on, Apple.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.160]   So there are--
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.000]   Go ahead.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.360]   Or at the very least, give me a look.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.960]   I know this is going to damage my battery,
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.360]   but having 100% in the next eight minutes
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.320]   before I board this plane is way more important to me
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.880]   than losing two hours of battery life three years from now.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.520]   Don't be a battery nanny.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.560]   Come on, man.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.240]   And that's why I think they changed it.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.920]   That's why now you get this information of like,
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.840]   we aren't going to charge your battery right now,
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.040]   but we know you usually leave and don't charge at 9 AM
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.720]   and so then we'll charge it to full.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.440]   A lot of electric cars do this now, too.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.640]   And it's the same idea is that they want to be efficient,
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.800]   but they also need to tell you what they're doing
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.920]   and give you an opportunity to override it.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.440]   But the larger point stands, which
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.680]   is there's a lot of things that we think of as exact science
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.880]   when it comes to our batteries that are not really true.
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.760]   And so yes, thank goodness I can say that it's 83% now.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.920]   But is that helpful?
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.000]   I mean, I get how it might be reassuring,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.440]   but I'm not sure it's helpful.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.840]   Well, I hope you paid attention in high school.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.080]   I know my physics and my math teachers
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.520]   were constantly talking about precision
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.400]   and how you had to know what the--
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.520]   Significant digits.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.440]   Significant digits were very good.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.240]   Of course, we were using slide rules.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:04.040]   So it really did matter about that because it was really
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.240]   pretty much a guess.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.400]   How thick is that line?
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.480]   I remember talking, having anything in chemistry,
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.960]   we had the long conversation about the accuracy
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.640]   of the thickness of the line.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.160]   We're not on a computer, but like we were--
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.720]   It's called a cursor on a slide rule.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.480]   That's what it's called.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.640]   And so you're looking at it, like going--
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.640]   but can we actually be more accurate than that?
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.280]   Because the line is--
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.560]   And really good slide rules, they
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.480]   would use hairs for the line.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:32.960]   So already, 9 to 5 Mac Jose or Dorno is writing comment,
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:37.680]   the problem with the iOS 16 battery percentage icon.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.520]   And it's not what you think it is.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:45.880]   It's that down to 20%, it looks like you got a full battery.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.840]   It was only after 20%.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.960]   See, here's a 78% battery, but it's fully filled in.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.840]   They only partially fill it in once it's below.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.440]   The icon is no longer meaningful.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.760]   It's only the number inside the icon that's meaningful.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.480]   Now, I presume I could switch this off, right?
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.120]   I don't have to have a percentage.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:02.800]   I think so.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.840]   I think so.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.440]   And you should because it's silly.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.960]   But everybody wants it.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.760]   You want to be silly.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:08.800]   I have an iPhone Mini.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.840]   Silly feature is not available for the iPhone Mini.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.880]   It's only a limited--
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.240]   Too bad.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.840]   First of all, not all iPhones with a notch
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.040]   will have the new battery percentage icon.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:22.840]   The 1313 Pro 13 Pro Max will 12 Pro 12 Pro Max will 11 Pro
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.040]   11 Pro Max.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:28.160]   The iPhone XS and XS Max and the iPhone X, that's it.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.000]   So yeah, no minis.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.400]   You have a mini, Jason?
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:32.920]   I do.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.160]   iPhone 13 Mini, I love it.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.440]   You prefer it?
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.080]   Yes.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.120]   Tiny phones.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.360]   You probably got to be on a lock, right, in the next month?
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:40.920]   Totally.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.480]   I'm hosed.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:42.440]   Absolutely.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.720]   Well, I mean, I bought this last year,
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.200]   and I usually hold on to a phone of my own for a couple of years.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:51.080]   So I've got another year with it.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.440]   But yeah, it's not coming back.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.960]   I'm an outlier on that one.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:56.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.880]   Did Apple not sell a lot of them?
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.280]   Is that why they're not making them anymore or--
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.080]   In fact, I think they didn't sell a lot of the iPhone 12 Mini.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.320]   Because we heard even before the 13 Mini came out
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.920]   that there wasn't going to be a 14 Mini.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.440]   I think for good reasons, they want to experiment.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:14.360]   And the idea of doing a Max phone that's not a Pro Max
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.160]   is interesting to them.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.240]   And I think we'll probably sell incredibly well.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.760]   And they'll be happy that they did it.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.760]   I think it also turns out that we now
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.360]   have cameras that happen to do other functions.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.400]   And so, I mean, all the cameras,
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:34.240]   that all the camera options that are on the bigger phones,
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.840]   I mean, it's just amazing.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.720]   And I just look at it like a phone.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.920]   It's a camera that happens to do other phone functions,
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:42.920]   to me, at this point.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.360]   I don't know.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.760]   I think that mostly it's because the people who
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.880]   are interested in smaller phones aren't
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.560]   interested in premium phones.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.480]   It's not that they're buying based on price,
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.280]   but the fact that they want a smaller screen,
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   something that's easier to stick in a pocket,
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.240]   they can operate without being quite so
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.160]   showy about it, are not necessarily
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.720]   the people who want something that folds three ways,
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:07.240]   has 18 lenses, and has satellite communications.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.320]   They're happy with a $400, $500 phone.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.080]   And one of those things that they find in those four, $500
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.520]   phones is that they can be compacted
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.240]   because they don't have to put quite so many expensive,
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.760]   full-featured parts of it.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.400]   Those socketed chips, those do take up a lot of space
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.280]   in those cheaper phones.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:28.600]   But other than that, one thing I was reading--
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.160]   I don't know how accurate this is,
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:34.960]   but the Rumoriz Apple will not release iPad OS 16 at the same
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.600]   time as they release iOS 16, iOS 16,
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.920]   within-- probably come out with the new iPhones.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.720]   But iPad OS will be delayed an extra month.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.640]   The rumor is that it's problems with stage manager,
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.960]   that it's not-- I don't know-- not what they want it to be.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.200]   I think it's more like complexity with stage manager.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.920]   This is an app-- this is a total rethink of how you interact
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.320]   with apps on the iPad and on the Mac.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.520]   And so there's such a compelling motivation
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.560]   to get it right.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.400]   And Apple is never the company that says,
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.200]   we're going to put every feature out there and make it complex.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.080]   And we'll debug as we go.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:12.800]   They really are.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.840]   We are OK with doing something that
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.200]   does half of what we think it should ultimately do.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.360]   So long as it works right out of the gate.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.480]   And if you're not going to make a good first impression,
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.120]   that's how people might have never
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.480]   used this feature you spent so much time and money on.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:31.040]   I mean, I don't tend to use full-screen apps.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.040]   I don't tend to use workspaces a lot on the Mac.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.360]   And there are a lot of other examples of features on the Mac
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.360]   that I don't really use, not because they aren't good,
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.000]   but because they just never presented themselves
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.160]   in such a compelling way that I can't imagine working
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.600]   without them.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.520]   I was going to say that too.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.600]   It's well said.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.560]   iPad has been drifting to the Mac, right?
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.160]   It's more Mac-like all the time.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.200]   Stage manager makes it even more Mac-like.
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:04.760]   The Mac comes out-- Mac OS comes out a month later anyway.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:05.720]   There are going to be new--
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.840]   probably the rumor is new iPad Pro that's
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.000]   going to come out in October.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.800]   So you time this announcement and new Macs in October,
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.320]   new Mac OS in October.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.760]   Why not take the extra time?
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.240]   And then let's not forget the biggest picture of all,
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.920]   which is half of Apple's revenue is the iPhone.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.400]   The iPhone is what matters the most.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.720]   If you're making OS decisions in late summer
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.280]   about what to do in order to ship your OS for the fall,
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.080]   the iPhone will win every single time.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.800]   And so if you're an iPad user or developer,
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.480]   you're like, if you could get the iPad to just get out
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.000]   of the way a little bit, let them ship that first OS
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.320]   revision for the iPhone, and then get a little extra time
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.040]   to wrap up the iPad work.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.000]   I think that's all for the best, because it
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.440]   isn't becoming more and more like a Mac all the time.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.120]   And so having it wait till October, it makes sense.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.240]   Because the iPhone event is in September, not an iPad event.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.640]   And as someone who most likely upgrade around February,
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.040]   I think it's fine.
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:04.600]   iOS tends to be a little better.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.600]   But I tend to wait.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:09.880]   I have a-- I think that a lot of things
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.160]   get cleaned up between when it's released
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.960]   and about the end of February.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.160]   And then I think that a lot of focus
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.480]   turns to WWC and everything else.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.720]   And so I think that most of what you're
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.160]   going to get as far as fixes happen,
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.320]   then those are really great time to update.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.080]   I went ahead of it.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:33.840]   And so I have the last version, because I was really
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.240]   excited about some keynote stuff I updated my Mac OS much
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.440]   earlier, because of the new keynote live stuff.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.320]   And I don't think I'll do that again.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.400]   I think that was a really painful fall.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.640]   So I think I'll wait until March 1.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.560]   I haven't noticed the stage manager is particularly
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.680]   buggy or anything.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.520]   I've been using the iPadOS beta, public beta on my iPad Pro.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.520]   It seems to work fine.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.000]   I mean, it's not so much.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.880]   I think when you use a lot of the Apple stuff,
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.400]   what you really see is when you start going off
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.640]   into the developer stuff that is asking for things that Apple
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.640]   may not approach that way, and things get a little funky.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.600]   That'd be invisible to an end user, really.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.400]   They're still tweaking some of the details of stage manager.
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.920]   And I think they're doing a good job of it.
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.600]   Like, I think it feels more cohesive than it did even
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.520]   a month ago.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.760]   There are bugs, though.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.400]   And my friend Federico Vitticci at Mac Storey,
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.040]   he says it's getting really buggy.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:24.080]   I think it's an effect of them making changes
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.440]   is that they're letting the bugs kind of hang out there
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.240]   while they make it more usable.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.160]   And I'm OK with that.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.800]   But his example that I think is a really great one
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.560]   is sometimes you click on a link and you've
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.800]   got two windows open.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.160]   A link in a document and Safari.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.600]   And you click on the link in the document.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.560]   And what you expect is that what would it do?
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.640]   It's going to open a new tab and Safari window
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.480]   in the same stage.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.400]   And instead, it opens a new stage
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.040]   with a new single Safari window with the link you clicked.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.640]   And it's like, what?
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.160]   And the answer is--
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.560]   it's not ready yet.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.560]   That's the answer.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:59.400]   I also think it makes perfect strategic sense now
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.080]   to separate the iPad and the iPhone.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:04.280]   And to have-- you've got an iPhone event in September.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.640]   It's focused on the iPhone.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:06.440]   That's good.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.080]   And then you're going to have an iPad event.
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.160]   Why not release iPadOS?
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:14.840]   That's also a measure of the bifurcation of iOS and iPadOS.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.480]   It's just the continued bifurcation.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.840]   Not even the Macification.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:21.040]   Because I still think iPadOS is very distinct from MacOS.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.480]   It's just drifting a little further away from the iPhone
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.840]   and a little bit closer to the Mac.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.280]   But they're not merging them.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.840]   The one thing that I understand the frustration of--
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.000]   there are a lot of iOS developers.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.280]   And their apps run on both the iPhone and the iPad.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.760]   Because it was the same base OS.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.720]   And my friend James Thompson, who's an iOS developer,
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:40.200]   said this the other day, that the challenge is,
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.920]   if you release your iOS 16 version when the iPhone shipped,
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:43.920]   that's great.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:49.000]   But the day that the iPad version ships, all your iOS 16
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.520]   features light up on the iPad, you
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.320]   haven't tested them with the final version.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.760]   If there are bugs, you're going to get negative reviews.
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.080]   I think Apple is going to keep doing this.
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.920]   Apple needs to maybe put in some features that
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.080]   allow developers to have more control of when
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.000]   the iPhone version drops versus when the iPad version drops.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.880]   Because up to now, it's just been assumed
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:09.560]   that it's going to be the same time.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.200]   And if it's not going to be the same time,
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.880]   maybe they need some more developer tools there.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.320]   That's a very good point.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.960]   I didn't even think about that.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.280]   What are we thinking for the Apple event?
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.800]   I'm looking at the September calendar, September 6,
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:24.440]   obviously, day after Labor Day is out.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:29.640]   September 13, the following week, you think?
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.720]   It hasn't always been out.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.000]   I think that they did do one that was like Tuesday or a
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.240]   Thursday after Labor Day.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.600]   Yeah, it might have been even on the Wednesday after Labor Day
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.200]   around the equation.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.600]   Oh, they could do that.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.040]   They could do that.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:45.120]   So I guess it's impossible at this point to predict how far off--
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:48.120]   it's roughly a month off one way or the other.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.720]   Also, in previous months--
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.280]   excuse me, previous years, they have to schedule around
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.560]   September 11.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.400]   Oh, yeah, that's not an issue.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:56.920]   That's a Sunday this year.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:57.640]   Right, exactly.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.320]   That's why it's--
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.000]   That's right.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:49:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:04.000]   The good news, according to Ming Chi Kuo, iPhone 14 is not
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.640]   facing supply chain issues.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.800]   Production and shipment are on track.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.080]   They're building them not only in China, but they're also
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.800]   going to in Taiwan.
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.160]   They make the chips, but also in India.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:21.440]   They're going to start production at the same time.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.520]   And I think in Brazil as well.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:28.720]   I think that's something we want to watch that progress.
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:30.400]   The India, Brazil--
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.720]   no, essentially, that's partially because you
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.880]   want to do local production.
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:35.600]   India, because of Brazil, because of tariffs.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.160]   They demanded, yeah.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:41.080]   They demanded, but I will say that China's antics over the
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:45.440]   last little bit has, I think, everybody that's doing
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.720]   production in China is going, oh, we need to get out of here.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:51.320]   Speaker of the House, Elsie Pelosi, went to Taiwan, upsetting
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.880]   China.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.880]   China did live fire exercises right off.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.440]   The fired missiles over the island.
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:05.800]   I mean, if you're watching Ukraine, and then you watch that--
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:06.480]   Scary.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.520]   I think that every company doing anything in China is trying
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.400]   to figure out how to diversify.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.520]   It's probably the most expensive thing, China.
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:19.080]   It's probably going to cost China trillions of dollars over
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.680]   the next decade as people start to go, we need to be not in
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.080]   this country, at least not always.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.440]   Everyone's been pretty lulled into, hey, we can just do it
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:28.720]   all in Shenzhen, or whatever.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.240]   We can just produce all these things.
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.240]   And they built up all that capacity.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.600]   And now they-- because how do you--
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:37.800]   how does Apple really talk its way through an invasion in
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.520]   Taiwan?
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:40.040]   And I think that--
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.840]   I don't think that's necessarily the biggest concern.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.440]   For instance, Pelosi met with Pegatron executives.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:51.660]   And so the stories were that some China was blocking
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:55.080]   Pegatron shipments to Chinese plants for the iPhone
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:55.880]   assembly.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.080]   Things like that are--
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:00.640]   I don't think maybe people were worried about an invasion.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:04.120]   But politically, it gets really complicated if they
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.080]   actually go into Taiwan.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.080]   And China only has a leboketron.
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:08.160]   That's a huge problem.
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.320]   I know, I mean, that's where--
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.320]   How does Apple say--
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.840]   if all of Apple's chips are made, it's TSMC.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:13.560]   I mean, yeah.
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:14.880]   Currently.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.560]   And so the thing is, is that both Taiwan and China start
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:18.560]   to become hot potatoes.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:21.520]   And companies can't do anything about it immediately.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.000]   Like, they're going to follow the party line and do what
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.280]   they need to do to make it work.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.400]   But that doesn't mean that they're not--
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.720]   these things happen over decades and over years or a
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.200]   decade.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:34.720]   And once they go that direction, they don't come back.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.600]   Everyone-- I think that everyone is now figuring out how
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.920]   to diversify from China.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.600]   And they won't come back when they figure it out.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:43.120]   Like, China has really--
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.520]   I think it's an unforced error on their part over something
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.200]   that they shouldn't--
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.200]   I mean, it's crazy that they're trying to--
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.240]   I know it's a pride thing for them, but it's a crazy thing
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:51.760]   for them to be--
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.280]   There's also--
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:52.840]   --going after Taiwan.
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:55.320]   There's a lot of geopolitical stuff going on.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.480]   There's a party congress in October.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:01.880]   There's thinking that she is worried about losing his role
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:06.800]   if he doesn't show that he's a strong man.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:09.840]   I think it's pretty clear after the invasion of Ukraine
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:15.040]   that would be very foolish economically to invade Taiwan.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.960]   But that doesn't stop them from doing things like halting
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:21.040]   shipments that are labeled Taiwan.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:25.480]   I mean, also TSMC had a one-on-one with Pelosi partially
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.160]   to talk about what the effect of the chips act is going to be
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:28.520]   with the--
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:29.160]   Which, by the way--
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.480]   --which was signed yesterday.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.000]   So--
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:31.800]   Or today.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:32.160]   Maybe.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.400]   Just signed.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:34.520]   So that's--
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.880]   And that came like a week or two after TSMC basically put out
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:41.800]   a policy statement saying that, look, war between China
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:44.120]   and Taiwan is not going to help China, Taiwan,
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.440]   or the international chip industry.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.920]   And basically, TSMC is saying that we side
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:51.960]   on the side of capitalism in this role.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.640]   And part of the discussion that they're having
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.680]   is that they legitimately want to branch
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:59.920]   beyond Taiwanese manufacturing to make sure they are not
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:03.240]   necessarily under the thumb of whatever China chooses
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.240]   to do in the next few years.
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:08.120]   TSMC is building a massive trillion-dollar plant
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.840]   in Arizona for this very reason, I think.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:11.760]   Right.
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:16.280]   And it's also-- yeah, there's also a related story about--
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:19.680]   it's part of the things that makes all of us politics in China
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.640]   so hard to fathom is that you don't
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:26.440]   know how much of this is deeply held politically motivated
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.880]   beliefs that look, this is a line we will not cross.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.600]   Do not-- do not test us on this.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:33.200]   And how much of this is looked, we
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.880]   have to save face somehow.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.160]   We've made all this posturing.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:37.480]   We have to do something.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.040]   So when Apple and other manufacturers
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:43.280]   get hassled by the government saying that, by the way,
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.880]   all these boxes of shipments that are coming into China
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:49.520]   saying product of Taiwan, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.520]   You're going to basically make sure they're all
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:55.880]   labeled that product of China, product of whatever they--
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.440]   Yeah, it says Taiwan, common.
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:59.800]   --com, China, which the Chinese love,
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.560]   because that means Taiwan is part of China, which--
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.060]   Right.
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:04.520]   --of the disputes.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.520]   Right.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:10.720]   And Apple has basically put out messages to all of their supply
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.240]   saying, look, you've got to box all of our incoming stuff
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.880]   exactly this way.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.600]   That law was apparently in effect for a while,
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.120]   but just wasn't really enforced.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.920]   So it's kind of interesting as a data point
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:25.760]   that they are choosing to enforce it right now, right
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:30.880]   when China needs to have some sign that, hey, look, we made
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.760]   you reprint your boxes.
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:37.440]   So if you want, don't pull the tail of the dragon, sir.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:41.720]   TSMC's chip factory in Arizona is a five nanometer process.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:46.760]   It will start production according to TSMC early 2024.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:47.840]   So this gives you some idea.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:49.800]   I mean, this is a long way off.
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:56.280]   There's a Japanese plant more for legacy nodes end of 2024.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.840]   And then they have a Taiwanese plant that's coming online.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:03.120]   The three nanometer plant, which probably is most interesting
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:06.480]   to Apple, is in Taiwan.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.120]   That's those are the most valuable product lines.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.080]   So if most of the money goes into making
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:13.280]   the most valuable processors, China
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:16.600]   will be left to basically be making chips for cars, which
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.920]   are really important, and chips for talking
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.120]   Billy Bass fish, which are not quite so important.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.280]   But very lucrative.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.240]   Very lucrative.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:27.120]   That is a great commercial.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:30.800]   It's good for dads or grads.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:32.960]   And again, I think you're going to see something that happens
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.320]   over a very long period of time.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.560]   But it's going to be really expensive for China.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:37.880]   Like when you look at the stack up,
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.200]   and it's not a great timing for them,
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.160]   because over the next decade, China
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.680]   is going to go through a population bomb,
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.360]   and that it's going to be traumatic for them.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.680]   And so for them to undermine their ability
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:52.600]   to generate revenue, in addition to all of this
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.280]   is complicated, really complicated.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.240]   That's a big threat too, because it
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.960]   seems as though every important political movement
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:05.520]   or government going back to the United States revolution
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.720]   that we had a couple of hundred years ago,
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:10.760]   it doesn't happen unless the people who are very, very rich
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.600]   are concerned that the current government is not
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.840]   going to help them continue to become very, very rich.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:18.440]   That if all the people who are making money in China
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:22.760]   suddenly realize that, hey, look, we have this flag waving
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:26.520]   to the president that is more interested in the stature
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.680]   of China and his own political power
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.760]   than in all these factories that are making us
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:33.560]   cajillionaires, continuing to make us cajillionaires.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:36.680]   Once he loses the support of the people who are essentially
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.280]   operating the economy in that country,
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:41.200]   that will make that person very, very vulnerable.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:43.840]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:45.400]   More to come.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:49.680]   Jason did a little investigation over the iMessages
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:51.320]   kerfuffle with the Secret Service.
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:53.480]   I thought your article was kind of
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.440]   response to something we talked about on the show.
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:57.560]   And you did some digging, which is good.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.920]   We'll get to that in just a little bit.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:03.080]   Jason Howell from six colors.com.
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.160]   Now, Jason Howell.
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.520]   Did I call you Jason Howell?
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.200]   Oh, crap.
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.480]   Too many Jason's.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:11.680]   How many Jason's were all born in that five year period?
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.000]   I was always Jason S in school always.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.200]   Except for that one time where there were two Jason S's
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.720]   and we had to go, there's a lot of Jason's.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.720]   We thought when we named Henry Henry,
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:25.680]   which was such an old fashioned name in 1994,
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:27.160]   that'd be safe.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.440]   And there were like eight Henry's in his class.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:32.240]   So it's a problem.
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:34.920]   We call some of them by their last name, some of them.
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:38.560]   We call Henry Hank now because of the confusion.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:40.080]   Well, yeah, that was, you remember
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:43.080]   that how big Friday the 13th was.
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:44.080]   A lot of parents--
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.880]   That's what they wanted to name their kids Jason.
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.360]   That's a good, strong, powerful--
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:48.360]   Jason.
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:49.360]   Take command of the situation.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.360]   Jason Snell from six colors.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.560]   1970s, yeah.
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:52.800]   Jason Snell.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:58.040]   Also, Jason and I co from WGBH in Boston and Jason Lindsey.
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.600]   I'm very, very proud.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:02.760]   And I will try to uphold the honor of the title of Jason.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:03.960]   I'm going to swear you in later.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:07.240]   I'm going to swear you all in later as the Jason society.
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:07.800]   I swear--
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:08.920]   My two-kin ceremonial sword.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.880]   It's COVID brain fog, not senility.
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.880]   I'm just saying that.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:14.080]   Just saying that.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:17.280]   Our show today brought to you by New Bay, tomorrow's payment
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.600]   platform designed to accelerate your business.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:23.000]   Today, if your payment provider is holding your business back
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.080]   because of funky old technology,
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.400]   New Bay's next generation payment technology,

[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.320]   Thank you, Nouve, for your support for Mac Break weekly.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.080]   So we were talking last week about the Secret Service,
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.320]   about the lost messages.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.720]   The Secret Service had a story.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:59.280]   And the question was, how credible is this story?
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.600]   And we had some speculation.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.800]   But Jason, you did the work, which is--
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.880]   that's why we love you, Jason.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:06.360]   You talked--
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:06.920]   What you want me?
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.040]   Not Jason and Lindsay.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:13.560]   Jason Alexander, at Six Colors Doc-- oh, no, wait a minute.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.760]   That's my middle name.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.280]   You got it.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.320]   You nailed it.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.280]   Is it your middle name, really?
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:17.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.440]   That's great.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.600]   I loved you in Seinfeld.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:21.200]   Jason--
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.640]   It's not his real name, by the way.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.560]   It isn't?
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:24.560]   It's a pseudonym, yeah.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.120]   Bastard.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.000]   It's a stage name.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.320]   Damn him.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:30.360]   I message in the Secret Service, you actually
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.240]   talk to somebody who--
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.080]   Yeah, Tom Bridge, who knows stuff.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.760]   Because I didn't know stuff.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.120]   But Tom Bridge knows stuff.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.480]   And so he helped me out.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.280]   Because I didn't understand the story, right?
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.120]   I didn't understand how--
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.520]   How could they screw up so badly?
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.240]   It's encrypted, they say.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.360]   And it's like, well, wait a second.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.280]   It's end to end encrypted.
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.640]   But it's not encrypted on the device.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.080]   That's why your iCloud backups have it.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:50.880]   So what is it?
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.400]   And it turns out that the story here
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.920]   is all about mobile device management or MDM.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.600]   And if we've got listeners out there who are IT managers,
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.760]   they know all about this.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:01.120]   But it's like, there are so many different things.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.120]   There's like, they're not using iCloud backup
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.360]   because it's the federal government.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.360]   And they're afraid of that.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.800]   And so then they have a particular MDM.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.480]   And the way that it's set up, if it's not being backed up
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.240]   to their backup solution, and it's not
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.240]   allowed to go to iCloud and they're not backing it up
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.840]   to a computer, guess what?
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.000]   It's not being backed up.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.800]   And then if you switch to a different thing
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.440]   and you didn't use the old backup,
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.960]   you will restore the phone and you'll lose the messages.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.520]   And what Tom said was, bottom line
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.720]   is there is a way to work around this.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:35.160]   But you have to have a handset next to your handset.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.440]   So you basically back it up and restore it.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.800]   And it's this huge process.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.840]   It's much easier to get people to just sort of wipe
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.280]   and reinstall.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:47.480]   And so Tom basically said, this is a plausible story,
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.080]   but it doesn't answer the question, right?
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:52.680]   He said, it's 100% possible that this was malicious
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:55.440]   and 100% possible that this was accidental.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.280]   And we don't know.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.880]   It really doesn't tell us anything about it
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:02.560]   because you could know that you wanted to wipe those messages
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.840]   and know that you were going to do an MDM migration
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.920]   and know that it's January 7th and say, let's do it right now.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.200]   Or you could not know and it wouldn't matter.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.600]   The issue comes down to something called FedRAMP,
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.640]   which I was not familiar with that acronym.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:22.040]   But the issue is government secrecy
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.480]   and document retention requirements
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.640]   mean you can't just backup iCloud.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.360]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:32.360]   And iCloud is not approved for FedRAMP apparently.
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.520]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:34.520]   Although it is a HIPAA.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:37.880]   I was surprised that it's HIPAA compliant.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:40.480]   So you could use it for HIPAA.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.080]   He works at JumpCloud, but he said,
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.800]   when he worked for a healthcare startup,
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.800]   they weren't sure if they could use iCloud
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.760]   to backup their health data because of HIPAA,
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:55.480]   but they later found out that they could.
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:59.720]   However, FedRAMP not supported, I guess.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.920]   No, I mean, it's that old saying about
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.880]   never assume the level in when it could just be in confidence.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.040]   And it's like if it's the federal government,
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.400]   like that goes double.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.040]   Like again, like what Tom said,
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.840]   look, is it possible that somebody said,
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.560]   we need to lose those messages?
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:15.800]   This is the way to do it.
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:16.680]   Sure.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.640]   But it's just as likely, if not more so,
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:22.160]   that they just did a migration and lost all their messages
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.160]   because, which is against law, by the way.
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:28.240]   It's actually not, they need to retain those messages legally.
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:31.000]   And so by making that decision to do something
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.440]   that's technically expedient,
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.520]   regardless of whether it was a conspiracy or anything,
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:38.480]   just the act of it is actually violating the Records Act.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.440]   So they should have made a better decision than that,
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.200]   but it doesn't necessarily mean that they're covering any.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.440]   Well, and as you pointed out last week,
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.800]   all this is new.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.680]   This is a relatively new problem.
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:52.680]   And so it's completely conceivable that they didn't really,
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.200]   they hadn't really considered this or thought about it.
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.360]   But now that we know it's more than just the secret service
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.200]   that is destroyed again.
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.040]   They probably won't do it again.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:01.880]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:02.720]   They won't do it.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.560]   You can only get away with that once.
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:04.560]   You can only get away with that once.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.840]   That's a mulligan.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.920]   You know, like it's like a,
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:09.880]   you know, we can only use that excuse one time.
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.040]   And I think that,
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.080]   there's so many things I've worked, you know,
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.000]   adjacent to the government for a long time.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.720]   And there are so many things in the government that you're like,
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.680]   wow, that's way more advanced than I expected.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.880]   And so many things that you go,
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.280]   yeah, that's really not what you're saying.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.920]   You're using commonwealth 128s.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.520]   Yeah, I know.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.240]   So it goes both ways.
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.480]   And I think that when you see one of those things,
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.280]   it's far more likely that there's no,
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:35.520]   there's far more likely there was no conspiracy.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.400]   It was just a mistake.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.400]   You know, it just, then, then,
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.840]   I'm not saying it, maybe it was, but,
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.800]   and they got away with it once,
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.120]   but they won't get away with it twice.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:47.280]   FedRAMP is federal risk and authorization management program.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.040]   Right.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:48.720]   So there.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.480]   And it has to be FedRAMP compliant.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.480]   I think it's probably safe to say that iCloud is not,
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.000]   as are most clouds, not FedRAMP.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.680]   Well, I wouldn't, if I were the federal government,
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.040]   I don't think I would want a system of backup
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:06.760]   that included unencrypted text messages, right?
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.800]   That we're on Apple servers, unencrypted.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:10.880]   That's not great.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.920]   Especially for the secret service, like that's not.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.240]   It's not gonna be okay.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.760]   Speaking of the cloud, get ready.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.440]   You might be getting a check.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.560]   We don't know how big it'll be.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.560]   iCloud.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.600]   Two dollars and thirteen cents.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.280]   It was an iCloud class action lawsuit.
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.600]   It's been settled out of court.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:31.200]   The class said Apple breached service terms and conditions
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.560]   by storing user data on non-Apple servers.
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:36.160]   I mean, we've reported many times Apple used AWS
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.040]   and Microsoft Azure.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.160]   But apparently that was a breach of contract.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.360]   Apple has settled out of court.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.480]   The settlement includes anyone who paid for a subscription
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.880]   to iCloud anytime from September 16th, 2015
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.760]   to January 31st, 2016.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:54.720]   I'm gonna check.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:57.560]   The total amount for the class is 14.8 million, but of course.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:00.760]   And you get a mocha and you get a mocha and you get a mocha.
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:04.680]   Well, did you see that Tim Hortons is settling its privacy lawsuit
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.920]   because the app was following people around and revealing
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:10.400]   their free beverage and baked goods?
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.640]   There you go.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:15.000]   So there's probably more.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.480]   I bet you that's higher than the cash value would have been
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.160]   for every person.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.080]   So the lawyers take their cut.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:25.320]   The balance is distributed between everybody in this class,
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.000]   which is probably millions of people, right?
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   I make fun of this.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.440]   To be fair, the reason that these lawsuits happen
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.240]   is to keep companies in life.
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.080]   Yes.
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:33.920]   That it hurts.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:34.760]   And that they should do it.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.480]   And the lawyers are going to walk away with 40% of that amount.
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.280]   That's typically what they might get cut down to 25,
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:44.880]   but somewhere between 25 and 40% is gonna go to the firm.
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:49.040]   And then-- but the point is, is that it's a slap on the wrist.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.040]   It's not really to do anything for anybody else.
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.880]   It's just to make sure that we don't-- the reason we want
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:09:00.160]   that to happen in our legal system is that the tort--
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:08.400]   torts, that law probably affects us as consumers far more
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.880]   than federal law.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:14.760]   The risk of being sued has a much
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.960]   bigger impact on companies' behavior
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.560]   than the risk of a federal law.
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:22.840]   And sometimes it's a really important federal agency.
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:26.600]   The SEC can't arrest you, but the SEC can file civil lawsuits.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.320]   So that's coming up.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:29.920]   We'll talk about that tomorrow with crypto,
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.480]   because there's really a question now
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:33.760]   if cryptocurrencies are securities
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.360]   and if they are, big-time problems with the SEC.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.840]   So this really is also commensurate
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.880]   with the amount of actual damage that people suffered
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.240]   based on this.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.280]   This basically comes down to Apple said,
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.120]   they were going to do this.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.040]   They didn't do that.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.640]   What is that breach of trust worth?
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.880]   And so if it's worth a latte and a baked good,
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.800]   that's OK in this instance.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.920]   It is a public disgrace.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.640]   It also makes it harder for Apple on the second, third,
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.480]   fourth, fifth, sixth violation of this
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.040]   in the coming five years to say that, oh, yes, we
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:05.840]   do take this problem very, very seriously.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.160]   The fact that we keep selling these lawsuits basically
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.040]   every nine to 11 months doesn't mean we don't take it seriously.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.800]   And we're just using this as a checkbook way
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.840]   of getting out of our promises.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.400]   And that's when the government does step in and say, yeah,
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.840]   we're going to have to make you feel some pain here.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.680]   If you're one of those people, which I think we all are,
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:24.920]   you don't have to do anything.
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.840]   You receive a check to the address
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.000]   that you were registered with iCloud with at the time.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.240]   If you want to know more or change the payment method
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.120]   or opt out, you can opt out.
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:38.640]   StorageClassActionSettlement.com.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.800]   I'm not taking your blood money.
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.160]   I want a personal apology.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.440]   Yes, a personal apology, Tim.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.000]   I thought we were friends.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:45.480]   Too late.
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.600]   You can't submit a claim.
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.600]   It's over.
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.160]   It's done.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.080]   So you can't change your payment method.
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:51.240]   I apologize.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:55.920]   You're in the class, and you will get a check sometime
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.800]   in the next few months.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:58.640]   You wonder why you didn't get
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.040]   an advantage of my Oscars party.
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.120]   Well, there you go.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:07.080]   Says, please do not telephone the court
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:08.880]   to inquire about this settlement.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.360]   OK, thank you.
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.240]   Don't call them.
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.280]   Don't call us.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:15.400]   We'll send you a latte and a baked good.
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:16.680]   It's on its way.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:21.160]   That would be funny if you got that in the box.
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:25.280]   It has to be-- Tim's on the campus kitchen just baking,
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.320]   baking, baking, another pack of cookies, another pack of cookies.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.240]   By the way, Apple admitted no wrongdoing.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:34.440]   They just said, well, here's some money.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:39.520]   Getting ready for-- very little talk about AR and AR glasses.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.720]   I mean, that's still the rumor.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.040]   Not this year, I would guess.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.520]   But next year, perhaps.
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:49.880]   From the ELEC, which is a good source for supply chain stuff,
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.400]   Samsung display and LG display, both developing something
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:12:00.040]   called OLED on Silicon or OLED OS and LED on Silicon, let OS.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:06.200]   And the thinking is that Apple is going to do a deal
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:11.840]   or has done a deal with LG display for OLED OS--
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.000]   I don't know how you pronounce that-- and LED OS as well.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.040]   The pixels per inch are kind of insane.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.920]   6,000 to 7,000 pixels per inch.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.320]   Holy cow.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.800]   That would only be useful if you're
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.760]   putting it right in front of your eyes.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.800]   Now, I will say, I saw the 10,000 nits,
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.080]   and I'm like, I hope they don't actually
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.400]   plan to give people 10,000 nits in right in front of their eyes
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.560]   because that would--
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.560]   Ow.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.040]   With a specular highlight.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:38.240]   With a 2,000 nits-- with a 2,000 nits monitor,
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:41.080]   we get warnings that say, don't do this for 2,000.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:42.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.480]   So the 10,000 nits goes with the Samsung OLED
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.680]   OS, which is only 3,000 pixels per inch.
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.280]   So the thinking is, those will be on the front--
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:52.040]   remember, there's extra screens for some reason.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:55.240]   Maybe on the front facing screens, those will be the Samsungs.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.120]   And the inward facing is the one you're looking at.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.640]   It will be the higher res.
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.240]   But one hopes, lower nits will look--
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.400]   But still, it will take--
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.920]   It will take-- it'll basically take an M1
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:04.800]   to run that screen.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.000]   I mean, that's a lot of pixels.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.200]   It's a lot of pixels.
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.880]   There's a lot of stuff to sift through with this stuff here
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:14.360]   because it's doing stuff like what Oculus/Metta is doing.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:17.760]   That's kind of easy because they're selling a headset
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.840]   that is going to be operated indoors recreationally
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:22.280]   for a few hours at a time.
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.520]   If they're trying to make something that
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:26.760]   could be operated anywhere, like outside during a day like this,
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.680]   where it's super sunny.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.280]   And if they're trying to make something that where people
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.960]   might even conceivably say, look, I'm
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.120]   going to be on the show floor.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.200]   I'm going to be out doing this for the next six or seven hours.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.200]   Or I'm going to be on the assembly line.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.280]   I'm going to be actually on the factory floor for all day
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.040]   long.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:44.440]   You need something that can be as close to human sight
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.000]   as possible.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.280]   And that is where you get the rumors of a $3,000 introductory
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.120]   headset because you can't cheap out on any of that stuff.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.040]   Kim Kardashian--
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:57.920]   Go ahead, sorry.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:58.600]   Just quickly.
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.800]   Isn't it something like 370 frames per second
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:04.760]   or something that experimentally researchers
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.000]   say that if you want to approximate human vision
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.840]   and you want something to look like it's real,
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:10.280]   if you want to screen to look like you're
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.560]   looking out a window, the brain starts
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.160]   to get tricked in the high 300s of frames per second.
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.960]   And underneath that, it can detect that there's something
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:16.960]   else.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:17.760]   That's really high.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:18.880]   I don't think anything.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.960]   No high frame rate movies are shut up.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:22.280]   So that's--
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:22.760]   Not yet.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:23.760]   I mean, that's--
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:26.040]   Can video do that?
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.480]   Well, I mean, yeah.
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:31.760]   I mean, most of us are like 92 to 96 frames a second.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.480]   It becomes a real thing.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.400]   We just think of it as a window.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.360]   The 120 frames per second is something
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:38.800]   that's really popular in games.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.080]   And there's a lot of testing in sports.
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:44.120]   So literally at the Olympics, there
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.560]   was a huge press to go to 8K, 120 frames per second
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.240]   for the Olympics in Japan.
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:52.240]   That didn't happen or it didn't happen very widely.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.360]   But the test still happened.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.640]   And so a lot of people are looking at it.
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.640]   It's not great for film.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:00.840]   It actually makes you disorient it, helicopter shots.
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:04.000]   Because your brain is no longer processing it as video.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.760]   It's a disorienting experience to be at over 95 frames a second
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:09.960]   or so.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.320]   And it makes you sick, seasick.
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.200]   And when you're in your ear and your eyes
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.640]   disagree that you think you've been poisoned,
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.240]   and that's what happens after that.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:21.560]   So anyway, so the high frame rate, though, is coming.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.160]   I mean, everybody, all these cameras
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.280]   are getting set up for 120.
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.080]   All the TVs are already 120.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.280]   The Apple TV is capable of 120.
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.960]   120 is on its way.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:33.000]   It's just a matter of where does it fit in for film?
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:33.640]   Probably not.
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.200]   Probably stay at 24.
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:39.280]   For lots of other things, concerts, live experiences,
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:43.280]   reality TV, if they can stop using handheld.
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.600]   Like, those are all things that are in games.
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:46.120]   That's interesting.
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:48.080]   The games are really big 120.
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.280]   You don't want to be--
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.920]   Handheld at high frame rate.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:52.360]   Ooh, that's bad.
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.040]   No, you don't.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.040]   You do not want to do that.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.760]   I've done it, and it's not fun.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:56.960]   What happens is you just say--
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:57.520]   You get sick.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:57.920]   I'm getting sick.
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.520]   You get sick, because at a high frame rate--
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:02.200]   now, it depends on whether as long as you can see
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:06.000]   the edges of the screen, your mind will be OK with it.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000]   But if you get it into a full frame,
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.280]   so if you're on a really big screen--
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:09.960]   Or in AR.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.400]   Or you're close enough to it.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:15.080]   Or in AR, big camera moves.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:17.720]   Handheld steady-- steady cam will make you marginally.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:19.480]   Makes me sick just thinking about it.
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.680]   We were doing VR with the steady cam.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:24.440]   And my brother was a steady cam operator.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:25.040]   And he has a tendency.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.800]   He gets to the end of it, and he just turns 90 degrees.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:30.800]   And we left that in so that you could always tell when someone
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:33.320]   got to the end of the test, because they pull their headset
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.080]   off really fast.
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.200]   It was like it just turned their whole body.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.440]   And it was a funny--
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.360]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.120]   Probably not a good joke.
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.200]   But it was a good joke for us.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.640]   So anyway, so the--
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.440]   So anyway, it was--
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.160]   Oh, those lazy boys, I tell you.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:52.080]   So anyway, the 120-- the high frame rate
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.280]   is going to make a huge difference for AR and VR.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:58.320]   And again, I don't think that we're going to see it in film.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:01.480]   I think that you're going to see it in games and the experiences
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:02.240]   and so on and so forth.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.960]   I think over time, when you watch a lot of high frame rate,
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.920]   film does look very-- what we call frame-y.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.920]   It's just like a lot of not-very many frames there.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:12.040]   And you notice it more because you're seeing it all the time
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.160]   and something else.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.640]   But I don't think-- I think that film--
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:16.160]   it's important for film to stay at 24,
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:19.920]   because it keeps on telling your brain that it's not real.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.120]   Yeah, it's an interesting--
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.040]   It's interesting, yes.
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.280]   Interesting tidbit in that documentary you recommended,
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:25.280]   which is so good.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:28.760]   An Ever-A-Shit Watch on Disney Plus Light and Magic,
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.200]   about Industrial Light and Magic.
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.520]   They're talking about digital cameras.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.400]   I mean, this is-- it started with film, right?
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:34.160]   They're doing Star Wars.
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:34.960]   I have that camera.
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.480]   And yes, the Sony-- what is it?
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:38.000]   EX?
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:38.560]   That's 900.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.360]   Well, it was a 700 when they showed up at Lucasfilm,
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:42.520]   but it became the 950--
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:43.520]   But at one point--
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:43.960]   The 950 is the one.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:46.240]   George is saying, well, can it shoot 24 frames?
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:46.880]   Like-- yeah.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:49.120]   They're saying, it was too many frames.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.840]   We went-- because they got a match, right?
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:51.520]   They got a match to film.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.600]   Well, it was because that's all film--
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:54.600]   They're used to.
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:55.040]   Back then--
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.440]   And especially, it was like, well,
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:57.840]   we're going to do film at 24.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:01.280]   And so the camera that they brought, I believe,
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.360]   was like 59.99.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.120]   59.94.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:04.640]   I.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.840]   Like, it was I.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.000]   It was like Interlecran.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:07.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.760]   It was a TV camera.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.960]   And Sony had to do this really funky thing called PSF
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.520]   to figure out how to get from--
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:16.840]   they didn't really change the camera.
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:19.000]   They just changed the way it output.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.160]   They created a specific mode to take the fields
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.560]   and put them back together into progressive.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.480]   And then you'd output it.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.080]   So my 950 still does that.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:28.760]   But anyway--
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:29.760]   Interesting.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.800]   But it's a very unique thing.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:35.520]   And then over time, of course, we went to progressive.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.880]   But there was nothing that was digital that was 24
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.840]   until they asked Sony to do that.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:44.080]   And then Panasonic came out with a consumer, quote unquote,
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:48.360]   consumer version of that with the DVX 100A, I think.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.360]   And then that was the first time we saw 24
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:52.320]   in something you could buy for less than 5 grand.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.760]   And then red and all those things.
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.960]   I loved it.
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.880]   So they're getting ready to do Star Wars.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:02.400]   And they want to do these motion cameras where they want--
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.680]   they have models, but instead of having the models move,
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:06.360]   they want the cameras to move.
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.000]   And one of the reasons they could do this
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.360]   is because there was a lot of old VISTA vision gear
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.880]   that they practically gave them because nobody
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.160]   shoot an VISTA vision anymore.
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.000]   So they were able to use VISTA vision lenses.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.800]   And then they hacked these cameras.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.400]   Wait.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:22.400]   So they went upside down.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:23.560]   So there's nothing on top.
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.560]   So they could get very close to the models.
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.920]   Just by the way, we talked a lot about this pre-show.
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.200]   And so if you're in the Club, Club
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.720]   Twit, watch for that on the Twit Plus feed.
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:38.120]   But last week, Alex recommended this Disney Plus
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.400]   documentary about industrial light and magic, which
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.760]   where Alex worked.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.440]   And I just was blown away.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.560]   It was so good.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.800]   And what was really fascinating to me
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:51.640]   was this transition from "Star Wars" episode--
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:54.600]   what is it-- episode four, "The First Star Wars,"
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:20:00.080]   where they're doing everything with models and stop motion,
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.520]   with what they call practicals, physical stuff.
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:06.360]   And then this transition by 1992 in Jurassic Park,
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:09.600]   and then of course, episode one and so forth, to digital.
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.640]   And it was like a cliff.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.280]   It went boom.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.560]   And to show you, I don't think that they talk about this
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:15.060]   in the film.
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:17.400]   If you want to see the very first digital scene,
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:23.980]   it's in episode one when Qui-Gon is sitting outside
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:24.940]   doing the Mandalorian--
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:27.200]   or doing the "Mediclorian Count" thing, where he takes
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.640]   him from Anakin or whatever.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:30.580]   That was actually shot on the Sony.
[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:34.740]   That was the only shot in that movie that was shot digitally.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.340]   Episode two was all digital, right?
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:37.320]   But episode one--
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:38.020]   That was the test.
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:38.520]   --that was the test.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:39.020]   It's like flip.
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:40.180]   And it looks horrible.
[01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:41.820]   Yeah, you can catch it.
[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:43.220]   There was no data, because it was 8-bit.
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:44.860]   It was under-- it was at night.
[01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:46.760]   It was-- so if you look at it, it's very--
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.020]   like the Blackstar all crushed.
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:52.260]   And it didn't really turn out.
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:54.300]   But that was the very first digital.
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:56.060]   After watching the documentary, I'm going back
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:58.440]   and re-watching all this stuff, including Jurassic Park,
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.600]   which was the first--
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.500]   those dinosaurs, they had planned that.
[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.900]   Stan Winston building a giant T-Rex.
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:07.940]   They had Phil Tippett, who was the amazing stop motion guy,
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:12.180]   doing little stop motion tests of the Velociraptors running.
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:14.280]   And then all of a sudden-- and you
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.800]   talked about this before the show--
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.640]   Two animators--
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.140]   Spaz.
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:18.720]   Spaz.
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:21.320]   --and Dupe from ILM.
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:22.080]   Mark Dupe.
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:25.880]   Mark Dupe had been working at night after hours
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.920]   to put it on the computer.
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:31.520]   And they show Steven Spielberg and Kathleen Kennedy
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:32.120]   and George Lucas.
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:35.160]   They say, well, let's show you what we've done.
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.920]   And at that point, everybody's jaws drop.
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:39.840]   And they say, this movie can be made digitally.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.160]   And it was.
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:41.840]   That's the trend.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:44.840]   1992, boom, just a clip.
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:45.840]   Can you still feel bad for Phil?
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:46.760]   Look at these--
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:47.260]   I know.
[01:21:47.260 --> 01:21:48.160]   --and all that work into it.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.760]   Well, he's almost a little crushed.
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:50.760]   Like, you think the show is like--
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:51.760]   So the interview him, Lawrence Kasdan,
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.400]   who does this interviews him.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:58.120]   And it is a moment where, like, I guess I'm out of work.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:00.360]   I've been doing this.
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:03.400]   The best at it, I've won an Academy Awards for it.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.560]   And nobody's going to use stop motion ever again.
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.240]   But there is a happy ending.
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.040]   And I won't tell you.
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:11.640]   You have to watch the wonderful documentary.
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:14.040]   "Light and Magic," about the beginnings
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.520]   of industrial light and magic.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:17.840]   Just incredible.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:20.400]   By the way, I'm going to plug something I worked on.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:21.480]   Please do.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:22.000]   Quick.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.320]   There is a 50th anniversary--
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.040]   50th anniversary for "Empire."
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:31.200]   If you really like the "Seater" series,
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.640]   hidden on YouTube, I think on the island site,
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:36.720]   is a 50th anniversary discussion between Dennis Muren
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:39.240]   and Phil Tippett and Joe Jackson.
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:42.560]   Like all those guys are all talking about just "Empire"
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:45.040]   of what it took to do "Empire."
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:48.200]   And I would highly recommend just doing a search on YouTube.
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:48.960]   It's up there.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:49.560]   Tidden up there.
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:50.080]   I don't think it's--
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:50.640]   I think this is it.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.920]   "Islam" presents "Empire" at 40.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:53.680]   Is it 50?
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:54.160]   At 50.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:54.720]   Are you sure?
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.520]   Because this looks like "Stream Live May 20th--
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:58.600]   20th, 20th."
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:22:59.120]   Oh, no.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:22:59.620]   Yep.
[01:22:59.620 --> 01:22:59.800]   That's it.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.040]   Dennis Muren, Joe Johnston, Phil Tippett.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:02.640]   40th.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:03.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:08.560]   It's a really fun discussion.
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.680]   This is an amazing shot.
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.760]   This is "Stop Motion," believe it or not.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:15.840]   There's Phil Tippett animating the tantan running
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.920]   across the snow planet of Hoth.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.000]   That's how good "Stop Motion."
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.880]   This is the peak of "Stop Motion."
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:25.080]   But if you watch the "Light and Magic"
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.120]   and you just can't get enough, this
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:31.040]   is not the same budget as the "Caz"
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:31.720]   than another great one.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:33.360]   It's still a great discussion.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.360]   Just those guys are just brilliant.
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:38.200]   It gave me such an appreciation for the artistry
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:44.520]   and the talent and also just the devotion to the project.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.280]   And yet it sounds like it's the most fun they ever had
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:48.000]   in their lives.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:48.880]   They all look back on it.
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:49.920]   It was great nostalgia.
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.000]   Those were--
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.360]   I think those were the days.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.160]   I think almost everybody looks back on "Star Wars"
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.360]   as a result.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.920]   I mean, because most of us--
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.840]   when we had the re-releases--
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.920]   when the re-releases came out in 1999,
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:04.920]   they let all the ILM folks go to Smith Ranch Road
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:07.840]   and Roland Plaza and stuff like that.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:10.160]   We went to see it that morning, right?
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:11.320]   The morning that they released it,
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.600]   or maybe the morning, Saturday before.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.960]   The Saturday, you get to go.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.480]   We used to go to a lot of movies that way.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:19.840]   And anyway, when we saw "Star Wars,"
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:23.880]   when the thing came up, when the credits ended,
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.080]   you could hear everybody sniffling.
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:30.160]   Because we were all there working on "Star Wars"
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.280]   because we saw "Star Wars."
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:36.080]   We were like, oh, it came to me and I felt myself sniffling
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.240]   and then I looked around at everybody.
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.440]   Everybody is.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:39.440]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:39.940]   I know.
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:41.080]   We're here.
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:44.280]   One of the most beautiful things that ever occurred to me
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:47.520]   and related to "Star Wars" was the idea of--
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:50.400]   just as you say, all these people who are working at ILM,
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:53.240]   who went into this field of special effects
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.840]   and all kinds of other nerdy things because of "Star Wars,"
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.080]   and then suddenly, like, they're doing whatever they're doing,
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.800]   and someone pokes their head in, hey,
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:02.320]   do you want to be an episode for the special edition?
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:05.480]   We need people to fill out a background scene in Tatooine.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:09.680]   And suddenly, you are in a new hope,
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:11.720]   which is not something that you considered even possible
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:12.560]   of any sort of thing.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:15.680]   That is such a beautiful thought to me.
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:17.320]   Of course, I'm talking to Rump's leg.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:18.960]   So that's what happened now.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.000]   That has to be a couple of times.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.800]   And definitely, when someone walks in and says, hey,
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:26.640]   can you get up and do something you get up
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.640]   and whatever you're working on.
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.640]   Anything you want.
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:30.440]   But it was--
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:32.480]   But I think that in addition to it--
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:34.800]   and I think you see this when you watch that documentary
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:37.120]   is that for most of us, we were maybe not
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.120]   the smartest person in the room.
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:40.160]   But we were doing pretty well most of our lives.
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:42.480]   And then you get to ILM, and you're just average.
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:45.880]   Unless you're just trying to keep up with everybody.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.640]   Because everybody is just the most brilliant collection
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:52.120]   of people that I'd ever worked with.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:57.360]   That just-- it was just an amazing, amazing group.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.440]   I hope that some of this comes up in your AMA.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.440]   Alex is going to be doing it, asking me anything for our club.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:03.520]   I'm looking forward to it.
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:07.920]   Nine days from today, Thursday, August 18, 9 AM,
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.000]   and ask me anything.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.040]   If you're there live, you can ask the questions.
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.440]   If you're not, and you're our club member, of course,
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:15.280]   that'll appear on the Twit Plus feed.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:17.120]   I should put in a plug.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.360]   Thanks to Ant Pruitt, the club is just getting more and more
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:19.560]   fun.
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:22.520]   He's our community manager that's among other jobs.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:25.040]   But originally, the idea was we wanted
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:27.840]   to give Twit listeners an option to get
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:31.320]   ad-free versions of the shows without tracking.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.080]   And so we did that for $7 a month.
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:37.680]   And we thought, well, we'll throw in a Discord.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:38.840]   Because that's fun.
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:42.160]   And the Discord's turned out to be, for me, the best benefit.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.520]   I just love it.
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.560]   Great place to hang and talk about all kinds of things.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:46.840]   We have events in there.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:49.320]   And then there's that Twit Plus feed I mentioned, which
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:52.120]   is a chance-- so we had a great conversation before the show,
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:55.280]   a half hour conversation about all of this, which
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:58.280]   would have in previous years just been lost.
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.880]   You wouldn't be preserved.
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.800]   Now it's part of the club feed.
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:06.880]   So $7 a month, I think it gets you a lot of great benefits.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:11.720]   And it really helps us as we head into difficult economic times.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.480]   We started it in the middle of COVID
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.840]   because we were trying to get through that.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:19.400]   It helped us get through that without any additional layoffs.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.600]   And now, I think hard times ahead is again.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:26.320]   So if you can scrape together as 700 pennies a month,
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:27.760]   we each are appreciated.
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:32.920]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:35.440]   Matthew McCon says, it's not going to start at 7 a.m.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:36.240]   Like, office hours?
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:39.240]   No, we're going to let you sleep in.
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:42.040]   Literally, I will be coming right out of office hours.
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.960]   That's why I'm two hours of office hours.
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:47.480]   And then I'll just punch right into that.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:50.380]   Yeah.
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:54.080]   So from the sublime to the ridiculous, I started this story.
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:56.880]   You might have heard me about 10 minutes ago, say, Kim Kardashian.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:59.680]   I'm wondering why.
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:02.920]   Well, Kim Kardashian's pairing with beats
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:08.200]   to make some more muted colors for your beats headphones.
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:10.240]   I don't want to call these flesh tones,
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.640]   but I think they kind of are.
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:16.760]   Beats X Kim, the collection, Zoom Brown.
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:17.480]   No, no, no.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:18.880]   This is not to look like a Zoom.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:23.240]   This is, I think, to kind of be a more neutral palette
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:25.840]   to blend in in your ear.
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.480]   Variation of skin tones, which is a very, very nice idea.
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:31.800]   Although, nobody's that white.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:32.520]   Maybe they are.
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:33.040]   I don't know.
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:35.040]   Well, speak yourself.
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:39.840]   On top of everything else, I'm wearing headphones,
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.320]   so my ears aren't getting any tan.
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:41.800]   Any either.
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:44.960]   So actually, you know, now that I look at you, yeah, maybe those
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:45.760]   would be the right ones.
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.200]   There you go.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:47.040]   That's your shade.
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.120]   Yo, man.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:49.560]   Put the picture next to this.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:53.280]   And yeah, I think that we're Eastern European white, we call that.
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:57.240]   Again, I'm optimized for winter warfare in Eastern Europe
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:59.240]   or Western Russia.
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:00.480]   This is a commodity.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:03.840]   The new Beats Fit Pro headphones will come in three
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:06.560]   earthy, muted tones, moon.
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:07.640]   That's you, Andy.
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:10.960]   Dune and Earth.
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:11.640]   And the--
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:11.840]   You're right.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:12.840]   It should have been zoomed.
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:13.080]   Don't wait.
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:13.400]   We're going to ride.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.920]   Moon, moon, moon, zoom, and zoom.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.440]   Why didn't they do it zoom?
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:18.480]   You're a marketing genius.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.400]   Because it is Zoom Brown.
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.320]   I hate to say it.
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:25.240]   The Kim Kardashian will be featured in the ads.
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:28.520]   So more money for the Kardashian clan.
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.840]   That's all I can say.
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:33.880]   I mean, did we really need someone?
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:35.160]   I understand the marketing power.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:37.200]   I understand the incredible power of the brand.
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.720]   I'm not criticizing that.
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:41.080]   I'm just saying that you could have come up
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:42.160]   with those colors on your own.
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.560]   You could have come up with--
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:45.240]   especially the idea of, hey, people,
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:48.120]   if people want to be able to wear earbuds that don't scream out,
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:48.720]   hey, look at me.
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:49.680]   I'm wearing earbuds.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.640]   Why don't we create them just like Band-Aids
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:55.200]   and a degree of flesh tones to approximate
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:57.280]   like a different wider range?
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:00.600]   You didn't need someone with a Kardashian in order
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:02.200]   to make that happen, I think.
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.560]   And of course, our esteemed chatroom
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:07.600]   has come up with alternative marketing names
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.280]   for those colors.
[01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:13.400]   Booger Brown, BabyPukeBrown, BabyCouldn'tHelpItBrown.
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.160]   So I don't think of those.
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.640]   They're going to--
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:17.600]   I don't think so.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:18.560]   Thank you, chatroom.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:23.520]   But speaking of brands, Asai Miyaki--
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:27.920]   Asai Miyaki, boy, let me get that right.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.840]   You know the name, fashion designer
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:33.120]   passed away at the age of 84 this week.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:37.080]   Born in Hiroshima in 1938, he lived to the age of 84.
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.400]   Why is this an Apple story?
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:48.240]   Because Steve Jobs asked him to design black turtlenecks
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:50.600]   in the early '80s.
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.840]   Miyaki gave Steve 100 turtlenecks.
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:54.760]   He adopted and used in his public life
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.240]   as the head of Apple.
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:58.680]   The garment became iconic.
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:01.120]   Not only is signature look for Steve Jobs,
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:04.720]   but Elizabeth Holmes took to wearing black turtlenecks.
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:08.200]   But it's the Miyaki's, the Isai Miyaki's
[01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:11.120]   that are the most famous.
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:12.680]   And I hope--
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:14.720]   I don't-- do you think Steve only had 100
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.280]   and like that was the total?
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:17.760]   Or he probably got more later.
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:18.260]   I don't know.
[01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:19.680]   You think that he could shift him on a roll?
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:21.520]   He would just tear off a new one every day?
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.280]   That's a great idea.
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:23.800]   I want to roll.
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.080]   Yeah, there was a little X.
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:25.840]   It's a different story.
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:28.360]   Yeah, I mean, the rumor that I had always heard
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:30.000]   was that he had to turn a factory back on.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.840]   He ended up with thousands of them.
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.000]   To get the ones he wanted.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.640]   But maybe--
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:35.480]   This is from Apple.
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:36.400]   It's a little cider part of the--
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:36.760]   That could be lower.
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.240]   Part of the--
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:37.600]   Could be lower.
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:38.320]   But could be lower.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.720]   I'd heard that he really liked it.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:42.360]   And then he couldn't-- they'd already finished making them.
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:44.640]   And he said, well, what does it cost to turn the factory back on?
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:45.440]   That sounds more accurate.
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:46.920]   1,000 or 10,000 or something.
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:48.440]   And he just ordered them all and never
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.560]   would have the same one twice.
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:50.960]   Well, you find something you love.
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:53.600]   And you only bought one or two of them.
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:54.920]   And then they don't make them anymore.
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:55.920]   And there's nothing you can do.
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:55.920]   You can do it.
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:56.400]   Oh my gosh.
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:57.640]   You're a billionaire.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.480]   What you do is you just--
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.120]   I found-- OK, I'll just say this.
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:04.120]   I found this plastic glass that I really like, plastic cup,
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.120]   that I got at a football game.
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.520]   And I love it because it doesn't shatter.
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:07.200]   And it doesn't bend.
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:08.240]   And it's really nice.
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:09.480]   And I found the company that makes it.
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.160]   And I said, I want to buy some of these.
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:13.200]   And they said, minimum order 500.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:14.560]   And I was like, hmm.
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.400]   Yeah, I'm not going to buy 500 cups.
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:19.560]   But if I had Steve Jobs money, I'd buy 500.
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:20.040]   Sure.
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:20.840]   I know people who buy 500.
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:21.880]   Open the back up.
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:23.560]   A lot of something to get it.
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:24.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:25.060]   Yeah.
[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:25.560]   I mean, right?
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:26.320]   If you really want it.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:29.400]   And if you've got-- if the money doesn't matter,
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.000]   I love that, whatever it is.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.840]   Also, keep in mind, the whole idea here
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:35.480]   is that Steve Jobs didn't want to waste any brain power
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:37.200]   on deciding what he was going to wear that day.
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:40.040]   So he just got a rack of the same thing.
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.800]   And he wore the same thing every day.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:43.360]   Also, I'm sorry.
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:44.920]   I'm interrupting.
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.880]   Also, one of the things that came out of the Visux
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:49.640]   and the biography was where that connection came from,
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:52.360]   where Steve Jobs toured the Sony factory.
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:55.280]   And Sony's employees were wearing uniforms
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.840]   that had been created by Ise.
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:00.160]   And so he came back saying, oh my god, this is great.
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.440]   We should have uniforms for Apple people.
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.240]   And to his two Steve Jobs credit,
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:05.720]   he says in the interview that, oh boy,
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.520]   did I get food off the stage for that one.
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:08.520]   But that--
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:09.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:10.960]   But the connection did stick.
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:12.880]   But that is interesting that if you want to--
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:15.520]   if you want to have company uniforms for Sony,
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:17.040]   this person had to create something
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.800]   that was going to be practical, functional,
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.400]   and that people would be kind of relieved to put on every single day
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:24.520]   instead of having to solve that problem every single day.
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:25.840]   Yeah, but a uniform--
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:28.120]   no, not so good in Silicon Valley.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:30.280]   That's the-- you're one step away from people asking,
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:33.680]   demanding that you do push-ups like in unison every morning.
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:34.520]   That's-- no.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:35.280]   That's going to say--
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:36.280]   not going to happen.
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.280]   --feels like one of those old Star Trek episodes
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:39.080]   where they beam down and everybody's wearing a green jumpsuit.
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:39.600]   You know, like--
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:40.080]   I will--
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.080]   This doesn't seem right.
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.080]   It doesn't seem like a progressive one.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.240]   I'm not going to lock a campus.
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:45.800]   I wandered around a lot of campuses,
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.240]   and they don't have a uniform, but they--
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:49.360]   you know, many campuses have a look.
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.640]   There is a look, for sure.
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:51.160]   That's true.
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:52.160]   Yeah, there is a look.
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:52.920]   Yeah, so it's--
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:53.960]   They achieve it organically.
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:54.720]   That's the important thing.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:55.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.760]   Isaacson continues in the jobs biography.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:00.000]   He asked Miyake to supply him with a large number
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.560]   of black turtleneck sweaters on sale.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:07.680]   For me, say Miyake incorporated at the time for $175.
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:11.160]   He made me like 100 of them jobs told Isaacson adding,
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:15.440]   "I have enough to last for the rest of my life."
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:17.720]   There is actually a precedent for this story
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:19.080]   that maybe he restarted the factory,
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:24.200]   because the folks who made Gorilla Glass Corning
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:27.160]   had already shut down the Gorilla Glass factory.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.280]   They weren't going to make any more when Apple came to them
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:31.960]   and said, "We would like it for our new iPhone."
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:35.000]   And here's money to restart the Glass factory.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.960]   And ever since, I think they've been subsidizing Corning
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:40.720]   and Gorilla Glass because they like it for the iPhone.
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:43.320]   So it's not unbelievable.
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:44.080]   Let's put it that way.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:46.720]   So it's a long history.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:49.480]   I mean, the Boston Public Library,
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:52.000]   the architect wanted this special kind of marble
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.240]   that had stopped being quarry for 20 years.
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:55.840]   Like the quarry was closed.
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:56.640]   Everyone had moved out.
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:00.760]   He got them to reopen the quarry to get them just enough marble
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:02.160]   for this one little hallway.
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:02.720]   Wow.
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:03.440]   So yeah.
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:08.840]   Money and creative, creative, crazyness talks always.
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:13.040]   Speaking of broken iPhone screens, Otterbox now
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.760]   will pay part of the way, at least,
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:16.760]   for a broken iPhone screen.
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:23.840]   If you buy an Otterbox screen protector, amplify or alpha,
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:26.880]   you then get there's an Otterbox protection program.
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:30.120]   So you're really still buying insurance
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:32.800]   because these are not inexpensive screen protectors.
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:37.720]   But you can get reimbursement up to 12 months after purchase.
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:41.360]   I do not like to-- they're $40, $55 screen protection.
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:46.080]   I do not like to put on screen protectors on any of my stuff.
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.400]   If you put a glass screen protector on,
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.960]   does it prevent you from breaking?
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:51.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:52.240]   It does.
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:52.800]   I've broken.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:55.880]   Yeah, I have a case and a screen protector.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:58.160]   I mean, my phone is still in--
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.040]   I mean, I spent $2,000 on this phone.
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:01.400]   I'm going to put it in something.
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:03.280]   Like, I'm just like--
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:05.560]   this is a decked out, whatever, 13 Pro.
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.280]   And it costs a lot of money.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:09.320]   I'm not going to crack it.
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:12.120]   And I'm definitely-- and I have to admit, I had my last phone.
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:14.120]   I had a screen protector on it.
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:18.880]   I got some air under it, so I just took it off.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:21.000]   Scratch the heck out of it in like a week.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.440]   Like, I was-- because I used to--
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.240]   because I'm so lazy about what goes up against that screen.
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.320]   And I just suddenly was realizing it's all these scratches
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:29.800]   that I didn't have before.
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:33.680]   Because it was pristine quality for almost a year and then not.
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:36.040]   And so I absolutely put screen protectors on it.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.280]   It's not a big deal.
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:40.920]   The new application, putting them on, is nothing.
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:44.360]   It doesn't-- I don't think it affects the quality of it.
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:45.280]   And it's--
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:47.600]   You can't tell there's a screen protector on it?
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:48.880]   No, I can't.
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:50.680]   Of course, I've had screen protectors on it for so long.
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:51.880]   But I don't notice it at all.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:52.880]   It don't notice.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:53.560]   No, I don't notice.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:58.640]   The performance is exactly the same as far as I'm concerned.
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:36:59.480]   It works great.
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:02.200]   And one of my favorites is the one I put on my iPad.
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:04.800]   The one that's a paper like-- my older iPad Pro,
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:06.240]   I put the paper one on.
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:07.440]   Just love doing--
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:08.400]   That's kind of cool.
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:09.240]   Yeah, that feeling.
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:10.080]   It makes a few crushes.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.080]   That frictions.
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:12.600]   Oh, I love it.
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:15.800]   I just love using that just to do storyboards.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:16.800]   Because it's just that friction of paper.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.560]   What's the name of that again?
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:19.560]   Oh, I have to look at it.
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.360]   It was a pick.
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:22.880]   Bought it on YouTube.
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:24.000]   I mean, I bought it on YouTube.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.040]   I bought it on Amazon.
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:25.760]   I confuse them.
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:26.760]   They're very similar.
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:28.880]   But it's easy for me to find you literally.
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:29.760]   Yeah, that's what I do.
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:32.320]   I constantly go through my Amazon orders
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.680]   to find something when people say, well, what kind--
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.880]   what did you buy?
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:39.200]   I'm very curious because I think maybe I should do this
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:41.040]   for my iPad Pro.
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:42.600]   New iPad Pro's in a paper feel.
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:43.600]   Paper feel.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.160]   OK.
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:44.720]   That's what I got.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:45.440]   That's the one I used.
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:47.440]   I don't know if it's any--
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:48.760]   it's probably one Japanese paper.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:49.040]   Like--
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.160]   One Japanese Chinese one.
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:51.600]   Paper like was another one.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:52.400]   Paper like.
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:52.920]   Yeah, OK.
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:54.320]   Probably all made out of century.
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:56.640]   Probably one.
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:00.040]   It is kind of interesting how dogmatic Apple is about--
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.160]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.440]   Our phones are so durable and they're so beautiful.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:03.440]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:05.040]   But never want to put them in a case.
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:07.960]   They came out with a new Switch to iPhone--
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:10.800]   really good Switch to iPhone video a couple of weeks ago
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.280]   for people who are--
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:15.120]   switching to Android is like simple, punchy, 4 and 1/2 minutes.
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.120]   You're the top six questions that people might have
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:18.480]   and here answers to them.
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:21.360]   And when they get to the section of, hey, can I carry over all
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:22.720]   my data from an Android?
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:23.220]   Oh, yes.
[01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:23.720]   Cheers.
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:24.480]   Here's how easy it is.
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:28.320]   She's got, in one hand, she's got like a iPhone 13, no case.
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:33.000]   In the other hand, she has a Pixel 4A absolutely
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:33.880]   in a case.
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:35.920]   And I don't think that that's an accident.
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:40.120]   I mean, I have the Pixel 4A 5G, but I have the 4A.
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.920]   It's not like there's a big Google logo on the back of it.
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.720]   It's not as though there's anything on the back
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.240]   that identifies it as like--
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:48.520]   it's not like there's a big Samsung logo on the back of it.
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:50.320]   So it's like, OK, you're definitely
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:53.680]   making the case that in the case, this phone looks uglier.
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:55.840]   So we are definitely putting a phone in a case
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:59.000]   for the Android side.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.400]   This one is a little concerning.
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:03.720]   We've talked before about Unreal Engine not being
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:06.480]   available for Apple Silicon.
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:09.400]   Developers who won a game engine pretty much are using Unity.
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.040]   Unity may be in play now.
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:17.840]   Apple Oven, of all people, has offered to buy Unity for $17.5
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:21.200]   billion no cash all stock.
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:22.240]   That's a horrible deal.
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.800]   It's free energy.
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:29.640]   I mean, it's an 18% premium on their Monday closing price.
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:31.680]   But who wants to be owned by Apple Oven?
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:33.320]   And who knows what Apple Oven stock will be?
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:34.600]   The board has to approve it.
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:37.000]   This could end up being a hostile takeover.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.800]   If the board does not approve it.
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:41.600]   And here's the other bad deal.
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.520]   Unity investors would hold more than half the shares
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:45.440]   of the combined company.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:49.000]   But Apple Oven would have more than half the voting power.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:49.760]   It's a horrible deal.
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:51.960]   Like, that would be a horrible deal for the shareholders.
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:55.840]   I can see-- the problem is Unity bought some stuff that
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:59.000]   puts them in direct competition with Apple Oven.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.200]   So this is, I think, more of a defensive move by Apple Oven
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:05.600]   to try to get a hold of Unity because that Unity may crush them.
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.160]   Like, that's the problem.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:08.800]   This is their high point.
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:11.200]   I don't even know how they get the valuation to that point,
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:12.200]   to be honest with you.
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:15.040]   It's probably something with KKR that they're trying to organize.
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:20.160]   But I don't think this one doesn't pencil out at all.
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:22.160]   I think that would be a horrible idea.
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:26.840]   It might put Unity in play, which others might then come in
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.000]   and say, well, wait.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.680]   And I know it's possible.
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:31.680]   Yeah.
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:33.280]   It just makes for instability.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:34.160]   We've seen it with Twitter.
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:35.320]   It just makes for instability.
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:37.480]   It's not a good thing.
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:40.160]   And Unity is really-- is it pretty much the only way at this point
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:44.840]   to do a multi-platform game on Apple?
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:50.200]   I mean, it definitely runs better on the Mac than Unreal.
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:52.800]   I mean, even on the Intel Mac, Unreal,
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:55.480]   it's pretty clunky to run it.
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:59.680]   So you really need a PC to use Unreal, in my opinion.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:02.160]   They're better at different things.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:04.720]   So they're not-- I used to think that Unreal-- I mean,
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:08.240]   for a long time, we forgot that Unity existed.
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:11.400]   Like, it was just all Unreal Unreal Unreal Unreal Unreal.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:13.320]   And then the lawsuit happened.
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:15.840]   And all of us are just like, whoa.
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.960]   We don't now know.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:21.080]   And then Unity also bought the digital--
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:25.960]   the Weta Digital, so they have an incredible amount of content--
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:30.920]   I mean, of R&D and technology that they acquired there.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:33.400]   So there's been a bunch of moves here,
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.160]   which is really good for the consumer,
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:38.120]   that there's two companies that are doing--
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:40.040]   they're not apples to apples.
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:42.200]   They do different things well.
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:44.960]   A lot of us have felt like Unity is a little bit better
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:48.240]   on the AR stuff than Unreal is.
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:51.000]   But Unreal is really powerful, with metahuman,
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.760]   with a lot of the assets, with the marketplace.
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:56.040]   I mean, they're still, I think, the clear leader
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:00.560]   in kind of the development of that 3D future.
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:03.960]   But Unity is still very powerful,
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:06.840]   and it really is the Mac solution right now.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:10.120]   And so hopefully-- and again, someone could buy them,
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:11.960]   and then they can keep doing what they're doing.
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:15.240]   I hope it's not app-loving, because it seems like--
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:19.960]   I mean, I think that it was a bold thing to say by app-loving.
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:22.200]   But I don't think that anybody in their right mind
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:23.440]   would actually allow that.
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:27.320]   On the Unity side, stockholders, investors,
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.400]   there is nothing good about this deal.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:31.440]   And so I think that it's a bold--
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:33.800]   It's such a mismatch in thickness too.
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:35.880]   I mean, app-loving is not marketing.
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:37.320]   It's not, right?
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:37.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:40.120]   But I think they're worried because of some of the stuff
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:42.720]   that Unity bought, and they're trying to--
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:44.480]   I think it's more of a defensive move
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:46.200]   that they have to try to see if they can do that,
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:49.200]   because I think Unity might run them over at some point.
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:51.400]   So I think that that's really more of a defensive view
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:54.120]   from app-loving, but I think it's a horrible deal.
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:57.800]   Like, it would be disastrous for everyone connected
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:01.200]   to Unity for app-loving to do that on an all-stock deal.
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.400]   Like, why would you--
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:02.900]   Right.
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:04.080]   You can really believe in the company
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:04.920]   that they can all-stock deal.
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:05.800]   That's a horrible idea.
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:07.400]   Right.
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:15.000]   One more piece that I didn't mention from iOS 16 beta 5,
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.080]   which was released yesterday.
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:20.320]   There's a new Find My Sound.
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.080]   So I don't know about you.
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:22.400]   I live by Find My.
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:25.640]   I misplace my phone and my watch all the time.
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:28.920]   So let me see what the sound's going to sound like now.
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:30.200]   You got my sound up.
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:30.800]   All right, John.
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:32.280]   [DING]
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:34.360]   Oh, that's better.
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:36.880]   That's better.
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:37.760]   I gave it a 9 out of 10.
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:39.640]   I can dance to it.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:41.480]   I wanted to say, I just wanted to yell.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:42.400]   I'm over here.
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:43.160]   I just want to do.
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:43.880]   I'm over here.
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:44.760]   Right now it's just--
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:44.760]   I'm over here.
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:46.160]   It's almost a high-pitched scream.
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:46.680]   Help me.
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:47.180]   Help me.
[01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:47.680]   Right?
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:48.680]   No.
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:49.680]   Yeah.
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:52.160]   This is another one of those cases where I really wish Apple
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:55.120]   were one of those companies that puts the engineers in front
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:58.160]   of a camera and explaining how hard this was to do.
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:03.040]   Because crafting a sound that has to be attention getting,
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:04.080]   but not harsh.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:07.040]   And it has to penetrate through layers of fabric.
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:07.860]   Yes.
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:09.760]   It's a much better penetrate through it's door.
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:10.880]   Exactly.
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:14.720]   And be long enough for you to be able to locate it while it's
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:15.280]   playing, right?
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:16.760]   It's not long enough right now.
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:18.360]   I can tell you that right now.
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:19.200]   It's not long enough.
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:20.640]   That's a different way.
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:23.440]   The human brain is really good.
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:25.760]   There are high frequencies and low frequencies.
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:28.360]   Low frequencies mean that they travel much, much longer
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.400]   distances, but they're harder to locate.
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:32.720]   High frequencies travel short distances,
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:35.120]   but our ears can locate them very, very easily.
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:37.560]   So this is part of the math that has to go into this.
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:39.960]   So this is why I really want to see the paper based on this.
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:43.200]   The current sound is not quite so syncopated.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.880]   It's just a high-pitched DD2.
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.480]   Faster, faster attack on the new one.
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.240]   It's bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:49.120]   Yeah, I like that.
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:50.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:52.040]   Oh, you got it, Jason.
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:53.280]   You already have it.
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:55.000]   Look at that tiny phone.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:55.960]   Do you have massive names?
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:56.920]   No case either.
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:57.400]   No case.
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:57.920]   No case.
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:59.400]   No screen for Dr. Oak's screen.
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:01.880]   Just like, bare naked phone.
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:02.400]   That's right.
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:06.160]   And the bare naked phone playing the new theme from I/O.
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:07.800]   I think it's just if you really wanted to cut through
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:09.440]   everything, then you just need a baby crying.
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:10.960]   You know, like a little bit of a little bit of a little
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:11.960]   that cuts through everything.
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:14.040]   Like you never missed that one.
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:16.880]   But again, we're trying to not freak people out here.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:18.240]   That's the balance.
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:18.920]   That's the balance.
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.240]   That's the balance.
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:23.080]   Rhett Kahn says it should be playing Axl Rose's Paradise City.
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:26.120]   That would be something I'd want to find and stop real quick.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:27.120]   No.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:29.200]   Sweet out of my eyes a little bit harder.
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:31.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:32.560]   All right.
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:35.200]   That would be good because it ramps up and down
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:36.720]   different frequencies of sound.
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:39.120]   So that actually would probably be very, very good.
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:40.120]   This is the right ending.
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:41.120]   The right would be expensive.
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.440]   But outside of that, we're good.
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:43.120]   Apples, good.
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:45.200]   It's Apple, the past long expense of the consumer.
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:46.200]   Come on.
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:49.280]   That's never been a problem before.
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:50.960]   Let's tell you what.
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:52.840]   Let's get ready for our picks of the week.
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:55.000]   You guys are so much fun.
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.520]   But we do have another show to go to in just a little bit.
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:03.360]   Let's kick the picks of the week off with Jason Snell, your pick.
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:03.920]   All right.
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:05.520]   My pick is going to be a little weird,
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:07.560]   because I've been here long enough now that I realize they
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:08.520]   can't always be useful.
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:09.720]   Sometimes they got to be weird.
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:12.080]   And this is a company called Firestar Toys.
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:15.720]   And you're saying to yourself, why would you choose Firestar
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:16.960]   Toys an Etsy shop?
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:19.720]   And the answer friends is they have a wide collection.
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:20.400]   Do you like LEGO?
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:21.480]   Do you like LEGO Minifig?
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:24.600]   Are you sad that things aren't licensed that you love,
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:26.560]   but aren't licensed for LEGO Minifig?
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:30.040]   And the answer is, would you like to get, for example,
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:31.600]   Hawaiian detective?
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:33.480]   Ooh.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:34.480]   Who is actually--
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:34.960]   Strangely--
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:35.480]   Magna Pi.
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:36.480]   Strangely Miss Teshu.
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:37.480]   Right at the end.
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:38.320]   Beautiful.
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:40.080]   Of Magna Pi.
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:44.280]   But he's available on their site as private detective.
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:47.200]   They have basically taken a bunch of pop culture figures.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:47.560]   Kind of like--
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:48.280]   In this store, make--
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:49.480]   Fried chicken muggle.
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:50.480]   Custom.
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:52.320]   Yeah, make custom--
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:55.440]   make LEGO Minifigs that resemble things you know and love
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:56.240]   from pop culture.
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:59.720]   So in honor of Magna Pi, Roger, mostly,
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:01.320]   who was on that show just passed away,
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:05.920]   I'm going to just say, I guess I have a Magna Pi Minifig.
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:08.280]   And there's also a Ferrari, by the way.
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:10.440]   So there's an official LEGO Ferrari.
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:12.040]   So you can put him in the Ferrari if you want to.
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:14.920]   Has that been recalled as well, probably, yeah.
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:15.800]   You name it.
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:16.320]   There he is.
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:18.480]   There's the private eye.
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:21.200]   But anyway, there's lots of different choices you have there
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:23.960]   if you want to get your LEGO on.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:25.440]   Like the chest hair.
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.960]   This is a dark one.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:27.840]   It's so good.
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:30.880]   Hylizer, chest hair, gun, mustache, the hair,
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:31.800]   the whole thing.
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:34.320]   And these are LEGO Minifig parts.
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.680]   Some of them are custom printed.
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:36.680]   Some of them are not.
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:37.160]   This is awesome.
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:38.480]   And they source them and put them together.
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:40.600]   So if you've got a Licko set or something like that,
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.040]   it is a LEGO Minifig.
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:43.680]   It will work in that space.
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:48.000]   So you can put a Ferrari in a tie-fiber or wherever.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:48.960]   And yeah, you name it.
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:49.480]   They've got it.
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:50.040]   It's amazing.
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:51.880]   Mentally unbalanced journalist.
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:54.280]   I've got to own this one.
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:55.760]   The names are also beautiful, right?
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:57.400]   Because they can't legally use the names.
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:58.480]   So if you want to pop Ross--
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:01.520]   Basically, they took the Magna Pi body
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:05.040]   and put a briefcase in his hand and a crazy head on.
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:06.440]   And then he's Hunter S. Thompson.
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:07.520]   He's Hunter S. Thompson.
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:10.800]   Happy little painter who is literally the Bob Ross Minifig.
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:11.840]   It just goes on and on.
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:12.040]   It's amazing.
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:13.720]   Oh, so great.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:14.920]   Oh, my god.
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:15.560]   Great fake.
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:16.080]   Great fake.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:17.240]   It's the Firestore Touries Etsy shop.
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:19.840]   They're very nice.
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:22.080]   My Magna Pi I got lost in the mail.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:23.640]   And I sent them a note saying I never got it.
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:25.360]   And they sent me another one right away.
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:25.720]   Very good.
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:28.760]   How do you think they make these?
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:31.640]   I think they've got a library of actual LEGO pieces.
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:34.160]   And then I think they do some custom printing
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:37.800]   on generic LEGO pieces with the custom designs.
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:38.200]   That's my guess.
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:39.880]   This is so cool.
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:40.640]   Yeah, they're really good.
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:41.680]   Wow.
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:42.520]   And they don't feel fake.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:43.280]   They feel real.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:46.160]   So they don't feel like it's a 3D printed part or something.
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:47.800]   It feels like the real deal.
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:51.640]   This is fantastic.
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:56.000]   Etsy.com/FireStartToys.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.040]   Firestar Toys.
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:58.400]   Star Toys.
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:48:59.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:01.920]   Or could be FireStart Boys.
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:02.840]   Start always?
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:03.360]   Yeah.
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:04.360]   Yes, exactly.
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:04.720]   OK.
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:07.000]   Anyway, if you're a fan of Doctor Who, I'm just saying,
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.040]   time traveling captain is available.
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:11.840]   Wonderful.
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:13.480]   Wonderful.
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:15.680]   Andy, you're pick of the week.
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:18.840]   My pick is kind of specific for people in Boston.
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:24.000]   I know Boston Comic Con/fan Expo Boston is this weekend.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.560]   But then that cost you money to get into.
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:28.440]   But it's a good time.
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:30.000]   It's especially good for those of us
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.720]   who are-- who used to go to Mac--
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:34.600]   Mackerel Expo Boston because it takes place
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:36.360]   in the exact same part of Boston.
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:39.760]   So it's very, very weird to be speltering in August,
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:42.280]   overdressed for an occasion, and heading down
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:43.080]   to the waterfront.
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:45.880]   It's a trip, man.
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:49.200]   But for the real pick of the week is Thursday, Friday,
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:51.320]   and Saturday in Boston Common.
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:54.480]   Boston Common puts a big, big performance stage
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:56.400]   up for the month of August.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:58.120]   And there are some really good performances happening.
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:49:59.600]   Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:02.160]   Boston Lyric Opera is putting on a full production
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:06.880]   of Romeo and Juliet of the classic opera.
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:09.840]   And these performances are free from 8 AM.
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:13.040]   8 PM will probably go for another two hours after that.
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:15.440]   That's happening on Thursday and on Saturday.
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:20.200]   On Friday, there is a part of the Tito Puente performance stage.
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:22.680]   There is a Latin Music Festival or Latin Music
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:23.640]   performances.
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:29.200]   And it really shows off why people from Boston who
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:30.840]   like Boston like Boston.
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:33.080]   It's like walking home from work or walking home for something.
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:36.640]   And you didn't know that there is going to be an opera
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:39.800]   on your way to Park Street Station to get to the subway.
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:41.560]   And you wind up being three hours late for work
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:44.040]   because you decided to sit and listen to Latin Music
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:45.200]   for an hour and a half.
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:46.880]   So these are great stuff.
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:49.880]   It's on Tremont Street near the bandstand,
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:51.800]   the Sergeant Pepper style bandstand
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:53.720]   that you never see anybody actually performing in.
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:55.480]   It's mostly used as a landmark these days
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:56.840]   than as a performance space.
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:58.840]   But it's going to be a good time.
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:00.840]   And the weather is supposed to break a little bit,
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:02.440]   supposed to be only in the mid 70s.
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:05.080]   So for Boston in August, that's pretty darn good.
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:10.920]   I know, Jason, that you like custom coding scripts
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:12.240]   and adding them to your system.
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:14.200]   And I'm wondering if you've ever heard about something
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:16.280]   called Uber Sixt.
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:16.880]   No.
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:21.720]   This is a really cool widget program free for your Mac,
[01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:24.680]   traces of .net.
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:27.280]   And you can have any-- I mean, you can have bash scripts,
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:31.080]   Python scripts, any kind of scripts with their own widgets
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:36.200]   that you can then kind of embed into your Macintosh screen.
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:38.600]   So for instance, if you use OpenHab,
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:41.680]   you can have a widget that actually tells you
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:44.240]   what's going on with a variety of things.
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:46.200]   It creates a widget folder.
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:49.960]   These are basically HTML5 scripts.
[01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:51.800]   So it's very simple.
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:56.000]   You could write your own in JavaScript and React.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.560]   And there are so many other people who are writing scripts.
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:01.120]   You probably don't have to write your own.
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:04.400]   You could find little scripts for weather, for world clocks,
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:08.200]   for scores, for your current Bitcoin price,
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:10.000]   all kinds of little dashboards that you just
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:10.640]   didn't bet on your Mac.
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:12.000]   I know, doesn't this look cool?
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:12.480]   This is nice.
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:16.800]   This is like the return of dashboard a little bit.
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:19.160]   But there are always there.
[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:21.800]   They're always there.
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:23.880]   And I don't know how much-- I haven't played with it too much
[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:26.400]   to know exactly how functional it is.
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:29.000]   But in other words, can you interact with them
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:29.720]   and things like that?
[01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:31.440]   I think you can.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:33.640]   And there's so many widgets out there
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:36.240]   that you certainly could get an idea of what you might want
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:43.720]   to do using terminal script like bash or Z shell or Python
[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:47.760]   or other things in addition to just HTML5.
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:50.840]   Uber-sicked, U-B-E-R-S-I-C-H-T.
[01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:54.640]   But it's at traces of .NET.
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:55.400]   And it is free.
[01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:56.640]   And it's very easy to install.
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:00.760]   And it doesn't require any weird kernel modifications
[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:03.400]   or anything like that.
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:08.760]   Finally, we go to Alex Jason Lindsey for his--
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:11.360]   I could have called it Jason Statham.
[01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:11.840]   I didn't.
[01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:15.280]   I thought I'd make it similar.
[01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:18.800]   Yeah, so we have good sessions on office hours.
[01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:20.200]   We do a lot of them.
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:22.080]   And then we have great sessions.
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:24.600]   And this morning was a great session.
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:28.920]   We had Dan Tepfer from a far play, not fair play,
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:30.600]   but far play.
[01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:33.320]   What far play does is allows musicians
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:37.200]   to interact with each other-- I mean, basically play together.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:40.840]   And we had an incredible this morning, an incredible jazz,
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:42.680]   like half an hour of jazz being played
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:46.120]   by four different artists, hundreds of miles from each other,
[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:50.920]   live, being able to riff together and play back and forth
[01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:52.600]   and make adjustments and so on and so forth.
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:53.080]   This is huge.
[01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:56.160]   This is such a problem because of latency.
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:59.000]   And so many people have tried to play music together with Zoom
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.680]   and very low latency.
[01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:01.680]   You can't.
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:02.520]   They give you a sense of it.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:05.440]   Because Zoom is going to a server and then back
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:07.320]   and it has quality and it has to work for everybody
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:11.320]   and everything else, your latency is about 225 milliseconds
[01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:12.000]   per lake.
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.040]   So that's about what-- and we consider that really good.
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:16.760]   It's probably one of the shortest.
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:18.880]   For conversation, it's fine.
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:22.120]   So far play, under the same--
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:25.480]   across the United States would be about 40 or 50 milliseconds.
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:27.400]   So about four times lower.
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:31.080]   And on the East Coast is going to be under 20 milliseconds
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:33.080]   or less because it's peer to peer.
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:34.920]   So basically, when two people are talking,
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:36.040]   they're not going through any server.
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:38.120]   They're just going straight to each other.
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:41.760]   That latency is super low.
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:44.520]   And here's the clap test without far play.
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:46.520]   Just so you can see the difference here.
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:48.160]   They're doing it without far play.
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:50.600]   3Eana.
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:51.120]   There's the difference.
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:52.320]   Oh my god.
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:53.880]   You can't play music that way, right?
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:54.840]   It's simultaneous.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:56.920]   But if you could get that closer together,
[01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:59.080]   you could play together or sing together.
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:03.240]   And so these are playing complex jazz together.
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:04.440]   It's so cool.
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:05.520]   Over online.
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:08.640]   And up until recently, you could only do it with two people
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:10.280]   because it was just-- that's where they
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:11.200]   were with the technology.
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:16.040]   Now it is limited to your computer CPU and your bandwidth.
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:17.400]   Like how many people you can go.
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:19.800]   Because remember, it's peer to peer with everybody.
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:25.240]   And so we had four musicians on this morning.
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:27.240]   But you could keep-- this is the show here.
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:31.840]   And it was-- so those four musicians
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:35.440]   are anywhere from 10s to hundreds of miles apart.
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:37.320]   And if you go into--
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:38.800]   I was talking about second hour.
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:40.000]   Second hour, second hour.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.360]   Yeah, just go.
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:41.880]   Oh, there it is.
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:43.320]   OK, here they are playing.
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:46.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:57.560]   That's kind of amazing.
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:55:59.280]   Such a thing can be done.
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:00.640]   I know so many musicians.
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:02.560]   In fact, I get calls on the radio show all the time
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:05.160]   for people who are saying, how can we solve this?
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:06.520]   How can we do this?
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:08.760]   And if you've ever heard us try to sing Happy Birthday
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:11.480]   in a Zoom call, you know it's very hard.
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:12.360]   It would work.
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:13.440]   It would work here.
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:15.080]   You know, like it's-- is this cool?
[01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:16.240]   This is office hours.
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:18.440]   Good Lord, you guys are having a concert.
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:19.480]   Oh my gosh.
[01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:23.720]   We'll tell you, having concert level musicians helps.
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:25.720]   You know, like it definitely makes it big to make it better.
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:26.560]   Oh, yeah, so happy.
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:27.000]   Happy.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.480]   Happy.
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:30.080]   Office Hours.global, if you want to.
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:32.400]   That's today's show 868.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:33.120]   If you want to see them--
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:34.120]   Performing.
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:36.800]   And it's just amazing.
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:42.240]   Like it is-- you know, the technology behind it,
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:45.480]   because it's written by someone who is--
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:46.560]   Dan actually works on it.
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:48.760]   And because it's written by someone
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:52.040]   who is a very accomplished musician who understands
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:55.520]   what's necessary, it has things like they can play at one
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:58.320]   latency and they might hear some dropouts.
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:00.360]   But the latency that goes out to the broadcast
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:02.600]   can be different to make sure that it fills those in.
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:04.400]   And the latency for the recording can be different.
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.000]   And it's delivering all those tracks
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.640]   to as individual tracks.
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:08.720]   So you can send it all into Reaper
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:10.400]   and record all the individual tracks.
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:10.960]   Yeah, get it right.
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:11.960]   And remix it later.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:15.800]   And so there's a whole bunch of tools in there
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:19.040]   that are-- you have an app being developed by someone
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:21.760]   who truly is using it, who truly understands
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:23.640]   all of the issues that are related to it
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:25.440]   and all the things that have to be done.
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:30.160]   And it is-- oh, by the way, the most advanced version of it
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:31.280]   is about $8 a month.
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:31.800]   Wow.
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:37.080]   You know, for those of us who do have other versions of this,
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:40.600]   that do this kind of thing that aren't as low latency,
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:45.720]   but do deliver many tracks, it's a lot, a lot more expensive
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:46.720]   than $8 a month.
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:50.280]   And so this is an incredible deal, incredible.
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:52.320]   If you're a musician that wants to riff-- and again,
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:54.560]   there's a free version that you can download.
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:58.080]   And two people-- I think two people can do it back and forth
[01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:00.040]   for up to 45 minutes for free.
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:00.760]   You can just use it.
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:04.400]   So if you're teaching lessons, for instance,
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:06.880]   or you just want to riff with someone for a little while,
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:08.280]   the free version is free.
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:10.040]   And it will do all the things you needed to do.
[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:11.560]   The standard version is like $6.
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:14.520]   The advanced version that really gives you all the bells
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:16.360]   and whistles is $8 a month.
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:18.720]   And so if you're really doing this seriously,
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:19.520]   it's a really good deal.
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:21.960]   And again, you can get into it for free, test it,
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:23.440]   use it for up to 45 minutes.
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:25.320]   And then of course, just close it and open it again.
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:27.000]   The only person that has to have the license
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.120]   is the person starting the show.
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:30.480]   So you could have one person pay an $8 a month
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:33.800]   and eight people just join in and start going.
[01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:34.560]   So it doesn't--
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:36.280]   not everybody has to have it.
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:38.440]   And like kind of like Zoom or whatever.
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:43.320]   And so it is-- wow, really exciting technology.
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:44.600]   I mean, this has been something--
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:48.480]   or sorry, far play, F-A-R-P-L-A-Y dot I-O.
[01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:50.040]   But I think the first thing you should do
[01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:52.560]   is go to officehours.global and watch the interview
[01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:55.200]   and the performance with Dan, because that's
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:57.240]   a really great way to learn more about it.
[01:58:57.240 --> 01:58:59.120]   And that's one of the things that makes office hours
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:00.320]   exceptional.
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:03.120]   Officehours.global, if you want to join in,
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:04.720]   you can watch after the fact on YouTube.
[01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:08.200]   But honestly, join the Zoom conversation.
[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:09.280]   And you could be a part of it.
[01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:12.240]   And it goes not just in the morning, but really all day.
[01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:17.320]   And then there's the Super Saturdays, the Sabado Gigante's.
[01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:18.880]   And now we have more and more--
[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:21.000]   we have labs that are starting up every--
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.680]   so we have like Ecamm Live.
[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:24.360]   Ecamm is being a lab on Tuesday.
[01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:25.840]   We have web development Wednesday.
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:29.760]   On Thursday, we have Isadora, which is this incredible app
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:34.080]   that allows us to automate for theater and for our broadcasts,
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:36.080]   our entire infrastructure is based on it.
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:40.040]   And then we also today had a lab on SRT.
[01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:44.840]   And now we have Final Cut Labs and NDI testing labs.
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:46.400]   There's lots of things that are just kind of building up
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:46.760]   around it.
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:48.360]   It just keeps--
[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:48.880]   Nice.
[01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:49.520]   I wouldn't--
[01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:50.080]   --growing.
[01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:50.880]   Lovely.
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:52.880]   Officehours.global.
[01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:53.720]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:59.120]   And of course, if you want to hire Alex 090.media.
[01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:01.160]   Now in the beautiful--
[02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:02.000]   what is it?
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.000]   Optical.
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:03.840]   The corner optical.
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:04.720]   It's your optical building.
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:06.360]   We've been there for years.
[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:12.400]   We moved in when we moved in right in the beginning of COVID.
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:13.920]   And so we've been there for a long time.
[02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:15.200]   A lot of bandwidth, a lot of fiber.
[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:16.360]   A lot of bet.
[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:20.680]   Some reason, somebody-- some prior tenant must have needed it.
[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:24.040]   Andy Inaco, always a pleasure to have you on.
[02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:27.440]   When are you going to be on WGBH next?
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:30.360]   On next Friday, at the usual time, 1250,
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:37.680]   or 1210, 10 in the afternoon, go to WGBHNews.org
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:40.640]   to check out the live stream or the saved streams,
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:44.000]   or go to WGBH's streaming channel on YouTube
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.200]   to watch it live or watch it later.
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:48.600]   You can also, of course, look for Andy's logo.
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:54.560]   Custom designed, mentally unbalanced, journalist online,
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:58.520]   wherever finer LEGO minifigures are sold.
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:01.320]   That doesn't look like you at all.
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:03.600]   Actually, there's another one that's pretty spot on.
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:05.040]   Really?
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:07.200]   I won't point you to it, but it's like, you know what?
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:09.440]   That is-- that is-- that is-- got the burns.
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:12.040]   I also got the round sort of head coming up.
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:13.120]   Podcaster.
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:13.880]   Yeah.
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:14.560]   Great to have you.
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:15.600]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:18.560]   Jason Snell, I appreciate the time you make for us,
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:21.680]   because I know you're the busiest man in podcasting.
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:25.600]   Go to sixcolors.com/podcast for a list of them all.
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:28.840]   Or just go to sixcolors, because they're all there,
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:32.040]   along with a lot of great reporting by Jason
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:34.240]   and his colleague Dan Moran, and of course,
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:37.000]   the new downstream, which he published during this show.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:37.680]   During the show.
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:38.160]   It is a very--
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:39.520]   --pre-show, technically during the pre-show.
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:40.040]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:40.600]   That's fair.
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:41.600]   That's fair.
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:43.360]   Sixcolors is a great-- you're the greatest, Jason.
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:44.440]   Thank you for making your day.
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:45.560]   Thank you, Leo.
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:46.600]   A part of ours.
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:47.760]   We appreciate it.
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:49.280]   Thanks to all of you for joining us.
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:51.960]   We do Mac Break Weekly on Tuesdays, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:54.200]   Eastern Time, 1800 UTC.
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:56.960]   You can watch us do it live at live.twit.tv.
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:58.640]   If you're watching or listening live,
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:01.040]   you can chat live at irc.twit.tv.
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:03.520]   And of course, club Twitch members also can chat.
[02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:07.160]   In our Discord, as they're watching the show, many do.
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:09.360]   After the fact, on-demand versions of this show
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:13.520]   available at twit.tv/mbw.
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:15.520]   Or on YouTube, there's a YouTube dedicated
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:19.120]   YouTube channel for Mac Break Weekly.
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:23.440]   You can also subscribe in your favorite podcast player,
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:25.840]   which would be very cool.
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:26.960]   That way you get it automatically.
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:27.920]   The minute it's available.
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:29.320]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:31.560]   Here's a custom design.
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:33.080]   I don't know if this is Firestarter.
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:34.720]   No, this is another company.
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:38.400]   This is a custom Zelensky with Molotov cocktails.
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:42.160]   So that's good.
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:44.400]   I guess you could do a lot with these mini figures, right?
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:46.640]   This is from designboom.com.
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:47.480]   Yeah.
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:48.280]   Wow.
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:49.080]   No limit.
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:50.080]   No limit.
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:53.600]   [LAUGHS]
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:54.840]   Thank you for joining us all.
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:56.200]   We really appreciate it.
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:57.360]   And we will see you next time.
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:02:59.400]   But now I hate to tell you it's time to get back to work.
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:02.240]   Because break time is over.
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:03.880]   Bye bye.
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:05.320]   Hey, we should talk Linux.
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:07.040]   It's the operating system that runs the internet,
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:08.960]   but your game consoles, cell phones,
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:11.080]   and maybe even the machine on your desk.
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:12.480]   But you already knew all that.
