[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.320]   There is a big leak of the iOS 14.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.080]   It was leaked out of Apple.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.080]   9 to 5 Mac has broken it all down.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.240]   You'll be amazed at the amount of features.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.960]   As Michael Sargent said on iOS today,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.120]   it's kind of like WWDC all jammed into about an hour.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.040]   Speaking of WWDC, we talk about whether it might be canceled.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.280]   There's reason to think it.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.400]   It might be was never announced, so I don't know if you can cancel it.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.400]   And we'll celebrate International Women's Day.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.360]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.920]   Mac Break Weekly comes to you from Twitt's LastPass Studios.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.640]   You're focused on security.

[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.920]   Let's talk Apple.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.960]   And there is a lot to talk about this week.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.560]   My goodness.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.840]   Joining us from Sacramento in her pink layer, Lori Gill, managing editor, imore.com, is
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.840]   the house pink.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.480]   You should have a pink house.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.720]   The house has bright yellow, actually.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.640]   It's even better.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.640]   Even better.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.400]   Goes well with pink.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.640]   Her hair is pink for those listening.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.640]   And it's beautiful.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.080]   In fact, I think Alex Lindsey said he wish he could have your hair.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.880]   I'll help you out with that.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.880]   Okay, great.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.640]   I was thinking pink with some blue streaks.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.640]   That would look good.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.360]   I like the hair that changes colors at different angles.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.160]   No matter what angle.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.640]   My kids really wanted a Mohawk.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.920]   They suggested a Mohawk and I said, "I don't know why I go on air with that."
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.920]   It'd be great for TikTok.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.000]   I said, "Don't put stuff in it on the show days."
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.600]   It'll just look like a shortcut.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.760]   And then you can check it out.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.760]   Just saying.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.760]   It'd be great for TikTok.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.760]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.800]   Oh, 9/0 media at 090.media.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.360]   He is Alex Lindsey on the Twitter.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.800]   Thank you for coming to St. Louis.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.200]   I said it's a great time.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.040]   It was a death-defying act, but we did it.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.200]   We flew to St. Louis.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   We survived.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   Well, so far.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   So far.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200]   Right.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   14 days will now.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.920]   I think they said now five days.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.480]   Well, on average, you get five days.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.960]   It could be longer, but on average, you'll have symptoms.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   And it's been five days, right?
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.960]   It was Thursday.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.960]   I think we're fine.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   We skated, baby.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.120]   What an amazing place.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.840]   We were at Worldwide Technology, one of our sponsors in St. Louis.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.200]   I was really impressed.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.640]   I was very impressed.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.040]   It was a great tour and just an amazing location and amazing services.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.560]   It's pretty cool.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.560]   We had a great time.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.000]   So that is now a Twit Live event.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   It's an art-twit news feed, I think, right?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Which feed is it?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   News or events?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.840]   So, Twit.tv/events.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.280]   It was a panel discussion on the future of tech in the cloud.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.040]   As someone who does a lot of walkthroughs, it's a really nice theater.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.760]   And by the way, Hi-O-Mikes, Hi-O-Mikes stands everywhere.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.120]   That impressed the heck out of me.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.320]   They have good taste in the microphones.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.200]   And yeah, they shot it.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.560]   It was a multi-camera shoot and they knew what they were doing.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.800]   I mean, it was well done, I thought.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.880]   So yeah, there's those Hi-O-Mikes.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.480]   So if you're interested in the cloud and we had some great anecdotes, great stories,
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.480]   Gary Jofoli, Alex Lindsay, that's Mike Dohrosh on the right from Gardener.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.480]   He'll be on Twit soon.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.480]   He was a talker.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.480]   He was good.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.480]   He was great.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.240]   And he also, he lives in Chicago and makes his own pickles.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.000]   And he used to be the Dead's tour manager.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.400]   The Dead's tour manager.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.400]   Amazing.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.400]   Whoa.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.400]   He's done a lot in life.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.400]   He's fled to full life.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.400]   What did IBM?
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.400]   That's an interesting contrast.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   First, the Dead's tour.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.760]   No, I think it was IBM first, then the Dead's tour manager.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.560]   Is Andy Anaco, to my right from Boston Public Radio?
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.560]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.560]   Hello, boy.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.280]   That guy must know how to get drugs in all kinds of situations.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.520]   That's a skill you gotta cultivate.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.160]   They don't teach you that in sound engineering or school.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.080]   He worked with the Dead in the early 90s for a couple of years managing their tours.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.080]   Okay.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.080]   So, okay.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.080]   So high blood pressure medication.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.040]   No, he wasn't in his 90s.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.640]   He was the...
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.920]   And also with us all the way from Montreal, home of the last Great Bagel.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.960]   It is Mr. Renee Ritchie from iMournt.com.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.960]   Hi, Renee.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   It's true.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.800]   The last two Great Bagels, St. Vieder and...
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   What's the other one?
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.800]   Oh, God.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.800]   I'm gonna get my signature.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.800]   It's a quantum blue.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.800]   Vieder.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.800]   Oh.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.800]   I'm talking about it.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.800]   St. Vieder.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.800]   And...
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.080]   No, you have to excuse me because we have freezing rain and that means the power goes on and
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.320]   off all night.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.080]   And because I have smart accessories, they come on whenever the power comes back on.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.120]   You've been up and off and all night.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.120]   Oh, my God.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   And UPS is so...
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.240]   It's like hue lights and beep, beep, beep, just like every 15, 20 minutes and...
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.240]   I'm going back in the stone.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.240]   Is San Vieter still open?
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.120]   Because the last I saw, there were under threats in a variety of different ways.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.120]   One...
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.120]   Fairmount.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.120]   The other...
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.840]   Both of them are wood-fired ovens.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.800]   And Montreal was going to shut that down.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.800]   And then last year...
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   Like you keep permission.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.960]   They said they got a red hike and they were going to close, which is probably they were
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.960]   saved by the bagel philanthropists.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.960]   I would hope.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.960]   What would we do?
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   I mean, it's a national treasure.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.640]   A lot of big hearts there in the bagel community.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.560]   I don't think that's been reported enough.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.560]   No.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.520]   One of my favorite stories, and I don't know if it's apocryphal, but I believe it's accurate,
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.520]   is that the factory that makes the cheese curds for put in had a fire and couldn't
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.080]   produce, and because that was a national disaster, other cheese factories donated capacity
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.080]   to that cheese curds.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.360]   That's so Canada.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.360]   That's so Canada.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.360]   And they...
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.360]   Blessed.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.360]   But they apologize that they didn't do it fast.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.360]   We're sorry.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.360]   We'll help.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.360]   We're sorry.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.360]   Speaking of Canada...
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.560]   The crisis, they always find a way.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.520]   Speaking of Canada, I just got off the phone with Ray Maxwell, our second favorite Canadian
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.440]   after you, Renee.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.840]   Ray used to do a show on the network, which was a great show called Maxwell's House.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.920]   In fact, all the old episodes are still online.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.200]   Worth watching, but he's a professional color scientist.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   In fact, he was the guy explaining me there's no such color as magenta.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.040]   I think it's magenta.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.840]   There's no such color as...
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.840]   It's fake.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.840]   It's a made up color.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.800]   Today, they were saying that Brown is fake.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.080]   They said it's just orange with context.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.080]   I don't know anything.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.680]   It's orange with a pink.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.720]   Also true.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.200]   In any event, Ray happens to have a Mac Pro.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.840]   He's the only person I know besides Marques Brownlee who owns a Mac Pro.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.920]   Marques is going to be on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.720]   But I'm going to have Ray do our hands on tech review of the Mac Pro.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.400]   He has a lot to say.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.960]   Because he's a color scientist, he says the XTR display is a color scientist's dream.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.960]   I said, "Did you get the entry level?"
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.200]   He said, "No, I kind of got the mid-range."
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.840]   Then he told me he got the 32 terabyte promise raid in it.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.200]   32 terabytes.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:13.520]   He shoots a video with his DJI Phantom 6K video with that X7 camera.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.720]   He said, "Of course, a great photographer does medium format stuff too."
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.240]   Maybe he needs all those.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.960]   He said he discovered the first flaw in the Mac Pro.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.480]   That 32 terabyte rate array by promise is cooled by Apple.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.200]   He said there was a little miscommunication.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.280]   It overheated on day two.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:39.160]   He contacted Apple and he said that they updated Mac OS in '15, '03, I guess it was.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.360]   OS X has the fanspeak goes up a little bit.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.800]   I have to admit, I'm religious about not putting my drives in my head.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.800]   I wouldn't put inside.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.200]   I have just the drive in the computer for me is always the apps.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.600]   The apps and the OS and everything else, and then you have an external.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600]   Everything's external.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.240]   That way, if something goes wrong with the computer, I'm going to send the computer in.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.880]   I'm not sending all my data and everything else.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.720]   It's tempting though because you have all that room in the Mac Pro case.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.840]   You have all those bays.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.840]   It's got to be tempting.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.840]   It is tempting.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   Don't.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.840]   32 terabytes.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   Wow.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:13.120]   I don't know if you saw the Verge review, but they basically loaded it up and then ran every
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:19.280]   Adobe application possible and said, "Oh, Adobe's not optimized for the Mac Pro."
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.560]   Not optimized because of the graphics drive.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.280]   It doesn't use the GPU.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.280]   That's sad.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.280]   Well, I'm sure you'll have a lot to say that'll be a good hands-on tech.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.280]   It's coming up.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.320]   We're going to arrange a date to get ready to review the Mac Pro and the XDR.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.320]   Oddly enough.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.480]   Are you going to have them open up a bunch of Chrome tabs and see how many days to shut
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.480]   it down?
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.480]   No.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.480]   So this guy's a real user.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.440]   Oddly enough, the Apple app seemed to take full advantage of the computer.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.440]   Oh, what a surprise.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.440]   Surprise.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.440]   Too bad aperture is gone.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.440]   Well, I saw it.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   You can run it.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.440]   I know.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.440]   I saw that.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.440]   I saw it a too bit, but you can run it.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.640]   Does anyone try running Flash on these computers?
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.200]   That would be good.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.800]   I don't think it can handle it as much as a Chrome tab.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.240]   Almost as much power as a Chrome tab.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.160]   Anyway, so I just thought a little shout out.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.840]   I got an email the other day from guys that went over having a Ray Maxwell.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.960]   I loved that show Maxwell's house.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.960]   Great.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.960]   Okay.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.080]   Last Sunday, Twit was like three quarters COVID-19.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.320]   I'm not going to do that to you, but there is some coronavirus news.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.320]   We'll just give it to you.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.320]   We'll get it out of the way.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.960]   Very, very relevant this week.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.960]   Yes.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.960]   Well, yeah, it's probably going to get a little relevant.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.200]   Yeah, before it stops getting relevant.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.040]   Bunch of stories in the Kofi V-19 column.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.480]   Tim Cook outlines measures.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:45.520]   He sent an internal memo outlining measures that Apple is taking in response to the global,
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.320]   what may be a pandemic.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.780]   Work from home.
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.000]   He says this is a challenging moment.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.760]   Unprecedented event, please feel what he told employees at several global offices.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.120]   I imagine Italy is one of them.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.000]   Please feel free to work remotely if your job allows.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   That's got to be tough.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.640]   If your job doesn't allow, do you go in anyway and take a chance?
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.960]   Well, if your job allows, I think you get a large percentage of people able to work remotely
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.600]   for at least some period of time.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   Certainly.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   Coder's can work.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.600]   The hard part, I think, is that it's not really hard.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.600]   The design lab is hard.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.600]   It's culturally not.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.600]   Most people at Apple go into work.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.280]   So it's a different culture.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.280]   So his pot.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.240]   Because, and I think this is what something we discovered is that people who work at home
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.000]   often aren't doing much.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   It's hard.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   It's hard.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.600]   Sorry, Laurie, but it's true.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.240]   No, no, it's not true.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.640]   You just have the wrong people.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.640]   That's it.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:43.960]   It does take a mentality, you know, I think that to do it where you, I actually do more
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.880]   work at home because I'm not spending the time driving and I'm not spending, you know,
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.960]   and I work, I get up in the morning and start working and then I work all the way into the
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.920]   evening and there's a lot of stops in the middle, but it's not.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.160]   It's just a different kind of work.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:01.200]   And also you have to be really good at being visible to the folks that you're working with.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.520]   That's the problem is, is if we can't see what you're doing and there's no obvious output,
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.520]   then we just can't tell.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.520]   And if you're doing anything.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.520]   My problem is they don't stop.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.520]   Like wake up, start working.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.840]   You both of you, you and Laurie both have output.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.800]   You've got vector, you've got articles, you've got it.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.800]   But if you're to see that.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.120]   If we have a sales like my son, I'll use as an example who is working home on Fridays
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.120]   doing sales, you know, sales, there's no clear output.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.560]   You either make sales or you don't.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.080]   So that's, and I think that's anyway, this policy.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:35.400]   I had a remarkable conversation where I was talking to an analyst and they said, well,
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.720]   start preparing for a baby boom because after a lot of people do when they stay home, we
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   have baby boom.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.760]   So start getting started investing in all those package consumer packages.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.200]   So I am the, I am the last baby boom.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.520]   It was post war.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.360]   All the GIs came home and suddenly there were a lot of babies nine months later.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.160]   And you're the gen Xers, which were the next, the next, the next.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.160]   Was that a boom?
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.160]   They were the children of the booms.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.760]   So they were like, I was a, I was a, I was a man.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.320]   That was like the ripples coming off of the baby boom.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.320]   But yeah, but also.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.200]   And then both, the millennials came from when Seinfeld ended and now people had nothing
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.160]   to do on Thursday nights.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.520]   Seinfeld and Leno was a double whammy.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:19.440]   So cooks Mommo said this applies to corporate offices in the Santa Clara Valley where they're,
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:25.760]   that's probably outside of Seattle, the West Coast's hotspot elk Grove, which is also in
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:31.960]   California, Seattle, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Switzerland and the UK.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.200]   Cook said apples making them.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.560]   This is interesting, a major effort to reduce human density and ensure those teams that
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.800]   are on site can do their work safely and with peace of mind.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.200]   And with another, in other words, spread out because social distancing is another way to
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.120]   reduce infection.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.440]   People's implementing quote new efforts to maximize interpersonal space and continuing
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.800]   enhanced deep cleanings.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   Now one thing we didn't hear about is WWDC, although, and I don't know if this will be
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:11.560]   Jermaine, but apparently Santa Clara County, which is where Apple is, has banned mass gatherings.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:16.920]   Well, they, they were on Thursday was in a band was just advisory.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.320]   They released it along with the band was yesterday.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.000]   Okay, that was, I know that on Thursday, they did a very, very long memo, basically,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.280]   not saying, not saying Apple, but saying Apple, we're encouraging you, we're encouraging
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:36.320]   large mass scheduled last mass gatherings to be postponed or canceled.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.320]   Yes, kind of a hint.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.520]   I think it's only for two weeks, right?
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.520]   It's a short term ban.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.120]   They're going to reassess in a couple of weeks.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.560]   Yeah, if the virus goes away in two weeks, they can have WWDC.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.560]   Yeah, you know, that goes away.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.560]   It'll just go away.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.960]   Off the calendar and probably gets Google I/O, which has already been canceled.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.280]   Yeah, well, F8, Facebook's developer conference, Google I/O, Google's developer conference,
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.280]   both canceled.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.280]   South by Southwest.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.480]   That was Austin saying we don't, we really don't want all those people coming down here.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.480]   Right.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.440]   And that's going to be disastrous for, I mean, a lot of these for, you know, like for instance.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.440]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.240]   It's a big economic hit for a city to take, but at the same time, what do you do?
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.800]   Say, oh, we need the restaurants business, but everybody can get sick.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   You can't do that either.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.960]   No, no, I think it's, it's hard.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.360]   Like for instance, NAB has not the conference that I go to probably more than the other one
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.360]   has not canceled yet.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.360]   Vegas is not going to say, don't come to Vegas.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.360]   Well, and I don't.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.360]   Even if they should.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.560]   My guess is the commitment for LVCC is between 10 and $20 million.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.840]   And so they have to have LVCC release, that's Las Vegas Convention Center, release NAB before
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.440]   NAB is going to be able to release the exhibitors, you know, like there's a, you know, otherwise
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.440]   they'll know no numbers.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.440]   It's like dominant or NAB.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.760]   So, you know, having people canceled, like so Ross has canceled, AJA has canceled.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.960]   There's a bunch of other people that are not going.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:52.040]   In fact, the Ross one is a 40 by 40 booth in the center of the South Hall.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.040]   What's Ross?
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.040]   They've never heard of them.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.040]   What do they do?
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.320]   They do, they're kind of between, no, they'll hate, I'm going to get in a lot of trouble
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:03.080]   from Ross to say this, but, but they are, they are between black magic and grass valley.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.080]   So grass valley is like the.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.080]   So the little higher level.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   So the higher level.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.880]   And then grass, then black magic, a little lower in the grass valley.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.160]   More expensive in price range, you know, and definitely there's a lot of feature sets
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.240]   that they have that are really good, but they're usually considered like, oh, I can't afford
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.240]   a grass valley.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.480]   So I'll, you know, then they go Ross and Ross has got really great stuff.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.920]   But the, but they're kind of in that, that niche and they're really big and they do a
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.920]   lot of infrastructure.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.920]   How many people go to WWDC?
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.920]   Cause Santa Clara says.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.680]   It's like a hundred, I want to say a hundred and fifty thousand.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.680]   Okay.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.680]   So that's 20,000.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.680]   That's definitely is above the cap.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.880]   They say anything more than a thousand people is banned.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.120]   So that pretty much, pardon me?
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.120]   There's seven thousand tickets.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.120]   But you see your enemy.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.720]   Any BSW is a hundred twenty.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.120]   WWC is five thousand.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.120]   Okay.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:51.000]   But it's so I think that means whether Apple announces or not, that means there's no
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   dub dub.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.120]   Well, they have, they've only announced this for a few weeks and, and dub dub is traditionally
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.120]   in June.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.760]   So the good news is Apple hasn't canceled anything yet because they never announced it.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.760]   There's nothing to cancel.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.760]   Right.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.760]   But that does, but that does put a lot of pressure on them.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.640]   The fact that all these other conferences, Google I/O is just one month before, actually
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.280]   just a few weeks before WWDC.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:17.040]   And so if Google is saying that out of a plurality, out of, out of an abundance of
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.180]   caution, we're canceling the lots of humans getting together and exchanging, exchanging
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:27.080]   handshakes part of it, what does Apple say that we think that in two and a half to three
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.600]   weeks is going to be better or we think that we can organ, we can organize and run it in
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.880]   a way that is not going to create a health problem.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.320]   But like, but just, just like Alex said, they haven't announced anything yet.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:43.360]   And also a lot of companies are instituting travel bans, especially the bigger ones.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.760]   Like you're just not allowed to travel.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.560]   They don't want to take on like the health.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.400]   Yes, they're worried about the health, but also the risk of anything happening to you
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.200]   and them being held liable is just a show stopper for them.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:58.640]   Apple is just the difficulty of getting, of moving people around whether, whether companies
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.040]   are doing travel bans or not.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.000]   Just how a lot of people are not going to.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.680]   I'm going to move through this quickly because otherwise it's going to be the coronavirus
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.680]   show.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.760]   And retail and hourly employees, unlimited sink leave, this is something every company
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.120]   in the country should do.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.800]   I know a lot can't afford to, but that's the right that Apple certainly can.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.320]   That's the right thing to do.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:22.400]   Hourly employees shouldn't feel like they have to come in and risk illness or if they're
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   ill come in.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.000]   And that's the real risk because they can't afford interest for Apple because they've
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.480]   been on this huge open concept design push for a decade.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.160]   Everything is open for them.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:38.360]   First, a coronavirus case with an Apple employee in Ireland on the Cork campus.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.720]   You reported that one on iMore.com with the headline, uh oh.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.920]   That's all Stephen.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.440]   Yeah, Stephen Warwick.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.440]   Well done.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.440]   Uh oh.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.640]   Does he get to write the thing above the headline?
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.640]   He does.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.640]   He's super talented.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.640]   He's pretty clever.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.880]   Stephen's amazing.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:02.120]   As far as coronavirus related apps, the problem, there's so many people jumping on
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:07.640]   this is a gold mine on Reddit and elsewhere with fake cures and so forth.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:14.000]   Facebook, uh Apple has is reportedly this from Business Insider rejecting any coronavirus
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.280]   related app rather than trying to figure out whether this is valid or not.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.280]   If it doesn't come from established health organisms.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.480]   Turns out that if you covered yourself in honey, people will stay away from you but not.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.640]   Is somebody actually saying that or is that you just made that up?
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.640]   I would be surprised, you know.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.400]   YouTube is demonetizing anything with coronavirus whether you say it or show the name so they
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.680]   want to de-emphasize that as well.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:41.200]   Uh, demand in China for iPhones cut in half down to 500,000 last month.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.200]   Right.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.000]   Well, wait two, a bunch of the Chinese vendors as well are reporting significant sales downs.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.200]   Uh, let's talk about the next, uh, iPhone.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.600]   There were, you know, was rumor Apple would make an announcement this month, uh, for the
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.000]   whatever it is, the iPhone nine, the SE two.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.400]   I think you have problems with production.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.200]   You also have problems with just going to China to meet with people.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.200]   Right.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.120]   So, uh, and also John Prosser was reporting that they don't want to launch an iPhone
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.560]   and have a bunch of people flood a store right now.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.360]   So they're happier to wait while the, hopefully the economy will warm up again, but also it
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.800]   will be safer for people to start going in buying again.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.200]   I have to say, go ahead.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.280]   I'm just saying, yeah, if, if there are, if, if the market is already down, why introduce
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.160]   a new phone if you have the option of delaying it for time when people are in the summer,
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.880]   people are going to be more apt to go out and spend a lot of that money that they have
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.800]   not been spending and lots of activities in the past three months.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.480]   So yeah, this is just smart.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:39.800]   The today at Apple sessions in the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle stores canceled.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:47.480]   Uh, they also produced capacity at store events, another way of reducing the risk of infection.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.080]   Uh, Apple had already pulled out of South by Southwest.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.880]   They've also canceled, uh, the premiers, the Apple TV premiers.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.200]   They were planning it South by Southwest.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.000]   Um, huge hit.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.520]   I have a lot of folks that I know that have, that do huge activations in South by Southwest
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.480]   and they're all that's right around trying to figure out how we're going to get the economic
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.040]   hit is kind of hard to over estimate.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.920]   You know, we're, we're seeing ad sales disappear for Q two, which is funny because that's the
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.640]   exact opposite thing you want to do.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.640]   This is the time to, everybody's going to be listening to a lot more podcasts.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.840]   You're like a convince them of that is what they call leaning back on your skis.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.840]   Lean back.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.840]   You know, yeah, start losing.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.840]   Well, the people do that though.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.400]   I've seen this in other academic downturns, although I remember 2008 after the crash, uh,
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.880]   that was the, that was when twit, uh, boomed.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.720]   Uh, because for some reason people started, uh, doing a lot of advertising, maybe they're
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.720]   trying to recover those loss sales.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.240]   We would, we doubled for years after that.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.280]   I mean, that, because everyone was trying to figure out how to live stream.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.280]   Which is what we're doing now.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.760]   Actually, this is really good for Oh nine.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.760]   Oh, right.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.760]   A lot of calls.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.520]   Uh, I'm sure most of those developer conferences will be live streamed at this point.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.280]   That's what Google's planning to do with IO.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.960]   Let's big opportunity for Microsoft and Google now, especially since they're wisely giving
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:07.360]   away their, their, their higher end, uh, video conferencing and live streaming, uh, tools
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.440]   for enterprise for free, at least through the summer.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.320]   Market has been bad for, I mean, another economic thing that doesn't hit everybody, but it
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.680]   does hit some people.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.920]   If you're an investor, uh, bad for a Corona virus, bad for Apple, a hundred billion dollars
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.640]   in value lost on Monday.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:30.200]   Uh, the stock market went down a record amount, 2000 points that down 8% slump.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   And that's a lot of value.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.200]   You've got to get the full money out.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:36.040]   If you're, if you can ride through it, it'll be good for you, but it's bad.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.680]   Well, and that's the sad thing.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.840]   I mean, I find myself, uh, starting to look at, oh, I gotta, you know, get some liquidity
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.760]   because, you know, money is going to be tight.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.600]   And this is exactly the worst time to try.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.200]   I would love to keep, let it, let it ride.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:56.140]   Um, Hanhai Fox con says, and I think this is disinformation, we're going to have our
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.240]   plants back to normal this month.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.160]   Uh, I think that's a lot like saying, oh, everything's, it's all better.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.160]   All done.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   Right.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.160]   Um, I'm bleeding.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.160]   I'm very boundly up and I'm alive.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.160]   I'm alive.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.160]   I'm alive.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.160]   Not dead yet.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.720]   Uh, all right.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.720]   That's the, uh, let's see.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.720]   Did I get it?
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.880]   One more thing coronavirus related.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.960]   And I didn't realize this last week I showed how to use a Clorox disinfecting wipe to clean
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:26.240]   your iPhone and said, you know, evidence is that, uh, some viruses can, including coronavirus,
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.720]   can last as long as nine days on a glass surface.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.440]   Uh, who knew, but your iPhone, any phone is going to be, you know, you're touching it
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.920]   all the time, a potential source of infection.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.920]   So disinfect it.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.000]   Little did I know that that actually was not recommended by Apple at the time because they
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   were afraid.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.040]   And they saw you and they were like, well, I said, well, Leo did it.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.280]   Because they were a feared that the only a phobic coding that resist fingerprints would
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.280]   be destroyed.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.120]   Uh, Apple has changed that.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:55.000]   They've added in fact by name Clorox wipes to the list of things you can do with your
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   phone.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Oh, bless Joanna Stern.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.160]   And then God bless Joanna Stern who took a carpal tunnel hit this week.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:06.040]   She took an iPhone eight brand new iPhone eight taped half of it off and then wiped the other
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.560]   half with disinfecting wipes 1,095 times.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.120]   She had a little clicker.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:18.800]   And uh, which she said, well, that's about once a day for three years.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.600]   No disruption of the only a phobic coding at all indistinguishable.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.360]   She said she can't say the same for the bathroom cleaner she used on it.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:31.200]   I don't know if she was joking or not, but that was the last time.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:36.920]   Yeah, but it's okay to use a Clorox wipe, a disinfecting wipe or Lysol wipe on your iPhone.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.600]   Apple says it's okay.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.200]   And probably a good idea.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.440]   I never even thought about this.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.440]   That's the goods.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.360]   The upside of this is we're learning a little bit more about hygiene.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.720]   Well, yeah, we'll be better.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:53.120]   The animals again, 20, 25 to 35 million flu deaths every single year just about just as
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.120]   a matter of course.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.480]   So hopefully this will cut that number down next year.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.480]   Next year.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.400]   Although if this is anything like the Spanish flu, it is going to come back with a vengeance
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.400]   in the fall.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   If it goes away this summer.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   No, next year can be more intense than this year.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.400]   Right.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.400]   And then I have no vaccines.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   No vaccine till 2021.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.400]   Okay, that's enough coronavirus.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.600]   Thank you for putting up with that.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.480]   I, you know, a number of people said, what is this?
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:22.080]   The coronavirus report, but it is impacting as it is everything else is impacting tech
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.480]   heavily.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.320]   And so an apple heavily.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.000]   So I thought we better better talk about it.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.120]   I think there are some people say, oh, it's just, I had a guy call the radio show.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.440]   It's all the media.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.440]   It's all overblown.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.800]   They're just sensationalistic headlines.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.400]   I said, Oh, okay.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.400]   Are you a physician?
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.280]   No, I'm a piano tuner.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.680]   I said, well, thank you for your input.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.200]   But 5G is going to kill you.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.200]   That's not a kill.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.080]   According to the piano tuners, it's nothing to worry about folks.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.560]   Okay.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.880]   We have my actually, there's a lot of news, including massive leaks.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.200]   I guess it's the beta of iOS 14 and people have been not, not the beta.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.200]   One of the internal builds.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.600]   Oh, it's not the official beta.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.740]   It's an internal bill leaked out.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.080]   Should we not do the story?
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.080]   No.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.680]   This is what, like, if it's what I think it is, an internal build leaks out it because if
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.520]   you're outside Apple, you can't actually load that on a device.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.480]   They're spelunking through the code to try to see what they can find.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.880]   We call it Steve Trotman.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.280]   They're talking about smithing these days.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.280]   I mean, fair, he's a trailblazer in reverse engineering.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.680]   It's what they're basically doing is reverse engineering and finding what features they
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.680]   can.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.680]   Look, he's a source.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.680]   Well, we'll talk about it.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.120]   I mean, we, you know, why not?
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:37.040]   We may not have this phone, but at least we can see what we're not getting in just a
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.040]   second.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:43.760]   Also a great Jean-Louis Gase piece on the arm Mac and how it might be more doable than
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:44.760]   we thought.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.760]   That's coming up in just a little bit on Mac break weekly.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.960]   First word from our sponsor, LastPass.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.920]   Just because you're stuck at home doesn't mean you don't need to have better hygiene
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.080]   with your passwords.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.080]   Password hygiene.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.520]   That's what we're talking about today.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.960]   If you're reusing passwords, uh-oh, problem, just think about it.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:09.920]   By the way, most people do, but the problem is if you reuse a password, if there's a breach,
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.920]   one of those sites that all of the sites have been compromised.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.240]   LastPass is the way to fix it.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.480]   A password vault that generates long, strong, unique passwords for every single place you
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.240]   visit, every app you use keeps track of them.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.120]   So you don't have to keep some safe encrypted on your device.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.120]   No one can see it.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.600]   Not even LastPass.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.440]   No one gets your master password.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:36.240]   And if you're in business, you know your employees don't have good hygiene.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.000]   You got to do it for them.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.200]   That's why we use LastPass Enterprise here at TwitMe.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.880]   In fact, give LastPass as a benefit of employee to every single employee because we want them
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.600]   to have that security.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.880]   Securing every access point in your business, you know that.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:55.960]   It's critical, but it's challenging for IT to improve security without having employees
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.640]   get upset or impacting productivity.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.840]   That's what LastPass does so well.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.800]   It gives you a great balance of strong security that's also easy for your employees to use
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   and manage.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.800]   And that's key.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   If it's not easy to use, they won't use it.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:13.120]   So you got to have something they like with LastPass employees benefit from a solution
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.800]   that's easy to use.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:19.080]   And yet your IT department maintains control over every login.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.360]   LastPass has a number of solutions for businesses.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.720]   LastPass identity that unifies password management.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.680]   Control sign-on is fantastic over 1,200 SSO apps.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.720]   By the way, with training for each of them so your employees can learn how to use them.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.320]   And then they love it because it's so easy.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.240]   It's easier than passwords.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.240]   And biometric multi-factor authentication.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:46.160]   I love that because it means it's not just the face ID or the touch ID or the dongle.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.200]   It's geolocation.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.840]   It's IP addresses a bunch of extra information that authenticates.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.520]   That person is the person.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:29:01.920]   They say they are adaptive authentication combines biometric and context to prove a user's identity.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:07.640]   No more passwords because you can use these biometrics and integrations in SSO to streamline
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.480]   access to applications without ever typing a single character.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.600]   That's honestly one of the best things you could do for security.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.520]   And with LastPass, you could secure every access point from web applications to workstations
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.320]   to VPN manage every access point in your business.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.640]   To deploy it instantly, you have absolute control.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.400]   You can set over 100 password policies.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.160]   We say password length.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.600]   We also require a second factor.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.080]   But that's at the organizational level.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.480]   And you can even have different requirements for different departments and different users.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.400]   LastPass is the gold standard.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.400]   In fact, they have world class third party security firms conducting routine audits all
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:50.280]   the time to verify that their service and their infrastructure is absolutely secure.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.280]   That's what you need.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:57.560]   After 10 years now of using LastPass, I just can't imagine operating without it.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.560]   It's first thing installing.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.800]   Personally, or in the company, being able to send someone access to a page but not send
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.440]   them the password and just put it in a folder where they can.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.440]   I love that.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.520]   They just get dots.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.520]   They just get dots.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.800]   And also with everything now, I don't try to think up a new password.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   I just go just give me a 20, 20 character hash with all the bells and whistles and special
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.920]   characters and numbers and everything else.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.240]   And then I just have to remember I have a lot of security around logging in.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.600]   That's good.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.400]   LastPass.com/twitstart.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.760]   Your journey today, find out how they can help you in your business.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.360]   I just put Linux on this Windows machine.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:38.360]   Of course, the first thing I installed, LastPass, it solves the whole thing.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.880]   Gets it all done.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.880]   LastPass.com/twit.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:47.240]   Okay, let's get some Apple news.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:51.640]   Should we talk about the developer?
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.440]   Because I think that there's a lot to say.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:58.080]   This is iOS 14.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.080]   Mouse support.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.080]   First-class mouse support.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.720]   We should just point out though that this is an iOS 14, basically an alpha, an internal
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.800]   build.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.000]   And this stuff may or may not be present when it actually goes into beta.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.320]   Yeah, I think the only lesson is this Apple's looking at it, they've coded it in, but it
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.440]   doesn't mean it'll come out in 14.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.880]   They may say after trying it, "Yeah, this isn't good."
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.880]   It may never come out.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:20.880]   And we don't want it to.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.720]   Like if it's buggy, please don't do that this year.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.720]   Right.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.840]   But it does show you what Apple's thinking about.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:30.480]   We had seen a rumor that there'd be new smart keyboards with track pads.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.880]   That apparently is validated in the code.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:38.640]   And mouse cursor support is first-class is moved out of accessibility.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.520]   So I don't know if I like that.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.720]   I don't know if I want a mouse on my iPad.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.720]   Oh, that's huge.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.720]   That's on your Mac.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.720]   Exactly.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:52.640]   If you're going to justify $1,000 for an iPad Pro, and for a lot of, I was able to justify
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.960]   $1,000 for an iPad Pro as is, you really are going to have to beef up.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:02.080]   You really have to make it functionally and convenience-wise competitive with any notebook
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.000]   you can buy for $500 or $600.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.400]   And the ability to navigate between apps, the ability to take advantage of having multiple
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:14.600]   apps open at the same time, just by simply moving your focus from one place to another
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.760]   and also moving data from one place to another.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.800]   The absence of a trackpad is just absolutely huge.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:25.960]   And if Apple decides to do it in a way that's not just, "Hey, this is an accessibility feature
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:31.240]   that we decided to just cut copy and paste it into the main UI," if they do it better
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.920]   than that, that is going to be a huge, huge move forward for the iPad.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:44.080]   And also, dare I say it, a step forward for iOS's ability to one day supplant the Mac as
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.080]   a consumer desktop offerings.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.240]   I mean, they can't do that until you have a pointer.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.240]   That's for sure.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.240]   I mean, they'll understand-
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:55.560]   They'll always be pro, but in terms of people who are coming in to spend $1,000 to $1,500
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:00.560]   for a Mac or for a computer, this is what will allow Apple two or three or four years from
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.400]   now to say, "Hey, well, we do have a MacBook Pro, but those are mostly for people who are
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.920]   doing 4K and 8K and 16K editing, but maybe you should just take a look at this iPad instead."
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.920]   Go ahead.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.920]   Go ahead.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.920]   Go ahead, Renee, and then you-
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.920]   Oh, no, I was just going to say my understanding is that this started off sincerely as an accessibility
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.840]   feature where they had people who just had trouble using the multi-touch and they have
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.320]   access to mouse and trackpad.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.640]   So they enabled it as part of a system of touch, almost like an addition to the switch
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.800]   system.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.600]   And they didn't even announce it at the keynote.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.560]   Like it wasn't one of the features that Craig Federighi went over when he announced iPad
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.560]   OS.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:39.760]   It was really meant- it came from the accessibility team, was meant to the accessibility feature,
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.000]   but the idea of this is also living in the main OS team.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.400]   And this is a different implementation than the one that's baked into accessibility.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.560]   And it's meant to be a first-class citizen.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.720]   And the thinking is sort of like, you know, Steve Jobs wouldn't allow arrow keys on the
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:56.560]   original Mac because he wanted- he didn't want people to just use arrow keys and never
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.840]   learn the mouse.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.040]   And they didn't want to have a mouse or a trackpad on the original iPad.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.800]   And that's fine as long as it's a tablet.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:07.360]   But once you make a keyboard and once you can dock it into that keyboard, you have to
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.760]   provide- you have to make that experience absolutely first-class.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.040]   And this sounds like it does that.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.400]   Like the mouse pointer appears when you use the trackpad.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.960]   It does appear when you're not using it.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.960]   It doesn't get in your way, but it lets you do pretty much what you need to do with the
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.960]   trackpad.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:23.160]   And if they can nail that, I think you- you don't get the toaster fridge, which is going
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:26.200]   to come back and bite them in the butt, but you get the best of both worlds.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:27.200]   Tap to click.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.960]   Tap with two fingers to right-click.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.960]   Love that.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:34.160]   Yeah, I mean, I think that the issue is for a lot of the precision stuff that I do, I
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.200]   still find that's why I go back to the computer.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:43.360]   And it would eliminate- there's probably 30% of my work that still requires an iMac or
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.800]   a MacBook or something for me to do it.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.280]   And half of that- I mean, I can't say that I would be completely done, but the last bits
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.640]   would be just apps that aren't running on the iPad.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:57.400]   You know, a truly fully functional Photoshop and a truly, you know, those types of things,
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.840]   final cut and, you know, motion and those types of things.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:06.280]   So, so I think that that mouse is key to making that work.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.280]   You agree, Laurie?
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.280]   You're a mouse?
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:13.680]   Yeah, and there's also- I actually- yeah, I actually do use the bridge keyboard with
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.280]   trackpad all the time on my MacBook Pro right now.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.280]   I have one.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.280]   I have one.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.680]   You got an early release because they announced that because of coronavirus, they're not
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.120]   going to be able to get those out.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.840]   I have a pre-release build that sent me through.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:28.840]   You like it?
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.840]   It works well?
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.080]   I love using it.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.080]   It's very clunky.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.080]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.480]   Because of the- because of the target, the bullseye target and the end it disappears and
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.480]   all that weird.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.000]   Because that's the old way of doing it or the current way.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Exactly.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.360]   But I use it and I love it because I- if I'm using a keyboard, just like Renee is talking
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.960]   about, if I'm using a keyboard, it's natural for me to want to use a trackpad or a mouse
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:56.360]   to click and do all that kind of stuff and not having to reach my hand to the screen
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.600]   to do that stuff has been really pleasant for me.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.880]   So I do think that's a great idea.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:08.480]   And I also think in addition to just being better for the pros using an iPad, it's also-
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:13.920]   you got to consider- Apple's kind of original idea with the iPad was this idea of getting
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:20.200]   rid of computers and how we're moving out of desktop and into laptops and mobility and
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   things like that.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:28.600]   And here's a way for somebody to get into the Apple environment in a computer-ish way
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.200]   without needing to buy a full computer.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.920]   So you don't have to spend $1,000 on an iPad.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:40.760]   You can spend $399 on an iPad mini and also get to use a trackpad or mouse.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:49.320]   So you're combining the comfort that people have of using a mouse or trackpad with a tablet
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:56.200]   and also allowing people to enter the Apple ecosystem at a much less expensive rate by
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.520]   giving them a little bit of both, a little bit of the computer that you're familiar
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.280]   with, a little bit of the tablet and Apple world that you're getting into.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.400]   Hey, the Master's got a good idea.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:11.400]   What about a dual boot tablet that can be macOS and iOS?
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.400]   Well, that'd be amazing.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.760]   It was a great comment on the 9-5 article when they published it.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.240]   The guy is like, "You know what?
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:23.280]   I don't care, but I hope all your traditional nerds are super happy about it."
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.320]   Yeah, I feel like...
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:28.800]   So Apple's been very clear that they're never going to put touch on macOS.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.280]   And I feel like they don't have the same sense of purity on iOS.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.040]   They say that, but it's really a resource problem.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.320]   Again, Microsoft, it took them three years ago.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.520]   So you're saying they would if they could.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:44.160]   Well, so Microsoft did not have a successful touch OS, so they had to take their engineers
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.840]   and say, "We're going to graph touch onto Windows."
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.480]   Apple has a super successful touch-based operating system.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:53.160]   And it's hard to justify spending three years taking their non-touch operating system and
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.560]   making it touch when they feel like they could just spend those three years making iPad
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.800]   OS good enough that you won't ask for it on the Mac.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   It depends.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.960]   No particular order here I'm just going to run through because there's like a hundred
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.960]   things in this.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.400]   It's not just source code.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.400]   There's also icons.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.200]   There's icons in here for over-the-ear headphones.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.160]   Lori's so happy.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:23.640]   Those are presumably noise canceling kind of a side companion to the AirPod Pros.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.000]   I'm going to get them in black and white.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.240]   What are they going to call them?
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.240]   Studio Pods.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.240]   Well, they're beats, right?
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.040]   I mean, nearly all it is is really.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.040]   Oh, I think they're Apple-branded.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.280]   No, no, no, no.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:38.840]   I would argue that they're not going to just make a copy of beats and put an Apple logo
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.840]   on it.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.200]   They're going to do something different.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.880]   Otherwise, why would they do it at all?
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.240]   So I don't know what it's going to look like or feel like or sound like, but I'm thinking
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:49.680]   it's not going to be anything like beats at all.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.320]   It'll be a completely different headphone experience.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:58.000]   I agree that 100% because one of the things that really justifies the idea of Apple doing
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.960]   a really premium $300 or $400 over the year, no noise canceling headphones, is Sony's
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.960]   success.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:08.840]   They kind of, they don't necessarily own this market, but boy, the aspirational brand
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:14.200]   for, I mean, I'm in an open plan office, but I want everybody to know that if we had
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.880]   individual offices, I would have a corner office because look at these Sony headphones
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.880]   I have.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.080]   And those cost 350 different bucks, right?
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:27.320]   And I don't think that anybody, it was hard to get people who are not into both, excuse
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:33.440]   me, who are not into beats as a brand to say, I'm going to spend $400 on a pair of really,
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:37.200]   really exclusive makes, not only does it sound great, but it's going to make me feel good
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.200]   headphones.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.200]   And I think that's a really good thing.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   I think that's a really good thing.

[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.200]   I think that's a really good thing.

[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.200]   The sheepled rule, as our chair says.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.200]   The only thing I'd say is this comes back to our agreement.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:39.200]   Apple should be building their own Wi-Fi routers is because they have all the stuff that all
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.200]   these things are connected to.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.200]   They've externalized this capability of how you connect them all.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.200]   It just seems crazy.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:51.200]   There's a codec from AppTix now called HD.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.200]   AppTix HD is 20.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.200]   They claim 24-bit.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.200]   They have AppTix HD.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:01.200]   They have AppTix low latency for using with audio and video.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.200]   A lot of these can be done just by pushing out firmware updates.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:11.200]   The Sony Walkman that I recommended a few weeks ago, the previous model of it.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.200]   I thought that the reason why you'd want this new version,
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.200]   said the old version, was that, "Hey, the new version has this new version of AppTix on it."
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:21.200]   The old version, however, just got a firmware update to get the new version of AppTix HD.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.200]   There's a lot of wiggle in there.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.200]   Oh, no play or be happy.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:29.200]   Nothing's going to make Neil happy.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.200]   Nothing's going to make Neil happy.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.200]   That's not even live music.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:38.200]   Unless you can have a lake with a boat in the middle, a speaker on one side.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.200]   The barn.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.200]   The speaker on the other side.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.200]   You're not going to, Neil's not going to hear that.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:47.200]   New iPad Pro will include, according to who this is again,
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:55.200]   9-5 Max Analysis of iOS 14 leak.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:00.200]   Triple lens camera, triple lens camera, and time of flight sensor.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:05.200]   So you have a 3D sensor, a wide angle lens, an ultra wide lens, a telephoto lens,
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:10.200]   big update, still one generation behind the iPhone.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:14.200]   But a time of flight means it would be ahead.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.200]   Yeah, because this iPhone doesn't have time of flight.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.200]   Oh, that's right.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.200]   That's right.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.200]   And of course, that's going to be great for AR.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.200]   AR, that's what that is, right?
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:24.200]   And iPad is a good, it would be an interesting AR tool.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.200]   The only thing is you have to hold it.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.200]   But it's got that nice screen.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.200]   Big viewfinder, Leo.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.200]   It's such a big viewfinder.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:33.200]   And I'm not sure I really want to encourage people to be taking pictures with their iPad.
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.200]   But since they're doing it, at least give them a good camera.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   What if they throw a blanket over their head like an old-time UIV camera?
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.200]   Is that okay then?
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.200]   Is that socially acceptable?
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:45.200]   Magnesium.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.200]   They're supporting hardware digital flashes.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.200]   So maybe a digital magnesium flash?
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.200]   But no, but the ability.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:59.200]   But that's a really big deal, especially as the iPad Pro is being used a lot for illustrators.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.200]   The ability to take a picture and then work on it with your stylus,
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:07.200]   either just simply by editing Rob or by simply using that as the basis of a fake watercolor.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.200]   Good.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.200]   There's a lot of potential there that hasn't been used yet.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.200]   Just please, folks.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.200]   Don't take your iPad Pro to concerts.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:21.200]   And if you look at what Tilt 5 is doing, where they have gameplay that is being driven by AR,
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:26.200]   you can see there's a lot of possibilities with an iPad mounted somewhere looking over a table
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   and having nothing on the table but everyone playing a game.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   I think they should make a round steering wheel shaped iPad.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.200]   It'll be amazing.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.200]   Just put a mount in it.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.200]   You just mount it.
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.200]   There's a little square opening.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.200]   You just go, "If they weren't going to make a watch with a round screen, I don't think
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.200]   there are any chances they're going to make a iPad with a round screen."
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.200]   Okay, you get one of those Nintendo attachments, right, that goes around.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.200]   The Apple Porthole.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.200]   The Apple Porthole.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.200]   iPhone 9.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:59.200]   Well, again, not the name 9, but whatever that next iPhone.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:03.200]   There is some code there that implies it'll support Touch ID.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:08.200]   And Micah Sargent had explained this to me earlier on iOS today.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:11.700]   Express Transit capabilities.
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:14.200]   What is Express Transit Renee?
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:19.200]   That's when you use it at, for example, like the metro station or the bus station or the
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.200]   train station, they don't want you to have to hold up the line as you're going through
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   by like Face IDing it or Touch IDing it.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.700]   So you can turn on a setting.
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:30.200]   It's not enabled by default, but you can turn on a setting and then as you walk by, it just
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.200]   pings the device and charges you.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:37.200]   Oh, so you may have to pull out your phone and just, oh, that's great.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.200]   Is that Bluetooth?
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.200]   It must be Bluetooth LE.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.200]   It's NFC.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.200]   I think it's Bluetooth LE.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.200]   Yeah, it has to be closer.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.200]   It has to be closer.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   Oh, or FRF ID.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.200]   It has to be Bluetooth LE, I think.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.200]   Now, your watch, you can use your watch for those too, right?
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.200]   Yes.
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.200]   Okay.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.200]   But this would be even better.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.200]   You don't have to pull anything out.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:00.200]   I see you get to a point at like Whole Foods where they just go, so we charge you?
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.200]   So I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:09.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:33.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:48.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:06.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:15.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:57.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.200]   I see you get to a point at the end of the day.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:19.200]   Is this an encrypted system or is this an unencrypted system?
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:25.200]   Apple, we knew from iOS 13 was planning to release a new Apple TV box.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:30.200]   Now we know from iOS 14 there will also be a new Apple TV remote.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:35.200]   What if it turns out that I hate the new Apple TV remote?
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.200]   Then you're screwed.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.200]   I got it in my ear.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.200]   I got it in my ear as well.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.200]   Everyone hates it.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.200]   No one likes the current Apple TV remote.
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.200]   I like it.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.200]   I'm the only person in the world that likes the Apple TV remote.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.200]   What is it you don't like about it?
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.200]   It's a tiny little trackpad.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.200]   How great is that?
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.200]   That's really cool.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:50:00.200]   What it means is you're constantly changing things with that.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   It's so easy to lose that I put it in this pocket, which means my front shirt pocket, which means
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.200]   that the channel is changing randomly.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.200]   The thing scrolling randomly.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   Inside that they just didn't put a little buzzer or beep or something.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   So that I can say I can find my remote and it just beeps.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.200]   I'm here!
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.200]   It could do all that.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.200]   It just needs a speaker.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.200]   All that needs.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.200]   I know.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:37.200]   Or at least put some sort of a divot on one end of it so that you can by feel know what end of it you're holding on to.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:41.200]   That's why they put that menu circle.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:45.200]   The problem is you're feeling for the mat and you just change the channel.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.200]   I can tell if you like it Laurie.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:54.200]   There's something wrong with the Apple TV that I can't get the Apple TV to do.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:59.200]   Well, would you agree there's room for improvement?
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:04.200]   I would say if they never changed the Apple TV remote I would be perfectly happy with it.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:09.200]   You're the only one.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.200]   It's like Lisa.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:14.200]   My wife says she loves the MacBook keyboard.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.200]   You know the little thing.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.200]   I said, "Lisa, doesn't that hurt you? The finger?
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.200]   She doesn't love it."
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.200]   She's not writing.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.200]   No.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.200]   Lisa had Carpal tunnel at one point.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.200]   She uses a keyboard so much.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.200]   No.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.200]   I just want one bottom centered button so I know which end is up.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.200]   It's all there.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.200]   It's how the home button be the bottom where the normal home button and the iPhone goes.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.200]   I'm not going to go to the middle.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.200]   I'll never confuse which way is up again.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.200]   I'll be happy.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.200]   As long as they keep the remote app on the phone and the watch I'm happy.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.200]   I don't have to use that silly or anything.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.200]   No, but the thing that I dislike is if you don't have the remote you can't use your Apple TV.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:50.200]   But I can use my home pod by just saying, "Yo Jimbo, turn on Avengers Endgame on my Apple TV."
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:53.200]   And it does it, but the Apple TV won't listen to me.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.200]   I have to tell the whole, it's like it's not talking to me.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.200]   It's shutting me.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.200]   I have to tell the home pod to talk to the Apple TV.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.200]   And then the Apple TV talks to the home pod which in response to me.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   Talk to the pod.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.200]   It's like an abusive relationship.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.200]   I will not deal with you.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.200]   Talk to the pod.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:11.200]   Also these air tag trackers which have been rumored for a long time.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:17.200]   There's code in there including the marketing name air tags.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:21.200]   And you'll be able to set them up in bulk through iOS.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.200]   Oh, most important.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:26.200]   There'll be a user replaceable battery.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.200]   Hallelujah.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.200]   That would have been a non-starter.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.200]   Apple would have had a hard time.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:37.200]   I'm not talking about the money of when the Styes, you're going to have to buy a new one.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   But basically saying, "Hey, we're happy to have a tag that has to be thrown away."
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:45.200]   And putting all this stuff into a landfill as opposed to this little button cell that
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:50.200]   lasts three days before the apocalypse is how long one of these batteries last.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.200]   Well, they were chargeable.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.200]   When they made those rechargeable batteries for the Malice for like 10 minutes.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.200]   You can put rechargeable and Apple rechargeable batteries in your Malice or trackpad.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:02.200]   Then we just let me put a little tiny battery in there, but then we stick it on top of my wireless charging pad.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.200]   That is one thing I have to say.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.200]   The series remote does right.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:10.200]   The one thing the series remote does right is it has a little lightning connector on it.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.200]   And it lasts for a long time after you've got it.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:20.200]   HomeKit and iOS 14 will recognize your face, adjust lighting based on the time of day,
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.200]   and more.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:26.200]   How is it going to recognize your face through the phone, I guess?
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:34.200]   This is the homeKit secure video, which means the cameras will be able to recognize people
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.200]   based on their parents.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.200]   They say it will be kept on device.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:43.200]   Apple is notorious about being careful not to send your face recognition stuff to the home office.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:48.200]   And there'll be a night shift for the lights, which is, I guess, good.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.200]   A lot of us do that anyway.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.200]   The night was out already.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.200]   That's clever.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:57.200]   All right.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:01.200]   Owners of Apple TV, set top box will be able to configure an audio output that will be used
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.200]   by default.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.200]   Yes.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.200]   Thank goodness.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.200]   So you could say your homepot will be the...
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.200]   Because previously, you could set it up, but if anything else went to the homepot, it destroyed
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.200]   it and you just set it all up again.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:14.200]   That's why you could say, "I want to dedicate this homepot to my TV."
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.200]   Nice.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:22.200]   And Micah thought that maybe Apple would do a solid and put out a sound bar.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.200]   Please, yes, please.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.200]   An atmos and atmos on bar.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.200]   Yeah, because the homepot, it sounds good, but it's not the right shape for it.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:32.200]   And it doesn't have top facing speakers, which limits its...
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.200]   No atmos.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.200]   The positional audio.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.200]   No atmos.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.200]   Oh my God.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:39.200]   I'm only about halfway through this.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:43.200]   IOS 14.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.200]   Full of press though.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.200]   Code reveals the new Apple Watch.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:51.200]   Apple Watch will have a blood oxygen detector.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:55.200]   Yeah, I think that's about time for that one.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.200]   Because it could do that before.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.200]   I mean, it probably could do that because if it can see your pulse, it probably could
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:01.200]   tell.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.200]   I don't know.
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.200]   And it will also have a tachometer.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:12.200]   The new Watch Face Infograph Pro will have a tachometer, which means...
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.200]   It's a old school.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.200]   Yeah, it's very old school.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:18.200]   It means if you're an airline pilot, you can calculate how much fuel you'll need.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.200]   Like something.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.200]   I don't know.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:24.200]   Here's a tachometer on a Bowman-Melsier watch.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.200]   A color to Bowman-Melsier.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:29.200]   What you do is you...
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.200]   I've never understood these tachometers.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.200]   They're just to me...
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.200]   It measures how tachy something is...
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.200]   That's an ornament.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.200]   I have a hard time understanding how they would put that on the watch.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.200]   Yeah, really.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.200]   This is a physical dial at least.
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:47.200]   Well, it would be maybe like the way the compass app is.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:52.200]   Or at least maybe the way the compass app used to be before they made it so much more digital.
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.200]   Silly.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.200]   Silly, silly.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:57.200]   Well, it's a style thing, probably.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:03.200]   I mean, if you're an airline pilot calculating the necessary fuel on your tachometer, please
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.200]   stop.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:09.200]   I've talked to pilots who say they did use it for that, or that was the intent or something
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.200]   like that.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:14.200]   Siri Voices, customizable by developers.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:17.200]   A pity to food that want me to turn off your lights.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:22.200]   I was sad to learn that they did not have an eternal contract with John Legend on the Google
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.200]   voice.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.200]   John Legend will be leaving in a week.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:27.200]   I just want sweet a chef.
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.200]   It's a bird.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:29.200]   It's a bird.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.200]   It's a bird.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.200]   It's a bird.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.200]   It's a bird.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.200]   It's a bird.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.200]   It's a bird.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.200]   I just want...
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:36.200]   It might as well be...
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:37.200]   It might as well be.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.200]   Let me see what I found on the web about that.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.200]   No, it doesn't even say...
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.200]   Sorry for the means...
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.200]   If it says...
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:45.200]   Customize it both by developer.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:51.200]   Does that mean that Siri, the native Siri in the system, is going to be what we already
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:56.200]   have, but then if an app is using Siri...
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:01.200]   Developers can add voice synthesis to their own apps.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.200]   So I am using an honor of Renee Richie.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:07.200]   I'm using, I'm Siri right now, the South African voice.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.200]   It's great.
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:13.200]   It's great.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:17.200]   I go between the Irish because of Tony Stark and Friday and the South African one because
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.200]   my parents find it endlessly amusing.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:23.200]   To me, it doesn't sound like South African that much.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:27.200]   If it sounds way, way better than it does on the Apple ifin.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:32.200]   I have no idea what he just said.
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:36.200]   So you could in theory have an app that had its own voice, but it would be for the app.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:39.200]   Yeah, it wouldn't change Siri in general.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.200]   It would just be for the app.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:45.200]   Voice provider is the developer from framework.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:49.200]   I talked to Tom Tom a long time ago and they were making Homer Simpson and James Earl Jones'
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:53.200]   acts and they just kept saying, "In England everybody just wants the male British voice
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:57.200]   and in America everybody just wants the female British voice and that's the only ones that really move."
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:00.200]   That makes sense, actually.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:03.200]   That's my favorite voice, the female British voice.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:07.200]   I would be changing voices all the time just for fun, just have something different to listen to.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.200]   Oh, actually, I thought I had the South African.
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.200]   I have the Indian voice on here.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.200]   Your virtual assistant.
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:13.200]   I love it.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.200]   I'm Siri.
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:15.200]   Your virtual assistant.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.200]   That's British.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.200]   I'm Siri.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:18.200]   Your virtual assistant.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:22.200]   And I like that because I feel like there's the South African.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:24.200]   I forgot I had the Indian.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.200]   I wonder if it didn't sound South African.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:28.200]   I mean, I can't turn on the lights for you now.
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:30.200]   I'd be better to take the win.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:32.200]   I love it when you do that accent.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:38.200]   For those who don't know, Renee was born and raised like Elon Musk in South Africa.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:42.200]   I spoke that way until it was in great school, I guess.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:49.200]   Major accessibility features, Alipay, Apple Pay, wallpaper app, integration and more.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:52.200]   I don't even know.
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.200]   Read the articles at 9-5 Mac.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:57.200]   Oh, I forgot to mention, oh, I did.
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.200]   I talked about the blood oxygen detection feature.
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:05.200]   That's in an iPhone 14 code snippet.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.200]   Oh, yeah, kids mode where parents can lock it down.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.200]   That's cool.
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.200]   And also set it up based on their iPhone.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:16.200]   So if the kids don't have an iPhone, but they want them to have an Apple watch, they can set up a child watch on their iPhone.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.200]   I think that's a really good thing.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:21.200]   School mode is another really, really big thing.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:24.200]   It would be great for an extent to iPhones as well.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:29.200]   The ability to say during classroom hours, I'm going to limit you to just receiving emergency texts from your mom or your dad.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:31.200]   You can't use it for text messaging.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.200]   You can't use it for other things.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.200]   So this was the one that I thought was most surprising.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:40.200]   Apple doesn't really change the user interface on iPhone very often.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:43.200]   Springboard hasn't--the last update was folders, I think.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:47.200]   Apparently, they're looking at a list mode.
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:53.200]   So you'll be able, instead of seeing the icons on the front of the phone, you'll see a list view.
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:58.200]   It'll include a list of all application icons making it easier for users to see all their apps at once.
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.200]   Several different sorting options.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:07.200]   You'll be able to filter applications that currently have unread notifications, for example, recently used.
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.200]   Smart Suggestions powered by Siri.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:16.200]   The list views, they did that on the Apple watch because nobody could figure out carousel, so they gave you the ability to toggle it into.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:19.200]   Oh, so yeah, we already do have that on the Apple watch.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.200]   In fact, I use that because the carousel is like the worst user interface.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.200]   It's like a random app generator.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.200]   It's like, what the hell is this dot cloud?
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.200]   So you're thinking it'll be kind of like on my Apple watch.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:37.200]   Yeah, but with the ability to change the sort of order in much better ways that also take better advantage of the larger screen.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.200]   Yeah, I think that's the hardest part with the watch.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.200]   You're like, I realize the way I use the watch, I don't really care what apps are on it.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.200]   It's like, I don't look for them.
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.200]   They appear when I need them and I don't ever really--
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.200]   You know, never interacting like, where is that app?
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.200]   It just pops up when I'm using it.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.200]   I think a lot of people are like that.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.200]   I mean, I don't think it's function based, not app based.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:19.200]   I feel like if you go to-- no matter what your smart watch is, if you go to the smart watch to launch an app and solve a problem, that's probably a problem with the design of the watch because it really shouldn't-- unless you're starting a counter, unless you're starting a fitness thing, it really should not be a place where you focus your attention for more than five seconds.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:30.200]   Also in the iOS 14 leak, a new augmented reality app, code named GoB.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:38.200]   This claims the app-- the report-- actually, I should go to the 9 to 5, give them the-- because they're the ones that did all this work.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:46.200]   GoB will allow users to get more information about the world around them by using a QR code like system.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:53.200]   So you could-- I don't know what-- you could read a QR code and then see more.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.200]   You see that all the time.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:00.200]   There's T-shirts where it shows the anatomy of the body or a dinosaur in motion and stuff like that.
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:03.200]   So that's not new to augmented reality.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:09.200]   There's some sort of phony coding in there that lets you signal it.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:13.200]   Is there anything-- oh, sleep app in the new Apple Watch.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.200]   Finally.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.200]   Anything I missed?
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.200]   And a new fitness app.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.200]   New fitness app?
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.200]   I didn't see that one.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.200]   Okay, new fitness app.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.200]   Let's see.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.200]   This is--
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.200]   And pencil support.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.200]   Seymour.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.200]   The new fitness app is called Seymour.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:40.200]   And those are some of the exercises you'll be able to do, including rolling a log up a hill,
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.200]   crushing grapes.
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.200]   We're going to find out how litigious Peloton really is.
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.200]   Are these the-- oh, yeah, that is a Peloton, isn't it?
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.200]   And then doing ballet.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.200]   Dancing.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.200]   Yeah, dancing.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.200]   So one that had me super excited to do is the ability--
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.200]   Mosh Pit.
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.200]   That's the Mosh Pit.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.200]   There's a Mosh Pit.
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.200]   That's clearly difficult.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.200]   It's probably the Mosh Pit.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:05.200]   You know, the thing that I have.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:09.200]   I think that the-- I'm surprised that we haven't seen faster integration.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.200]   There's a lot of people experimenting with it, but fast integration between the phone or the watch
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.200]   and exercise equipment where it goes.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.200]   It keeps track of everything.
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.200]   It keeps track of your reps, your weights.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.200]   Gym kit.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.200]   And it's not-- we've been talking about that for-- a lot of us have been talking about.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.200]   There are apps that do that.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.200]   But the problem is we haven't--
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.200]   Well, they have gym kit where they haven't been adopted.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.200]   The gym equipment has to do it.
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:31.200]   There's apps that do it.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.200]   Oh.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.200]   What you want is you want-- I want to walk up and not know anything.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:40.200]   So once we get to a point where your watch or your phone, most preferable to your watch,
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:46.200]   is totally tied into the exercise equipment, it means that it can change my workout.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:48.200]   It can change what kind of workout I'm doing.
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.200]   It says, "Do you know how to do this exercise?"
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.200]   And if you don't, it shows you a little video.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:55.200]   And then it keeps track of what weights you set it to and it keeps track of how many reps.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.200]   So it makes the calculation of what the weights--
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.200]   They have the beginnings of that because they have gym kit, but just almost no equipment
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.200]   integrate.
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.200]   Exactly.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.200]   I'm just surprised.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:09.200]   When a high end gym starts doing that, it's going to be a big deal because you're going
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.200]   to have a much better workout.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.200]   I love that.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.200]   Because a lot of us don't rotate enough.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.200]   We don't rotate our exercises enough enough.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.200]   No, I love that muscle confusion.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:19.200]   The reason a gym might be slow to do that is because they make a lot of money on trainers
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.200]   who do that for you.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.200]   And so--
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.200]   I would invest in a home version of that though if--
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.200]   Both flexes.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.200]   If gym kit came to the home--
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.200]   Oh, then the--
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:38.200]   The extra few hundred dollars to have that equipment that supports gym kit which also connects
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.200]   to my phone and lets me track that stuff on my activity app.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:46.200]   I think that would be really smart to make it more not just in the gym but in your house.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:50.200]   Yeah, both flexes has a hit version of that and they have dumbbells that kind of talk back
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:53.200]   to your phone, but it's not a complete solution.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:57.200]   And they have the right machinery, so like the revolution which is what I have at home.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:01.200]   That's the one where you change the weight by twisting a knob.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:05.200]   You have these little weights but they're just springs that you add to it.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:09.200]   But the mechanism would be really easy for them to automate like that.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.200]   And they have a Swedish chef voice and it just--
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.200]   It's hard to read.
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:18.200]   But yeah, so I think that the issue is I think you'd have in a gym like that they may not make
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.200]   more money on the trainers but what they would make money on is that you would never leave.
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.200]   Like until other gyms had it, like if you're a high-end gym--
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.200]   No, it's a good way to win.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.200]   You would be totally locked in.
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:31.200]   No one would ever go back to a gym that it would feel like you're going back to cave world.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.200]   I think that's the trend actually.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:39.200]   If you look at SoulCycle and Pillowton and these other smart and able devices that this is the trend.
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:44.200]   And it's so much that it can-- because the thing is your watch knows what your heart rate is.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.200]   It knows all these things about it.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.200]   It knows what you did last night and yesterday and all these things.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:55.200]   So it could really create a really tight tie to how people get in shape.
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.200]   On top of everything else, you trust that.
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:00.200]   You've already decided to trust Apple with that data.
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:04.200]   So the last thing you want to do is, hey, I've just signed up for this fly-by-night gym.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:08.200]   And yes, I'm going to make sure it has access to every single piece of health data that I have.
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.200]   Right.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.200]   And yeah, no, no, no.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:16.200]   Renee, how many people have blank screen issues on iPad Airs?
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.200]   I see that Apple.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:21.200]   Before we go on, Leo, can we just-- because the one thing that I'm really excited about is Apple Pencil
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.200]   as a first class that is--
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.200]   Oh, yes.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:27.200]   So any text field, you can just write into it and it will turn-- it is so newton.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.200]   I love it.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.200]   I want it now, but I will wait until June.
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.200]   You know what I want is--
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:34.200]   So you will recognize your handwriting and it text field and convert it.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:37.200]   If you use your pencil, it sucks to have to put it down.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:41.200]   Putting out the virtual keyboard, lose half the screen, start typing, put it away, pick your pencil up again.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.200]   Just let me write.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.200]   But people have such bad handwriting.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.200]   I don't know.
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.200]   That's a challenge.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.200]   So minding, we'll bring it back.
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.200]   It's like virtual assistants required us to relearn diction.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.200]   This is going to require us to relearn--
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:55.200]   I just want to write-- if you're going to have the machine learning models, learn how to read
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:59.200]   Dr. Sandrod, and you've got to start the training sooner we'll throw it out later.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.200]   I just want to be able to write over my text and notes.
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.200]   That would be-- that would be happy, you know?
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.200]   Because right now, anything you do with your pencil has to live in its own space.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.200]   Yes.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.200]   And the text lives in its own space.
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.200]   And I'm like, I want to type that--
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.200]   You can't annotate a text.
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:15.200]   You can't draw over text or around it.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.200]   So that's terrible.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.200]   You can't proofread.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.200]   Well, you can't proofread.
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:21.200]   And also, if you're just thinking about stuff, you might text up and then draw a little things
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.200]   down the side, and you can't do both of those things at the same time, and it's really
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.200]   annoying.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.200]   Oh, that would be nice.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.200]   So that's also potentially--
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.200]   No, I have no idea.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.200]   That's just--
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:35.200]   And by the way, a tip of the hat to Karsten, because all of this came in this morning while
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.200]   I was doing IOS today, so he had a scramble to add all of this stuff to work.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:44.200]   And literally added 20 stories to the rundown in about five minutes right before the shoot.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.200]   There's one.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.200]   There's one.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.200]   There's one.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.200]   Well done.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:52.200]   Imagine how hard these newswriters had to work to get all these news articles written.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.200]   I know.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.200]   I know.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.200]   The code I was intent.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.200]   I think we just take focus on Karsten.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.200]   Those people should get a raise, shouldn't they, Lori?
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.200]   Yeah.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.200]   Well, Ben Mayo should get a raise.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.200]   Hard work.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.200]   Yeah, Ben-- so, well, I don't-- I was going to say no.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.800]   I don't want to talk about it.
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:11.900]   We don't want to get Ben in trouble.
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:16.000]   I thought your article on this was kind of interesting in "I'm More."
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.200]   Apple has changed its review guidelines.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.000]   Actually, it's Oliver Haslam.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.040]   So Apple has for a while used notifications as basically as ads, but nobody else has been
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.040]   allowed to do that.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.040]   Now they're saying you can.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.040]   Ads could--
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.040]   People have done it.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.320]   It wasn't allowed to be done, but people have done it.
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:40.640]   Apple had a huge internal argument about it where one team is like, no, it's a bad experience.
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.000]   Another team is, can we please make you money?
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.320]   And literally, depending on who was where, at what time, they would get away with it or
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:48.200]   not, which is not ideal.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:54.080]   So in a way, this is making it better because now the app has to ask permission.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:57.680]   And so if you don't say yes, you won't get it.
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.520]   And so that's a good way to split this.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.360]   And in fact, it really-- it's a better way than just banning it out.
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:03.360]   I have to-- I really like--
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.360]   There's actually--
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:07.280]   Go ahead, Lori.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:10.000]   This potentially could be a problem, though.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.640]   We actually-- a couple of I'm more writers have wrote a couple of editorials about how
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:14.680]   they feel about it.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:17.160]   And it could be great.
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.720]   You do have to ask permission.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:23.280]   But if, for example, I use-- I don't want to throw anyone under their bus.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:27.920]   I use a particular calculator app that I love that-- and I need notifications turned
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.920]   on so that it will remind me of an event.
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:36.040]   But then that app starts advertising to me.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.640]   You don't get to separate advertisement versus the notification.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:40.640]   Right.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.080]   And what's in that is difficult to define.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.080]   Yeah, that's a good--
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:50.960]   And there's also the issue with people-- there's also the issue with people just saying yes
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.480]   to things and not paying attention to what they're doing.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:58.600]   So it potentially could have a negative effect on the user experience if there's enough
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:04.200]   bad actors that are taking advantage of us not really paying attention to what we're
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.320]   saying yes to.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:10.920]   So it's good, but also there's a lot of controversy about something like this because it potentially
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.760]   could be bad just for us as iPhone users.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:20.240]   I think that if they increase the whole-- maybe not just the first time that you get that notification
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.760]   or that you say, you've been using this for now for two weeks.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.720]   Do you still want those notifications?
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.440]   Because I know that with the location tracking, having it updated--
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.440]   That's really not an opener.
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.880]   It's been really like, oh, why am I letting that thing do that?
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.800]   And I just say, no, no, I don't want to do that.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:39.240]   Which has been devastating for them, for the app developers, but really good for me.
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:44.040]   And I think that I'm fine with them putting ads in it as long as I get to do it.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:48.840]   And then the app developer-- as long as I get a constant reminder and a way to opt out
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.640]   every two weeks or every month or whatever, because then it's really on the onus of the
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.280]   app developer because if they start sending me a bunch of ads, I'm just going to be like,
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.280]   I don't want this anymore.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.840]   I'm just going to turn off-- and right now what I probably do is just turn off their
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.760]   notifications, like all together.
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.520]   Like I just go into the app controls and just go, yeah, I don't want--
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.040]   From Acme, I don't want that notification at all.
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:10.360]   But what you'd like to be able to do is, in Laurie's case, is get the right notifications
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:14.440]   and have the commercial notifications have a separate setting which you could turn on.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:17.880]   And I have to admit, I only let only a handful of apps send me notifications because otherwise
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:18.880]   it's too stressful.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:19.880]   Yeah, I turn them all off.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:20.880]   Yeah, a lot.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.680]   I think a lot of us are like that.
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:26.240]   Why do you need to calculate your notifications?
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.240]   You know, I've just thrown an idea out there.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.360]   I don't have a specific thing.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.600]   That sum is two plus two.
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:35.280]   We've calculated a larger product.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:39.040]   I was just thinking like what something that people would want to do.
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:43.080]   And I didn't want to throw any good developers under the bus by commenting on that.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.040]   So I picked like the most innocuous thing I could pick up.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.040]   But you're right.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.040]   You often do want push notifications.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.480]   My calendars have to have push notifications, otherwise there's not much use or reminders.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.560]   But what you would like to do, and I think this is the right thing to do, is separate
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.840]   ones that are saying.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.920]   And you know, for $15 more you could get a better version of this.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.920]   That should be separate.
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.440]   Yeah, that should be separate.
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:05.960]   And so that's the theory anyway.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:09.600]   Which is what they don't want because they think that you'll just mute all the ads immediately.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.280]   Well, of course.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.640]   Now, this is what I was going to ask you.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.280]   I have not experienced this.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.600]   Apparently, third generation iPad Airs are having blanking screen issues.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.160]   Apple has issued a service program.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.400]   Have you heard from readers?
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:27.480]   Anybody seen this yourself?
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.720]   I haven't heard from any readers.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.880]   Nor have I seen anyone on my Twitter feed mention it.
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.480]   But often it's a small percentage of users.
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:38.680]   But at Apple scale, that's most thousands at least on an iPad.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:45.120]   So if you have one, a third generation iPad Air that's blanking out, Apple will fix it
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.120]   for you for free.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.880]   It's a new service.
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.480]   And these are all, like people wonder why does this issue get a fix and mine doesn't?
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.160]   Like why are they fixing keyboards, but not graphics cards?
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.840]   And like most big companies, these are automated.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.200]   They have a problem tracking system.
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:00.040]   And when a number hits high enough it alerts them and they look at it.
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:04.120]   And then if it gets to a certain number, it's bringing it in and we'll fix it if it breaks.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.560]   If it gets to a higher number, it's bringing it in now and we'll fix it immediately because
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:08.560]   we're even higher numbers.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.560]   Like we're going to just take that back here.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.200]   Take this one instead.
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:14.920]   It's all automated.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:15.920]   Wow.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:19.680]   This is kind of a scary one.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:26.840]   Former Apple tech support staffer stole the identities of multiple billionaires, including
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:30.280]   Houston Rockets owner.
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:37.400]   I've to admit, sometimes I feel like I'm, when I take a device to Apple, if I'm going
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:41.000]   to hand it off to them, even Apple, I will blank it out.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.080]   And I always feel like I'm wearing a tin foil hat.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:49.000]   No, well, you know, you never give them a password.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.440]   The art, but does the article say that the identity theft was accomplished by purchasing
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:58.000]   information in the dark web was a did the article mentioned that the sex support.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.960]   I say that she bought this information for $10 on the dark web.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.560]   But so it's not related to her work, I guess, as a tech support staffer.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:10.680]   It wasn't the article was unclear about whether or not this would, it looks like it happened
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.440]   after they were working for tech support.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.440]   Okay.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.440]   So that's relief.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.440]   That's a relief.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.800]   So I'm still wearing a tin foil hat now.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.760]   It's still prudent to any time you don't let personal information get out of your control
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.560]   unless it's encrypted.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.000]   And so yeah, I do the same thing.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.160]   It's not because I don't trust, I don't trust Apple.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.760]   It's because I just could, it's just prudent.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:32.440]   It's the reason why you wash your hands.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.240]   This is by the way from an Apple insider series that I am going to check.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:40.080]   I used, I always would have these, the police bladders in the back of the local newspaper,
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.640]   the Argus career, because it's so funny.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.880]   This is basically their version of that with, but for Apple.
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:52.520]   Even the surprise of two Knox County sheriffs in Knox County, Illinois, when they pulled
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:15:00.360]   over a car that was going 104 miles an hour inside the car, 53 iPhone 11s and two iPhone
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:09.440]   10 maxes, I guess not as excited, but 55 total phones, stolen phones, valued at $80,000 for
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.520]   people were arrested to from New York, to from Pennsylvania.
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:14.200]   If you're, if you've got about just stolen property, all you got to do is drive this
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.200]   piece on it.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:20.000]   It's like a seriously stolen door there.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.760]   My car's inspection sticker was like invalid for like a week.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:28.320]   And I, I, I, like, I drove so carefully for Fairview being busted.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:32.200]   If I had a hundred, if I had a hundred thousand, two hundred thousand dollars in stolen goods,
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:35.480]   oh boy, I don't get it.
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.200]   That was one of my favorite West Wing lines where they said, how did you catch the guys?
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.640]   And he said, sir, swear to God, broken tail light.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:43.720]   There is no amount, I've learned over my career that there's no amount of law enforcement,
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.400]   man power of funding that can equal criminals being stupid.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:51.760]   Important to remember in this day and age when they're trying to break encryption.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.440]   I remember a secret service.
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.640]   Patrick and I were talking to the secret service.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.640]   And that's what he told me.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.640]   Said, you know what?
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:03.920]   We can pretty much count on these guys to just be dumb or hand over their password.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.400]   It's not really that big a deal.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:14.860]   Chanu's reporting a and ohio man decided to dress as a woman while stealing iPads and
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:21.040]   iPhones from a Wal-Mart in Wisconsin. He was joined by a crew and acted as lookouts. He
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:26.340]   used bolt cutters to open the cage at the Wal-Mart, put $24,000 in merchandise in to
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:32.620]   a box, a toaster box, and then paid for the toaster itself. Check out. Why do you go through
[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:37.620]   the dress as a woman? I mean, like I thought he was going to hide stuff on that. I know.
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:40.720]   I thought that too. You're like, no, he put it in a toaster box. Okay. And then scanned
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:46.140]   the toaster box, picked 39.95. A man dressed as a woman is not going to get any attention
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:51.220]   at all. You know, like, you know, you know, obviously a man would never buy a toaster.
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:57.380]   That's a woman's. Oh, there you go. Clearly. We need a law and order sound feature.
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:03.060]   And feel for the English college student who bought what he thought was a Mac Pro and some
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:10.580]   iPhones for $1,338. If it had only been $1,337, that would have been a red flag, right?
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:14.980]   He opened the box at home and instead of the Mac Pro and iPhones he had seen previously,
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:22.180]   he found two lemonade bottles instead. He dumped them. He says he must have switched
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:26.220]   the bags on me. I just want to know like why they decide on the lemonade. Like, you know,
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:30.620]   have some lemonade there that had it like this. Put lemonade in it. If they were thirsty,
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:34.740]   what would you put in instead? It was like it was like, it was like, right as a law
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:37.740]   start, they were like holding the Mac Pro and holding the lemonade kind of going back
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:41.100]   and forth. Okay. I think they're the same way.
[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:53.020]   The Birmingham police are going the extra mile to find to somebody who lost their iPhone.
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:57.660]   If you recognize these women, it's on the homepage of the iPhone. We recovered this
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:02.660]   iPhone. We're hoping to reunite with its owner with stolen in the early hours of the morning
[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:09.220]   from the pitcher and piano in Brindley place. I want a bar called the pitcher and the piano.
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:14.500]   British car, though, no, maybe so far we haven't heard of it being stolen. Apparently, they
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:22.180]   were able to arrest the thief and return the phone or maybe not. Maybe they're still looking.
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:29.580]   If you recognize these women. All right. That's enough of our police blotter. Our iOS police
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:35.660]   blotter. Thank you, Apple insider.
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:42.780]   Apple has not been able to invalidate the California Institute of Technology patent.
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:47.300]   The patent infringement verdict was questioned on Thursday. Weirdly, the court, it actually
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:55.300]   is a little weird because the patent was in fact reversed, I think, but then the court
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:59.580]   reversed the reversal. It's like a murder mix. Even if it's invalidated, you still got
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:06.100]   to pay. It's dead to whopper all the way down. Yeah. And it's going to cost Apple 838 million
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:11.900]   dollars. This is going to cow tech. Oh, I know. I don't want to do it. We got lots more
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:20.020]   stories. All right. I'll do it. Carson. Carson is as decided that he is going to now be the
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:28.860]   ghost on the bottom of ads future. Our show today brought to you by health IQ health IQ
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:35.220]   is a life insurance agency for people like you who go the extra mile to take care of
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:41.340]   yourself. You exercise four more times a week like Lori Gill. You get a minimum of eight
[01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:48.780]   hours sleep on average like Alex Lindsay. Yes. You eat right, including a lot of chicken
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:53.300]   and waffles like Andy and I don't know. I don't think that's in there. But what here's the
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:20:00.940]   deal. A life insurance has always been statistically based. People who are healthy kind of subsidized
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:06.900]   people were unhealthy. Health IQ is a life insurance agency that uses science and data
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:11.820]   to secure lower life insurance rates for the healthy ones. You can get a million dollar
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:17.700]   insurance policy as little as $36 a month. Just but then here's the trick. You need somebody
[01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:22.620]   to go to bat for you. Health IQ gives you concierge white glove service, walks you through the
[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:27.260]   entire process of applying the policy comes from is underwritten by one of the top 30 insurance
[01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:32.900]   companies. But health IQ has savings exclusive to them. You won't find them anywhere else
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:37.300]   for the healthy folks. Now here's how it works. You have to qualify for this. And it starts
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:42.100]   with a health IQ quiz online. It's a knowledge assessment, not a self assessment. They put
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:47.140]   together the quiz with the nation's leading medical health and fitness experts depending
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:50.940]   on your score. And you can also offer if you want other qualifying factors like your Fitbit
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:55.940]   data or your Apple Watch data. You may save as much as 41% on your life insurance compared
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:21:00.900]   to other providers. No commitment. And by the way, there are other great opportunities to
[01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:04.900]   be rewarded for your commitment to living healthy. But you got to start by going to health IQ
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:12.980]   dot com slash Mac break. Take the quiz. It's a lot of fun. Health IQ dot com slash Mac break.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:16.740]   You could talk to a member of the health IQ team, your life insurance concierge to walk
[01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:23.380]   you through the process. And you can get the savings you've earned for your healthy lifestyle.
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:30.180]   Health IQ dot com slash Mac break. It's a really great idea. Because for so long, you
[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:33.540]   know, most most of the time with insurance companies, you're just a number health IQ goes
[01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:40.340]   to bat for you to get the price you deserve. Apple Pay coming to Mexico. Okay, fine.
[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:48.180]   A. Okay, good. It's about time. A new jailbreak hack lets you run Android on your iPhone 7.
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:54.500]   Why would you want to do that? I know. I can make my Ferrari run like a shoe bet.
[01:21:56.900 --> 01:22:00.420]   Why would you want to do that? You can have comic songs as your main system.
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:08.100]   Sometimes again, why do people climb Everest when there is absolutely nothing to do once
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:12.100]   you get to the top there? Because it's the challenge. It is. It's like putting doom on the
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:18.500]   earth. Yes. Yeah. It's just fun. Project sandcastle dot org. If you want to find out more,
[01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:23.220]   hold on. If I had an iPhone 7, I would do this just for fun. Yeah, I would just do it.
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:28.260]   Yeah, it seems pretty funny. Jason Howell, our host at all about Andrew was asking around if
[01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:33.220]   anybody had an iPhone 7, he could do this too. So if he finds one, we'll show it on all about
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:38.820]   Android. They would be interested. Actually, part of the big deals, but there's less to
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:44.660]   leave about the story is that it's a jailbreak. It unveils a jailbreak technique that does not
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:49.620]   require a notebook to get going. So there is a new jailbreak technique that you can launch now
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:55.780]   from an Android device so that it makes it more convenient, more mobile, more back of a front
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:23:01.540]   seat of a car as opposed to back seat of a truck. So I would have thought that jailbreaking was
[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:06.740]   kind of like flared trousers. It had its day. There are people who are into it because of nostalgia,
[01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:09.860]   but I didn't think there are people who are still actually interested in it, but it's still going
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:13.140]   on. There's still security that's trying to be broken. That's excellent.
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:21.460]   For a long time, Microsoft had an ad campaign. Windows does what? Windows does what? Apparently,
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:26.580]   there were people who didn't understand that Windows did things. Apparently, also Apple has no
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:33.780]   qualms about stealing the campaign for a new iPhone can do what? Wall of iPhone based tips.
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:35.860]   Can we please not spell it that way though, Apple?
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:38.980]   What? That's how many aces at four a's? What?
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:41.380]   I love you six. Let's get the longer one.
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:45.620]   It's what? It's an intero bang. Shouldn't that be an intero bang?
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:48.740]   It's just uncomfortably close to, hey Andy, you need it, says what?
[01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:55.780]   Andy says what? Andy says what? What? Andy says what? Same. Some Apple stores have this.
[01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:59.940]   Look forward at your favorite. It's a wall full of iPhones with a synchronized animation.
[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:02.980]   Each of them explaining how to do something different.
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:10.660]   There's a lot of meetings to find out. And running Android is not on that wall, by the way.
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:18.340]   No, iPhone can do what? That's not a millennials idea. That's like a generation
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:23.060]   Xers who's scared that their job is going to be taken over by a millennial coming up with an idea.
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:26.580]   Actually, they should rename it. Okay, boomer. iPhone can do what?
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:31.220]   Steve recipes, even balance your checkbook.
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:36.580]   That's straight from the original end.
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:39.940]   Steven Warwick writing again at iMore.com.
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:47.140]   Rumor time, Steven says the iPhone 12 leak claims a bigger battery. Yeah, I love that.
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:57.620]   A 64 megapixel camera. Yeah, I'd love that. And a 120 Hertz display. Also, a macro ultra wide mode
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:01.380]   and night mode. Yes, please. And thank you. Now, I'll be super happy.
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:06.020]   I'm really okay with like six lenses in the back. I'm not.
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:09.460]   Yes. Like, I don't have a problem with just adding more sensors.
[01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:12.340]   Credit actually to Max Weinbach from Everything Apple Pro.
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:18.580]   He's XTA developers. I think every day Apple Pro just reported on it.
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:21.620]   Oh, okay. Everything Apple Pro. Yeah, he's an XTA developer.
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:25.540]   It's very confusing because I'm reading an article on iMore that refers to an article in Tom's guide.
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:30.340]   They refers to Max Weinbach and Everything Apple Pro. And that's all very confusing.
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:33.780]   There's this new culture, like where people takes stuff from Instagram and then reput it up as
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:37.540]   their own because they want the cloud from it. It's very confusing. So, I just want to teach
[01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:41.300]   best practices across the board. Yeah, because I always want to refer to the original source and
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:48.260]   give them credit, right? So, Max, this one's for you. Yeah. That would be weird though. If Apple
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:55.140]   were to use pixel binning as an actual feature, I mean, right now that they it's, I like the way
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:26:00.260]   that Apple and other manufacturers do that kind of technique where they're saying they don't say,
[01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:06.660]   hey, we've got a 48 megapixel or 60, 100, 100, cut or in cajillion megapixel sensor. They say that,
[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:10.580]   hey, look at how good our digital zoom is, even though it's using the same technique of we're trying
[01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:16.900]   to calculate what pixels would be in between the real pixels if we had a sensor that was that good.
[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:23.460]   So, and but but also another part of me wonders that if Apple, if a company like Apple were to
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:28.260]   actually stand behind, this is a 48 megapixel. This is we are willing to state that this is a,
[01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:34.500]   you're, if we say you're going to get 48 megapixels of data in there, each of those pixels is going
[01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:39.620]   to be actually good and usable and valuable as opposed to what you've got on the Galaxy S20,
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:46.020]   which is okay. We counted that is indeed a lot of megapixels, but none of them are actually usable.
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:49.860]   You don't want to actually wouldn't actually want to zoom in close enough to actually take use of that.
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:57.380]   Gentlemen, we get 364 days a year, but one day every year, we dedicate to the ladies.
[01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:04.180]   It's International Women's Day. Well, it was, but I wasn't around March 8th.
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:09.140]   It's on Sunday. We get one day. Lori handled it. You got a day, lady.
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:13.220]   One day. One day. It's great. It's great. Yeah.
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:13.860]   Lori, it's actually. Yeah. Lori, it's actually.
[01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:14.180]   Yeah. Lori, it's actually.
[01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:16.340]   It's a lot of questions that every year Lori, what did you do this year?
[01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:22.820]   I'm currently in the process of interviewing app developers, presidents of companies,
[01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:31.140]   engineers, game designers, all women for the entire month of March that I'll be rolling out
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:35.700]   throughout the rest of this week and next week and just kind of spotlighting them and
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:41.220]   reminding everyone. This is what always comes up for me around this time of year.
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:48.900]   There's a lot of this sort of incorrect sentiment that there aren't enough women in tech or women
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:56.100]   don't, they're not interested in tech or we can't find any women to do the job in this tech job
[01:27:56.100 --> 01:28:01.460]   that we want to do and that's absolutely not true. They're out there and they're hungry for work
[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:06.660]   and it's actually getting bigger and bigger as time goes by. More and more women are interested
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:16.260]   in participating in different types of technology positions, whether it's coding or running a company
[01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:20.980]   or designing or something like that, they're out there and they are participating in it and there are
[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:26.980]   a lot of women and I just want to make sure that the history books don't write women out of
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:34.180]   the technological advances that have happened in the world. The way women have been written out of
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:44.420]   certain other categories in the world, I'm thinking music. So I feel that it's important that we
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:48.340]   continue to raise awareness and remind people that there are a lot of women out there that are
[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:55.060]   doing a lot of incredible things, especially in the tech world where we kind of consider that to be
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:29:00.020]   not filled with women, they're all out there. We don't see them as often as we should but they're
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:06.980]   doing all kinds of things behind the scenes and really making strides and making huge changes
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:12.580]   around the world. Yeah, you women. Yeah, women. And actually it is women's history month so we
[01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:16.820]   should get to at least that and Apple did a, I thought they did a great thing in the App Store
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:23.780]   highlighting women, yes, developers, women are in companies. There are events, there were events
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:30.980]   spotlighting women in the She Creates series at Apple Stores and online, which I think is
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:41.060]   really great. Yeah, for the entire month of March, Apple is having women participate in these,
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:46.260]   hosting these events. These must be streamed because I don't think Alicia Keys is coming to my Apple
[01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:51.140]   Store. No, they're different. So first of all, different stores and different locations are going
[01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:56.500]   to have different events and that specifically, the Alicia Keys is not going to be there.
[01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:59.940]   They're allowing you to go in and remix one of Alicia Keys songs.
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:05.220]   Oh, my kids have taken a bunch of these. Oh, they're good. Oh, my gosh, they love them. And they
[01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:10.100]   learn a lot. They come back. I mean, I think that my daughter goes and she like remixed some
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:15.060]   other bands stuff in GarageBand and she goes back with all kinds of new ideas of what she can do.
[01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:20.660]   And what they do a lot of times is you see that that creator is on the big screen and talking about
[01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:24.820]   stuff. I saw the Zack King one, I think, at one of the stores. And so he's like talking about how to
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:29.460]   do quick things with your phone. And then the, and I think it's a really great model for education.
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:34.900]   I think they're doing a really good job there and of packing these like really cool assets,
[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:39.780]   along with something that gets you excited because there's a video of the really famous person.
[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:43.380]   And then you have staff that's been really well trained to kind of walk the kids through it.
[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:47.220]   It's a really strong model. And I think the only reason I've talked about it a lot is just that
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:50.820]   I'm always amazed that my kids come back with these stories about what they learned at the
[01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:58.020]   Apple Store. And I wish they'd learned that at school. Do you check with your local Apple Store?
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:01.700]   Because as I mentioned at the beginning of the show, due to coronavirus, some of these today,
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:06.340]   and apples are being canceled in certain areas. They should stream them. Not that I have a
[01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:12.180]   opinion about that. Who would you call it? You know, we get one month a year. And the, you know,
[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:17.540]   this, this darn virus is taking our month away from us. Come on. We should have a redo, a do-over.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:21.780]   You should get October. Yes, exactly. Let's just have just one. Sorry. And then it'll be a little
[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:28.660]   honestly half the year should be women's, but months, but all right. Every day, every damn day.
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:38.020]   Apple Music is asking Lady Gaga to help as well. The music streaming services, new artists in
[01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:45.780]   residence. She's curated a playlist called Women of Choice. Of course, her single Stupid Love is on
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:51.060]   it, but also music from St. Vincent, Rosalia Grimes, Charlie XCX. Is that how you say that?
[01:31:51.060 --> 01:32:00.100]   It's not 1910 or whatever. And I am among others. Taylor Swift will also get one, Megan Trainer,
[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:09.220]   Kailani and Hayley Steinfeld will have other artists curated playlists. And Beats One will
[01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:16.580]   feature interviews with women. Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, Miranda Lambert, Duolipa and Halzy,
[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:28.500]   among others. So good. Thank you, Apple. Meanwhile, Apple Spotify and others accused of music industry
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:35.780]   conspiracy. Other news. In a related story, a new antitrust lawsuit filed yesterday claims.
[01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:41.860]   Apple and other companies have built out an illegal buyer's conspiracy to block out
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:48.340]   licensing competition. The complaint was filed with the US District Court for the District of
[01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:57.140]   Connecticut by a performers rights organization, pro music rights PMR.
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:33:04.180]   They're suing the entire streaming music industry and other broadcasting entities,
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:10.260]   including not just Apple, but Amazon, Google Spotify, SoundCloud, claiming they entered into
[01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:14.180]   an illegal agreement, combination and/or conspiracy. In other words, they colluded
[01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:20.660]   to shut PMR out of the market and fixed prices. This is why we can't have nice things.
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:25.300]   Well, I don't know. It might be right. I did also just read an article that the music
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:28.740]   industry is having the best year or had last year, the best year it's had since
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:34.900]   in like 10 years. And there were a lot of streaming music. There are a lot of us that
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:37.860]   would we're saying that 10 years ago. Like we just moved to subscription and we're going to make
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:40.900]   a lot more everyone's going to make a lot more money. And there's going to be this down thing.
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:43.780]   And then, you know, there's a lot of us that were just like, you guys are nuts. You know,
[01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:47.620]   why would you not get paid every time someone plays it when they buy a CD and then they play
[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:51.620]   that CD over and over and over again, because it's their favorite CD. The artist doesn't get any
[01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:56.020]   more money, but when you play it on Spotify over and over and over again or Apple Music over and
[01:33:56.020 --> 01:34:00.980]   over again, they get paid every time. Now they don't get paid a lot, but they still get whatever
[01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:06.660]   they're, you know, they're not sent. So PMR is actually just one 20 year old guy named Jake Knock.
[01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:13.380]   Okay. And the reason he's suing in Connecticut, I guess, is that's where he is. They say
[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:20.580]   he was streaming works that they've licensed to users in Connecticut, having purchased licenses
[01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:27.780]   from BMI, but not directly from PMR. PMR says we have the right to license. Two million works from
[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:34.100]   ASAP Rocky with Khalifa, Pharrell, young GZ or young, is it GZ? Lil Yadi, I always get in trouble
[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:39.780]   with these names. Solja Boy, Nipsey Hussle, two chains, Migos, Fallout Boys and others.
[01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:47.620]   He says you got to come to me to license it, not BMI. So I, you know, courts will decide.
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:55.700]   Who are you? Like we already you are. You would be. There's BMI in ASCAP and everybody else.
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:58.740]   There's not really any reason for the for these guys to deal with anybody else.
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:04.100]   I have third party. Imagine how crazy it would be in sanity. It'd be hard to do
[01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:07.460]   a thousand nut job. I'm sure the courts will have something to say. They're gonna say you're a nut
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:14.020]   job. I bet you this gets dismissed before you know, some airily. Some airily dismissed.
[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:18.500]   As because he's a nut job. We called your parents. Yeah, exactly. You called your parents and we're
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:23.220]   attending you home. Stop. Well, on the other hand, maybe he's just a real go-getter. Yeah.
[01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:27.060]   We got some PR out of it. Maybe that's it, what it's all about. I don't know.
[01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:34.820]   It's got to be tough. It sort of seems like it's just somebody who is, like, I want my cut as kind
[01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:39.620]   of the idea by this of like, you know, there's a lot of people out there that went into that
[01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:46.100]   did the work to make the music good. And somebody just wants to own licensing rights to it and then
[01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:51.860]   sue people for not, you know, for sharing licensing rights with other people it sounds like too.
[01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:56.260]   So I don't know. This is all this stuff seems a little shady to me. And it always
[01:35:56.260 --> 01:36:01.220]   draws me the wrong way when it comes to music stuff. And people wanting more money while the
[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:06.180]   actual artists aren't getting, you know, they're getting less and less because these other companies
[01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:11.700]   are wanting more and more. So I don't know. Stop it. Spoken as a true unsigned artist.
[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:18.580]   Exactly. So you didn't have a deal with PMR with Jake.
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:25.460]   I did not have a deal with Jake. Six burn is not represent. He's not represent by PMR. He's not
[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:31.620]   represented by Jake. All right, let's take a break. Get your picks of the week prepared and ready.
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:38.420]   Because we are going to wrap things up. But first a word from our sponsor. I'm just logging
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:43.620]   into my hover account. Hover is where I register all my domain names. And I can give you a couple
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:48.100]   of reasons why I'm a big fan of hover. Let me just put my two factor. And that's one of the
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:53.780]   reasons I'm a big fan. Hover's security is excellent. In fact, there was at one point somebody who was
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:37:01.060]   going around trying to hijack podcasters. URLs. I got a call from hover immediately saying,
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:06.980]   hey, we've had this problem. We're going to fix it, put two factor on. I like that. I like a company.
[01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:11.060]   Look, there's security flaws. There's problems all the time. I always judge a company not by
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:15.860]   whether they're flawless, but by how they respond when something happens and how they fix it. And
[01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:19.620]   hover did a great job. I can't remember when I changed the hover, but it's been awesome.
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:24.500]   It's so much better. Yeah, it's awesome. You see all these are the domains. And by the way,
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:27.540]   one of the things you get when you register domain, these are all my domains. Easy to the
[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:33.380]   manage to. I mean, that the interface is great. Hover will do your email for you or forward your
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:39.700]   email along. They have one button connectors to all of the major websites. And so it's very easy.
[01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:45.940]   In fact, I love having domain names because I use them all the time for like my Minecraft
[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:52.500]   server has its own domain, right, which makes it easy to share that. My cloud has its own domain.
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:56.580]   I just meant I have ideas and I just let's me express them. You know, everyone has a hobby.
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:38:00.660]   And I have I can do a business around that and I make a I make a URL and then I never do anything
[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:05.860]   with it. It's really for anybody who's business monitor and entrepreneur. Hover is kind of a must
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:10.340]   have because you can't really do a business if you don't have the domain. Yeah. First thing you do
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:15.860]   is you see is the domain available. Every great idea deserves deserves a great domain name. 300
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:20.980]   extensions to so you're not limited to just.com.net. You can see I use a lot of third party
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:26.980]   weird extensions, which you know, Leo dot pizza is still available if anybody wants that. But I have
[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:33.460]   a lot of other ones, including Leo dot social, la port dot tech, la port dot coffee. I still haven't
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:37.540]   figured out what to do with I think if my coffee maker ever needs a domain, I have it.
[01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:44.980]   La port dot host. I haven't used that one, but I thought that maybe for web hosting as
[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:52.180]   opposed to show hosting and you can't get creative like, you know, I made a mistake and let my you
[01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:55.940]   know, moving back and forth before hover, this is actually why I moved to hover and let Alex
[01:38:55.940 --> 01:39:00.340]   Lindsey dot com, which I had registered like in 2000 over expire and someone bought it. I was like,
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:04.660]   you know, no one's used it. But I'm and so I asked them how much they wanted to pay and they were,
[01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:08.100]   you know, expensive. I was like, I'm not going to pay for it. So I got a bunch of other Alex
[01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:13.700]   Lindsey dot other things that I can use at. Yeah. And it was just easy to find them. It's easy to
[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:19.060]   grab onto it. And then I told the guy that go, you know, do do yourself. Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:24.340]   One of the things I really like about having your own domain names is having a unique email
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:28.820]   address that you can have different email providers, but you give out that one address for the rest
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:36.420]   of your life. That's it. I also I registered Leo is it's very short as my my short domain URL. So I
[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:43.780]   can use that for you domain shortener, which is because it's only six characters, Leo dot IST.
[01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:49.300]   I couldn't get Leo dot com Leo dot net or Leo dot org, but I was able to get Leo is which I kind
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:54.660]   of like. Yeah, it's, you know, it's kind of fun. And so hover makes it very easy. You can see I have
[01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:59.940]   domain forwarding turned on here. So when you go to Leo dot is to forwards to my key base,
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:04.580]   a proof of it and anything's like that. I just think this is such a great thing to do. Notice
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:10.660]   who is privacy is on by default part of the price. I always turn on transfer lock and auto renew too,
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:17.780]   because I I want my domains to review automatically. I love hover for registering domains. No matter
[01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:21.700]   what you want to build, no matter what business you want to start, there's a domain name waiting
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:27.540]   for you. Great technical support. No upsell. I think it's really important because there are a
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:32.420]   lot of registrars you got to go through 30 pages of crap. Yeah, just to register a domain name.
[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:38.500]   It's a very easy to manage UI. And if you do do your own DNS, some of you do, I like it that you
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:43.300]   could do the automated stuff with like Squarespace and Wordpress and all that. But I do a lot of
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:48.660]   custom DNS and they make it as easy as possible to do that. They also you should check regularly
[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:54.180]   because they have monthly sales on popular TLDs. So you know, you go there.me was on sale a while
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:41:00.740]   ago dot blog, you can get some great domain names. Use a domain name that represents your passion
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:05.380]   that represents you. And once you start registering domain names, you'll find many more.
[01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:12.660]   Sickburn sickburn dot pizza. I think sickburn dot ninja.
[01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:20.580]   Yeah, sick. Is there a sickburn dot pizza? That's pretty good. Yeah, probably is a sickburn dot rock
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:26.740]   or rocks. Hover dot com slash twit. Go right now. Check it out. 10% off your domain extension.
[01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:32.580]   10% off for the full year. So I mean, they're very affordable to begin with. But I really am a fan.
[01:41:32.580 --> 01:41:36.500]   We all use hover even Steve Gibson, because he was moving off one of the old, you know,
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:41.460]   the classic ones that, you know, he would just terrible that everybody use really expensive.
[01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:45.220]   And he asked on Twitter, what should I use? And everybody said, just use hover, Steve.
[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:49.060]   Yeah. Just you. And he's so happy. And they do and they can move your URLs. They have kind of a
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:54.020]   concierge service, right? They can they do because I, as you can see, I moved when we moved to hover
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:42:00.820]   years ago, I moved a ton of addresses. And I asked them just, can you do the work? It was a lot easier
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:05.540]   to do that, although it's not hard to do it. I've got twit dot watch twit dot agency twit dot
[01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:11.780]   questions, twit dot careers dot company dot equipment dot expert. I've got if I always thought
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:19.780]   if I ever get arrested, I want to have free loport dot com. So I'm saving that. You see,
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:25.860]   I registered that six years ago. I'm saving it just in case free loport dot com.
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:28.260]   Give you like free willy. Yes.
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:34.740]   Hover dot com slash twit. Thank you, hover. Andy and I go, let's start with you this week.
[01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:40.820]   Your pick of the week. We had a really, really big and important anniversary happen on Sunday.
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:49.060]   It was on March 8th of 1978, the first episode of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy went out on
[01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:54.500]   B. Can you believe that? How long it's been? That's amazing. And it's the 42nd anniversary,
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:58.820]   which is you're not going to, we're not celebrating the 50. Okay, we'll celebrate the 50th as well.
[01:42:58.820 --> 01:43:04.740]   But you got to celebrate the 42nd. And so this is a good chance to remind people who maybe a lot
[01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:09.380]   of these things skip a generation. So there's a whole generation that didn't grow up with peers
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:12.980]   who are saying, Oh my God, you haven't read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. You go, I'm
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:18.900]   here. Take my copy. Take my copy. You don't even give it back. It's it's still just one of the
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:25.540]   funniest, one of the best, one of the most influential science fiction books ever written. And for me,
[01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:30.260]   especially like as a kid, I was, I had lots of friends who aren't a science fiction,
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:34.180]   but I didn't like a lot of the most of the science fiction that they recommended because a lot of
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:39.780]   it was, Hi, I'm 43 years old and I'm going to explain to you how I think the universe would
[01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:44.660]   be different if doorknobs were all square. Like, okay, characters plot. No, no, no, but
[01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:48.180]   okay now also because the doorknobs are square. Yeah, I'm not really interested in the square
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:55.140]   don't know. This is it was full of fantasy and just absurdism influenced by money Python,
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:44:01.700]   influenced by by PG Woodhouse. And every single page it was this is just absolute silliness from
[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:07.540]   page after page after page, but with coherence. And it all started off with this BBC radio series.
[01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:14.180]   And one of the reasons why it's just so bizarre is because Douglas Adams was real even even decades
[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:20.260]   after his death. The legend of how he just did not want to get anything done on time persists.
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:25.620]   If anything, it is magnified like a giant prism spreading out throughout the throughout the cosmos.
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:31.460]   So he oftentimes he was writing scripts as the thing was being recorded, like they be recording
[01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:36.180]   act one and he'd be in another room like writing act. Here's the here's the group.
[01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:43.220]   All know, oh, you got Lori's got it. That's nice. And the radio series is the best one. This is the
[01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:49.460]   group Douglas Adams and the performers at the BBC theater. Let me play every time I hear it.
[01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:55.620]   I think I can play a little bit of this. Can you get my audio? You can't hear. Oh, wait a minute.
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:45:02.260]   I turned it off. Let's turn it. Let's turn it back on. The sounds of theater from national public
[01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:07.700]   radio. I recorded the public radio one. So that's why that begins with that. But here's the sound,
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:14.980]   the Eagles song that begins it. Journey the Sorcerer. I get the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy.
[01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:21.620]   I Douglas Adams, starring Peter Jones says the book. Something's wrong with it. It's sped up.
[01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:29.540]   So I apologize. But there's the music. Every time I hear that music, I get chills. I get chills. Yeah.
[01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:33.620]   So remember, we talk about the books. We talk about the movie. We talk about the TV show,
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:38.500]   but it was originally a BBC radio show. As you said, Douglas Adams was writing this
[01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:44.420]   as they were going to the studio. And it is one of the greatest radio shows of all time.
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:50.500]   And I would say they so pan the Macmillan, the Macmillan publisher, I think pan something.
[01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:55.380]   They're doing like reprints of the entire series, including including the radio scripts.
[01:45:55.380 --> 01:46:00.020]   I would suggest if you can't get ahold of the definitely listen to the radio series.
[01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:05.380]   But the books are also amazing. The first three, let's say, and maybe the fourth in the series
[01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:11.220]   are also good. There was a fifth and at this point, the publisher was basically saying,
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:16.260]   hi, but I really want to write this book about traveling the world and looking for nearly extinct
[01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:20.900]   species. Like, okay, we will let you write that book. If you write us another multi-million,
[01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:27.780]   I'm sorry, another series, another hitchhiker's book. And so even the book of radio scripts is
[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:31.700]   an amazingly good read because it has all the stage directions and all the background stuff.
[01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:34.900]   And so it's, this is a series that I've been doing every year.
[01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:38.340]   It's still sped up. I'm going to have to get a new copy of it.
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:42.980]   Did you buy that somewhere, Laurie? Because that's, yeah.
[01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:48.100]   It was a Christmas present to me, but I believe they found it on Amazon.
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:53.620]   So I think that I don't think it's hard to find it. It's a TV set.
[01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:58.180]   Oh, it's unaudible good. All right. Because I, like I said, I recorded this off the radio.
[01:46:58.180 --> 01:47:03.540]   Maybe that's why after being, after being translated over and over and over again,
[01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:11.860]   it's slightly sped up. I agree 100%. 40 second anniversary, hard to believe hitchhiker's guide.
[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:13.940]   Life, answer everything in the universe, 42.
[01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:16.420]   That's right. 40. Oh, that's why it's a big deal.
[01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:17.860]   Exactly.
[01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:25.620]   I think I even said that last week when I recommended that Filson Fieldbag,
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:28.740]   that all my life, ever since I was a little kid, part of me was like,
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:31.060]   at some point I'm going to have to acquire a bag that's,
[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:35.780]   what I figure is exactly like what Ford Prefect was traveling the universe with as a field,
[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:37.780]   as a field contributor to the hitchhiker's guide.
[01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:39.220]   You got to keep a towel in it, of course.
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:43.380]   And I feel isn't exactly. That's why I like that weather flap.
[01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:47.220]   Because you can put the towel on top of it and then just simply put the towel over.
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:53.780]   Very nice. There's a lot on the, there's the, I think the one you're looking for is narrated
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:58.340]   by Peter Jones, Simon Jones, the long list. Peter Jones, there's the audio book,
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:02.020]   which is like Stephen Fry and Martin from "The Digital." Okay, so that's fine.
[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:04.980]   It's very good. You should have it all. Yeah, you should listen to it.
[01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:08.340]   Yeah, it's true. You should. Pretty much everyone that I know of, if you say,
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:12.820]   I've got a question, the reaction is always 42.
[01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:19.140]   Then we can figure it out. It's show James Thompson.
[01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:22.900]   Renee, Richie has a great pick for us as well, Renee.
[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:28.260]   Yeah, so in order to compete with Andy, who just kept looking more and more realistic every week,
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:33.940]   I had to up my webcam game. I tried everything. I tried DSLRs, tried Cine cameras.
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:38.900]   Nothing worked. So finally, I broke down and it's not quite what Lori had last time.
[01:48:38.900 --> 01:48:44.020]   I think she had something a little bit fancier, but I got the Logitech 4K camera.
[01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:48.500]   And it's just the previous one I had was 10. Yeah, yeah.
[01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:53.780]   It's just, I had the 1080p one, the 920 for so long, and it was a good camera at its time.
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:58.100]   But when I saw what Lori looked like with the latest and greatest technology,
[01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:02.020]   I knew I had to up my game. So it's a little bit pricier. It's 199.
[01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:07.220]   I was thinking about it. I was thinking, wow, you look really good. I figured you just got the new
[01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:13.700]   is it the capture cam? Is that right? Is that what you have, Lori?
[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:16.660]   Oh, sorry. It's the stream cam.
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:17.700]   Stream cam is what it's called.
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:18.180]   It's not a stream cam.
[01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:18.660]   Yeah.
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:18.660]   Yeah.
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:23.140]   So, but yeah, so the stream cam, so I thought that was you just you just followed what she did.
[01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:25.140]   But yeah, I swerved.
[01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:27.300]   Yeah, you were like, I gotta do better.
[01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:28.820]   Now it looks good. It looks really good.
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:29.780]   He needed that 4K.
[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:35.220]   And it's good now because everyone is stressing remote work and distancing and all these things.
[01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:39.700]   And if you use MacBooks for all of their virtues, do not have good webcam.
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:43.460]   This is not something that Apple has prioritized over super slim lids.
[01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:48.580]   So this it can either I have mine on a gorilla pod, but you because you can unscrew the little
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:53.940]   flap there and just mounted on any tripod you want. But you can get it with this and just put
[01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:58.260]   on the back of your display, especially if you don't have a webcam. And it just the better you
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:03.940]   look, the more like in real life, I find the experience feels. It is the USBC on that side.
[01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:08.500]   It is not USBC on the other side. I felt a little bit like I was caught in a time machine.
[01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:11.060]   So I just pulled that plug out. It's like a proper USBC.
[01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:13.860]   There's Andy's version.
[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:18.260]   I'm helping out because you can't show off this camera because you're using this camera.
[01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:18.740]   Using it.
[01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:19.220]   Yeah.
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:19.780]   Yeah.
[01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:24.740]   So yes, here's the it's a big it's a big advantage over like the previous edition of this camera,
[01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:29.940]   because on the previous edition, the what the thing that lets you screw it into a tripod
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:34.260]   and perch it on top of your monitor is actually like hard mounted into the thing,
[01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:38.100]   which made it almost impossible to like pack for travel. But with this one, it comes with a
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:44.500]   detachable version of that. The only the only caveat I will give if you have an older Mac,
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:50.900]   like a 2015. Or excuse me, let's say a mid range i5 Mac from a few years ago,
[01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:57.300]   you might find that the you can't stream in 4k or use the digital zoom features of it.
[01:50:57.300 --> 01:51:02.580]   Because I found that when I when I have this plugged into my Mac book, my 2015 Mac book pro,
[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:07.700]   it is a 4k camera and the Logitech software you can download, lets you use a digital zoom.
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:10.900]   So you're still getting full HD even though you're using a digital zoom,
[01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:17.380]   but it was still pumping so much data into that into that USB three port that it was downscaling
[01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:20.900]   it quite severely. So I wasn't getting the the advantages that I thought I was going to be able
[01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:26.020]   to get. But on on a more modern Mac and on a higher, higher capacity Mac works just great.
[01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:29.940]   And I and I really think that that Logitech has really kind of cornered this market as far as
[01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:35.300]   high quality cameras. I mean, whether it's the the 920s, we were our standard for a long time.
[01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:39.940]   And I think they have the 922 and then the stream cam and then the Brio. And I just think
[01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:44.820]   it's the best class of of cameras right now at different price points. And I've tested
[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:50.420]   a lot of web cameras, you know, and and and I think that the detail that we're that that you see,
[01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:54.980]   and even just the what it does with light sensitivity and control over the camera,
[01:51:54.980 --> 01:51:59.860]   I think is pretty my best. It's not it's not just the resolution. If you're still using a 920,
[01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:04.820]   it really is like I'm actually doing this with the 920s still. Yeah, because I haven't I need
[01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:08.900]   to swap out some hardware. You would not see quite so much of this blooming. You would see better
[01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:14.100]   shadow detail once I swap out. I'm swapping up new new a new computer onto the station. And
[01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:18.740]   that's what I'm going to be putting this in permanently. But you can see the difference. It's a good
[01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:24.180]   it's a good situation, but it'll be a lot, lot better just with simply tonality. So even if
[01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:28.660]   you don't care about 4k, you'll get a big big improvement in the video quality. And you really
[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:32.820]   can. I mean, we've done some stuff where we're taking multiples of these cameras and plugging
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:36.180]   them in and using Wirecast or OBS where you're jumping between those cameras. If you're really
[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:41.060]   looking for a cost effective way to do live streaming that is a you know, that starts to get pretty
[01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:45.380]   good with the HDMI out though, because I got that black magic mini a 10. Well, see, I was going
[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:50.580]   to pick the Canon C 500 Mark 2 Leo that has HDMI out, but I figured it's not a great webcam.
[01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:57.780]   Yeah, that's also probably more than 200 bucks. I'm guessing. Thank you. Good pick. Good pick.
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:53:03.300]   We've used Logitech cameras and set them out for years, but that one looks even better than usual.
[01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:08.500]   That's really good. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for Alex Lindsay's pickle away.
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:14.580]   So quick times great quick times quick times quick time. Even do they still offer quick time?
[01:53:14.580 --> 01:53:18.740]   Yeah, they do. Quick times free. So quick time. Is it free? Not quick time pro.
[01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:21.620]   Quick time pro. There's no more quick time pro. There's just quick time.
[01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:26.500]   Okay. Quick time and it's great. And I use it a lot to do screen records and to playback stuff.
[01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:30.980]   And it's on everything and you can pop it over. But some of us need something more refined.
[01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:36.260]   Well, you need let's crop some flops. I do. I do need it. So I actually needed this because I
[01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:42.660]   shoot almost everything on my black magic camera in log. And so being able to you know, have look
[01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:46.980]   up being able to open something up and then have a look up table and being able to really look at
[01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:51.780]   what I'm you know and having a more refined player than I can use. So this is a call.
[01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:56.580]   Log green. Log is a professional format that doesn't log rhythmic. It doesn't look good.
[01:53:56.580 --> 01:54:01.300]   Look good. But but some people so if you're out there shooting in log and then posting that to
[01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:06.180]   YouTube, not making any any transform. Shame on you. It's a weird look. Shame on you. It is like
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:09.540]   but the reason you use this because you're getting more data but you have to play a lot.
[01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:13.060]   When you play a lot. A lookup table. Otherwise it won't look like.
[01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:19.140]   It looks like it was someone poured coffee on it. So you have to put it to the lookup table and
[01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:22.980]   you can do that in Final Cut. You can do it in a lot in After Effects and Premiere and you know
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:29.460]   all those things. But the but the idea is that I've why do I want to open it. I just want to view
[01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:33.780]   it. I want to have you know really be able to play with what that look looks like.
[01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:40.580]   Being able to kind of have look at image sequences. You know all of these things are things that
[01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:45.700]   are important. So this is just a great app. It feels pro. It has the tools that you need.
[01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:50.660]   And so if you're really looking you know there's all these things that people like me really want.
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:55.380]   So if you're listening and you're really into more. You're looking for a pro player that really
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:55:01.380]   gives you all that kind of power user data. I think this is the best solution I've I've found as a
[01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:06.740]   kind of a lightweight playback tool that I can just kind of open up. It's not like open it into
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:10.340]   Final Cut or open it into something else. This is what you use for your TikTok videos.
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:14.580]   No he's Final Cut for my TikTok videos. This is what I this is what I preview the playback
[01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:21.540]   song. You know so you know so for 99 bucks a year. 29 bucks thereafter. It's it's it's it's it's
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:26.180]   you know it's not something that if you just need a pro. But for your pro that's not a big number in
[01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:30.740]   it. And for all of these tools to be all kind of put in here and you can do some export and
[01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:37.700]   transcode. So you know I love for all of the features. It's got just a pure clean display.
[01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:40.660]   Well and the other nice thing about it is you can't hide it all. So there's like a little
[01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:44.820]   carrot there on the right and you can roll it up roll it down. So you're not like stuck with
[01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:49.780]   having all but you can open it up and then have all these tools. So it's it does allow you to have
[01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:56.100]   kind of a clean aperture when you when you want it. And so I just think that this is how you turn
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:56:00.820]   on all now. This is how you really if you're doing kind of pro work and you want to be able to
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:05.860]   view it it's not for your average person to just put the you know to get this. And it also works
[01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:09.940]   with they have another one called lattice which allows you to kind of build the
[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:14.900]   LUTs or create new LUTs and work with LUTs and so on and so forth. So there's a couple different
[01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:20.820]   options there. And so it's a but it's a very useful. This is quite amazing. What a lot of stuff in
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:25.940]   here. Yeah. I like the barcode. I haven't used the barcode. You know like it's kind of like I
[01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:31.300]   was kind of like I don't know what I do with that. But I think that it does give you a look of your
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:36.100]   entire film. So if you had something really long you can take a look at it and see if and some of
[01:56:36.100 --> 01:56:41.620]   this gives you a sense of what colors you're going through in different scenes. But I again I.
[01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:47.540]   So the barcode basically takes the kind of the color from any given frame and puts them all
[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:52.580]   together. Kind of just squeezes all the frames together into one long image that looks like a
[01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:56.340]   bark a little like a barcode. But you can kind of like if your film is gloomy and gray it will be
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:57.700]   I'm just gonna be gloomy and gray.
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:56:58.700]   - Right.
[01:56:58.700 --> 01:56:59.520]   Right, exactly.
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:00.580]   - It was like, this was the gloomy,
[01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:03.340]   you can see here that you had the Act I was sunny,
[01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:04.200]   then Act II was gloomy.
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:05.360]   - Very gray.
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:07.060]   - And Act III was sunny again.
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:08.260]   - So they got them.
[01:57:08.260 --> 01:57:09.900]   They described the Trillion Act I.
[01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:11.340]   They got them up the Trillion Act II.
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:12.580]   And they got them down the Trillion Act III.
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:13.980]   - Who was it I interviewed recently,
[01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:16.860]   Carsten, that does this for movies.
[01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:18.540]   Like this was his thing.
[01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:22.160]   He was doing big prints, big long prints,
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:24.320]   but he couldn't ever get Hollywood to buy into it.
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:25.320]   Well, I don't remember.
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:27.340]   Yeah, it was somebody really cool.
[01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:28.620]   And I've just forgot.
[01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:32.100]   Screen is available from videovillage.co.co
[01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:35.700]   .co for 90, as I said, 99 bucks.
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:36.620]   Good pick.
[01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:39.720]   Lori Gill has a Cine-esque pick too.
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:41.300]   Hello, Lori Gill.
[01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:42.140]   - Hi.
[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:46.540]   So, Max Vonsnau passed away yesterday.
[01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:48.180]   He was 90 years old.
[01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:49.620]   - So sad when I read that.
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:51.260]   I just love him.
[01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:56.260]   He's been in so many movies that I think,
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:57:58.040]   if you don't know his name.
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:57:58.880]   - You know his name.
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:00.680]   - You would know, you would just know him
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:03.840]   because he's just been a working actor
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:07.160]   for a very, very long time.
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:09.200]   This pick actually comes from Carsten.
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:11.440]   Thank you, Carsten, for the recommendation on this.
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:14.240]   I had never heard of this movie before yesterday.
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:16.560]   It's called The Apple War.
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:19.080]   And it stars Max Vonsnau.
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:22.180]   It's a Swedish film from 1971
[01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:27.180]   about a very small rural town in Sweden
[01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:32.420]   that is being, there's some investors
[01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:36.860]   that wanna come in and they want to build a Doichney land,
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:39.540]   which would be a very large amusement park.
[01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:40.540]   - Just for German tourists.
[01:58:40.540 --> 01:58:41.700]   - And everyone's on board with it.
[01:58:41.700 --> 01:58:42.740]   Yeah, yep.
[01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:44.660]   Everyone's on board with it at first
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:46.300]   because it seems like a really great idea
[01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:50.140]   to bring in more tourists to buy things.
[01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:55.060]   And there's this amazing sort of city council meeting
[01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:57.940]   or resident meeting at the beginning
[01:58:57.940 --> 01:58:59.140]   where all these people are asking,
[01:58:59.140 --> 01:59:01.020]   well, I'm a pig farmer.
[01:59:01.020 --> 01:59:03.500]   Do you think that I could raise these pigs
[01:59:03.500 --> 01:59:06.180]   and maybe sell them to the children
[01:59:06.180 --> 01:59:07.540]   so that they could have them as pets?
[01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:09.540]   And then I could even buy them back from them
[01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:12.500]   when they're all grown up and I could butcher them
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:13.380]   and sell them for me.
[01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:16.380]   And there's this investor guy who's like,
[01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:18.740]   yeah, that's a possibility.
[01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:20.420]   So there's all these sort of,
[01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:21.860]   these people that are asking,
[01:59:21.860 --> 01:59:23.340]   how will this benefit my town?
[01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:26.220]   And there's this investor who's kind of like,
[01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:28.540]   sure, that's a possibility.
[01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:30.980]   So they all get on board with it at first.
[01:59:30.980 --> 01:59:33.500]   But then they start to realize
[01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:36.420]   that maybe this isn't really gonna be such a great idea
[01:59:36.420 --> 01:59:40.460]   for the town to bring in this giant conglomerate.
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:45.460]   It's very much hitting home life and community
[01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:48.460]   against these giant corporations
[01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:52.580]   that would come in and just level out something
[01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:54.780]   and turn it into an amusement park.
[01:59:54.780 --> 01:59:58.780]   And there's that sort of paving of paradise idea behind it.
[01:59:58.780 --> 02:00:01.500]   And it's got fantastical elements in it.
[02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:04.100]   There's a little magic to be had in the family
[02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:07.740]   that Max Fonsadau is the head of
[02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:12.740]   that to trick and use magic to kind of get the town back
[02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:20.220]   to its roots and not have this giant amusement park built
[02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:21.900]   in their town.
[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:25.460]   So it's a very lovely little story.
[02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:30.460]   And I found a version of it on YouTube that has US.
[02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:35.980]   - I was gonna ask where you found this
[02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:38.900]   because a 1971 movie from Sweden
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:40.740]   is not gonna be on Netflix.
[02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:42.540]   - Yeah, it's very hard to find it.
[02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:45.300]   And it's because I wanted to watch this before today.
[02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:48.660]   I didn't go find a DVD copy that had subtitles.
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:50.740]   Don't even know if that exists, actually.
[02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:53.100]   But I did find somebody on YouTube
[02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:54.900]   and I don't wanna,
[02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:55.740]   - You're not gonna hold that.
[02:00:55.740 --> 02:00:57.100]   - You know, it's a movie so I want people to buy it.
[02:00:57.100 --> 02:00:59.780]   So I don't, yeah, I don't wanna to mislead people,
[02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:01.140]   but I did find it on the internet
[02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:03.020]   with English subtitles on YouTube.
[02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:05.180]   So if you do wanna do the search yourself,
[02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:06.300]   you should be able to find it.
[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:07.420]   And it's really great.
[02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:09.300]   Honestly, that's one of those things where
[02:01:09.300 --> 02:01:11.140]   I wish that this could happen more.
[02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:12.780]   So that I wouldn't have been able to watch that movie
[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:14.260]   if it weren't for the fact that just somebody
[02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:17.260]   who loved this movie put it up with subtitles,
[02:01:17.260 --> 02:01:19.940]   a US subtitles so I could see it.
[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:21.580]   So it's great.
[02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:24.140]   - The apple cricket.
[02:01:24.140 --> 02:01:26.500]   - Apple cricket.
[02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:30.460]   - He plays the family fighting Deutsch knee land,
[02:01:30.460 --> 02:01:35.140]   which is being built by somebody called Jean Volkswagen.
[02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:36.980]   (laughing)
[02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:38.700]   So I'm feeling it's a little bit of sad time.
[02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:39.540]   His wife literally.
[02:01:39.540 --> 02:01:40.380]   - Oh yes.
[02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:41.220]   (laughing)
[02:01:41.220 --> 02:01:43.700]   - It's very satirical and lighthearted and fun.
[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:44.540]   - Fun, yeah.
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:45.380]   - Very cool.
[02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:49.140]   I'm gonna save my pick for the end of the show.
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:49.940]   We're gonna show it.
[02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:53.220]   We have a new show coming in a couple of weeks
[02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:55.260]   to twit called Hands on Macintosh.
[02:01:55.260 --> 02:01:57.660]   I said, you know what, I wanna do this one.
[02:01:57.660 --> 02:01:59.900]   So we're gonna have a lot of fun showing.
[02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:02.300]   The first thing I show is the better toolbar,
[02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:04.580]   better touch bar, but we'll talk a little,
[02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:06.020]   I'm gonna do a lot of terminal stuff
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:08.700]   'cause I'm all over about the terminal and brew.
[02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:09.780]   So that's gonna be a lot of fun.
[02:02:09.780 --> 02:02:12.100]   It'll be a weekly show comes out every Friday.
[02:02:12.100 --> 02:02:14.900]   Short, five, 10 minutes, quick hits,
[02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:18.260]   little Mac tips for the expert and the in expert.
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:21.860]   So we'll play a little promo for that at the end of the show.
[02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:25.020]   But first I wanna thank everybody for being here.
[02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:27.660]   In women's months it's so important to have a woman
[02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:28.460]   in the show.
[02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:31.900]   Thank you, Lori Gill, for making us more than just

[02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:35.900]   - Every month, she's a woman.
[02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:37.180]   It's amazing.
[02:02:37.180 --> 02:02:39.980]   She's just very consistent that way.

[02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:51.900]   I feel really good about being the bread
[02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:53.300]   in this sausage factory.
[02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:54.140]   (laughing)
[02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:55.780]   - Oh geez.
[02:02:55.780 --> 02:02:58.300]   That means Alex Lindsey's the mustard.

[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:01.300]   (laughing)

[02:03:10.420 --> 02:03:11.620]   - For making your way up.

[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:22.260]   What's the current episode about?
[02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:25.620]   - I start speculating about how Apple can make
[02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:27.780]   five iPhones in a year and their prices could range
[02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:30.740]   from $3.99 to whatever, adding a 5G modem
[02:03:30.740 --> 02:03:33.300]   to the already 1099 Macs.
[02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:36.340]   And then tomorrow's show is all about what Apple could do
[02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:38.620]   with WWDC if we're not all there in person.
[02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:39.580]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:42.620]   You know, I didn't do the Jean-Louis Gasset article.
[02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:44.780]   I mentioned it, I teased it, but I forgot to put it
[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:48.620]   in the content about arm and the future of arm
[02:03:48.620 --> 02:03:50.060]   and how it might even be possible
[02:03:50.060 --> 02:03:51.860]   with some new high-end arm designs
[02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:56.860]   to make a Mac professional Mac, not quite a Mac Pro maybe,
[02:03:56.860 --> 02:03:57.980]   but a Mac.
[02:03:57.980 --> 02:03:59.780]   So we'll save that for next week.
[02:03:59.780 --> 02:04:02.660]   Andy Inako Chicago, not Chicago sometimes,
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:07.660]   former Chicago Saratimeser, America's favorite sideburns.

[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:18.900]   - Part of the mighty WGBH Boston
[02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:21.420]   is public radio station NPR.
[02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:24.620]   I'm gonna be on Thursday at 1230 this week

[02:04:27.020 --> 02:04:28.060]   I appreciate it.
[02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:30.380]   We do Mac break weekly on Tuesdays

[02:04:31.860 --> 02:04:34.180]   You actually can make this a whole Mac Apple day

[02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:16.960]   Hello everybody.
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:19.060]   Welcome to a brand new show on the Twit Network.
[02:05:19.060 --> 02:05:20.900]   This is episode zero of
[02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:24.780]   ♪ Home hands on Mac ♪
[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:26.220]   My name is Leo Laport.
[02:05:26.220 --> 02:05:27.740]   You may have seen me on such shows
[02:05:27.740 --> 02:05:30.020]   as the screen savers and call for help.
[02:05:30.020 --> 02:05:31.460]   I've been doing Mac break weekly

[02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:34.740]   but I wanted to do a short show,
[02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:36.980]   a five minute program every week
[02:05:36.980 --> 02:05:38.780]   that will cover my favorite Mac apps,

[02:05:50.380 --> 02:05:52.060]   One thing that's sure,
[02:05:52.060 --> 02:05:55.300]   Apple has not made Mac OS easier to use over the years,
[02:05:55.300 --> 02:05:57.100]   but it has made it more powerful.
[02:05:57.100 --> 02:06:00.100]   And I'm gonna show you ways you can get the most
[02:06:00.100 --> 02:06:01.500]   out of your Mac and touch.
