[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.200]   Hey a little bit of a snow on the roof there and are you is your beard getting wider? What's going on here?
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.800]   No, it's just I let it grow a little bit and it's punishing me by being incredibly bright
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.040]   Look at that you're starting out. You're like Kenny Rogers in a minute. Got a no

[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.160]   CW OB calm hello Andrew
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.660]   I just gave me an idea to hold the show hostage if you if you don't pay pal $500 into my account in the next five minutes
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.900]   I'm going to start singing Beatles and Rolling Stones
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.120]   And not co-buster and I go buster. It's an an echo buster
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:55.960]   So October 27th is now 17 days away as we record this that is the day of course we will be able to
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.800]   Order the iPhone 10 Apple has received FCC approval
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   goodness
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   Wouldn't have been embarrassing
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.000]   Actually, if I guess they don't apply ahead of time because that would be you know
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   They'd have we'd know all about it
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.880]   It did in fact say on the iPhone 10 product pages iPhone 10 has not been authorized as required by the rules of the FCC
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.480]   This device and is not and may not be offered for sale at least or sold at least until authorization has been obtained
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.120]   John say that you wanted Apple to announce the iPhone and not the FCC yeah. Yeah, yeah takes them a while
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.320]   so pre-orders are on although if you if you
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.360]   Listen to the rumors from even from people like who should know like Ming-Ji quote
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.720]   It sounds like it might be very very difficult to get an iPhone
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.640]   10 where you'll get one is just no no account of for when Leo. Yeah, November 3rd might be when you'll get yeah
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.360]   iPhone
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.960]   8 is of course Apple's answer to that
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.240]   You can buy an iPhone brand new iPhone right now get the iPhone 8
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.520]   Quo says the iPhone 8 is in fact selling better
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.600]   Than expected
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.800]   But he says the true super cycle. That's when you know the apples results go through the roof
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.760]   The true super cycle for the iPhone won't actually happen until next year
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.800]   Because you won't really get enough production of the iPhone 10
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.360]   Until then
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:36.400]   Furthermore, he says in 2018 the phones will see longer sales period than the 2017 iPhone 10 do the improvements and availability as Apple
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.360]   Perpects the production process in other words while there may be some iPhone 10s available on November 3rd
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.400]   It's gonna fill that pipeline. He is predicting
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:57.280]   210 million to 220 million iPhone sales in 2017 and then next year a big bump 245 to 255
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:05.040]   What what is your strategy gonna be Renee Richie forgetting
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.800]   Because you need this you yeah, you need it especially I need it
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.120]   We have the three of us really want to have an iPhone 10 in time
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.920]   You know to tell people whether to get it or not as
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.040]   Totally totally so I mean my usual modus operandi is to wake up at 3 a.m. Local time
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:29.560]   Which is 12 12 p.m. Your time and then hit the Apple Store app on the iPhone as hard as I possibly can and just try to get my
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.900]   Order through hope the servers stay up hope the Apple pays work and hope every you know Apple pays much faster than the other payment processing methods
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.040]   So I make sure I have that done I go in beforehand make sure all my account details my dress everything is is proper
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.760]   I try to buy something small a day before just make sure that everything works
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.500]   And I'm paranoid, but they are out to get me so I don't feel bad about doing that
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.840]   Well, you know I get a watch band like I got the hickin looper
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.200]   Hickin looper's night. Yeah, those those are good. This is the velcro
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.960]   I'm sorry. Yeah hook and look and look it was made
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.340]   It was made by velcro, but they're called it looking is it actually is velcro
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.620]   Yeah, I think I think Gruber was talking about that is it's a partnership with velcro the same way the glass is made by Corning
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.860]   But it's not branded say that it's that way. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.220]   Yeah, this is actually this is for a sport band my favorite new sport band
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.020]   The idea is that I would never look scruffy no matter how often you pull them. Oh really up to pull down on yeah
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.340]   We shall see I have enough of this to be averted. Yeah, I also got a to match the gray
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.660]   I got a black millenies loop. Oh
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.700]   I got I'm wearing that today. Oh, I love it with the gray watch. That's pretty just looks so
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.860]   I'm a little worried though because my silver hook my silver millenies got scratched up pretty quick. So we'll see
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.780]   It I think the DLC coating is just so tough. Oh good. I hope so. Yeah
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.140]   So we shall see
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.020]   Andy do you have are you gonna try to get an iPhone 10 or you're just gonna wait and see if you get a review unit
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:03.140]   I'm gonna try I'm gonna try to get it. I buy an iPhone 10. It's I like to I'm not day one
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.020]   Reviewer. I like to like this ponder a little bit
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.980]   But I know that there might be that might be a lot of time for pondering as in pondering when I'm going to get one
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:18.020]   So yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna be like Renee. I'm gonna be awake at 3 a.m. Central time
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.820]   Making sure that we can all tweet each other then
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:26.500]   At the same at the same time, you know, you can't like make requests
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.980]   Of Apple, but you can say obviously I'm going to be quite interested in
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:37.060]   Reviewing the iPhone 10 and I know it's gonna be a short supply and that's that's when you say that well
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:44.740]   I will probably I hope to do it my first my first radio show on national public radio in Boston as soon as after
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:50.100]   After the release to sort of again if there's like a if there's like a row of checkboxes
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.780]   I know that if there if there's a 10 out of 10
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.980]   I know that at most I'm gonna get three out of our four of those checkboxes
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.220]   But I want all four of those checkboxes whenever metric they're using
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:06.980]   Well, I'll even turn my hat backwards and do one of those like direct-to-camera unboxing videos that get all the hits
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.140]   If that's what anyone it just there's a guy named
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:16.020]   Robin Blanken has last name, but he's the guy who uses the iPad Pro to do the storyboards for things like
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.840]   designated survivor and Star Trek discovery and
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.360]   Pacific Rim does it all an iPad Pro? He's phenomenal and the other day he tweeted what is up guys?
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.840]   I keep watching YouTube videos, and I just don't know the answer guys. What's up guys? What's up guys?
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.820]   Oh, I hate that I hate that
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:38.460]   So what colors are we getting we're looking at here you get silver or black that's it right the silver is
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:43.740]   Incredibly silver it is like original iPhone so bright. You can't believe it's bright silver
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.820]   It's just shockingly bright silver the black is very muted the black stainless steel is actually
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:55.220]   It's I don't know if it's DLC code of the same way as a watch they call it vapor coding in DLC is a type of vapor coding
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.260]   So I'll leave that to the material science experts
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:02.020]   But it's got a very similar coding to what's on the Apple watch and a much darker palette
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.020]   So if you want something that really screams
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:10.500]   Bright shiny then the white one is for you if you want something that looks like Batman's phone then you want the and
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.980]   speaking of screaming Apple does
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.020]   two things to this phone I
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:21.420]   Think I would submit almost unnecessarily to make sure that everyone will know that you have the new iPhone
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:26.700]   Of course the notches one and then they've repositioned the camera lenses so that they're now
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.980]   Oriented vertically instead of horizontally so it'll be very clear. I'm standing is how it fit
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.540]   Yeah, so like because of the way the insides are rejiggered they couldn't fit it has a long way the way they'd
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.220]   Undel the other one so this it was a better fit for the components as well
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.540]   Well, but it's also a you know, it's a beneficial thing too because it is important. I think
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.860]   At least half the people buy iPhones maybe more buy them because it's a status symbol
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.780]   You want to have the latest iPhone and that's what drives a lot of first-day traffic anyway, super cycles Leo
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:58.900]   It drives super cycles. I think that the iPhone 10 especially because it's it's right now
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:05.140]   It seems as though you're gonna get the same processing power. I'm not expecting the camera to be that much better
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:10.900]   It's going to be you're gonna you're gonna get the better case gonna get a better form factor
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.860]   You're gonna get 3d face ID, but they're not a whole lot of people that are complaining about touch ID right now
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:20.280]   So yeah, I mean that there's again nothing to nothing to be ashamed of but
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:27.460]   The first the first thing piece I see that says that the I the new iPhone 10 is very much the culmination of
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:32.860]   Everything that the industry has been building towards for like okay. Yeah, it's a it's a nice. It's a cute
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.860]   It's a nice phone. It's a lovely phone. It's a pretty phone
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.100]   It's okay to spend extra money for nice lovely and pretty things
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:44.660]   But don't say that until until the tests come back don't say that it's something what color you're gonna go for
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.100]   It isn't it the opposite though Leo?
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:52.100]   It's like it's not the like the iPhone 8 feels like the culmination of what Apple's done till now and iPhone 10 feels like what
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.140]   They're gonna start doing from this point where they're aiming aiming to yeah
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.020]   They were they're going next so like it's like it's a rev a board and some people just avoid rev a board
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.660]   It's they want to stick with like the calm
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.900]   They would they much rather have the culmination product and let us test the new one and then they'll get iPhone
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:11.820]   10 - or whatever that is. I think I'm sorry handy is absolutely right. It's gonna be it's something different
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.460]   Yeah, I think I think that the thing that would be
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:21.940]   That would be most signifying of hey, this is a new revolution is if they really did say well
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:27.940]   We're gonna be putting the new neural net engines only in the iPhone 10 the iPhone 8 is gonna have to wait for a while
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.620]   For that to scale down a little bit
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:34.820]   But I think the one thing they absolutely did not want to compromise on where let's make sure that all the
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:40.900]   All the technology we have in here that requires machine learning can actually do that very very ably everything
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:47.780]   That's gonna require AR has to do that very very ably and they would never compromise on camera technology
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.260]   To not to the extent of there
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:55.140]   I believe that again having speaking with the authority of someone who has not even touched an iPhone 10
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:01.980]   The I believe that the only things that are going to enhance the camera on the iPhone 10 are going to be things that they can get for free
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:06.940]   By actually having a real 3d face camera up on the front
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:12.020]   So I think that like I said this there's I I'm not I'm not trying to snark on people
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:17.180]   It's perfectly you don't need to explain that I can I can afford the extra money for the iPhone 10
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:22.660]   I like the iPhone 10 I'm going this is a thing. I'm gonna be taking out of my pocket 10 to 40 times a day
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:27.260]   I would like to have and I like to have lovely things. That's why I'm spending extra money for it
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:33.820]   But the only difference on the back is the f2.4 and OIS on the both on both
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:42.140]   That's an important thing. Yeah, but even but even here all so much of the so much of the so much of the real magic in
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:49.460]   Camera improvements is going into computational photography as opposed as opposed to making these making the actual hardware better
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:54.380]   Yeah, it's interesting the first is Google now in this new they you know, they dropped the other shoe
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:13:00.860]   We heard Google's announcement on the pixel to this week and they announced that they didn't need two lenses that that was
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.540]   You know that they could do it with a single lens and they didn't need
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:10.700]   Last year they don't need two cameras. Well, that's that's the truth. They did they don't need two lenses
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:16.500]   But they did use left-right pixels in order to get things like depth. That was really interesting. Yeah, they're doing
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.980]   Yeah, I can't wait to get my hands on it. See how well it works
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:27.620]   The thing one of the things is that they have on one of the people who's leading leading up their computational photography team is this
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:31.860]   Really really smart cookie at from Stanford?
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:37.940]   They heard away from Stanford who used to be like one of the guys you would want to talk to about computational photography
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:41.420]   of one of my picks of the week like years and years ago was a
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.020]   I forget what was called
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:49.560]   But it was it actually let you do sort of depth of field effects by shooting through the camera and basically
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:55.660]   Focus stacking and that was basically a a research project. You released out of Stanford
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:02.780]   About again must been ten years ago nearly by then and he's and he's he retired from teaching
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.940]   I think he's doing one class. He got pulled back for a semester this year
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:14.140]   But it's they've got some pretty pretty cool stuff on there and also the things that they're when they talked about the Google clip camera
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.300]   Just again just to talk about computational photography
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.280]   Here is a camera that you just basically set it up
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.340]   It will wait for what it what looks to be a good picture happening in front of the camera
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.360]   And then it will take that picture if only
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:35.100]   800 people buy this camera it will have done a certain job by saying here is what here is where we think photography is going not necessarily
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.580]   Hooking up a bigger sensor or a bigger lens
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:44.900]   But putting putting better smarts inside that camera so that you never just like so you never actually see
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:50.660]   How bad a picture the image sensor is actually taking it's gonna cook it and it's gonna process it
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.660]   So that by the time it hits your screen it looks beautiful
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:58.540]   And this all the big-foot pictures that way just all the crummy big pictures that camera never took
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.460]   So are you gonna I just did this ice I
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:07.060]   Favourited the the iPhone 10 model. I'm gonna get yes
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.140]   256 silver I think what do you think yeah?
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:15.580]   I'm probably gonna get the space gray just because it'll match the watch that I'm
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.060]   Walking and I'm just that superficial
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.060]   You're just that superficial
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.300]   I just wish I wish you could like buy iPhones the way that you can buy theater seats
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.820]   And wish there's a but you could say do I want to be in the balcony do I want to be the orchestra?
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.900]   Do I want to be like you can just say just best available?
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.900]   I just say whatever I
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:38.700]   Whatever colors available whatever memory amount is available. I just want to own what I just need to own one of these
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:45.220]   Sell me the pink 16 gigabyte one with a cracked screen that no one else is touching nearest neighbor search
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.940]   I want this but give me the closest thing to it you have yeah
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:56.740]   It's a safe bet even on phones you can return them within 14 days so yeah if it if if if
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:00.820]   if you if you want to be if you really are that concerned about the series a
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:08.460]   Motherboards just keep it in the box a week later if people are not getting their eyes blinded by the
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:14.860]   But turns out to be an actual laser dot in the face ID then unbox it take a look at it
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.540]   Oh, that's gonna be a headline now Andy people laser to death by
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:23.460]   Exactly you should not that's why you should not buy and I do not pre-order an iPhone 10
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:28.420]   I'm telling you you'll you'll be you'll regret it if you if you were sitting online there
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:33.300]   Don't do it especially in the bottom 1,150 bucks
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.340]   But that's all right. It's just money, right?
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:42.700]   Pixel wasn't I mean I bought a pixel XL last week and it was not safe. No and actually I think I'll get the iPhone
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:48.540]   Well, I'm being optimistic if I get the iPhone 10 on November 3rd. I'll get it before I wait. I get my pixel
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:53.580]   Is a pixel XL or pixel 40? I can't tell with Roman numerals anymore. What are we supposed to say? Oh?
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:17:00.840]   Interesting good point. I didn't think of that it's 40. I'm gonna get the 40 a 40
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.660]   pixel 240 so
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:10.140]   You saw him Renee so yes is the new iPhone 10 smaller than the 8? I think it is
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:15.260]   It's a it's a little differently shaped like it's a little bit longer than a regular iPhone 8
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260]   But not much. I think it's just a tad thinner and a little bit longer
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.420]   But I didn't have them at the same time. That's just my faulty recollection at work
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.580]   Yeah, it's way smaller than a plus though
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:27.660]   It's a bigger screen because it's a 5.7 inch screen instead of 5.5
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:33.180]   But let of course the bezels are infinitesimal so it deleted all the bezel all the bezel yeah
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:40.620]   Uh, okay. Yeah now one of the rumors also I think from Ming Chi quote is that the next iPad will have
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:47.500]   Face ID built-in as well that they're gonna extend this technology to the iPad will it have the notch?
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.380]   You know that's super interesting
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:54.860]   They went out of their way to make a not like they it would have been easier not to make a notch just to make that
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:18:00.460]   That part of the bezel run all the way across with other manufacturers with the note 8 they just yeah
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:05.260]   And it takes silicon to support that it takes the panel to support that it takes the UI to support that yeah
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:09.660]   You can't just buy a panel from Samsung and cut a chunk out of it. No
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:16.380]   Made that way right you got to fill that chunk with pixels like you got it you got to have the display drivers and everything and you know
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:21.820]   You got to do the curves. It's non trivial. I mean so that they might want that to be their next big identifier
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:27.020]   So this isn't this is a note 8 and yeah, actually even a bigger screen at six inch
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.820]   6.3 inch screen is like that
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.460]   But what they just did is they just have a look they have a bezel that's big enough to hold the camera and stuff and that
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.860]   You Apple could have done that
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.820]   Totally. I feel like they did the notch so it would be physically visually distinctive as much as anything else
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.580]   A lot of people who have them seem to like there's a lot of people already have them
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.700]   And like we've seen this right after the event they're allowed to open carry
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.860]   So a lot of people at Apple are out there testing them and using them doing things with them
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.660]   And from everything i'm hearing that either love it
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.300]   Like it or doesn't bother them. I've never heard anybody like actively come out against the wall
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.340]   Yeah, but they're all Apple employees. I know but sometimes you know
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:07.740]   Sometimes people in Apple grouse a lot like they'll hear them grousing about like the desk arrangements in
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.060]   Apple quarters for example
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.180]   So they will let your they will let their opinions suddenly be known if they have them
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.060]   But a lot of them like the character because it gives them another icon
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:22.300]   When you put them side by side, no one will mistake it for a Samsung or a lg or pixel or and that's part of the point, right?
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.260]   Unless they're running that android app that puts the bar
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.180]   It's on the screen
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.380]   Foiled again
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:35.180]   If I if I live in a San Francisco, I would so want to troll people by running that on my on my Samsung phone and just letting people think
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.260]   Oh my god, look at this person on my phone x
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.180]   I think well
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.060]   My guess is that they they tried it. They
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.180]   I wouldn't say that it was a deliberate choice
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.860]   I think that they you know, they're they're famous for testing and trying everything
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.180]   And I think that what happened was that
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:56.380]   Something that might have seemed disgusting in concept or Steve would never have done it that way
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.060]   And outside Apple sort of pouring view they built it they said
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:04.940]   I mean it doesn't suck does it and then the more they used it they realized that they don't care about it
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.500]   And then they said well, this solves so many problems. We don't have to do this
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.980]   We don't have to fix that we don't have a we don't have to adjust
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:18.060]   The vertical bezel bezel size here. We can do edge to edge as we wanted to and if people get if people react that badly to it
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:24.220]   You're as 18 lines of code. We add it to the os that lets you flip a switch inside settings and just turn the entire
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:28.780]   Turn the both of those ears black so that they completely blend in with the rest of the screen
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.500]   So I I have to I have to say that this is
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.180]   It's it's fun to watch people's reaction to it
[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:39.900]   This is something that really doesn't matter either you like it or you don't like it
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.980]   If you and you are never wrong when you say how something makes you feel
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:48.380]   But when you say that oh, this is this is intrinsically a horrible design
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:53.660]   This is this apple apple would never ship a phone like this. Oh, wait crap. I'm sorry. I'm not I just remembered
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:58.300]   I'm not talking about an android device. I'm talking about an apple device. Oh, well apple did it correctly, you know
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.820]   It we as a community we spend so much time. I think
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:08.860]   Get making a big deal out of things that absolutely do not matter and in the end of the game is clearly just you know
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:13.740]   You know purple flag versus blue flag, you know, you're you've got the wrong flag
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.740]   So therefore I've got to dislike this thing
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.660]   I for feeling will probably just all accept it
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:24.220]   Yeah, I think I'll find it annoying. I don't like after I use it for a week
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:28.220]   I may not notice it, but my gut reaction in the event I was too excited. It was brand new. It was shiny
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.780]   It was flashy. It was HDR. Oh my god. Look as Wonder Woman
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.020]   And I didn't really get to pay attention to it
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:36.780]   My gut reaction just on seeing pictures is that I will not like it and it will bother me
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.780]   But I'm gonna use it for a week or a couple weeks before rendering. Yeah, yeah in opinion
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:46.220]   You get you get used to things like that. Yeah, it's it's not it's not like removing a headphone jack where they're practical
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.100]   Resolve that's still driving crazy if you do if you
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.660]   either again either
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.780]   There'll be three settings people who love it people who don't like it
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:01.100]   But we'll get used to it and then the people who just absolutely hated just just like we've had weekly conversations
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:05.900]   Didn't we about the about the new super super flat keyboards on the macbook purrs that there are
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.580]   I never would
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.860]   Yeah, I actually caused me to abandon the macbook, which is I feel bad
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.500]   I hate to say that because I love the macbook in every other respect, but yeah, so
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:20.620]   It's a little bit. I think it's gonna. I think it's gonna be a little less intense. Yeah, I don't think you'll be that bad
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:25.740]   Well touch bar is also polarizing the touch bar is another thing. I don't I can't get used to
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:32.620]   Well, we will refer listeners to the previous 11 hours. Yeah, we don't need
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:37.260]   I have a data point though. Once the eight came out
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.060]   I talked to my kids
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.380]   Abbie and henry and my mom
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:49.420]   Mary and said would you like a new phone? Hey, I have some I have like the seven plus I could give you and or i'll get you a new eight
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:54.620]   And none of them wanted to upgrade solely because of the I've the headphone jack
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:23:00.220]   All three of them said no no no I need I'm not gonna abandon the headphone jack. I need the headphone jack
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:05.020]   So I thought that was I mean, that's completely anecdotal, but that was a telling data point
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:09.740]   Well again, it's it's not it's I think one of the difficulties there is that
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:14.620]   You're not giving me something. It's not like they said we by the way, we deleted the headphone jack
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.780]   But that's because we've added this new thing called bluetooth
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:21.260]   So now you can have wireless headphones. They said no you've you had bluetooth and you had wired headphones
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.460]   We're taking one of those things away from you right now and we're not
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:29.260]   And I think if they could put if there was an invoice of like on a new car
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:35.500]   It's oh by the way, we saved you 18 cents by removing the headphone track at least I could have 18 cents in my hand
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.580]   At least I could you know go back to 1971 and buy a coke with that
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.420]   All three of those people abby henry and mary have headphones they like to use
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.380]   Yeah, they didn't want to replace the headphones as good as the air
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.260]   I love the air pods. I just bought a second pair because I lost my first one
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.940]   Yeah, but uh, there's our adapters when people lose the adapters. Are they inconvenient?
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.900]   It's in the adapters inconvenient. I I mean I have
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.540]   I carry my air pods and an adapter
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.420]   but but uh
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.660]   Yeah, I can I can I can I should have an adapter in it
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:07.260]   You can really pull out an adapter right from the airplane and it may not be fully logical
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.020]   You know, you can say well, you just you know, you if you have a favorite pair of headphones
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.100]   You just connect the adapter to it
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:19.180]   And leave it that way and that was those are those are lightning then you get on a plane and you take them off and you put the adapter somewhere
[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.940]   I'm gonna grant that it may not be fully logical, but uh
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.980]   It's definitely there. It's out there in the world that people are saying well, I you know, I want my head
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.100]   I miss parts of it. They google say why they deleted the headphone jack that they have a
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.180]   I'm assuming they didn't say courage
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:40.620]   They saw another company play that car they saw how well that one played out. Don't say courage whatever you do
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:45.980]   No interestingly google didn't even uh mention it. They just uh, they just drew I deleted it
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:51.980]   They they knew that people would figure it out. Yeah, I think the thing is the thing is I think it's it really is like baggage fees
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.540]   For check bags where there was
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:59.260]   Well, there's well there was a company there had to be one company that said, you know what?
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.460]   We're gonna just simply start charging you 15 bucks per bag
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:07.900]   In an environment where everybody and instead of all the other companies crump playing say oh, we would never do that
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:13.180]   They said oh a penguin has jumped off the ice flow into the water. Let's see what happens that first penguin
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:18.620]   Yeah, I mean they the real is it was never a question of oh, I I lost the headphone jack
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.020]   And that was the most wonderful thing that could have possibly done for me
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:25.980]   And I would thank goodness it was I am not willing to switch to a completely different
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:30.300]   Phone platform just to get the headphone jack back. I don't like it
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.940]   But I don't really feel as though I have that much of a choice in the matter
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:39.580]   So it's it's when you have it's when you make more serious changes like again like the keyboard and I'm I'm sort of in
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.780]   I'm sort of in your boat where I've I've
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:47.740]   I told you a while ago that I got a think pad a Lenovo think pad which has the
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.940]   Really probably the best
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.140]   Across the board keyboard you can find on a laptop these days
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:59.100]   And so that's the upstairs computer the macbook is the downstairs computer
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.860]   So I don't no longer you know, track this unplug and go up up and down with them
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:07.340]   And I have to say I'm I'm starting to like bring the think pad downstairs because
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:10.220]   the even my even my 20
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.140]   2016
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:17.980]   MacBook keyboard is not feeling very good compared to a really good notebook keyboard
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.300]   And it's like oh god. I
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.140]   Everything everything about this notebook
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.220]   I love except for the operating system
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.300]   It runs and except for the software that it runs
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.620]   And then yeah, and I would love a mac book because I love the operating system and all of the software
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:35.020]   But I can't use that keyboard and if I feel like it's a failing on my part
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.060]   I really do like I should just oh no again. It's
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:44.700]   You you this is something just just like the phone is something you use it all the time and you guys especially you're writing all the time
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.100]   I don't even write that yeah, but I'm totally keep like I said
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:53.740]   I'm keyboard resilient. I go from an iPad the apple smart keyboard to a macbook to a macbook pro and within five minutes
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.740]   My brain is just like oh whatever type
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:00.140]   You know actually bad for a reviewer because I had stronger opinion. It's yeah
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.860]   Well, I mean I switch I switch between keyboards all the time too
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:07.420]   I mean right right here in the office. I've got like these two keyboards plus the
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:12.540]   I'm this is not this is not a joke plus I've got the
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:17.660]   One of my favorite apple keyboards the old fashioned like old fashioned macbook keyboard
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:22.940]   Which I use when I need to podcast and so I need to be able to type silently and then when I'm typing
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.860]   an anger
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:29.100]   Like for for money. I've got like the the really good like code clicky keyboard
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.420]   So I'm switching over and over and over again
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.940]   It's just that I will say objectively that
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.180]   excuse me my
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.180]   Objectively is a strong word
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.220]   It's the what that's the the keyboard on the macbook is the one where
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:46.940]   Doesn't matter how long I've been using it. It doesn't matter the use case
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.700]   I'm always hating that keyboard. But again, that's a the other conversation
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.500]   I find it hard to switch to the 15 inch one the 13 inch one is fine for me
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.860]   But when I go to the 15 inch one I make tons of mistakes. I wonder if it's just a scaling thing
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.340]   And then I'm back on the 13. I'm fine
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:05.580]   Let's take a break lots more to talk about including swelling batteries. How serious is it? I don't know
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:10.620]   But I'm sure you guys will have an opinion more about the new apple
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.900]   Products we could talk a little bit about how the google products
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:21.420]   Compare google going head to head with apple in the home speaker space. So is sonos for that matter
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.820]   It's oh, I thought you're gonna say the headphone jack deletion space
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.100]   They own apple owns the headphone jack deletion space
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.700]   We did this first and we got zero credit now
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:36.300]   And google are getting actually let's be fair the very first Android phone the HTC made
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:42.300]   G1 did not have a headphone jack and I had a tilt or something and early HTC windows phone that didn't have one either
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.300]   I had this horrible little breakout cable
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:49.580]   And I used to I used to have this really horrible like apple phone
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:54.860]   I think was called an iPhone where you had to have special adapter to plug in like it was
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.820]   You talk about the kick in the pants. I mean you used a regular analog thing
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:02.860]   But how about a custom analog goodness? I plugged the adapter into my lightning my air
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:07.020]   Lightning after my air pods didn't wired air pods an alley. I didn't help
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.260]   I thought I could wire my air pods
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:15.660]   Someone actually asked us that instead if you plug the lightning headphones into the air pods case
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.420]   Do you have wireless headphones? We had to say no sadly does it does not work that way?
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.780]   No, no, no
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:25.260]   You can fit the case into your ear canal. Yeah, you got it. I don't say that we're sending us a picture
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.060]   *laughs*
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.060]   Our show today brought to you by Jamf
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.860]   Does Jamf stand for something?
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.340]   J-A-M-F
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.820]   It probably does and deep in the deep prehistory, but everybody who knows max knows Jamf
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:46.540]   Jamf makes Jamf now is uh really nice. They make apple management software for it folks
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.060]   And they make now a really nice product called Jamf now
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:56.220]   It's an on-demand mobile device management solution for apple devices if you uh if you work in an environment where
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:30:01.980]   You've got a bunch of apple devices. You've got to keep track of ipads, ipads, ipons and macintashes
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.940]   Jamf now is awesome. You know, it's easy
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:11.020]   It was easy for us when we first started we had a handful of ipads a handful of macintashes
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.140]   We could do it on our own, but as you start to grow
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:19.580]   You buy more tech free employees. It's harder to keep track of everything ipads and ipads and max
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.060]   We have a ton of them fortunately
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:28.380]   We've got Jamf now if you if you lose an ipad you can secure it remotely with Jamf now
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:35.580]   It makes management tasks like deploying wifi passwords securing company data in forcing passcodes simple
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:39.820]   And by the way very affordable. It's inexpensive Jamf now
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:45.340]   Let's you easily set up devices exactly like you want them with the accounts the applications all
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.460]   You know the settings that you need in your workspace
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.420]   So you don't you know that makes it really great for your employees
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.060]   remotely configure settings too
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:31:00.060]   With the like wifi passwords and email account information. So for instance if you're in the situation, which is not unusual
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:06.300]   Uh, where you decide to change the wifi password because it's been compromised or maybe you just that's your policy to change that every month
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:12.380]   You don't have to send an email out saying the new password is you can actually change it on the phones directly with Jamf now
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:18.300]   Email account information same thing protect sensitive information you can even lock or wipe a device if an employee
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:25.820]   Walks out the door. Don't worry your data won't you can centrally deploy apps view device details get a 360 degree view of your inventory
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:31.140]   And you don't need to be 19 wizards you just need Jamf now so go to Jamf j

[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:10.220]   People keep saying why aren't you talking more about the swelling iPhones?
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:14.460]   Because how many are there total seven six six?
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:18.220]   Yeah, I think there's six still which is I think we talked about this last week
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.060]   I talked to jerry hildenbrand who's like an actual
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:25.820]   Engineer like he can get into electronics and do things with them and he was giving me this the the average
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:31.740]   It's it's something like one out of every so many thousand hours at lithium ion batteries have a failure rate for and
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:35.500]   All of the my own batteries fail because they're not a stable technology
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.300]   We just we know we use them because they're the best thing we have
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.540]   It's when that rate of failure becomes
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:45.420]   Excessive when it's a much higher rate than what you'd expect and then you you have a problem
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.500]   That's what happened with the galaxy note, but right now
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:52.140]   Every I mean every phone has failures every year you can search meshes boards or forums or anything and find them
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:57.580]   Uh, it's just we're hypersensitive now because we're all used to the huge bruhaha that we had with the the galaxy
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.460]   Note seven and airplanes announcing them and you know
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:07.340]   Massive amounts of how many how many iPhone 8s do you think apples sold? It's got to be millions right millions
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.540]   Yeah, there's millions out there
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:12.460]   So if you have a failure rate of one thousandth of one percent
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:16.620]   I mean, I don't know a seven out of millions is a very low failure rate
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.500]   I don't I don't think it's cause for concern. I think it happens every time
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:24.620]   Totally and I asked Jerry his big takeaway was that oh look how nicely it splits open to prevent it from incentive
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:30.060]   Actually, that's a good point if the if the note seven had done that you wouldn't have the fires
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:33.580]   But it was so tiny in there that you get short circuits
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:38.380]   Yeah, that's a good. Yeah, that's like having breakaway panels or something. That's a good point
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:39.500]   Yeah
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.220]   Yep, that's that's a good point to make every every time there's a brand new
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.740]   Model of something really really big and really really popular
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.260]   Don't
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:50.940]   You're you're gonna see you're gonna see reports like this for the first couple of weeks
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:55.180]   The question is do you see reports like that for the next month month and a half?
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.020]   Do they tend to escalate do they tend to mount?
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:01.020]   And so if you have just one isolated incident of this happening
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:06.460]   Then that's law of averages. And so don't worry. Don't worry about the the line as a whole
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:12.220]   When when apple had its antenna problems, everybody was experiencing that and it didn't go away after a couple of weeks
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.780]   And that was clearly a problem with the design
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:19.660]   But this is not the times that we've seen like remember when they the I the first
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:24.860]   iPhone 6 plus came out and people were concerned. They're oh, it's it's made out of it's made out of
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:33.340]   Out of out of wallpaper paste it bends like like nothing. Okay. No, you can find people who wound up bending their phones
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:38.220]   Uh, they were not it's not they didn't necessarily treat these things poorly
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:44.780]   But the fact that you didn't really see this as a widespread epidemic indicates that this is just something that can happen to this phone
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:51.180]   It's opposed to a design defect. So show show me show me thousands of batteries that are doing this again
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:54.700]   At a scale of where they're expecting to sell maybe 10 million a quarter
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:35:01.020]   You would have to really have hundreds or thousands of these batteries having a problem before you'd have to say this is a design problem as opposed to
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:06.620]   Again law of averages. Yeah, I don't want to sound like last year that we're apple watch the first generation apple pot watches
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:10.220]   We're swelling and the front cover was coming off and apple just replaced them. I think there was like
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.700]   Happened to mine. I was one of the people that had happened too
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.740]   And they just they just announced that you bring it in and they change it
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:19.660]   I think it was a couple dozen in the end out of however many million the first apple watch yet
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.660]   My first pair of airpods had that same problem. Yeah, these things happen
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:28.940]   Uh, I don't want to be an apologist and we'll certainly keep an eye on it and if it continues that might be an issue
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:33.260]   but at this point seven failures is not a significant
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:40.220]   Issue and somebody's saying well if you had seven failures on an airplane. Yeah, but nobody's nobody's been hurt
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:46.460]   Anybody who had this happened presumably brought it to apple and they I'm sure not only do they want you to
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:50.700]   Yes, they'll immediately replace it. They want to study it. So they there's no
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.900]   No issue
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.220]   Also, if you have impact like if you do drop a phone and there's significant impact keep an eye on it because again
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:59.340]   Lithium batteries are not the stable things in the world. So panic
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:04.780]   It's it's contained fury, but you know, just keep an eye on them and if you have any problem at all, please take them in immediately
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.420]   Here's some good news
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:13.100]   And actually kind of interesting news future mark, which does benchmarking
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:21.420]   Benchmarked old iPhone devices is well, actually they didn't have to because they collect in the database benchmark results
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.020]   They have a hundred thousand results for seven different iPhone models
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.580]   So these are people using future mark
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:32.540]   And they they wanted to see is it true that if iPhones get slower over time
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:36.540]   People often say, ah, you know my iPhone is so sluggish now
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:42.780]   The good news updated wants me to buy a new phone. Right. Yeah, they borked my phone just so I get a new one
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.100]   Look how flat that curve is
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.820]   uh, there is this
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.140]   virtually zero
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:55.500]   Change uh, and it's not always by the way of slower sometimes it's fast
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.700]   or
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.540]   the gpu there's a
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:02.140]   Maybe uh, it just doesn't look like this is an issue at all
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:05.020]   There's a couple of important things to note about this though
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:10.460]   One is that, um, iPhone slow a lot of these reports come out every september because google trends
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:16.060]   Spikes for that search result and the thing to remember is that every iphone is updated all at the same time
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:22.940]   Everywhere on every carrier for every model that's supported and that means that everybody who does think the other problem will be googling for all at once
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:29.180]   Where other phones are updated throughout the year at different paces in different areas on different carriers for different models
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.980]   So people who are searching for galaxy s something slow
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:37.980]   There's no it's not everyone in humanity all at the same time doing it those search results are normalized across the entire year
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:41.900]   And the other thing is they are only testing for processor performance
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:48.620]   And that's to show that apple did not put code in there to deliberately make your processors lower or deliberately make your cpu slower
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:56.060]   It doesn't say whether this version of ios wasn't as well optimized or dropped frames or developers didn't support older versions of apps as well
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.260]   And they're slower to launch or slower to have um, you know
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.260]   All those things can be true and apple has a performance team
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:08.620]   There's a team called the performance team that they have their job is to make sure these devices run really fast
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:15.900]   They have older models a lot of people in apple and all the organizations use older models as part of that testing and also all their families
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:20.540]   They're you know, their parents their siblings their kids their friends use older iphones
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:24.940]   So they would be really angry if anything was done artificially make those iphones slow
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:30.860]   It's just that they're releasing so many versions and one it's not until you get in the hands of millions of people that you really see
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:37.740]   What you need to optimize in the code, which is why dot one and dot two are usually much better performing than dot zero ever is it's also
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:43.180]   Something apple doesn't need to do people want new iphones they will buy them
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:46.620]   You don't have to see art officially to create a smartphone
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.980]   So they want you to feel there's value and like longer term value in good point
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.740]   also
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:58.300]   Second hand iphone uses kind of their response to how come you're not selling an 80 dollar phone like like the android's ecosystem does
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.500]   Uh, and you and you get back to something that we've been saying
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:05.740]   For everyone's was saying for like 10 15 20 years of the the computer that you buy
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:12.780]   Unlike a car will always run the the always do the thing you bought it for with the apps that you started using it with
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:17.580]   Exactly as well on day 10,000 at it as it did on day one
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:22.620]   So if you have your iphone five or your iphone five and you've been using
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:29.900]   Essentially the same class and suite of apps. It'll certainly run great. Like rene says it's kind of it's kind of I would I would require
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:34.460]   Incredibly good proof that apple was intentionally trying to sandbag older phones
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.140]   uh, I
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:39.260]   You do tend I do think you run to performance problems when you
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:47.020]   Start running apps that are that were not be that that were not around when the developers start
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:50.620]   Excuse me when you start running apps that are really designed for modern hardware
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:55.580]   Where the developer really isn't running it on a iphone five to see what it looks like on an iphone five
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.260]   Then sure it's going to seem sluggish
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:02.940]   Particularly if you've got if you've got the third hand me down and you see that mom or dad who's got the iphone eight
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:08.620]   And the iphone 10 that my god this this this instagram filter runs so much faster on this other phone
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.700]   So yeah, it's it's like it's apple has way too much
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.980]   Require requires way too much of the older phones
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:21.660]   To intentionally send back performance like that and and I install as new just as a tip
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:24.060]   If you do think your iphone is slower you're having a lot of problems
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:30.220]   It is a complete pain in the apps to do but I typically install new on at least one phone every time because I feel like that's the clean start
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:37.020]   No bit rot no incompatibilities. No problems with old backups just a fresh start and that hardware will usually last a while
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:41.100]   Not a bad idea and if you yeah if it's getting slow wipe the phone and start over
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:46.700]   Especially with so much to sync now so much data is in the cloud and so much to sync does not nearly as onerous as it used to be to be installed
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:51.980]   Not not only that but it's some you know how it is you there'll be a 99 cent app or it's a free app with
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.420]   with
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.420]   A&AP purchases and
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.660]   After about eight or nine months. You don't realize that I have 231 apps on my phone
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:04.140]   How did that happen and it really and it really is a lot faster. Just simply say what if I just simply
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.740]   I will simply zorch this phone start from scratch again
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:12.140]   And I will not you know, I will not visit the app store and look for apps to install
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:17.660]   I will simply and this is this is something that I do with every new device including every new uh new laptop that I have
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:21.420]   It's when I just when it at the point which I need BB edit
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.780]   That's when I download BB edit at the point at which I need microsoft word
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.580]   That's when I download microsoft word and after two or three weeks
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.500]   I've realized that it's been a week since I downloaded everything anything and oh my god
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:38.460]   I've gone from 230 something apps down to like 41. It's funny. You should say that because I've just this last couple of weeks
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:43.660]   Uh on the radio show have added a new security recommendation, which is
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:49.580]   Exactly that don't install anything install when you need it and not before then
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:54.540]   Because every app you install it's more true on computers than it does on the phones
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:59.020]   But it's true for everywhere every app you install has the potential for adding flaws
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:06.300]   Reliability issues and even security issues and so if you know, I do I we all you know
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:11.020]   Reinstall all our apps and that's a mistake. I recently went through a prune
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:15.500]   Uh actually did on my android device preparing for the new pixel
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:19.420]   And I got 60 or 70 apps I deleted that I had just hadn't used
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:25.340]   I do love there's a new feature in the iphone that I really liked did they add this an iOS 11 Renee and notices
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:29.740]   It says if you don't will delete apps you don't use basically
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:34.700]   It'll keep the data if you need them again, but it'll remove them to if you're if you're low on storage
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.100]   It'll remove them to create space and then redownload them
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:42.220]   And I saw I said turn that on and I have some apps that have a little icon that says well
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:45.820]   It's not on your phone, but if you need it, we'll get it. I think that's a great
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:50.460]   It's super important too because increasingly messaging apps are becoming platforms
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.500]   And when you have old messaging now, so we saw that with Skype a couple months ago
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:56.860]   Where all of a sudden you're getting dms from friends telling you to click on links
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.620]   And you think it's a friend and you click on it
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:02.780]   And then you're the next person who's victimized or you get it in WhatsApp or a twitter DM or something
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.700]   And if you're not using a messaging app, it's one less attack vector for people to it
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:11.340]   So where do you turn that feature on is it an iphone storage in general?
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.500]   Yeah, it should be in the app store. I believe it'll double check
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:17.900]   Somewhere there's a settings app store settings app store. Let me check
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:22.060]   This is something I just stumbled on and I went wow, that's a great
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:26.620]   The very bottom off offload unused apps. Okay, so if you go to settings
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.940]   iTunes and app store items at the bottom
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:34.860]   It's uh, there's a switch offload unused apps automatically remove unused apps but keep all documents and data
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:37.020]   Reinstalling the apple
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:42.620]   Place back your data if the app is still available in the app store that is that turn that on
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:46.220]   Right away, right? That is a that is fantastic
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.700]   Anything you can do to make a smaller
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:54.060]   Yes, the bane of my existence video. So that is a that is a nice
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:44:00.300]   A nice feature, but in the first place don't install them in the first place and you and you'll save yourself a lot of
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.180]   Yeah, I'm just curious how many apps I have on here
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:07.580]   Let's say it also bears mentioning that a lot of these apps in the background are going to sap your battery a little bit
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:12.220]   Right. So you and so like I said, I think that a lot of the lot of complaints are people
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:15.820]   With old phones with new operating systems again, it's slower, but also oh my god
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.820]   What would it hit my batteries taking?
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:22.220]   Again, I see I do this in real life as well. There's every 10 years or so
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.100]   I do what I call the big edit which is I have to
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.420]   I have to go through every
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.980]   I go I go I go through every single thing
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:34.060]   The goal is to put eyes or hands on every single object I own
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:38.940]   Both like inside the house and in storage everywhere and try to make the decision
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:43.100]   I put this in the storage five years ago because I thought I could do something with it
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.820]   I now have no emotional attachment to it. I'm gonna get rid of it
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.780]   That's and that's also when that's also what I tried
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.780]   I'm doing this like just before Halloween
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:56.540]   So it looks like like everybody who comes to my house is gonna get some sort of like off brand mp3 player from
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.380]   2006
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:02.060]   2007 like oh, thank you a yuosho
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:07.100]   Player oh good 30 songs in my pocket. Thank you very much mr
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.620]   Not go there is a
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:12.060]   Swedish term I read this I must have read it on reddit where else would you read it?
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:18.460]   But there's a Swedish term for what you do in your life as you get older and you start getting rid of things so your
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:26.700]   Your children aren't stuck with all your crap when you die and it's a it's a it's a great
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.700]   Like shot in junka or something. Yeah, it's like shot in junka. It is
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:33.740]   It's the kidding. It includes eight matches
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:39.260]   Georgia gave me a great tip a little while ago because like she said never go through a drawer and just take stuff out
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.260]   You don't think you want you take everything out of the drawer
[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:46.140]   Then only put back what you absolutely want to keep and it results in you get rid of way more things in the other way around
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:51.260]   I like that. Yeah, Georgia has probably a lot of tricks like that. She's very awesome life hacker
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:57.020]   Yeah, that is a good look so that's but so do that with your phone delete stuff or as or better yet
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:01.420]   Uh the equivalent of taking everything out and only putting back the stuff you need is
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:08.060]   Wipe your phone when you get a new phone wipe it and start from scratch and only install stuff as you as you need it
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.260]   You'll get from orbit. It's the only way to be sure you get from orbit
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:15.100]   Uh
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.900]   Good news. I guess if you're an apple fan
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.460]   Uh the average american
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:25.740]   If you're a shareholder. Yeah, if you're apple shareholder owns more than two apple products
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:33.340]   This is the cnbc whoops first a button and I went to the wrong page. This is the cnbc all america economic survey
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:41.980]   64 percent of americans now own at least one apple product the average american household reports owning 2.6
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.140]   apple products
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.260]   Of course
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:49.100]   Income has something to do with it the wealthiest americans own 4.7
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:53.660]   per household the poorest americans won but even they have one
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:56.460]   Which is just remarkable
[00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.940]   Renee how much are you skewing these results?
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:07.100]   I think I think just the three of us alone have pushed this way over illegal to bands count because if bands count we're having
[00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:10.300]   Oh, no, you just totally changed my gotta read through the math
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:15.740]   Let's just say all bands cat is one apple product. Yeah, uh, yeah
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.780]   I'm just sitting here with uh three apple products in my pocket
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:25.020]   You know, I have an iPad i phone and apple watch and then there's max at home and there's multiple uh phones multiple ipads
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.220]   Yeah
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.340]   So that's uh, that's kind of that's I don't think you could I can't think of
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:36.220]   What other category what are their what other company would you say 64 percent of americans own at least one?
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.780]   Kleenex sony in their heyday
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:40.780]   I don't know. Um, I was back in there
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:47.260]   I would say if you're if you're gonna include components sam song has to be in there
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.340]   Because they'll they've got components inside every iphone. Well, that's true so many other
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:53.580]   Enan flash belongs to them
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:58.400]   Well, we talked about this last week sam song makes more money off the iphone 8 than it does off the note
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:02.720]   A to the essay because it makes some like there's like sam song parts
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:06.560]   Like google makes so much money off iphone search, you know, it's like everyone's making money off the yeah
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:13.440]   It just shows you when you have something this phenomenally successful. It spins off money. Oh, it's like god gravity
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.840]   His mice falling off it all it's making it rain everywhere it goes
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.800]   I need that jeff leo with an iphone making it rain
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.080]   Uh, yeah apple tv at home
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:26.480]   Uh, have you got your new apple tv yet rene?
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.880]   I do yeah, and I have the lg
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.040]   Seven was it's uh c7 p
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.920]   Uh, ole at hdr tv you did a review of it
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.160]   So I think I think we talked about that last week
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:40.880]   Can't stop looking at it once you go like it again. It's not the 4k. It's the hdr once you get hdr
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:47.920]   You can't go back. Yep. It's like getting yes. It's like a layer of gray has been removed from your world. Yeah. Yeah, it's true
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:53.040]   Uh, let's see. I felt the same way when my sister moved out of the house
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:49:00.240]   By the way, 64 percent of american say their time on their smartphone is mostly productive and useful
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.760]   27 say it's mostly unproductive
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.680]   and uh
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:11.840]   Young people mid-westerners and those with a high school education only are most likely to report wasting time
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:17.280]   On their smartphones a lot of that's a lot of uh, candy crush players a lot of
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:21.120]   You know, I think the 64 aren't just not being honest with themselves
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:27.520]   I think I think it's pretty obvious most of the time you spent on a lot a smartphone is is wasted as for usage is
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.880]   Dominated by phone calls emails and text followed by social media
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:36.880]   Few americans say watching videos playing games and shopping are the main uses for their hand hope
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:41.760]   Surprise phone calls are still that high. I am too. I think really social media for me anyway
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:46.800]   And messaging and messaging together and I consider messaging kind of like social media, right?
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.560]   It's it's interesting
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.800]   But overall it continues to be the case says cnbc
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:59.840]   There were 800 respondents by the way in a margin error of plus and minus 3.5 percentage points
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:03.040]   Overall it continues to be the case the smartphone is
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:08.640]   Really helping the american worker helping the american family be efficient with their time and accomplish more than they could otherwise
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.040]   And I think people recognize and appreciate that
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:15.440]   Well, yeah, they don't understand that we can waste time with anything later. We don't have a smartphone to waste time
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.000]   I use always time with mud and cardboard, right?
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:25.360]   Uh, I thought that was uh, but yeah, that's pretty encouraging news for apple. It just shows
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.800]   Over and over. I mean that what a dominant
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:32.000]   brand apple is
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.240]   It has become
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.880]   I think well, it also shows how faithful
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:42.480]   Apple users are that I think that they're I think that like first is with android with windows
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.840]   They're people who use these things and they may even like these things
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:52.240]   But they don't feel any sort of emotional attachment to anyone logo. They'll be they'll they'll have they might have a linovo
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.880]   Lenovo
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.880]   notebook and but then a del desktop and then
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:02.800]   Another device then a smart device made by somebody else with if you had a good start with an iphone you are
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   Presume you are probably going to think favorably about a macbook and then when apple comes up with their own tv box
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.200]   You're gonna see it's
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.040]   You're not you don't have to be a fanboy to think well
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.480]   Maybe the first thing i'm going to look at is this apple one because I like apple products
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:21.520]   They're done right by me, uh, and they'll I know they'll will they'll work well with what I have so
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:28.720]   Let's take a little break lots more to talk about andi and akoschicago sun times rene richie i'mor.com or show today
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.440]   uh brought to you by
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:35.200]   I love it. It's like a lottery. It's a mystery. I t
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:39.920]   Oh, all right. Just look at the screen. I could have said it pro tv
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:45.120]   It pro tv is is one of uh one of twits great success stories
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:51.760]   Uh tim broon and uh don pazette came to us. Uh, I had done an nab panel on
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:56.240]   Uh twit and what we were doing they were fans of the screen savers. They were also though
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:02.400]   It trainers and they've been doing it for a long time after the panel at nab they came up and said
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.920]   Would you mind if we made an it training?
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:12.720]   Business that's similar to twit but it focuses on it and it skills. I said by all means
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.880]   Go right ahead
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:22.160]   And it pro tv was born and I have to say at this point. It's completely eclipsed to it. They now have five
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.880]   Studios
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:30.000]   120 we do twit does about I don't know 30 hours of content a week. They do 125 hours
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.720]   Every week they have
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:38.480]   1000 hours that's got to be out of date. They've got even more now more than 2000 hours of uh
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:43.680]   online on demand training in every possible
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:48.000]   It field including a lot of max stuff max management basics

[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.320]   I know people who have it on their big screen tv at home
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:15.440]   And then they get in the car and they keep listening on their phone and they get to work
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.520]   And they will stream it on their computer
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:22.960]   It's a great way either to get that first job and it to get those certs that make it possible, but also

[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:36.480]   Um
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:42.640]   Apple will not give off its uh ambitions for creating great tv content
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:47.520]   Haven't done it yet, but they did remember higher two sony executives and now they've done a deal
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.480]   Was steven spielberg. Okay?
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:55.120]   They're gonna be a part of them. Yeah, I've heard of him. Did you see the documentary on spielberg?
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:58.560]   Uh, I did not oh on hbo must see
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:05.920]   Fantastic. Awesome. And you may or may not remember he did a sci-fi series in the mid-80s called amazing stories
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.480]   Didn't last that long but did win five me awards
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:13.520]   Uh apple's gonna has bought the rights. They're gonna create 10 new episodes
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:17.520]   With nbc universal and the spielberg's ambling entertainment
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:22.720]   Five million an episode so that's a big 50 million dollar commitment here
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:26.880]   spielberg will be executive producer according to the wall street journal
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:30.240]   This is the first uh
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:37.120]   Series they've taken on since they hired those two zak van amberg and jamerillik from uh from sony
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:43.520]   Those those two produce shows like breaking bad the crown better called saul and so they have some pretty good shops
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:46.400]   so
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:49.600]   Yeah, plan is about this eddy. I'm sorry, uh, lemm
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:52.000]   We talked about this years ago. Are you thinking me is eddy q?
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:57.440]   Come on don't say that I was gonna say an eddy q thing and then I transitioned and only half of brain transition
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:01.600]   But we were talking about this for years on mac break, especially Alex about apple getting into their own
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:07.200]   Content well, but then they did plan of the apps and carpool karaoke and that we thought oh jeez
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:11.360]   But this will be the first show that is I think a little closer to the mark
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:18.560]   Yeah, yeah, also it's it's it leverages what's so important about this kind of television where
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:23.200]   Amazing stories. I think it lasted two seasons. Wasn't it? Yeah, only two. Yeah, two or three
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.600]   And each one was like a little movie
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:29.760]   It wasn't like it wasn't like all these reboots of the twilight zone where it's like minimal sets
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:36.080]   Let's move the entire production to wherever canada outsources its movie a movie of video production out to
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:39.920]   Exactly
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:46.480]   And what works great is these series that don't have to return ratings on an episode by episode basis
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:53.280]   Where the the idea is in is investing in a collection of episodes that are people going to be coming back to time and time and time again
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:58.560]   Me for everyone sakes. We saw cbs to the the entire new series of a star star trek
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:05.680]   Directly to streaming because they think they partly because they need something to get to get the the age
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.760]   the average age of the
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:13.360]   CBS CBS viewer on streaming a little bit down. It's all like bob new heart show and csi
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:17.600]   But also because this way they can actually shoot the entire the entire series
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:22.640]   They know that they're going to have a new thing that they can then sell in per per in perpetuity
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:29.200]   Without having to resolve without having to respond to a how come it got beaten by the big bang theory repeats three weeks in
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:35.200]   So this is I would much rather see them do something like this which has the possibility if it's like anything like it's
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:40.480]   Originator to be interesting and unique and deeply deeply wonderfully weird
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:43.600]   Then something knock off of the apprentice
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:51.840]   I'm sorry a knockoff of a shark tank and then a for an expanded version of a really funny six minute video thing on
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:54.480]   12 30 a.m. Talk show as good as it is
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:58.720]   I do I do think that it'll this
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.480]   This
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:07.440]   It all started with HBO really creating that kind of super high quality television and the reason I've talked to creators who
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.440]   Who have gone to HBO?
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:16.400]   The reason people went to HBO is because they got freedom. They got money. They got budget but more importantly for them
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.400]   They're creatives. They got the freedom
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:25.520]   Apple needs to do the same thing it needs to show creatives that this is a good place to bring your projects
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:30.560]   That will not just give you money, but that you will have creative freedom
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.040]   You'll be able to make something high quality you'll get an audience
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:39.200]   Although I think audience is almost secondary when you go to you know HBO. You're not you're not you're guaranteed smaller
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:44.560]   It's not yes, it's not it's not the audience. It's getting maintaining and increasing subscription basis
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:47.520]   Well for Apple's point of view but I'm saying several creators point of view
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:52.000]   I'm people like Dana Brunetti who was this close to going with a major
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:57.840]   standard network provider but got a call from Netflix the night before they signed the deal and
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.080]   Decided to sell house of cards and Netflix partly it was a hundred million dollars
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:06.800]   But what Dana Brunetti said was he's the producer for trigger Street that produced house of cards
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.560]   Uh, it was it was the thing that he liked weirdly enough
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:15.680]   And that Kevin space he liked was that they would do a whole series at once so people could binge it
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.680]   They thought that was important
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.000]   And uh, they really liked that compared to what HBO or whoever else they were talking to would have done
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.560]   It's that kind of thing that apple can offer them
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:28.160]   Uh creatives are so I think getting spielberg
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:35.360]   Is a is a very important start now spielberg being executive producer mare may merely mean they write him a check every week
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:39.040]   Uh, but if they could get him to direct an episode for instance
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:43.520]   If you could really see that somebody likes of spielberg's caliber was just attaching his name
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.520]   It helps
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.960]   And get the word out. This is a good place to do content
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.840]   That's what's going to have to happen before apple can can create these prestige products
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:57.760]   They're gonna have to show some shows that's hitting that was the criticism previously is that apple's talking about it
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.760]   But we don't know what an apple tv show means and this is their chance to show creatives in the industry
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.600]   What an apple tv show means? Yeah?
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:08.160]   Well, well like you said they have to offer these creators something other than an audience and right now
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.720]   Who looking at the minute audience netflix and given the audience apple tv apple cannot give an audience
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.920]   But you tell you to give you the worst examples
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.480]   This is why people are screaming away from from network television. There's a blog that I read
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:24.640]   Written by a ken levine might be levi and i'm sorry for pressing this pressing name
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:28.160]   But he's been writing and directing tv for the past 20 or 30 years
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:32.720]   And he does q&a every single friday and he just it just seems so horrible
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.840]   What's been happening in network television over the past 10 or 15 years?
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:42.080]   He says that so when asked him a question about hey, there's a guy who in this episode of frager who said this one line who was he
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:45.760]   Oh, well, that's a friend of the cast or whatever and then he goes on to say that there was a that was that
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:49.360]   That was back in the time where if you had if you had an actor who only had to say one line
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.400]   You could just cast whoever you whoever you thought was going to do a good job
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:58.080]   But these days even if it's just one line the network needs to see five choices and needs to approve the choice
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:03.120]   And when you in that sort of environment when you give them an option of we will give you your budget
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:11.360]   All we ask you to do is to deliver these episodes on time and we don't we we don't even know how to drive from silicon valley to where your studio is
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:15.520]   So don't just deliver it on time. That's got to be a huge huge attraction
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:20.240]   I wouldn't be surprised if spielberg did direct the first episode. I think there's actually some
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:25.760]   Some I remember when boardwalk empire got started produced by martin scur saysy
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:30.320]   One of the reasons why he directed the first episode and one of the reasons why is that if you direct the first episode
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.320]   You have a piece of the entire series
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:37.040]   Even if you're even if you're not martin scur saysy even if you're not steven spielberg, but it would also just be
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.880]   Who's not going to tune in just to see anything directed by steven spielberg?
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.040]   Yeah, his trail
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:45.280]   Yeah, yeah
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.280]   Yeah, the original director also often shows
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:52.960]   Creates the language that other directors follow in doing the show. It's a huge. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:58.640]   Uh, so good news. I think that's very encouraging news for apples efforts
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.800]   It's not clear, but I think I hope
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:05.840]   They don't do this, but I guess that they'll make it an apple music exclusive right and you have to have apple
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:10.320]   At least first then you'll be able to buy it on itunes or something. Oh, maybe it would be nice because I don't
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:15.120]   Really don't want apple music. I guess I would subs I guess I would subscribe to it if it was the only way
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:19.040]   That's what they want. They want to have enough good content that you subscribe and keep renewing that subscription
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:25.360]   I'll need a better name eventually though than well, but it's it's interesting because really there's not much differentiator between spotify
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:30.880]   Google music amazon music apple music title diesel all of these and uh
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:37.680]   You got to find a differentiator whether it's exclusives or in this case exclusive Netflix raised their prices right before stranger things
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:42.160]   I mean, that's what you want. Yeah, you you want that sort of subtractor
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:47.920]   Although this is a good time for apple because both netflix and especially amazon are struggling a little bit with their original stuff
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.040]   It's not as they don't have the breakout things that they had
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:54.160]   Last year in the year before amazon
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:59.920]   There's been article has no additional businesses like at least amazon has so many other products that they can write micro subs
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.760]   Yule businesses they want to be in where netflix doesn't have that and apple of course has
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.400]   More money than the earth
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.920]   Speaking of amazon here comes the battle of the home of the uh
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.080]   intelligent assistant enabled home speakers
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:19.680]   It's a new category apple of course is going to come out with its home pot in december
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:24.960]   Google this week announced that they're going to do the uh at google home
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:30.240]   Well two of them one the google home mini that looks like a pink donut
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:35.600]   To compete with the amazon dot and then uh google home max
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:40.080]   Which looks like it's directly a home pot
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.840]   It looks like a sonos speaker
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:46.080]   But they made a big point about how it will auto tune the sound depending on where it is in the room
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:52.240]   That's of course something apple says the home pod will do sonos does it but with the with a little more intervention on your part
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:58.080]   You have to you know select it and do all that so and sonos is going to have every assistant on it
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.480]   So they can just talk to themselves and finally leave you alone
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:06.800]   I immediately turned on that sonos said also had an announcement on october 4th and I immediately turned on
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.400]   uh
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.600]   Echo integration with sonos. It works great. I mean
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.000]   It was all that was missing on sonos is the ability to talk to it. That is that is
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.440]   It's hard to like overestimate how important that is
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:23.040]   Yeah, and like like I said, it didn't seem like a when when apple
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.320]   Introduce the home pod it didn't seem like that
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.120]   It didn't I couldn't go along the idea that this was a really bad sign for sonos
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.320]   All they have to do is sign a deal and suddenly they have a home assistant
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.560]   It's not a problem
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:39.200]   Well, there may have been technical issues because they've been talking about this
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.960]   Amazon integration up this echo integration up for more than a year
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:47.120]   So there may have been something about airplay for three years and they finally did that
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:51.040]   Well, they haven't done it yet. They said next year airplay support and they're gonna
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.880]   support
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:58.720]   A series I think but google assistant for a series by proxy. Yeah, just sort of likes the food by proxy
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:01.120]   Yeah, we'll get into that. Well, it's and technically it's interesting
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:05.520]   I don't know exactly I can't actually we should do some digging to figure this out because all you do is you connect
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:12.160]   An echo dot to a sonos speaker through the line in and somehow it magically turns lights up the whole
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:16.960]   Network and so now I can talk to any of my echoes and command any of my sonos is
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:21.600]   All I have to do is have one sonos connected to one dot. I don't understand how that works at all
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.080]   It's a meshing of the mesh Leo. It's a meshing of the mesh. Yeah
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:28.560]   Yeah, all of all of that just to say play me some doobie brothers
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:34.400]   There's three people in the house with 19 assistants
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:40.080]   Well, one of the things that happens you put the echo at you have the echo app on your iphone
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:48.320]   Uh, you say go find devices and all of a sudden magically it finds all the ek all the uh, sonos is what you never saw before
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:53.600]   So they're all on the same Wi-Fi and so it says oh I see all these sonos is and now
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:57.440]   I ended up renaming my sonos is so that the commands would be
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:02.640]   You know play the doobie brothers on the kitchen sonos because it was getting a little confusing
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.400]   Um because I have echoes everywhere too and uh
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:12.880]   So I think I will be buying a home pod and I would and I already put down an order for the uh home max
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:18.160]   The echo I mean the google home max. Well, yeah, so I think we're good
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:24.640]   What's gonna what's gonna what the pressure is going to be is I think on consumers is pick one pick an ecosystem
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.800]   increasingly
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:31.760]   And neil i patel wrote about this with the uh with bluetooth headphones and uh in the headphone jack
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:35.200]   He says well, it's really all about getting you in an ecosystem
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.040]   Because if you really want your iphone to work great, you're gonna get air pods
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:44.000]   If you really want your new pixel to work great, you're gonna get the what are they calling the pixel buds
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.920]   Buds. Yeah
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:50.800]   It's like laying this for cameras all over again is it is? Isn't it you choose an ecosystem?
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:56.640]   Yes and no the thing is people aren't gonna buy uh aren't gonna buy a home pod plus a google home
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:01.280]   super biggie uh plus a third speed try hit head they're gonna pick it up
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:05.760]   They're gonna they're gonna probably buy whatever will fit in with whatever they've got right now
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.360]   It's gonna sound perfectly fine
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.120]   And then they're gonna simply go with it and then i'm gonna be disappointed that i'm gonna feel roped at all
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.720]   Uh because this I think this is what the ante what they're gonna pick is they're gonna say well
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:19.120]   What's my phone? Oh, it's an iphone. I'm gonna pick the home pod. What's my phone? Oh, it's a google pixel
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:24.320]   I'm gonna pick the google pod google max and then when you want to change phones you have to change everything
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:27.040]   Well, but that's about lock in right?
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:33.440]   Yeah, but you have the choice of picking something else, you know, I mean that is
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:39.120]   And we're just showing the article it says you can now if you have an android app use air pods with
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:43.200]   Google assistant, but you know what that's gonna be cluji and it's not gonna always work
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:47.760]   I mean, that's well. Yeah, I mean, I've well again i'm famous for saying that i'm an android user
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.400]   But my favorite my favorite earphones are are actually earpods. They work great as bluetooth headphones
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:56.480]   How did you get that logo on there? That's kind of cool
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:59.440]   That's a rebel. Well, yeah, he's a rebel alliance guy
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:02.800]   You have to have your adopted uncles burned to death by the hateful empire
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.440]   and then
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:10.080]   No, that's also the symbol on the seek church right outside my house by the way. I think that's where luke is probably
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.120]   Oh, really? Yeah, it's a seek symbol. Oh, that's it. I don't know but the seek church right across from my or the seek temple
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.120]   I cross my house has almost exactly the same logo
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.840]   I just I realized I have so many friends with air pods. I did not differentiate mine
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.920]   I was I wasn't I wasn't concerned
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:29.840]   I wasn't concerned about swapping earwax so much so I was concerned with you know doing that pat down before you get up from
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.560]   Like a lunch for somebody's like, oh my god
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:36.320]   I almost left my earpods behind and then putting in my pocket and then like when I get home realized
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.720]   Oh, I've got three pairs of earpods in my pocket
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.000]   I took other people's earpods in not call
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.520]   They are just very generic aren't they?
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:50.240]   Has the gum stickers on her and you buy a sticker? What is that? Is it a
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:56.880]   That is it job? No, no, that's a that's a rebel alliance sticker that I'm sure is completely licensed
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:02.480]   No, it's a seek temple. It's a seek temple sticker. That's what it is
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:07.040]   Oh, no, he's wandered off
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.440]   I'm sorry. Were we boring you?
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.240]   He's disappeared. He got up and disappeared. No, the Lucas lawyers arrived
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:20.480]   I think Darth Vader showed up at the door. Here he comes a new trailer. Sorry. I just uh
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:25.440]   I really I needed to give you a complete answer and so
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:29.920]   There are people on eBay with like really good like laser cutters
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:35.840]   So you can buy like really good so you can buy like really good a couple of line stickers
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.440]   He's got a rebel alliance bicycle helmet. There you go
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:46.880]   And one of my bike too so that if someone steals my bike, I can say I'm sorry. I don't believe you are gold leader. I am gold
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:52.160]   It's just like shooting wap rats. I tell you
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.320]   Nice
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.080]   They're like a buck
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:01.920]   Literally, they're like a buck 25. You can even get them as big as like your christmas decorations on the door
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:08.080]   I don't want any spoilers. I have intentionally not watched the trailer in fact
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.520]   I was watching the money that I football game and I looked away
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:17.360]   When they showed the last jet I uh trailer, but I'm sure rene richy watched it. Yeah, there's already
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:23.600]   Things in it the star worsey things in it leo i'm not big on the I don't zap rudder the trailers to look for things
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.160]   I just it made me feel like star wars and I was happy
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.880]   I saw a animated gif by gif analysis
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.880]   Of that for their nerds are wondrous people. I just I just want that feeling but I will admit
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:45.040]   I immediately went online fast forwarded in my local theaters ticket sales to december 14th and bought six seats
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.760]   For the first I couldn't do it. I spent an hour trying to get tickets and I couldn't do it
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:54.720]   It was like it just would not use my combination of like it. I don't want to but it was you got a move to petaloma
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:59.760]   I do I do the funny thing though is I don't want to pay that close attention to star wars movies
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:05.440]   Because it inevitably ruins it for me. There was this great comic panel right after um roge one came out
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.000]   Where princess lea is on the blockade runner and she's like I am an ambassador
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.680]   This is a consular ship and vader's like no no you just stole the plans. I saw you I saw you see me
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:21.200]   I was right there. I followed you here you saw me following you and it just it changes the context of the movie
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:23.680]   So I just as long as it makes me feel star wars and i'm happy
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:27.680]   You've spoiled for me now
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:34.960]   Hello, it is it is like that like they're they're now they're they're sites that they won't they don't they understand the idea of spoilers
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.040]   We're not gonna we're not gonna tell you that you know
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:45.120]   They won't tell you how empire strikes back ends even 30 years later, but they will they will say like here's how here's how they
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.120]   Here's how they got uh
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:52.320]   Here's how they got like a teenage harrison ford to appear in the new like okay now
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:56.640]   I know that harrison ford as a teenager appears as a character in this
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:01.440]   Thank you very much. That would have been that would be surprising. I don't want to hear anything because I want to see this
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:04.640]   Is gonna be a really good challenge for next three months
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:10.400]   Contradictions in canon because you know, that's just a level of detail. It's beyond me. I just want to enjoy a good movie
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:13.200]   Yeah, no, that's exactly i will i will
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:20.880]   Not to turn this into a movie podcast, but okay. We are we are in like the the after iphone announcement. Well, so we have time
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:26.160]   That's that's one thing that kind of gets me. I like I like the
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.720]   I don't like in comics and
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:33.200]   In movies everything like that. I don't like I like it when they expand what's going on
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.600]   I don't like it when we find out that oh, but did you know that there was actually a
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:45.200]   an oss agent who was also looking for looking for the arc of the government covenant and the reason why that that uh that
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.800]   That uh, that
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:52.720]   India happened to have happened upon this person who could who could sneak him in was that he was actually this agent in disguise
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:57.840]   It's like no, you're changing the movie without changing a frame of the original raves of the last dark
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:03.520]   You are changing the movie now you're now you're changing this this guy who you know is making it up as he goes along
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:10.400]   And as seems to be guided by the hand of god to no, there was some tough as nails wonder woman character and some
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.880]   uh angry scotsman with a grudge who was actually trying to
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:22.160]   Who's actually making sure that that marion got off the the get got off the the transport truck before the thing blew up like no
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.600]   That's why i won't watch the new alien's movies. I just I banned them from my can and they're like star wars pretty close to me
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.760]   I'm sorry. I brought this up. I yeah, sorry
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:36.160]   Although I I am thrilled that this is the first time that I could get reserved seats
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.040]   So I will not be waiting in line. I just so great showing up
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:46.480]   For the six p.m. Showing december 14th with five of my close personal friends will be auctioning off those tickets a little later on
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:50.480]   Uh, so great. IOS 11.1 is coming
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.360]   with new emojai
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.960]   So great hedgehog or is that a pork upon
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.920]   It's a hedgehog. It looks like a hedgehog to me
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.640]   Hedgehog. I see it's a scary grasshopper
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:09.840]   Very high res mittens scarves trench was the Canadian emoji. There's even a there's even a um, this should be a two
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.920]   A curling stone there is a curling stone, which is really wild
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.880]   Look at that there it is. Hurry hurry
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.040]   Wow
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:23.520]   That uh is curling played in any other country besides can
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:29.280]   Uh, the scar there's the scandinavians play because I thought the emojis had to be kind of universal
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:35.040]   Well, I'm sure it's big in japan. I mean that's where emojis originated. So yeah curling huge Japan
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.880]   As our wizards
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.760]   Else or is that a fairy vampires in mermaids?
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:43.520]   It's so funny because a lot of people just roll their eyes at this but the minute this was announced
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.560]   I there was a bunch like I have friends who are civilians who are not in the industry
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.160]   They're like, oh, I gotta get those emoji. They're gonna upgrade for no other future
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:55.760]   I was 11 other than getting this is the one i'm gonna upgrade for it looks like hook them horns, but it isn't
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:16:00.960]   This is uh, I love you an asl and I think that's awesome
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:05.360]   You can tell it's not the iphone 10 display because the thumb is out. Otherwise it would just be the
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:08.000]   Just the horns
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.920]   Okay, I get it. I get what you're saying the thumb makes it. I love you. All right. Yes
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.440]   Um, I will I think my will i'm willing to wager that will be the most used emoji
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:23.280]   Ever of all time more though more so than the hearts mind blown mind blown is pretty good
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:28.480]   Uh the expert of angry face. Yeah, that's a good one. It is here's the angry face
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:33.600]   And there's a I guess the monopoly man. There's a monocle happy face
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:37.120]   The 1% yeah, that's the 1%er
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.000]   Um
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.480]   Broccoli this is not going to be the most used
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.800]   That's terrible
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:50.240]   I mean, we'll see with a with a lot of these the part of the fun is trying to figure out a year from their release
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:54.160]   What's sexual act or body part is going to be used?
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:17:00.800]   That is a kind of a reference. Well, see that's the point. I that's why I think it will not be widely used. It's just broccoli
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.440]   Amen. I want to broccoli
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:08.320]   No, it's just no, that's it. It's broccoli. There's not it's not
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.440]   And finally they have an emoji that looks like me look
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:12.880]   Oh
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.400]   You got him
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.560]   Yeah, I always say the beta came out yesterday
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:19.840]   Uh for the developers and I think the public beta comes out tomorrow
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:23.280]   Yeah, because I have 11 1 but i'm on the public beta so I don't have it yet
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:28.240]   Yeah, and it's beta 2 beta 2 also brings back the 3d touch swipe to multitask which a lot of
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:31.520]   That has been driving me crazy because I didn't know it was taken out
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:38.480]   It was like pressing really hard on the left side saying come on. I know you're there. I know you're there and it won't work
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:43.520]   Yeah, it was taken out that it was it was brought back for iOS 11.1 beta 2
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:46.040]   So once once you get that you'll be back and where iike fedoreg
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:50.640]   It was it or eddy q said there was a technical reason why they took it out. I don't understand
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.240]   Yeah, there was it
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.760]   I think they were trying to
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:58.400]   They were trying to unify how the gestures would work between multiple devices, especially with iphone 10 coming out
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.960]   But then there was a bit of a pushback on it. I think
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:04.240]   Do you think that's why that it's not technical they're bringing it back because people
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.480]   yelled
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:10.960]   I think it was fun. There's always these just like again the discussions we have externally or the same discussions
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:15.920]   They have internally and previously the people who thought having a unified gesture vocabulary would be better
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.440]   uh
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:20.480]   One out on that one and then they're like oh all these people want it and leave
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.240]   There's no reason not to give it to them
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:27.120]   And I believe some people at the event even had it on there because they were running iphone 11.1 already
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.760]   So we got a sort of a hint that it was coming back because they were using it
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.320]   Um, and now everybody has it back. Huh?
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:36.480]   Yeah, I use it. You know why I use it last pass
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:41.600]   Because that's the one time I really often am switching back and forth between apps
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:46.080]   I get I need a password I switch to last pass and that makes it really easy to and you can go literal back
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.560]   Like if you just go all the way across it goes right back to the previous app
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.080]   It doesn't give you the multitask exactly so it's really an easy way to do it
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:54.480]   I mean you could still double press the
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:59.760]   Uh the home button to get the same thing, but I really liked that swipe once I learned it
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.760]   It took me a while to learn it
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.760]   Let's talk about high sira. So
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:08.880]   I keep checking on my mac. I have it on as a beta on one, but on the other mac
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:15.360]   It's not pushing it. It's just offering it in the app store. When do they start saying there's an update for uh, uh, mac macOS
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:18.320]   It should give you a notification telling you that it's in the app store
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:23.520]   They often stage it outside not everybody's downloading it at once so it might be a week or two weeks after release
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.680]   But it's been a laugh too. It's more than
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:29.680]   It's not like a regular update where it says oh you have updates press the button in it updates
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:33.040]   It you actually have to kind of there's more excuses you have to want it. You have to want it
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:36.240]   Okay, I want it because I
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.480]   It's it's like computers are still treated differently and it's not like we're gonna force everybody to update
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:43.840]   They want you to go like to say there's some good reasons because of apfs
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:46.000]   It's not compatible with a fusion drive
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:51.920]   That although that's coming there have been some issues with apfs breaking time machine
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.040]   There's some stuff with a new file system that causes problems
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:59.840]   So I can understand now our and they do have a bug fix
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.480]   Did that come out?
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:07.760]   Yeah, so it's a it's a out of it's a special update. Um, I forget what the actual term was supplemental update
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:10.720]   supplemental update that's it and it fixed two things one was
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:13.200]   apfs was the
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:16.320]   Disc utility GUI not the command line version, but if you're using the GUI
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:21.920]   It was storing the password in the password handling correctly and then displaying it to you. Yeah
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:26.080]   Um, not not I mean the chances of someone running a crawl like someone who has access
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:28.800]   They have to have access to your machine. Yeah, so that doesn't bother me
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.800]   But they'd have to have access to your computer, but not access to a drive that you created a secondary
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.600]   secure container on without giving them bad
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.920]   So it's not but I mean that stuff just should never happen
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.480]   Uh, and then it it also fixed the issue with a
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:45.280]   Keychain forcing keychain passwords by requiring a login for keychain
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:50.400]   So that will be the 10.13 a supplemental update
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.400]   Yeah, you probably do want to get that if you've upgraded the high sierra
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.440]   Is it I think this might now be
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:02.640]   Once this comes out, it might be time to get high sierra if you've been putting it off or no. What do you think?
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.880]   You I mean there's it's
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:10.560]   Most people will not see a change. It's incredibly like it looks almost exactly like sierra looked if you're not running
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:14.320]   Um sd drives like if you have a hard drive or fusion drive you won't even be asked
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:17.840]   For apfs, so that'll be largely you know, it's too irrelevant to you
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.200]   But you do want if you have an ssd don't you I mean that's yeah
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:27.520]   It absolutely is better with ssd's and all you know and just because the system is hardened more like it has protection for
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:32.480]   Um, for firmware and things like it just better security features. Yeah, there's an efi issue
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:37.680]   Somebody studied max and by the way, it's all pcs that usfi are vulnerable
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:42.320]   Efi often if the update fails doesn't warn you that it's failed and never tries again
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:49.040]   So they found that many max were running older insecure out of date versions of the efi firmware
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:54.560]   But there is a firmware checker in the in the high sierra that will say oh you're out of date. Let's update
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:57.200]   That's I suspect related, but maybe not
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:02.240]   Um, yeah, they're they're good reasons, but the biggest reason is the new file system
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:07.840]   Now did they enable snapshot somebody call me? Uh this week on the radio show saying
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:11.920]   Uh, my time machine broke with apfs or I had to redo it
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:18.080]   And I and I wanted to say well, you know most of these copy and write file systems have a snapshot capability
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:22.240]   I know apfs theoretically does which would make time machine kind of
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:30.640]   Easier it would work better. You could but are they could use the mobile time machine which what was not never function properly under storage
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:36.000]   So are they but they didn't enable that right away? I believe no I believe and I could be wrong
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.640]   But I believe that snapch that snapchots are in there
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:45.280]   I just it seems like apfs is not well enough documented for developers that people like carbon copy cloner and
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:47.120]   Super duper
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.320]   Super duper that snapshot
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:53.120]   Yeah, it can get in there and figure out apfs to the degree that they need to and that's something apple has to fix
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.280]   Well, that one comes in something
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:59.840]   Something that's that's that's not well understood is that apple is actually documenting the stuff for themselves at the same
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:04.320]   Time they're writing all this stuff. So outside developers. They are often at the day of release
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:07.680]   They have no idea how many of this any of this works or any idea of how to test it
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.320]   So that's one the reasons why third-party utilities take a long time to catch up
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:19.040]   And if it seems like a backup backup utility in particular is kind of dragging its heels. It's not it's just trying to it's working
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:22.080]   It's context. It's using backdoor access to people
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.920]   They know it's here. I'm not dragging its heels
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:27.280]   Right. I mean there there are times when people will just
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:33.760]   It's you'll find that a developer is suddenly not available for lunch or whatever
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:39.360]   For like a month before the new operating system comes out and suddenly their instagram
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:44.320]   It's like all pictures of San Francisco and all pictures of Cupertino even though they're from Ames, Iowa
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:49.680]   It's like that's because they are basically living in a hotel suite near the apple campus and just running
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:54.880]   Inside and out saying hi. Yeah, you see this big purple smoking hole in the screen
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:24:00.080]   That's what happened after I implemented this piece of this piece of API that you told me was going to work well
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.400]   So yeah, here's a blog
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.480]   named maclouvin
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:06.960]   So i'm not sure if I should trust it or not
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:14.880]   maclouvin.org that says that you can do a snapshot from the command line pseudo tm utill
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.200]   snapshot
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:19.440]   And if you do that you can use
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:26.400]   The mac os recovery utilities. You'll see that snapshot as restore from a time machine
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.320]   backup
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.880]   And then it will actually show you the snapshots
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:36.800]   So this is something worth looking into it even calls them snapshots
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:42.960]   They call them time machine local snapshots, but what a snapshot is is it's essentially
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.760]   a risk it's a risk
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:49.600]   How would you describe it? Is it like a restore point? Is it the full image?
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:54.880]   Sort of I think the problem with traditional like when time machine was previously implemented was that there could there could be
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.680]   Conflicts there could be things that haven't right before right after that weren't properly recorded and this is an absolute
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.560]   You know bit perfect state of what your machine was in at the time of that snapshot
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.360]   And this is one of the features of zfs and other cow
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:13.680]   File systems like apfs so it says are you sure you want to restore the disk depth to its snapshot state from
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:19.040]   Two days ago you say yes, and it takes he says at maclouvin
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:25.520]   says it takes only a few seconds and you reboot and then you're you're done so
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:31.440]   This is this is going to be very interesting, but as you say it's not well documented
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:32.720]   I'm a here. I am relying on it's also
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:35.680]   I mean it's hard to people to understand because we're used to traditional file systems
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:40.720]   For example, just clone clone sounds great because it takes literally no time to make a copy of a file
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.120]   But then if you if you're in your old mentality and you're like I need to open up some space on my drive
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:48.000]   I'm going to delete these three files. Why didn't I get any space back?
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:53.920]   Well, it's because those were clones of original file that's still there and you got to go and track down every version of that and delete that and it just
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:26:00.480]   Has many many good points, but you have to fundamentally change the way you think about file systems to really get
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:04.480]   Yeah, also it's the difference between like with with time machine
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:12.160]   Faking these features that were built into cfs and now apfs having those features actually built in so it's it's
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:15.440]   There's a there's a hack that works as transparent to the user
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:21.280]   But we'll break under a lot of circumstances and it kind of circumvents all the reasons why this feature is a good idea to begin with
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.160]   And then there's actually doing it properly and the new file system actually does it properly
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:29.520]   So if people aren't terribly excited about the new operating system
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:36.000]   It's because most of the features are under the hood as opposed to things that make things make a daily life easier and more productive
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:44.880]   We talked last week about the lte issue with the new series three apple watch low and behold shortly after our conversation apple fixed it
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:51.360]   Right. Yep. Yeah. Well the update they pushed out a watch was 4.0.1
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:57.120]   I think was right. Yep. Yeah, and it fixed that they claim the fit the cellular bug
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:04.960]   Yeah, I haven't I didn't I actually never got bit by the bug. So I can't I don't know where to go to see if it's fixed
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:13.920]   But I hope somebody did this was the issue of you would go somewhere with a open Wi-Fi access point the watch would think it had joined it
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:19.760]   But it hadn't so it would turn off the lte connectivity and then you would therefore have zero connectivity
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.840]   If your phone had connected to it and it was a known network it would try to connect to it
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:29.840]   But because it had no webcam implementation it couldn't give you the agreed-of-terms of service or click okay or whatever password intercept
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:36.160]   So you would just be stuck there forever. So apple said it was aware of the issue just before the series three launched
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:43.360]   Uh, which is funny because they didn't tell us but it was discovered pretty quickly and uh, they they fixed it right away
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.360]   So that's encouraging we had
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:51.120]   Some fears greg ferro on twit last week said oh, I don't I think it's gonna be harder fixing you think I guess not
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:54.320]   I guess not good news
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:55.520]   Uh
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:01.840]   apple has patented self-adjusting apple watch bands just in case you uh, you care
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:09.440]   Do they have tiny motor the fuse has tiny more they have a little motor in it dynamic feed adjustment for wearable electronic devices
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:15.520]   Uh, a users could electronically adjust the tightness or loses their watch bands
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:20.240]   In response to biometric data from the watch, you know why this might be a good thing is because
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:25.600]   I like to wear my watch a little loose but for better results with the heart rate monitor
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.600]   You want to wear it fairly tight, right?
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.600]   You want to have loose in the morning and then
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:32.560]   Yeah, right
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:37.360]   By the way, I love the new heart rate stuff. I actually put the uh, yeah, I turned on the heart rate complication
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:41.840]   Just so I could see it resting rate nice 64 baits per minute. That's pretty good
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:48.720]   Walking average 88 currently I am a calm cool and collected 73 beats per minute
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:54.960]   Although I was seven no anomalies no anomalies Leo. Oh, that's the thing i'm waiting for it will warn me if I haven't moved
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:58.080]   But my heart rate goes up
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:03.440]   Yeah, I'm waiting for that. That should be exciting. I think that's what this pattern is about
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:06.160]   I think it's more about health than just comfort on the band. Yes
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:11.840]   There probably there probably gonna be a bunch of sensors in the count in the offing that uh, can do an okay reading if
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:15.600]   Depending on how the band is set but can also say if i'm not getting a good enough reading
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:20.560]   I will alert I will basically if the if the user asks for a blood pressure reading or ask for a
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:23.280]   Blood sugar reading I will
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:28.480]   To know the user will know that there will be a little cams just because simply it's just like a nautilus
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:35.680]   Can't just kind of simply turn a quarter inch. It's me a quarter turn just to snug up the band and make sure those senses are in really good context
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:41.360]   When get a good reading there's a we've seen all the controversies about how certain fitness bands are good at
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:45.280]   Heart rate monitoring and some are really off by 10 plus or minus
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:50.480]   You don't know which one if apple really wants to be a health device as opposed to a fitness device
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.640]   They're really going to have to nail that accuracy
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:56.480]   It's like the spider-man suit where the whole thing just zips up on you
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:59.440]   a couple of anniversaries
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:05.280]   Siri is uh, six years old. It was announced alongside the iphone s
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:08.160]   October 4th, uh, 2011
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:12.560]   sadly that was also the sixth anniversary of
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:16.640]   The death of steven jobs. I can't believe it's been six years
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:18.640]   Yep
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:23.360]   And uh, this is the link, uh, I guess karston put in there which i'm glad he did
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:31.520]   From october 30th, 2011 mona simpson steve jobs sister wrote that was I think this the single best kind of
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:37.600]   Uh summary of this it was just beautifully written mark well very very moving
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:44.400]   Uh highly and yeah and generous. I mean they have every right to there to be private but recognizing that
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:50.720]   Um a lot of people were going to be deeply affected by this. It was very very generous of her to write something like that and make it public
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:52.720]   Yeah, no kidding
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:56.560]   Uh even down to his uh his final words
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:00.640]   That beautiful beautiful piece so appropriate for us to
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:03.680]   commemorate those two
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:05.680]   anniversaries
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:09.040]   Tim cook does he speak french talking with the president of france
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:13.200]   The young just turned forward. I'd love to hear his accent
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:18.320]   Hey zuckerberg speaks chinese at least uh, tim could speak french
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:22.960]   Yall i think it was using those google buds to do like instant translation those were pretty amazing
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:26.480]   Translation answer the question. I cannot wait to use those
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:34.000]   Uh the next time i'm at the un no actually i'm going to japan as i mentioned in korea in uh the spring and I will definitely have
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.960]   Those will be your novel fish. Yeah, because I keep I mean I can get along and in romance languages
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:44.160]   Well enough because they sound like a little bit like english even german, but boy japanese
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:49.840]   Baffles me so that will be cafe cafe. I don't know what you're saying. I'm sure it's good
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:53.760]   Coffee. Yeah, really say you say coffee in japanese
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:59.200]   No in uh in all the romantic language. Yeah, no right. I but that's a perfect example
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:03.200]   I could get coffee in almost any country even china isn't it yum yum cafe?
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:06.800]   I think so i studied so i can even fake japanese, but
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:11.840]   Japanese that's that's you know, that's part of the that's part of the smart firm revolution like to get around
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:17.680]   I used to like never really trust myself using taxis and like non english countries at point
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:22.720]   But now it's in chapan in chapan in china all I needed to know was take me here, please
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:28.880]   And then just and then simply show here is the name of the place in the actual local language near the map
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:33.920]   Yeah, now you now you might actually be able to do it. Okay. Yeah, say say it into your phone
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:40.000]   Hold the phone. I I will not I would not have the guts to try that with a french waiter though in france
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.960]   Give give him another reason to hate you and spit. I know I might be too embarrassed to use it anywhere
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:50.960]   You're attempting to speak french you and imo I buried the lead the biggest story of the week
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:55.040]   Google is gonna buy apple. Yeah
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:00.960]   For a mere nine billion dollars, which would be a really good deal
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:03.840]   Accidental news report is amazing
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:12.160]   Uh, this was uh somehow an accidental uh post on uh the dow Jones and newswire
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:17.120]   I think somebody was messing around in a surprise move to everyone who is alive
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:20.720]   Google said it's going to buy apple for nine billion dollars
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:24.880]   Google chief executive larry page had secret talks with an out of c steve jobs
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:29.440]   In 2010 to firm up the deal the deal was announcement jobs will was red and kupertino
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:34.560]   The deal which is expected to close tomorrow gives each google shell holder nine shares of apple stock
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:36.400]   Worth
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:42.720]   Uh, what is that 1350 bucks? Obviously google will move into apple's fancy headquarters google employees said that's part yay
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:44.880]   That's the best part right there
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:48.720]   Well, that's see that that that makes sense because there are there are two o's and google
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:52.560]   There are no o's and apple so they could just keep adding on as they keep going
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:55.520]   uh
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:59.040]   Yes, accidental news
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:04.400]   That see that that's a whole that remember the good old days when like that in the press room
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:08.000]   They would they need to test out equipment so they would of course write stories that of course
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.080]   I'm never going to be printed eight million times
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:15.920]   But now the same person on the same motivation the same authority hits the one wrong button
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:20.160]   And suddenly oh look it's happening. Let's take the thought market
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:23.840]   You know the funniest thing and actually in a way
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:26.800]   catastrophe averted
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.840]   Programmatic trading doesn't know from crazy
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:33.680]   And that fact apple stock price briefly went up
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:39.680]   Uh due to program act trading but imagine if you know they'd really glommed onto this
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:48.880]   Anyway, it was just a test or is this or is this like those things someone like amazon like incorrectly keys in the price of like a
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:53.920]   $1000 pair of headphones to 30 cents and they they sell 30 but they have to honor the price
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:58.160]   Does apple have to honor this $9 billion price of google wants to actually take over
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:01.440]   Google has to give them nine billion but apple doesn't have to sell anymore. I think it's
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:07.760]   Uh, all right. Let's uh, I think we uh anything else that I miss any other big stories
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:10.560]   There's a lot of them. I don't need to talk about the qualcom apple
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:13.200]   War it's actually a good piece though in bloomberg
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:18.960]   Over an 18 dollar part apple and qualcom's billion dollar war. I just like the graphic
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:25.200]   The in hindsight that was bruce. Who was last probably his last interview as head counsel for apple. Oh, that's right. He's moving on
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:27.200]   Isn't he's retiring retiring?
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:33.360]   Uh apple pays two billion dollars a year to qualcom in patent fees
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:37.680]   And it doesn't want to do that anymore and it's withholding payments
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:41.760]   So uh that one's going to go on for a while. I have a feeling
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:46.320]   Although given that qualcom's two billion dollars in the whole every year
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.880]   They might be somewhat incentive to resolve this
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:55.520]   And given that apple still has what 21 letters left in there silicon alphabet. Yeah. Yeah, and one of those could be m for modem
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:59.280]   Yeah, well, I you got to think apple's working hard on replacing
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:04.160]   Yeah, i mean the w2 already does a lot more than w1 did in this only a year later. Yeah. Yeah
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:07.600]   That would be interesting. Maybe that would be in the next phone, huh
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:12.320]   apple would like to make the i'll tell you two trends you're gonna
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:15.040]   One is getting rid of all holes
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:18.160]   No more no more lightning jack no more headphone jack just a
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:20.800]   Everybody everybody
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.800]   All be
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:25.680]   No more belly buttons
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.200]   Uh
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:30.800]   And the other one will be getting rid of all non apple parts in the iphone like
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:36.800]   It should all be apple book and could they do that is there? There's kind of there's different where it provides significant differentiation
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:40.480]   They want to control the technology. I like sony still makes the camera parts, right?
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:44.960]   Yeah, yeah, and it would take it would take them look out one
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:49.200]   It's taken them to become a chip fab and they are really really good chip designers
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:52.240]   Now imagine how long it's going to take for to be camera designers
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:57.040]   How long it's going to take them to be screen designers? I don't think yeah, I don't think they have enough bandwidth to do all of that
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:00.320]   I don't think they have the interest either even even
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:05.520]   I think they'd even be preferred to strong arm intel into making
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:11.280]   modem chips that are very very completely up to apple standards and apple specifications
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.520]   Rather than build their own
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:19.680]   Because just getting certification just just getting a just getting a modem chip that they know is going to work in every single market in which they are
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:22.240]   operating the iphone which includes Antarctica
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:25.440]   I think that they're going to be judicious
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:32.560]   When they they will do that when they can find a way to improve their product by taking control of the manufacturing other other than that they're not interested
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:37.600]   You also they often tell manufacturers to make very specific things that they don't want like they they are happy to engineer
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:40.080]   But they don't want to make themselves and when you look at things like
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:45.680]   The way the modem works or the way the screen is going to work like the apple is using a samsung panel for the iphone 10
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:52.080]   But they are doing things with that OLED screen that no one has ever done before the same way they do things with lcd screens that other companies
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:54.720]   Don't do like true tone or the you know
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:58.800]   Some of the other stuff that they've done with the way that you know 3d touch works and things like that
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:05.600]   So they're very happy to take the commodity part from the quantity part maker and then provide the differentiation by how they actually implement the technology
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:10.320]   You mentioned any we're seeing more and more iphone 10s in the wild here's some images
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:18.720]   collated by nine to five mac this one I like this shows the vertical orientation of the lens on the back and the beautiful
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:21.520]   fully mirrored surface
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:27.440]   On the steel gray version of the iphone everyone at apple going please don't let that be mine. Please don't let that be mine
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:31.840]   Yeah, really do you think there's some way that they could uh, I guess not there's no identity
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:37.040]   I would never risk. I mean, I know people who deliberately don't want to carry them just just in case someone snaps a float of the mountain
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:40.240]   Yeah, no, I know
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:43.600]   And of course for all we know this is an android phone modified
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.320]   Yeah, well
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:51.760]   Yeah, I think I think the real fireable offense is going to be if they let someone actually hold it
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:57.520]   Because they that they apple wasn't even terribly pleased that I let david letterman use my ipad
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:02.160]   Really? So wow. Yeah, I was yeah, so wow
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:08.160]   All right, which is which is understandable because I had had like two weeks worth of experience using it at that point and
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:11.520]   Letterman had had what four or five hours, so
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:15.920]   All right, let's take a break picks of the week
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:19.680]   Getting ready coming up in just a moment or show today
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.480]   brought to you by
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:26.320]   It's another it's another sponsor lottery
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:30.000]   Freshbox. Yeah, we love fresh books
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.920]   Used fresh books in 2004. That's how long they've been around
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:37.360]   Uh to do my invoices. They save me a lot
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:40.160]   Not a lot of not just a lot of time, but they actually
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:43.920]   Help me get paid faster. That's one of the things you find when you start invoicing
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:47.920]   With fresh books you get paid on average 11 days faster
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:50.720]   the professional looking invoices help
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:57.120]   What I think the secret there is that button on there on the invoice that goes to your client that says pay leo
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:59.760]   And they press the button. It's easy. It's easy
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.920]   But one of the things that's really changed since I started using fresh books all those years ago
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:07.680]   By the way 10 million people now use fresh books. So that's that's a big change
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:14.000]   But the dashboard now is really a full accounting system. You don't have not I don't want to say that because you don't have to do anything extra
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.320]   You're just setting out invoices
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:21.520]   You know, recording them paid putting your expenses in the things you do anyway with fresh books
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:26.240]   But because they know you're in you know, you're uh accounts receivable your accounts paid
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:30.320]   They know your expenses. They know your total profit. They know what's outstanding
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:33.920]   You can get all the information you need in fact for the first time ever
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:39.120]   For a lot of individuals and small businesses. You'll know whether you're making a profit at any given time
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:42.720]   Sticky headers make it really easy in this new dashboard
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:48.080]   You know how when you're looking to spread sheet and you scroll it up and then the you don't know now what columns you're looking at
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.760]   They've got sticky headers. So the headers shrink your main at the top
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.400]   So, you know exactly what you're looking at it really is elegant
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:41:01.120]   They constantly improve the dashboard, which I really like you could build for time by client or by specific project
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:04.240]   They actually have a timer built into the app or into the website
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:10.160]   So you just start the timer it keeps track of the time if you build for time and hours and automatically puts it into the
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:16.640]   invoice you go to sign services to projects and designate different rates for every service
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:22.880]   Time entries are sort of chronologically. So it's very easy for you to see and they go right into the invoice
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:25.680]   No extra typing on your part
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:31.200]   It's really great too because if people are slow to pay you'll know that you'll know when they viewed your invoice
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:39.440]   You'll know when they paid it. It can automatically send dink, you know little reminders getting increasingly vociferous if they don't pay
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:43.600]   Employees can now log on to the fresh books mobile app for iOS
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:48.240]   Which makes it easy for them to take care of business wherever they are full description of every line item
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:50.800]   Is now visible when you view an invoice on mobile?
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:55.120]   So you the invoices are actually informational for you as well as your client of course
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:00.800]   They've got great help great support straight out of the fresh books offices, but also in the app they have a new help widget
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:07.520]   Which makes it very easy forbs put fresh books in their small giants list for 2017. No wonder there's that great support team
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.600]   They're really nice people
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:16.720]   Fresh books stop laboring over your invoices and keeping track of your money and learn more and do it more easily
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:21.360]   Get paid faster with fresh books go to fresh books dot com slash mac break

[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:45.120]   Andy and i co
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.120]   I love your pick of the week
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:54.080]   Yeah, uh, the game cuphead came out last week. So it's an amazing game
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:58.800]   It's so it's not available for mac yet. It isn't available for mobile yet, but the the whole way
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.000]   I
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.360]   The it's been in development for years and years and years. It is
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:05.920]   There's been no game like this. It is a
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:09.680]   cartoon hand drawn cartoon from 1932
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:15.440]   The max fly share studios disney studios again 1931 1932 as a game
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:20.720]   And it's not and it's not like you might have seen this like slapped at before with the idea
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:24.720]   Oh, you can see that this character this this 3d character. It looks a little bit like beddy boob
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:31.920]   And this one looks a little bit like popeye. It's no they this is all hand drawn animation and then process to look like it is
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:35.920]   35 millimeter 16 millimeter film complete with scratches
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:41.440]   But then when you play when the game is played it looks like you're watching a cartoon
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:48.000]   Really fun. It's like it's like a six minute short that ends with popeye and bluto fighting
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.680]   Now imagine just that part of the cartoon. Only that's the entire game
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:55.680]   So I can't I can't play the game. However, uh, I
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:59.920]   I found myself watching the entire play through video
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:05.520]   From a youtube user called the red brad. I can't imagine what it's like to play this game
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:11.200]   But oh my god. It's so fun to watch this game being played because the animation is so amazing
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:15.680]   So I'm recommending so my pick is both these these gameplay videos
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:18.720]   So again the one I the one I was watching was from the red brad
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:23.440]   I like the way he does these videos because it's not he's not hey dude
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:26.160]   Oh my god. I just turned he died
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:31.360]   He's just playing the game and like commenting to explain what's happening or he's reacting
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.440]   It is very very very very watchable
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:38.080]   But the other reason why I'm recommending it is the soundtrack to this game is amazing
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.080]   They put just as much work
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:43.680]   And creativity and beauty into the music going behind it
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:49.840]   And I was so disappointed because I went to I went to where you buy the game and you could only buy the soundtrack
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:52.480]   Uh, if as a add-on to the game
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:58.880]   $20 for the game and $10 for the soundtrack, but then I found out you could buy the soundtrack separately on bandcamp
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:04.720]   Uh, so if you go to studio m d h r dot band camp camp dot com, uh, you can buy
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:12.400]   Uh for at least $10, but I gave them extra money. I'd say three hour soundtrack that I'm not joking after I bought it
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:15.120]   I was I was listening to it from start to finish
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:18.880]   Uh, I listed this three hour start soundtrack from start to finish
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:24.880]   On saturday while I was just pottering around the house and really great like thirties jazz music
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:32.320]   Uh, you can also use it for music that will if you want to imagine you're in like a 1950s or 1960 detectives
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:38.160]   Movie, uh, and you are chasing someone through like the back streets of lower manhattan
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:42.640]   Uh, the music works for that too. I can't stop playing cop head
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:48.560]   Of course you have to have an xbox or windows machine to play it, but it is really it is really awkward
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:54.480]   When it comes to when it comes to something I can play on my on a mac or on android device. I
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:57.040]   Hope they release it. You know, it's only $20
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:00.800]   Uh, this was it's just incredible a lot of there's no
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:05.600]   There's I don't understand how people can actually play this game because I would be just sitting there
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:12.720]   Why is the animation and dying? It's really hard. It's really really hard. It's but it's a whole heck of a lot of fun
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:18.880]   It's I mean, it's it's got a so entertaining and so good looking and the music so good. You don't mind dying
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:21.280]   That's I think that's kind of the the point of it
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:24.960]   Uh, it's just a lot of fun. Really a lot of fun
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:25.520]   Gorgeous
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:31.440]   I'll go back to inkwell isle and uh and start playing them from the very beginning for you. It's it's just really
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:37.280]   Boy, it is it is great. I don't know how they do this for us so little frankly
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:44.000]   Yeah, that that just amazed me. I again I came so close to buying it just because i'm gonna buy it at some point sometime
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.720]   I do own a windows machine. I suppose I could play it
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:49.600]   Yeah
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:54.480]   Yeah, and you know this is uh, you don't really need a very high powered machine to play it actually whoa
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:59.440]   Oh, see that's pretty much the saga right there
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:02.240]   says
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:03.680]   Cuphead as
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:08.880]   You you lost your soul to the devil in a and again playing dice and it'll give you a soul back
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:14.720]   If you if you basically to be a debt collector for other souls that got sold but not turned tuned in to go all through the island
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:20.640]   It's it's a whole thing, but it's it's just like I said for free go watch these these gameplay videos and then
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:23.120]   Like it's really the best way to do it. Huh?
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:28.400]   Yeah, it's just it's just watch the videos or download the soundtrack. Look how many tracks there are in here
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:30.000]   There's 56 yeah
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:37.360]   And it's not it's not repetitive. It's like it's just everyone is there are very few like down tempo numbers as you might understand but
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:40.080]   Well, you're you're in hell
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:50.240]   Uh, really really nice. Christopher Madigan is the uh, toronto based percussionist drummer and composer who wrote the soundtrack for
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:55.840]   Cuphead xbox one windows ten and steam, but you can buy the whole soundtrack on band camp
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:58.800]   Very nice $10
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:00.240]   $10
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:01.200]   $10
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:03.680]   All right, mr. Renee ritchie. What's your pick?
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:07.920]   So mine is the return of a classic many many moons ago
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:15.120]   I believe the first twitter native client ever made was twitterific and it debuted on the mac and now today twitterific
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:20.160]   Cryo infantly returns to the mac the icon factory the developers behind this
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:24.000]   Uh people like shawn herber and giddy and mehia and craig hawkin berry
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:31.440]   Uh, they did a kickstarter first and if you did do the kickstarter you got really awesome stuff like little ollie toys for your trouble
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:34.000]   Which are just you know pretty amazing
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:40.080]   But regardless it is on the mac app store as of today and it gives you exactly what you expect in twitter in twitterific
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:46.080]   That is a unified timeline very clean interface delightful interactions really good sounds
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:50.480]   Uh, and it's just it's a lot of really fond memories of twitter
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:57.680]   You know before all the developer nonsense before it became a political machine before they're all the bots and all the spam and all that stuff was just using
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:05.600]   Twitterific with a bunch of tech people sitting there on my mac and now I have it is absolutely new it is completely redesigned completely rebuilt
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:09.600]   Uh, but it's that same familiar twitterific experience
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:13.760]   And if you do like this if you do like reading twitterific, I have two different modes
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:17.360]   I use I know other apps if I'm in twitter triage mode, right?
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:19.600]   I just want to quickly see and respond to things
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:22.480]   But on my ipad and you know now again on my mac
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:25.600]   I'm using this reader mode where I just want to go through and see everything is happening
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.760]   And twitterific is great for that because it has that one timeline to roll them all and you can just scroll through and catch up on
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:34.240]   Everything that's happened throughout the day
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:38.480]   So this is the reason to get it is you don't get while you are away updates you get just the
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:47.360]   Chronological list of tweets. That's all I want. Yes. No no blue lines. No threads. No promoted tweets
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:51.760]   No weird media handles. No it doesn't know no BS
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:54.080]   No BS
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:55.440]   At the top so that it's not you know
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:58.080]   Some people don't like it on the side because it interferes with the look of it
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.960]   But right really and you can customize a lot of aspects of it
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:04.240]   You can make it look the way you want it to look. I need this now. How much is it?
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:07.200]   It's 20 bucks, you know, and it's worth every penny
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:11.040]   Yeah, totally it's an app you use all at least for people like me use it all day every day
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:15.840]   And having a good experience is easily worth, you know the price of a few burgers to me. Yeah
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:18.720]   Very good recommendation
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:21.040]   My friends are coming in
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:24.320]   We've come to the icon factory deserves a lot of credit because they do great
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:27.280]   All around everything they do is well worth it
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:28.800]   We have come
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:33.040]   I need so money to put that hairdo that he's been sporting on today lately. I haven't seen it. That's the
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:36.560]   That's why I need a crown logic round. They call it the dog brown luck. Oh no
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:41.680]   That doesn't sound good at all. He says it makes him look even taller. I don't know if that's what he was pointing
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:44.160]   Our show today
