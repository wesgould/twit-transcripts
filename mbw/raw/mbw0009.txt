[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Hey everybody, this is Alex Lindsey and this is Mac Break Weekly, number nine.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   We have quite a cast here today. Coming in from somewhere else in San Francisco,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   we've got Jason Snow from Macworld Magazine, hey Jason.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Hey there. It's really, really great to have you.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Also we have coming in from Seattle. We've got Scott Bourne.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   It's Gig Harbor, right? It's not Seattle.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   It's Gig Harbor, but nobody knows what that is.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   They're trying to keep it that way. It's kind of like, yes we are.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Also we have Jan Kabili. Now Jan, where are you coming in from?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   I'm in beautiful Boulder, Colorado.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Boulder. You can't get any better.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   27 square miles surrounded by reality.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I used to live in Boulder. I used to live behind an ideal market.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Oh, that's where I shot.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Oh yeah, so that was a long, long ago and a very wonderful time.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I'm still living. I got my teenage years now.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Boulder is just such a great place.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   So anyway, we've got a little bit of news.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I think that the big news, I mean you guys can tell me if you think this is big news,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   but the DVD John has, he has cracked Fair Play.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Now people have been talking about cracking Fair Play for a while,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   but he's not trying to let us use it for free like he usually does.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   He's actually offering to license it.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   He's going to make it available to anyone who I guess the highest bidder or a handful of bidders
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   to be able to actually use it. Now is this going to work?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Jason, do you think that he can actually pull this off?
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I'm not sure that this isn't.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Okay.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Didn't, didn't, uh, real networks, I mean, it wasn't, didn't they have a,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   a Fair Play compatible DRM that they came out with that sort of didn't go anywhere.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And in large part, because Apple said, you know, we can just disable it in the next iPod software update
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and make all of your DRM not work.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Okay.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I mean that, that there is, I'm not sure, and I don't know how this differs,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   how DVD John's sort of reengineering a Fair Play is different from, from what real networks did,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   but you know, real networks made this claim like more than a year ago and sort of nothing ever came up.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Yeah, that's the question that I have as we see this come up.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   It was bouncing around a lot over the last couple days on, you know, variety of online sites.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And, and the question I have is number one, is it, is it legal to do it?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   It's a reverse engineer, a copy protection.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And number two is, uh, yeah, I mean, can Apple just continually adjust this?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I mean, if I was a licensor, why would I, why would I want to actually dig into this?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Scott, do you have any, I mean, Apple would have to go ahead, go ahead, Jason.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Sorry about that.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You know, Apple would have to analyze it and find out what made it unique and then disable it,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   but unless DVD John could get it to be unrecognizable when compared to a, you know, a legitimate file of some version from iTunes Store.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   You know, if he, if he could do that, he's one, I think, other than if they could sue him.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   But that's the big question is, can you, can you make it, can you reengineer it so well that Apple can't even detect that it's not one of theirs?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I'm not sure about that one.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I also think that there's, I mean, there's an issue, you know, even if they made it indistinguishable, all Apple has to do is add one flag every single time that they, you know, they do an update.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And it seems that to me that it would be disabled unless it's a standard that's not moving.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   It just seems like it'd be a very high risk for people who wanted to necessarily license it.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   It is risky, but, you know, you got to remember that stuff downloaded the day one of the iTunes Store still plays.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   So there has to be backward compatibility. They can update their file format, but the, you know, the iPod and iTunes still play those old purchase files.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   So if John could make them match one of those formats exactly, then Apple would have a hard time disabling it.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   But, you know, that's only one approach because there's also the lawsuit approach.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   If Apple says that they're, you know, this somehow and I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   But, you know, is there some way that Apple can say this is reverse engineering and it's, you know, it's not legal because this is patented or I don't know.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   That's a mystery.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Well, can I say there's something I didn't tell you guys.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I was a lawyer for 15 years.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And I know I try not to ever talk about it.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And yeah, but, you know, I, from the little time I've spent sort of looking at this, I think that probably a case can aid whether it would fly or not.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Who knows? But the real issue is that it could bollocks up the works and stop John from doing what he wants to for long enough that it may become a non-issue.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And that's virtually what happened with real and with Navio.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   They kind of just faded away because Apple kept posturing that it was going to sue.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   And that's one of the things, I mean, any large company can oftentimes jump in there and say, well, we're just going to hold you up in court for quite some time before you can actually do anything.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And no one's going to want to put money into the licensing scheme if it's unknown whether it's actually going to be able to actually use it.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I mean, that seems to be the danger there.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   But do you think, Jan, do you think that he has any case at all though saying that this is not some kind of infringement of the DCM or DCMA?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Well, I looked at the DMCA, Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and it's not my area.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   It never was. They didn't even have that when I was a lawyer.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   But it says, you can't circumvent a technological measure that controls access to a work protected under the title.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And it even tries to define what circumventing a technological measure is.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And I think there would be an argument under the language of that statute that going ahead and reverse engineering would violate that.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   So who knows? I mean, there's also case law.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And somebody pointed out on one of the sites that there was the Connectix and Sony Matter back in 2000.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Do you remember that one?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Where?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And apparently Connectix went and copied some of the bios from the Sony PlayStation and used it to make their own machine.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And that court, although I think it was before this act, was in place, said that was okay.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Right. And a lot of adjustments that are made. Now, in a larger question, and this kind of ties into the, you know,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   to, you know, intel calling for open standards, do we think that, I mean, this constantly comes up when I talk to people who talk about PC versus, you know, Apple.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I mean, the PCs in general versus Apple is, do we think that this, this enclosed society that Apple or structure that Apple tends to build?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Is that in the long run, is that going to be detrimental to Apple or is it to their advantage?
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   So, I mean, this is a bigger question that Intel's opening where, you know, they said that, you know, their motto is to let Apple be Apple and they're happy to serve them.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   This is according to the info world.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   But they, you know, they really hope that people use more open standards to allow more inner connectivity between hardware devices.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   The question really is, is Apple, the way Apple approaches this kind of stuff, is that good for Apple in the long run because of the argument, of course, is that it makes it more operable between Apple devices.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   It's easier for them to make that work smoothly if they don't have to deal with everybody else.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Or is it going to eventually get Apple into trouble either through monopolistic attacks or, or just because people will, once they start working around them, will, the market grows,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   pass them. What do you guys think is this good or bad for Apple?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Well, and should we say for the consumer too? I mean, that's the other question that comes up.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Is this a good or bad for the consumer that Apple has got this sort of dominance and what's good about it and what's bad about it?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Yeah, I mean, absolutely. I mean, because do we actually benefit as users from this close?
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   I mean, sometimes people can argue, and I argue this often, is that my experiences as a user oftentimes,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   is better because, you know, with a Mac, I can just simply just plug stuff in.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   It's just going to work. And if Apple, we've talked about this in the past once,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   if Apple made a phone, I would buy it the next day because I know it would work with everything else that I'm doing.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I don't have that guarantee on a PC. So the argument is, is that it's a good experience for me as a consumer because of that.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   But do I get so much less choice that it is, you know, that I'm getting locked into something that isn't, isn't to my advantage?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   You were going to say something, Scott?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Well, I was just going to say what Jason said. I think the real question is, what's the user's benefit?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And we need to always ask these questions from the standpoint of the user.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And I think the fact that the Macs are now open to windows through parallels and boot camp
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   probably provides just about the perfect balance of openness.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   We need to keep the system closed to some degree to protect those of us who are pure Mac people that like the Mac experience,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   but open it up just enough so that we don't have to worry about any trust things
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   and that people who want to do other things can get in their play.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   I think that's about all you need to do for now.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   I do believe, you know, sometimes the Apple stuff drives me crazy when you talk to an Apple guy at a trade show
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   and he can't even tell you what division he works in for fear that the SS troopers are going to come stormy on the back of the wall someplace.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   But other than that, I think that they probably have served themselves reasonably well doing it the way they've done it because, you know,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   we all like to use Macs.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And you know, this whole question of openness is a little bit of a red herring, really, because the iPod and iTunes are open in the sense that,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   you know, it's not just a lot of times the media just gets portrayed as, you know, if you don't buy it from Apple, you can't play it on the iPod.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   When the reality is the iPod plays MP3s and it plays wave files.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   It plays all sorts of files that don't have DRM, but it does play them.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   And so it's not as locked down as I think sometimes people make it out to be.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And I really kind of love the irony of the fact that DVD John, who made his name as somebody who decried DRM and said, you know,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   this information wants to be free and consumers want to be able to have control over it and let's strip all the DRM off.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And now he's moved to California and he's got a company whose entire goal is to slap DRM onto material on a player that will accept media that's free of DRM.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   It's just bizarre and I guess he's got dollar signs in his eyes, but it's weird because, you know, the iPod is open.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   It plays MP3s. It's not hard to figure out.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Well, and most of the stuff that I have on my iPod is MP3s generated from my CDs.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Absolutely. I do buy some stuff mostly when I'm traveling and I just feel like listening to some song or whatever.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   But most of them, you know, 95% are from my own CD library that I had built up before I had iTunes.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And so you're going to say, Jen?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Well, I was going to say we talked about consumers that's us and we've talked about the computer companies,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   but we haven't talked about the content producers and they're also really important.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Then the question comes up, does DRM hurt them or help them?
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   In a sense, it hurts. It helps them.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   But then in other sense, it hurts them.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   You know, I think that some musicians feel that if their customers are feeling that they are not getting what they want, that they're getting, you know, proverbially, you know what, that that doesn't help the musician either.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   So there's that other entity to think about.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Yeah, and I think that I personally think that's actually the Achilles heel of big media quote unquote,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   is that a lot of the smaller producers, us included, at Macbreak, you know, we don't put any DRM on them.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   I mean, we're doing creative comments.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   And the real issue is that as we go down downstream, if DRM continues to be hard to deal with,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   and I think Apple is really the only one that has a workable DRM solution at the moment,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   if it continues to be difficult to use, and I can't use it on these different devices,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   will people start to go towards non DRM content?
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   I mean, Creative Commons now has hundreds of thousands of licenses.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   You know, people are able to move that stuff around.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And the real question is, does DRM, will DRM start to really make it hard for big media to move forward into this new market by making it more difficult to act, you know, and people just going, well, there's content that's almost as good, or maybe as good, for my niche,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   and without having to deal with all this stuff?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   I don't care about the big names.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   I'm sorry?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   We need to work out a system here where we don't talk over here.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Like, you want to give us a hint at who you want the basics?
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Yeah, well, the other funny thing is that this, you know, it's not about the names.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   This situation, you know, the big names can get on iTunes.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   And iTunes really exists as a conduit for the big names, even kind of small-ish names,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   to get their content, whether it's music or video.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   And, you know, I think the movie store is going to open up and be a lot broader as we go along here onto iTunes and sell it and make money.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And Apple takes a cut, but they, you know, but that Apple's also providing the service and they're providing the bandwidth.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And so who is this for, exactly?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I mean, other than to stick it to Apple, I mean, Apple's already got a store.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Apple's happy to have people come in and sell their stuff on the store.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   You know, the big names are on the store.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   So it's really unclear to me exactly what this is about, other than sort of saying we want to stick it to Apple because, you know, Apple's provided this, you know, and if you want to bypass DRM altogether, you can get on the iPod too.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   So, you know, this scenario that John is talking about here is basically saying we want to be free of the cruel yoke of the iTunes store.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   I'm not sure anybody is really saying that.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Well, I think I don't even think he's saying that. I think he's saying that we're providing somebody we're theoretically hoping to provide somebody with access to 90% of the for sale market.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   You know, I think that's the concern, you know, that's what they're trying to do.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Right. Somebody who is an Apple.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Right. I mean, it's not so much that even do anything to Apple.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   They just want access to it. Apple's got a lockdown, which ironically was created by someone other than, I mean, Apple didn't want to do DRM in the first place.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   I mean, they were happy with MP3s. It was, you know, a lot of the, you know, to get these big companies into iTunes.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   They had to figure out a DRM and they sorted something out that really worked.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   And now it happens to have locked people in. It's funny. It doesn't seem as calculating as Apple may have sounded.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   You know, it's to their advantage at this point, but, you know, it wasn't created that way. Scott?
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   I'm never going to worry about downloading music again because I just bought my junk and so far I haven't been able to get off of it.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   I just play my junk all day long now.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Sounds like my grandmother.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   So, you know, there's, oh, man.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Go ahead.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   There's another aspect to it, which is the advent of ITV.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   And John may not be doing this for idealistic reasons. He may be doing it because he sees a lot of money in the offing there.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   If he can sell it to those people who want to get their stuff coming through ITV into your living room, then, you know, he may join that list of the richest in the world.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   But who are those people? I mean, because again, you're going to be able to go, the people who have got stuff to sell, who are theoretically the ones who want to DRM it, are going to be able to go through iTunes.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   So, you know, I don't think it's about the content owners here. I think this is about him trying to sell to people who want to set up their own stores and take on iTunes.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   I'm not even sure that's a viable option here. I think you're right that he's got his eyes on the ITV, but I still am not seeing the big picture here of why this is, you know, because it's not for those people.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Those people are going to be able to get their videos on the store and sell them. It's only a matter of time.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   You know, so who is this for? This is for somebody like Real Networks or a small version of that to put up a little kind of mom and pop video store that's, you know, I guess you could do that in the ITV compatible, but you can put out a file that's ITV compatible now.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   It just won't have DRM on it.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   I mean, I think that there is a growing push. I know that not so much on the DRM side, but for podcasters, I think that there's a lot of people who would like to really be able to sell stuff, either, you know, particularly through iTunes.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   I mean, they can sell it on their own now, but I think some of them are concerned about having their own DRM. Some of them would not, you know, I think that there's a, even though people can get onto iTunes, I think one of the concerns is that I know in the big media is allowing iTunes to keep on building.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   You know, they really got their butts handed to them, you know, when they tried to renegotiate the price of songs.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   And I think that there's a concern that Apple is now, I think the seventh largest song, you know, music reseller in the United States.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   I mean, is it fifth now?
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Fifth and job said next year, though, before?
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Yeah, and I think that there's a concern. I think what big media, while they have access to the iTunes music store, I think what they're afraid of is putting all their own stuff in the world.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   I mean, I think what they're afraid of is putting all their eggs into that basket again, allowing someone who has an enormous amount of control over their music future, having the same thing over their movie future.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   I think it's something that a lot of them would like to see it being sold somewhere else, but still have access to the iPod and still have DRM.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   I mean, they kind of want everything in that.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   But I think that that's a lot of why we've seen them try to build up other things, the other movie downloads sites, the Amazon's, you know, all these other things is to try to diversify their exposure.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And you were going to say something.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Well, I think, you know, I can see your point and I think you may be right that that's what they think, but at the same time, you know, you made the assumption that they really had it handed to them.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   But, you know, would you not say that the existence of iTunes has generated money for that industry?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   I mean, I don't think it's transferred it or sort of made the sales be less valuable because they used to be Amazon sales and now they're Apple sales.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   And they've, you know, they've, Apple's created a market here. So in some ways, it's not about, you know, having, being, it's about being vulnerable and not having somebody to play against Apple, I suppose, more than anything else.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   I'm not sure if DVD John's kind of alternative DRM is ever going to be that.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   It's much more likely that you're going to see it through, you know, Microsoft's Zoom or, you know, who knows what some other thing that is a competitor, you know, that's outside the Apple ecosystem.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   I mean, it's funny because everybody just wants to break into the iPod.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   It's like, "Give me the iPod. I want the iPod." You know, it's...
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   I think there... I mean, I'll say, I think that's their argument. I think they're flat wrong.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   I mean, I think that Apple is the best thing that happened to them when it comes to selling this stuff.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And I think that if they had listened to Apple on the movies, I think the movies are overpriced on it on Amazon and on iTunes.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   You know, I think that the $9.99 maybe makes sense.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   But I really think that the $14.99 is too high and I think Apple had the, you know, had to make that money.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   You know, had to make that compromise. I think that if I think if the movie industry listened to Apple a little bit more, I think that they would make a lot more money.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   You know, so I don't think that they're correct, I think, but I think that's what they're worried about.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   And I think that their, you know, their head is too far shoved up into a dark area that they can't, you know, figure out which way is up.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   So now, Scott, now you said that... Speaking of the Zoom that Jason was talking about, Scott, you said you saw one in the wild?
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   I saw one, well, I don't know how wild it was, but I was at the announcement.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   For all I know it was actually a tame Zoom. And we were at the Zoom Zoom in Redmond, Washington during the announcement.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   And why don't you mention that article we found that said the five reasons why this is going to kill the iPhone?
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Yeah, this is a kill kill the iPhone.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   In the tech news world, they say there's five reasons the Zoom may kill the iPod at market forces.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   That, you know, that it's the collective power of XP.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Sharing fever, you can share songs back and forth between, you know, between your Zunes.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   More content in a bigger screen, which is pretty funny, I'm sure Scott will.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Same number of pixels.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Same number of pixels, just a slightly larger screen.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   And it's surprisingly cool, according to tech news world. It's surprisingly, surprisingly cool.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Okay, well, I'm surprised.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   I'm surprised that someone is well-
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   It's technically cool.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Yeah, these are guys who think that Linux, you know, is probably something that everybody wants to have in their port.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Here's the thing.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Okay, now let's kind of, I'm not going to go through those in order, but here's the five reasons why the Zoom is going to end up like every other iPod competitor.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Number one, this wireless thing, it is just Bura.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   I mean, you can't sync wirelessly with it.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   When I found that out, all you can do is sort of stand in Starbucks by yourself and hold your Zoom up and go, "Anybody? Anybody?"
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Looking for somebody else to say, "You can't use it like to sync up your songs or anything like that."
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   So that's stupid.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Number two, there's no podcast support.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Hello!
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   That's kind of important.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   You can't get a podcast there saying, "Third parties will have to figure that out."
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Well, that's just wonderful.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   The third thing that's just really dumb is this point system.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   I'm old. I can barely figure out how to buy something on iTunes at 99 cents.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Now I got to count points.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   If I go into Kroger's and have to use a special card to get the special deal, it should just be money.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Then there's the form factor style deal.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   You know, let's look at the iPods.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   We've got the Nano, we've got the Shuffle, we've got the iPod with video.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   We've got several choices.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   With Microsoft, you get one form factor and it reminds me of the old Cadillac ads.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   It comes in any color you want as long as it's black.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Then speaking of color, here is the final straw that ate the camel.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Let alone break his back.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   The frickin' thing is brown.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Only some of them are brown to be fair.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   And the box it comes in is brown to size.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   And the click wheel is fake.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Well, I have to admit, so someone who remained nameless,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Leo and I play with when we were at the podcasting convention.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   I thought that it was actually kind of fun.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   I definitely enjoyed it more than I thought I would.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   But I did find they have this wheel that's round.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   It's not a wheel though, it's just you click up and down.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   It's just a little round piece.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   The problem, of course, is that we're all trained.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Every time I put my thumb down on it, I started going around in circles
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   and nothing was happening.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   I was like, "Oh, I can't make it work."
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   But the brown, I will say that I thought that the brown didn't look that bad.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Jason, have you seen one yet?
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Have you seen...
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   I have not held one in my hands.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   We're gonna go buy one and try it out, but I haven't seen one.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   So, make sure it's returnable, Jake.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Yeah, well, that's exactly right.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Yeah, I hope so for the sake of everybody who buys it thinking
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   it's basically an iPod.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   I mean, it's a Microsoft iPod.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   What's it gonna be?
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   It may be the second best digital music player ever made,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   but that's still second best, right?
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   And I think that a lot of hope is being put into the...
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Hopefully, you're gonna see soapbox really turn off.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   I mean, soapbox is still in beta.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   And there's a lot of viral, and they're working on some viral pieces
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   there related to that.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   But still, getting stuff from soapbox, for instance, to the Zoom
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   is not nearly as easy.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And I actually think I've been looking at soapbox a little bit.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Which I think is actually pretty cool.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   But I think that one of the big problems they're gonna have is once again,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   and people have heard me say this like over and over and over again.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   But without a net application is a great thing.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   A web page managing media is not so great.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   When you want to interface with any kind of piece of hardware.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   You know, on the show we've talked a lot about consumer, sort of interest
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   and consumer choice.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   And I don't envy Microsoft the situation they're in.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   And I understand they want to compete with Apple, and that's good for them.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   But the consumer need, basically the Zoom's consumer need statement is,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   it's not an iPod.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Well, I'm not sure consumers really want a not an iPod.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   I think they want an iPod, and that's a tough thing to fight.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   And so it's like, it's not an iPod, but it's kind of like an iPod,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   but it's not an iPod, and that's why you want it is.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   It's not.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Because it's not, you won't be locked into Apple's whole ecosystem.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   You'll be locked into Microsoft's whole ecosystem.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Wait a second.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Well, if I've got to be locked into one, why don't I be locked into the one
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   that 90% of the people who have this product have?
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   I mean, it's really tough, and I don't envy them their task,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   because I don't, you know, they're not really that likely to succeed.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Plus they're losing what?
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   50 bucks per unit?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   So good luck.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   I agree with you.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   They're going to make it up on volume.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Well, I'll go out on the limb and just say that I think it's just butt ugly.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   And if they think, you know, the people they think are going to run up to each other,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   sort of pointing their zoons at each other to share music,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   are probably teenagers.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And teenagers want something that looks cool.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   This thing does not look cool.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   It looks like my father's car, you know?
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Well, I think that people do have to, it isn't about being not an iPod.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   It really has to be something that is, it's got to be way better than an iPod.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   I mean, someone has to do something that is significantly better,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   and there are places to improve.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Like the wireless is really cool if you could do something other than sync with other people who have it.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   If you could have, if you were able to, for instance, download your songs on wireless,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   use VoIP.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Like, for instance, the Milo is able to, you know, Sony's Milo is able to, you know,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   you're able to use VoIP with it.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   If you were able to surf the web or get access to at least the videos and everything else,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   we would have downloaded them.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   That creates something.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   If you had GPS built in, if you had a phone built in, all those things.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Sure.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Sure.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Sure.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Your playlist, or listen, I always want to have it that I can tune in people who are around me
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   and if they let me, if they have that setting turned on,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   listen to what they're listening to right then.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   I would love that kind of feature.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   So people could say, hey, if you're curious what I'm listening to, tune me in,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   and they would be able to do it.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   There's so many ways the iPod can be improved.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   You're totally right.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   And I look at the zoom and, you know, all I see is, well, it's really just an iPod that is an iPod.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Right.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   And so I think that that's the thing that is, you know, if people up the ante a little bit,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   I think that they could compete with Apple, but just doing another player that's like Apple,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   but not under the Apple moniker, I don't think it's going to be, it's not going to go anywhere.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Okay.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   So we wrote that.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   So let me, you know, I'm hoping I personally would like to see more competition because I think
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   that there are lots of things that could be improved with the iPod.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   I think there's a lot of things.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   And I think we would see, you know, I think that Apple has gotten into a point where,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   I mean, and I think this happened to Microsoft, you know, and this is why Microsoft is in the position
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   it's in right now, is that, is that Microsoft got so far ahead and had so little competition
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   for market share that they just kind of produce things at a leisurely pace.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   However, they felt like it, they got it going.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   And what I'm afraid of is seeing, you know, Apple produces new iPods, for instance, that
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   will leisurely place.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   They know what everybody wants now.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   They know what we're all waiting for, you know, being able to see bigger movies and have wireless
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   and GPS and phones and everything else.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   And they'll get to it when they're good and ready because no one's even close.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   If someone was closer pushing them harder, you know, they'd have to innovate faster.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   And we may actually see wireless features in the iPod sooner than we would have otherwise,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   because Zoon has that checkbox.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Right.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Even if they're bad, they're there.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   And it'll be interesting to see if what Apple does, you know, puts the Zoon to shame.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   I would imagine that when they do wireless features, they will put the Zoon to shame, but that's
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   the mystery.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Hopefully they're pushing them there because you're right.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Apple should be pushed.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   They, they, competition is a good thing.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   I mean, now they're very comfortable milking, you know, as much as they can out of every
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   hardware, you know, it was just good for their profits and good for their, you know, their
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   investors.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Just not as good for us.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   I want my, I want my, my iPhone.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   So anyway, Alex, Alex, you cannot play my song on this.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.120]   So, so, but what I want to know is I, I can't envision how people are going to use this.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.200]   And I'd love to know, perhaps I'm missing something and you guys have an idea.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:12.000]   I mean, do you really think you're going to be walked down the street and like see someone
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   coming towards you and ask them if they have a Zoon in their pocket?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.440]   And if so, whip it out and point it at me so I can listen to your songs or just kind of
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.440]   be for.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.440]   More than likely.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.440]   They're going to have a special secret pocket in their vest.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.160]   They're going to be putting the Zoon in their son.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.480]   I don't want to seize it and pressing the sync button, hoping somebody else walks by
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.480]   as well.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.880]   And not that Scott's being rough or anything.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.880]   So, so now big to move to move on to another thing that's going to push up against what
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.920]   Apple's working on that might have a better chance.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.920]   I don't know.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.960]   On the, on the, on the, this is in the, I guess in the front page of Mac, of Mac world,
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.720]   actually today I saw the Sage TV Media Center software coming to the Mac.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:54.480]   Now, Jason, can you give us some background on the Sage TV?
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.480]   Not a lot.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.680]   It's, it's basically software that's going to come to the Mac.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.200]   It works with, with tuner hardware.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.880]   I think it isn't a tuner itself.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.080]   It works with tuner hardware that you attach to the Mac or, or PC.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.480]   And it works, you know, it's essentially like the ITV combo that, you know, that Elgato
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.480]   sells.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.240]   The only difference is that with Sage TV, they also have a remote component.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.480]   So in addition to setting it up and letting you like record shows or watch TV on your
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.440]   Mac, you can connect to it remotely and play back a show that your Mac record shows.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.520]   And then you can, you know, record it or, or stream life TV.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:33.560]   So it makes it sort of like a combination of like an ITV and maybe like a sling box kind
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.560]   of thing.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.960]   And, and there's been, and it's been pretty successful on the PC side, right?
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.200]   I mean, it's, it's done okay over, over there.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.600]   Well, I mean, I've never heard of it before today.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   So I don't know how successful it could have been.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.800]   I mean, obviously, you know, it's, it's a matter of degrees.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.200]   Nobody's really figured out how to do this.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.200]   Right.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.760]   I think, I think of all of these sling boxes, the only one that I've, I've even heard of,
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.360]   and that's because they have a pretty, you know, decent ad budget and they're advertising.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.360]   Right.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.680]   And I have a sling box and it's cool.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.720]   And I, I've used a fair bit of the, the ITV, you know, the, the, what, what I now, I guess
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.400]   the McGit, uh, Miglia, is that right?
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.960]   Um, there's the Miglia HD right.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.080]   And there's the ITV from, from Elgato.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.080]   And yeah.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.600]   And those are, those are, I really, you know, I really enjoy those, but of course a lot of
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.120]   us are wondering what, you know, what's going to happen.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:24.600]   And we've seen this direct TV now is talking about being able to move stuff from your PC
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.760]   to your, I mean, I think everybody is, is moving that direction, but, you know, I don't
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.880]   think anybody's done it well yet.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.200]   And we'll see how quickly the ITV, you know, comes out.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.280]   So, um, I think that's always going to be the big question.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.080]   So those, I think are the, did anyone have any other big stories, uh, or larger stories?
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.680]   I don't even know if those were headliners this, this week.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.960]   Oh, here's a little one.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.960]   You know what today is?
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.440]   What is today?
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.320]   It's international killed DRM day.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.320]   Oh, that's right.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.320]   Something like that.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.320]   Back to DRM.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.320]   We are.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.320]   Okay.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.320]   It is.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.320]   It's a minute to DRM wasn't enough.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:03.880]   I have a CDRW disk that I use only for one task, which is I erase it.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.800]   I burn whatever I just bought from the iTunes store.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:12.160]   I re-rip it into MP3 and then I erase the disk and start again.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.320]   And that's how I kill my DRM so that I've got some DRM free versions of my iTunes tracks
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.200]   to play because I've got a squeeze box from slim devices and, you know, like anything
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.960]   that isn't made by Apple, it won't play those.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.840]   So CDRW, it's old technology and it works great at stripping DRM out.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.640]   Macquality is still okay.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.240]   Yeah, I think that people can work around it.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.680]   I mean, I work around most of the stuff pretty quickly.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.880]   And in similar fashion, although I should be using CRW.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.400]   CDRWs, I just been using CDRs.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.400]   I mean, that's 50.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.600]   You know, I guess it cost me another 50 cents.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.160]   I do, I do them in groups.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.320]   It's like four cents per disk or something now that they're.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.320]   Gee, it's nothing.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.880]   I just have Navaceti or W and, you know, it's less plastic than I'm throwing away, I guess.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:55.880]   Now, the, on the kind of just little things that are coming out this week, has anyone
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.840]   seen, what do people think of this new .Mac email UI?
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.520]   Does anyone use .Mac's web interface?
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.520]   I do.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.520]   Do you like?
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.200]   Well, here's the good news.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.920]   My .Mac account broke a couple of months ago.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.040]   I could receive email, but I couldn't send it.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.880]   And Apple kind of puts in very bold letters on their website.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.680]   We don't support .Mac, even though we take your hundred dollars.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.400]   So they wouldn't help me.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.640]   And I sent them an email saying, "I know you don't support it, which is why I won't be
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.240]   renewing because it doesn't work anymore."
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.000]   But then when they did the update, now it magically works.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.080]   So for me, the good news was that it works again.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:37.240]   And I don't really think there's anything special about what .Mac provides in the way
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.600]   of a male client that you can't get from other things other than it does offer some
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.280]   syncing things that are cool for Mac users that have to deal with syncing this or that
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.280]   feature.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:51.800]   Other than that, I mean, you can use Gmail, you can use any number of free services.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.760]   I don't know that .Mac is going to be that relevant unless they do something to ramp it
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.440]   up just a little bit more.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.480]   What they're showing this week is the preview in the new UI, which really looks a lot more
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.760]   like the male interface.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.280]   So it's not just a web interface, which is totally, in my opinion, unusable.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:14.280]   I don't do web mail very much, and it just drives me crazy, but allows you to drag and
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:20.400]   drop functions and a lot of the other things that you would normally have within the mail
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.400]   app.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.360]   I guess this is coming soon.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.920]   I don't think it's actually, I don't believe it's actually out yet.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.840]   I think I might give it a try.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.880]   It's basically to move over from Gmail to that.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:39.880]   And every so often when my subscription comes up, I wrestle with myself about whether I'm
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.400]   going to pay another $99.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.880]   I fork the money over, and then I usually don't use the services.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.880]   And the thing I would like to use the most is the syncing services, and they just don't
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.440]   work as much as I can see.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.880]   They don't work for me.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.080]   Nothing happens.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.760]   So if there were something that I could use, then I would feel more justified in working
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:57.760]   over my $99.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.960]   So I think it would take a look at that.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.960]   I mean, I use mine.mac a lot, and I do do the syncing.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.720]   And then I also use it for an easy place to put stuff up for people to grab, although
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.960]   because of the Pixel Core we have our own servers.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.480]   I think if I was without the Pixel Core, I'd be using it constantly.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.040]   And I actually pay more than $99.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:18.960]   I have lots of drive space and stuff like that.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:23.160]   But yeah, I think that I have found that I've used it less and less, and I think they
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.160]   do need to rejuvenate it.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:28.960]   Jason, do you have any sense of whether they're going to push.mac any harder?
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.960]   I don't know.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.120]   I mean, they don't talk about it a whole lot.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.560]   But undoubtedly, when Leopard comes out, they'll add even more .mac features.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.600]   I mean, that's really the reason I think why most people pay for .mac is because there
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:45.440]   are easy syncing features that, you know, I think work for most people, maybe not for
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.640]   Jan, but for a lot of people.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:54.000]   And Apple makes it very hard to sync with a source other than .mac, but very easy to
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   sync with .mac.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   And so when Leopard comes out, not only is that a less upgrade, but it'll also be an
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.120]   inducement to continue paying for .mac.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.760]   And I would imagine Apple makes a lot of money on .mac because it doesn't seem like they
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:11.800]   put huge amounts of effort into marketing it or into developing it.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:19.760]   I know they do develop it, but you could replicate a lot of what it provides for free on the
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.400]   net or for really cheap.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.960]   And so, you know, it's a convenience thing and, you know, it's interesting.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.280]   We're actually, we were talking today in an editorial meeting about doing a story about
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:33.440]   .mac and kind of digging into it and comparing it to what it else is out there because, you
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.520]   know, they've got a lot of competition.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.920]   The one thing that they don't have is that, you know, the people who make .mac are in
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.920]   tight with the people who make .mac OS X because they work for the same company.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.760]   And that's a, you know, that's a pretty big advantage they've got.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.600]   Having that all wired in, I have to admit, when I break it out, I mean, when I think about
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.440]   it as $100 when the, when the, when it comes up due, it seems like a lot of money.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.680]   But when I think about it as $8 a month, you know, I'd, I don't need to use it that much
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:57.680]   to make it worth it.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:01.360]   The, the, and if you buy your renewal on Amazon, it's like Stephanie.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.360]   Oh, really?
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.920]   You can buy a box, a .mac box on Amazon and it's free super saver shipping.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.000]   Here's a little, little tip because I just did this and then when, and turn off auto renew
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.960]   on your credit card on .mac and when you get the box, you basically type in the code
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.920]   and it renews your .mac so you can actually do it for a whole, for a lot less than 99.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.920]   That's, that's tasty.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:27.560]   We know that, know that Amazon's always out there cutting, cutting corners for us.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.040]   Also 1048 has been released.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.160]   This is improves networking in the finder.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:37.400]   Anything major with this, with this release, was there anything that was really important
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:43.480]   versus just kind of a, are they just like the most notable feature was the, was scroll
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.960]   wheel zooming, which if you didn't know that it was turned on, if you had like screen
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:53.040]   zooming turned on by default and you did notice, it, it adds the ability, which is kind of
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.760]   cool to, to zoom into your screen with your scroll wheel.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:01.560]   I had one of my editors was freaked out this morning because she was mistakenly held down
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:05.560]   the modifier key while she turned her scroll wheel and all of a sudden she zoomed in like
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.160]   close to, yeah, what's going on?
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.160]   What happened?
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.640]   It's, so I think some people are going to get creeped out by that.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:14.120]   But you know, I think that may be the biggest new feature and for it.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.800]   There's a couple of things.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.800]   There's a couple of things.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:25.040]   Aperture is completely dependent upon the 10.4.8 release because the, all the stuff relative
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.120]   to the rock and version is handled by the GPU.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:33.720]   It's all fit into the OS and all the new camera modules, et cetera are delivered through 10.4.8.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.920]   So those who use aperture are going to really be happy about it.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.280]   Because if you don't have 10.4.8, you can't upgrade to 1.5 in aperture.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:45.240]   And to piggyback on what Jason said, I think the scroll thing is really cool.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:49.160]   If you, you know, get into your 50s like me and you can't see the type on the 30 inch
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.480]   Apple cinema display as you use, good as you use to, you can scroll right in.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.320]   But I'll give you a tip that you may not even know because this, I sort of figured this
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.520]   one out by accident as I often do.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.280]   You can actually do the same thing.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:06.240]   If you don't have the tracking mouse, you can do it on a laptop with the trackpad.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.720]   You can do the two finger scroll and hold down the modifier key and it works just like you
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.400]   had the track ball.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:17.720]   I have to admit that I'm, that's where I feel like an old person where I just can't stand
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:21.480]   my trackpad doing anything other than the basic mouse stuff.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.000]   Any time I do that too, it always does something.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.480]   Really the two finger, I love the two finger scroll.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.760]   I had to switch up for a while back to a laptop that didn't have it.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.360]   And it was like somebody cut off one of my arms.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.880]   I love the two finger scroll.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.880]   It's great.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.760]   So now we have three fingers zooming.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.760]   Oh, God.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.520]   I don't need that.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.360]   My eyes aren't that bad yet.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.200]   Last, last question.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.040]   Wouldn't that give you arthritis too?
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.680]   If your eyes are going bad, you might actually get the arthritis too with your, an extra
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:52.680]   finger.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.680]   Here's the good news, Jason.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   If your eyes are going bad, you've already got arthritis.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.680]   Oh, excellent.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.680]   No, no, not too.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.680]   That comes next.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:38:59.680]   I've told you.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.680]   I'm sorry to.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.680]   Go ahead, Jen.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.680]   I'll start.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:08.640]   There's another thing in 10.4.8 that I'm really excited about.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.360]   And that is I'll finally be able to connect to Comcast and it will work.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.160]   And that means I can scrap my DSL.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.800]   I can't wait because that just doesn't stay on.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   Right, right, right.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.400]   So also, just, and I'm only going to mention a couple of these.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.680]   I mean, there's always tons of stuff coming out, but I will.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.480]   This is one that I'm actually pretty excited about.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:29.400]   I haven't actually got to play with yet that have you seen this connective?
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.680]   This is from M Audio.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.680]   This little DJ box.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.840]   I don't know.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.520]   I think I put it in the notes.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.480]   We'll put it in the show notes here.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.040]   This is the M Audio Connective.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.080]   Now, the only reason I'm talking about this is because I used to be a DJ.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.080]   You know, the wedding singer?
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.520]   I was the wedding DJ for about three years.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.880]   I did like 300 weddings.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.720]   And this is the thing that I've been waiting for.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.000]   So if you're doing parties or DJing or whatever, this connects.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.360]   It's actually PC or Mac, but it just came.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.320]   It was just released in it.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.160]   And it allows you to really set up mixes and beat mixes and everything else.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.480]   It's got this cool little interface.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:09.600]   So I'm hoping to actually experiment with it, but it looks pretty awesome.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.080]   Alex, this is one of my favorite things about my life.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.080]   Yes.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:16.240]   You're no longer a DJ, but you love this DJ box.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.480]   You don't own a car, but you love the TomTom GPS.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.120]   You're a very young film.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:26.000]   But now I don't own a car, but I actually drive in one a lot.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.280]   So I am the master of rental cars.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.960]   So I'm only home half of them.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.320]   So are you going to pretend to be a DJ?
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.320]   I am.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.320]   I'm going to have a party.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.800]   I'm going to invite you all.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.240]   We'll have a big party.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.640]   Maybe during Mac world or something.
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.360]   And I'll spend some really bad tunes for you from the late 80s.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:49.920]   So also, just as a side note, for those of you into Panga...
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.920]   I don't even know where Topanga is.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.160]   Topanga Canyon Boulevard.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.160]   Canoga Park.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.960]   You got a new Apple store coming up this on Saturday.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:56.960]   The Valley, right?
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.960]   Yeah, it is.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:58.960]   It's a Valley.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.960]   So there should be...
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.960]   Yeah, I was going to say something really bad, but I won't.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.960]   Not a Valley, but it's a Valley.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:04.960]   The Valley.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.960]   Just...
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.160]   Like Valley Girls Valley.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.960]   Like, it's going to be like so great.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.960]   So anyways...
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.160]   It's the SaaS Valley Girl I have ever heard.
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.160]   I was going to...
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.640]   Here's what happens when I stop halfway.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.200]   You DJ for the Valley Girls.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.200]   You don't...
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.200]   Exactly.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.200]   Exactly.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.200]   Exactly.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.920]   So I was going to go full out and then I decided that was going to sound really bad.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.000]   So anyway, so that's it.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   I think that's all I had.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.240]   Does anyone have any other big news for this week?
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.320]   What about this thing you put in the notes where the governor of New Jersey is trying
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.000]   to tax iTunes sales.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Unbelievable.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.080]   Well, I just...
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.080]   Only in New Jersey.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.320]   Only in New Jersey when they're running out of money.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.680]   Where can we make some money?
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.240]   Well, Apple's making some money.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.240]   Let's go there.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.200]   I think the big problem with that, of course, is going to be interstate commerce.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.120]   You know, you're not...
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.120]   It's going to go...
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.880]   It'll go to the Supreme Court before anyone pays any taxes on it.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.600]   Because you're not...
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.760]   You can't do that right now.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:08.840]   I mean, this is just reason number 2397 not to lose.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.840]   Send your email to Alex at...
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.640]   Wait, we just alienated a lot of listeners.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.640]   That's what I said.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:19.800]   You're making me assumption that everybody who listens from New Jersey loves New Jersey
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   and would defend it.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.400]   I'm not sure knowing who I know who's from New Jersey.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.400]   I'm not sure.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.480]   So, no, it's...
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.320]   No, we love New Jersey.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.320]   We kid New Jersey.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.640]   We just kid it.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.080]   We don't love the governor, but we...
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.440]   Well, we just think that he's silly and desperate.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.440]   That's all.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.440]   Yes.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.360]   So, I think that's about it.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.120]   Now, Jan, you have a...
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:44.280]   You've got a new podcast, don't you?
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.280]   I do.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.600]   And thank you for asking.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.600]   Where is it called?
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.800]   It's called Photoshop Online.TV.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.680]   And it's me teaching Photoshop.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:57.960]   I've been doing for, seems like, 100 years, but getting to do it to many more people than
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.680]   I could reach in any other medium.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:04.200]   The books I write or the CDs I publish, all that stuff doesn't compare with the number
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.200]   of people that listen to the podcast already in just a month.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.200]   Awesome.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.200]   Well, so definitely check that out.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.760]   And that's on iTunes, of course.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.240]   So, you can definitely check that out.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.240]   Yes, of course.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:16.840]   Scott, of course, has the iLife Zone in addition to this.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.720]   So, we got some big news this week at the Portable Media Expo.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.560]   We announced that the iLife Zone is now formally a part of the TWIT Network.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.560]   Which is very...
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.560]   So, that was kind of fun.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.840]   And so, soon you'll be able to find that on TWIT.TV.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:32.160]   And so, that's going to be fantastic.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.160]   Pretty excited about that.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.160]   Absolutely.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.440]   And then, Jason, of course, you are from Macworld.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.080]   Macworld.com is all you need to know.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:43.040]   And now, you guys have your own podcast, right?
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.600]   Yeah, we do.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:48.680]   In fact, I cut Macworld podcast number 55, Justice.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.680]   So...
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:53.120]   So, yeah, yeah, we do that.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.720]   And then, actually, a bunch of guys who are on our blog site, MacUser.com, they have
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.960]   a podcast, too, that just started and is pretty cool.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.480]   That's our blog site.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:05.200]   And it's like a couple of guys in their 20s and a couple of teenagers who are the bloggers.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:09.760]   And it's pretty fun to listen to their podcast because you can sort of see sort of the different
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.320]   stages of puberty that everybody's gone through.
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.320]   It's pretty cool.
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.320]   Now, you could see that right here, Jason.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:21.360]   Now, Jason, how are you recording the podcast that you guys do at Macworld?
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.920]   Are you doing them all in the office there?
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.720]   Or are you doing them spread out?
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.720]   How do you handle that?
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.600]   Well, you know, we try to do them.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.480]   We try to get people from the office involved, although Chris Breen is our regular host and
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.400]   he's out this month.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.400]   But so, Sarus, who used to do it, he was in the office and I'm in the office doing it
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.400]   now.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.040]   And a lot of what we do is sort of like this.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:46.640]   You get people on Skype or you get people to do kind of a two-hand record where they,
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:51.360]   you know, we talk on the phone, but each participant is actually recording themselves
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.600]   in their own place and then you kind of stitch it together at the end.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.680]   And it's been pretty cool because we try to tap all the experts that we've got in-house,
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:03.400]   but we can also bring people in from around the world over the net, which has actually
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:04.760]   been a lot of fun.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.160]   So, but yeah, we do that ourselves.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:11.760]   And once Chris is back next month, he'll be picking that up again.
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.440]   And Chris is sort of virtually in the office.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.520]   He's down in the South Bay, but he's in the family.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.640]   He might as well be in the office.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:25.520]   And so, and you can get to those podcasts either in iTunes or at from Macworld.com, right?
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.960]   Yeah, Macworld.com/podcast, in fact.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.400]   Well, I think that's it.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.400]   We've come to the end.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.400]   This is Alex Lindsay.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.400]   Thanks for coming and we'll see you next week.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.400]   That's it.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.400]   Hey, hey guys.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.400]   Hi guys.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:35.400]   Thanks so much for your thanks.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.400]   Hey, hey guys.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.400]   Hi guys.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.360]   Thanks so much for your thanks.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:46:02.120]   thanks for your patience.
