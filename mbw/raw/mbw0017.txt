[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.600]   Beatles, Bugs, and more.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:48.680]   Hey, everybody.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.640]   This is Alex Linson.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.880]   And we are back again for another episode, episode 17
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.200]   of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.640]   And we've got Scott Born coming in from Gig Harbor.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.760]   Hage, Scott.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.840]   How's it going?
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.360]   Up here in the very rainy end for the first time
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.360]   in a long time, snowy northwest.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.560]   I was just talking-- a friend of mine just got snowed in in Vancouver.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.680]   And I hadn't heard of that before.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.600]   Well, we don't get much snow, but when we do,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.600]   it's a ton of fun.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.520]   One day a year, the entire town goes absolutely crazy.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.720]   The people in Minnesota, meanwhile, are laughing going,
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.880]   you got an inch of snow and you're going nuts.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.000]   We get two feet a day, no problem.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.240]   When I was a kid, I went to this school.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.520]   It was an hour and a half drive every morning to get there.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.920]   And one-- there was a husband and wife that drove us.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.280]   It was a little private school.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.640]   And drove the little bus.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.320]   And the wife was from England.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.360]   And the husband was from Minnesota.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.800]   And so depending on who was driving, if we had snow,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.960]   if there was an inch of snow, and she was driving,
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.240]   school was off.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.960]   If there was four feet of snow and he was driving,
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.960]   we were still going to be there on time.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.680]   So also, we have Chris Breen.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.680]   Chris is coming in from Santa Cruz.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.240]   That's right.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.400]   And it's not snowing here.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.840]   The surf's always up.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.400]   Rub it in, man.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.400]   Just rub it in.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.160]   Is the surf good-- is the surf good, Chris?
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.920]   Have you been out there sampling it?
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.840]   I have not, because unless you are born and raised here
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.240]   and have been living here for ever and past generations
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.240]   as well, if you get in that water and those people
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.200]   don't know you, they'll kill you.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.760]   They will.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.160]   Surfing around here is incredibly competitive.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.200]   And there really is.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.720]   There's water that people own.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.480]   And if they don't know you, you better not get in their way,
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.200]   because they will hurt you.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.440]   How do you work your way up?
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.120]   That's the question.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.960]   You pretty much had to start when you were 10.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.440]   What you started at is--
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.120]   Yeah, you started as a kid.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.120]   And you surf certain spots.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.000]   And after a while, you get to be known.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.960]   And you have to be good, because if you're bad
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.840]   and get in front of somebody else, forget it,
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.600]   you're getting beaten up in the parking lot.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.000]   That's great.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   So we've got quite a few stories here.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.080]   On the top of the list today, there
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.800]   is an analyst who is-- or people have been starting
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.080]   to talk about the idea that ITV may be a little
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.600]   beyond just streaming video.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.440]   I guess the rumor-- this is from Apple Insider.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.800]   The rumor is that there might be advanced interfaces.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   So what do you guys think?
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.000]   Do you think it's just going to be an extension of what
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.960]   we see right now?
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.400]   Or do you think Apple's going to add a lot more into it?
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.840]   Chris?
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.160]   I'm not sure that it's going to be a huge extension.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.200]   Partly what this is coming out of is the fact
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.640]   that it was Iger from Disney leaked the fact
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.200]   that there's a hard drive inside this thing.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.640]   And people were thinking, ah, well, then, ah, well, of course,
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.640]   it's going to be a DVR.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.840]   And I'm not sure that's the case,
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.680]   because what's driving this thing, other than the fact
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.120]   that Apple does want to bring iTunes to the television,
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.440]   is they also want to sell more stuff
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.880]   from the iTunes music store.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.160]   So I'm not sure why they'd want to get into the Tivo market,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.200]   because they don't make a nickel off that.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.120]   But they do make a nickel off selling content on iTunes.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.160]   But I do see that that hard drive could certainly
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.680]   be used as a buffer.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.440]   Currently, there is a question about what kind of networking
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.920]   they're going to have inside this thing.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.200]   I've been streaming video over 802.11g,
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.120]   and it is dog slow.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.000]   I mean, it's just not good enough.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.200]   So the question is, are they going to have an in there?
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.280]   And I think probably so.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.520]   But if not, if they want to make the thing as compatible
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.080]   as possible, it makes sense that they would have a hard drive
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.280]   that would act as a buffer so that your content is streamed
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.560]   to this buffer.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.200]   The hard drive, just as Tivo does now in a network situation,
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.240]   it grabs a hold of enough so that it can deliver us
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.800]   a faithful stream based on what kind of content or throughput
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.160]   it's getting, and then go for that.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.640]   Hey, everybody.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.080]   This is Alex, and we had some technical problems here.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.400]   So what we did is we cut out of the show a little bit,
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.120]   a couple minutes.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.520]   You'll miss about three or four minutes.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.600]   And then we're going to cut right back into it
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.600]   rather than having it jerk or cut out huge chunks where
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.320]   I could smoothly cut back in.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.280]   I figured I'd just tell you what was going on.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.080]   So back to the regular schedule program.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.360]   Now, the question is, can you sell Zunes to North Korea?
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.080]   You cannot.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.520]   Are Zunes included in the luxury items that cannot be sent
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.200]   to North Korea?
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.760]   Well, I know what iPod is.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.680]   I know they said iPods were, and I heard
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.200]   that they weren't going to accept Zunes either.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.120]   Except the thing is, is that given the choice between trying
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.160]   to figure out how you're going to eat and buying an ugly MP3
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.040]   player, I don't think it's much of a worry.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.960]   Well, this seems to be aimed specifically
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.240]   at the president and his 600 loyalist families,
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.240]   so to speak, the ones that are actually
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.280]   capitalizing on North Korea's problems.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.800]   And evidently, they can't buy any jet skis, Rolex watches.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.560]   They can't-- no more cognac, no more expensive cars.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.240]   Hardly David since they're out the door.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.640]   And of course, iPods.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.480]   There's no iPods.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.800]   He is not going to be rocking out to Metallica anytime soon.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.920]   So I guess Chris, that means your trip to North Korea
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.720]   is off.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.560]   It is pretty much.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.000]   I was going to do a whole book tour there.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.400]   But no, I guess I'm not.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.080]   But I think that's great for Apple.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.240]   I mean, what a wonderful way to sort of advertise, oh,
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.640]   and by the way, we're among the handful of products
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.320]   that are so cool that we are going to deny them
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.520]   to the North Koreans, and they can get as many Zunes
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.880]   as they want.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.240]   We're bringing-- this is how the United States government now
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.680]   brings countries to their knees to cut off the iPods.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.840]   That's right.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.680]   And we're closing down the iTunes music store for you as well.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.120]   So I could just see it now.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.440]   The guy goes, you can't buy any jet skis in the North Korean
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.600]   guy goes, we don't got no stinking water to put them on anyway.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.040]   You can't have any catalogs.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.680]   Well, our roads are so crappy.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.240]   Who cares?
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.520]   You can't have an iPod.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.360]   No!
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.000]   The iPod.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.640]   Let's bring in the international--
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.480]   our international observers now.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.680]   So now, just to change the subject completely,
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.760]   have you guys tried the chat now feature on the Apple store
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.160]   online?
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.080]   Have you seen this?
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.000]   I haven't tried it, though.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.640]   No, I haven't tried it yet.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.000]   But it actually looks pretty good.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.120]   So Apple-- and a lot of companies
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.440]   have been doing this where they're adding a feature that
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.200]   allows you to--
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.160]   it's been evidently in the educational store for some time.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.280]   But it gives potential customers the ability
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.120]   to chat with a live sales representative
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.480]   and ask questions.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.600]   I have to admit, I didn't do this with the Apple store yet.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.320]   I did do it with USA Airways this morning.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.320]   And the experience was fairly good.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.520]   I mean, this idea of not having to call, I think,
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.840]   is actually a pretty good thing.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.440]   Would you guys actually use something like this?
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.080]   Only if I could chat with a dead sales person.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.600]   Oh, OK.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.160]   There you go.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.480]   That would like a sales person.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.240]   That's just boring.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.360]   You know, I think a lot of people
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.960]   would actually be really interested if you could chat
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.960]   with a dead sales person.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.120]   I think that would be a very popular thing.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.960]   How are things on the other side?
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.280]   And then, you know, the thing comes to mind, Alex,
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.160]   is that I have had some very good experiences
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.000]   at real Apple stores with quote unquote, live sales people.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.600]   I've also had some experiences where
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.000]   I had to explain to them what the headphone jack was
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.200]   for on a MacBook Pro.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.320]   So I don't really know that speaking with a live sales
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.520]   person via chat is going to be any more advantageous to me.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.800]   With most of the experiences that I've
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.600]   had with these live chat situations,
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.320]   you get the feeling that there is some poor person sitting
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.280]   there in India who has got like six or eight of these things
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.600]   open at the same time.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.080]   And they're just kind of going back and forth
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.760]   and back and forth as fast as they possibly can.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.800]   It's out of that or someone who's really, really slow.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.520]   Because, you know, of course, the messages are always
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.680]   like a minute apart as you talk to them.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.840]   Now, I haven't done the one with Apple,
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.680]   but I've done with a lot of other companies.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.360]   Because I have to admit, for me, I prefer not to call.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.280]   I don't need to talk to anyone on the phone.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.080]   Well, I like it, too.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.040]   Because it's been out.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.920]   What did you say?
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.680]   Has this been outsourced to India?
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.280]   I don't know if it's been outsourced to India.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.400]   I always get the impression that most of the stuff has been.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.640]   So I just come from that assumption now.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.480]   I don't-- because most of it is.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.080]   I mean, there's no reason not to.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:19.600]   You know, for the--
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.640]   I like the tech support done that way.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.840]   I've done it a couple of times.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.680]   And so often, you go to somebody's website,
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.120]   and you're having a problem, and you
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.600]   feel in a form somewhere.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.760]   And you just send it out into the ether,
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.240]   and you feel sort of privileged if three days later,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.640]   they actually get back to you.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.140]   Right.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.120]   And it's nice to type something in and actually have
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.040]   somebody respond to you so you can say,
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.000]   this is really what's going on.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.880]   And hopefully, I've been very lucky to have a couple of people
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.520]   who responded intelligently.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.960]   And even though they couldn't fix the problem right then,
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.840]   they said, I will ping you tomorrow,
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.240]   and we'll get this figured out.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.200]   And they did.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.360]   They sent me an email message that included the fix I needed.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.800]   I could move on from there.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.320]   So just the instant gratification of actually being able to talk
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.000]   to somebody robotic or not, rather than just setting this text
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.560]   field out into the ether is nice.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.360]   I definitely know that I--
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.480]   Would you have to call somebody and have them be there
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.080]   to pick up the phone though?
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.080]   Well, if they do, but I've had--
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.480]   I don't know about you, but I've had those three hour waits
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.760]   on the phone and the death.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.240]   Drives me up the wall.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.640]   And that's what I wanted to point out.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.960]   See, I think there's a potential for this to be cool,
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.200]   but the negative side for me is it's
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.040]   just going to give them one more excuse
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:34.160]   to employ one fewer guy at their help line, which means your three
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.880]   hour wait will become four hour waits.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.360]   And they'll say something like, we're sorry,
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.280]   all one of our assistants are busy on another call.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.800]   They may route you to the type in method instead.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.160]   But what if you can't get on the internet, for example?
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.360]   No, that does exactly.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.440]   That's my problem.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.480]   That's what I see is wrong with this.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.160]   I think of my 80-year-old aunt.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.920]   If she wants help trying to get on the internet,
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.440]   whether it's going to say, OK, now what you do is you open up
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.080]   the chat room and you talk to something like, well, she can't
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.040]   do that.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.480]   She can dial an 800 number though.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.040]   I think that it might be one more step towards depersonalization
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.520]   that makes me uncomfortable.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.280]   I know there's lots of other areas
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.920]   that I love depersonalization.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.640]   I used to have to-- I remember a long time ago
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.160]   where I used to go to the bank regularly.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.160]   And it was this thing.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.880]   I'd get to sit stand in these long lines,
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.760]   and I'd get to deal with the bank teller and all this other stuff
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.520]   to get whatever I needed.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.040]   And in the last probably five or six years,
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.280]   I've been in a bank like eight times.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.920]   I just don't ever have to go into the bank.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.880]   It never occurs for me to go-- because I do everything online.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.560]   And I think that that's a lot more mature than what we're doing
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.760]   right now with kind of this live chat.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.560]   But I think that for me, I would much prefer just to be able to handle
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.960]   something really, really quickly.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.360]   And I'd love it to work with email,
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.560]   except that the fact that most companies of you send them an email,
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.880]   you're not going to get a response back that's in real time.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.760]   And the problem with email is it's like that chat,
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.240]   except it's really extended.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.800]   If they didn't answer your question totally,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   then you have to wait another day before you get the next response.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.240]   And so you can end up a week in something that would take 10 minutes.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.600]   And as I prefer to have-- I mean, for me, I prefer to have the chat,
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.400]   just the iChat, whoever I'm talking to.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.920]   And anyway, I thought it was very interesting that they added it.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.200]   Alex, if you'd seen the ladies at my bank, you would go to the bank.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.440]   Ladies at my bank, make the trip to the bank worthwhile.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.520]   Well, there you go.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.920]   There you go.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.120]   So I don't have that here.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.520]   Now, have you guys seen the new ads that Apple's put out,
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.320]   the new Christmas ads, the gift exchange?
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.080]   I did.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:45.600]   What'd you think?
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.920]   Yeah, they're cute.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.400]   They're cute.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.600]   I think I'm getting a little-- you know what?
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.360]   I really thought this was a great ad campaign.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.920]   And now I'm getting a little tired.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.840]   I get a little tired.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.080]   You hit it on the head, Alex.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.720]   It's fun.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.800]   And it was fun for about 15 minutes.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.240]   And now that we're into 30 minutes,
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.000]   it's time to change the channel.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.240]   Yeah, it's--
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.400]   I'm ready for something.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:09.920]   Actually, I really like the cool 24 guy doing the first ad
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.560]   for the Intel.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.680]   I want more of that kind of stuff, more of the 1984 ad.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.760]   I want more of the big cool stuff.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.120]   And this was fun for a minute, but it's time to move on.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.120]   And also, I'm getting tired of the Matt guy.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.560]   I think he doesn't wear well over time.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.840]   Hodgman, I think, does.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.960]   I love watching him.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.640]   But after a while, I kind of get sick of the Matt guy.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.560]   And I say, you know, I understand why people hate you.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.280]   Because you've just come across as smarmy,
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.720]   know-it-all punk.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.080]   And I think that's a reputation that Apple's
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.440]   been trying to run away from for a long time.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.400]   But this just sort of underscores you.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.200]   But I think it's hard for people who use Max and who
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.560]   work at Apple to see that as--
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.160]   see him that way, you know, as snarky.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.880]   Because it's so part of the culture.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.560]   It's part of the-- to me, it occurs since a lot of times,
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.320]   it's part of the culture of having a Mac
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.640]   is being just a touch snarky about it.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.400]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.760]   And then you wonder why PC users hate Mac users.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.320]   You know, like, generalize about Apple just saying, oh, well,
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.560]   I'm going to buy a Zoom because you have an iPod.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.240]   And it's because of that sort of--
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.160]   we're better than you attitude.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.320]   And I'm as guilty as making that kind of statement as anyone.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.120]   There was someone who was asking me
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.880]   how to fix their computer like two days ago.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.120]   And I found myself-- I thought of a Mac guy
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.080]   because I found myself going, yeah, the first thing I do
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.960]   to fix your computer there is to buy Mac.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.120]   It was like, you know, they had a virus.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.720]   And I was just like, you know, don't even bother.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.040]   I don't want to know.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.920]   I guess I'm just guilty too.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.560]   I just realized because that's always what I say.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.360]   Yeah, no, so--
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.960]   That's the first thing I say, buy a Mac.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.040]   So where are those--
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.880]   I converted somebody yesterday.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.000]   You converted them.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.120]   They're not going to hell.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.440]   They are-- they bought their first Mac.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.800]   They bought an iMac.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.640]   My mom-- my mom went back.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.560]   I think my mom is the first person I've ever
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.640]   met to go from Mac to PC.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.320]   Oh my god.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.320]   She had-- she works on a PC at the office.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.960]   And then-- so my brother had an old Mac from the golf course
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.600]   and he gave it to her.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.920]   And she started using it.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.600]   And then she decided she just couldn't figure out it.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.960]   She just couldn't make-- you know,
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.120]   she's so used to the PC that she just--
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.320]   she finally got a PC for the home.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.040]   You know, I was-- my head turned around.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.560]   But I was like, oh, you're going to turn around on your neck.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.000]   Yeah, no, I was like, what?
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.080]   You know, it's--
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.280]   This never happens.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:26.880]   What are you doing?
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.680]   I know.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.600]   It was like an anomaly.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.040]   I mean, because everybody else in the family--
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.560]   You learned that you have a reputation
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.400]   to uphold in the Mac community, Alex.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.320]   Did you-- did you explain to her
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.480]   the ramifications of this move?
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.320]   You know, I was even questioning whether I should even
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.120]   say it in public.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.800]   But I thought that--
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.320]   I do applaud you for the courage to admit publicly what
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:44.760]   just happened.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.960]   It was really hard.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.920]   Like, you know, I just--
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.840]   I don't know what to do now.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.000]   No, I'm thinking-- now my next thing is to get her--
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.520]   I'm going to get her an Intel Mac and let her run, you know,
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.800]   parallels so she can do--
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.320]   That's a good idea.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.840]   So we'll slowly, slowly move her over.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.440]   You know, that's my next step.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.760]   But no, it was a hard week.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.120]   It was great.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.280]   We could do an intervention.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.800]   We'll just tie an iPod to her and let it run away.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.960]   Bob, this is four-year-old good.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:16.520]   Exactly.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.680]   So now, have you seen that there is a potential exploit?
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.680]   Potential F. F secure reveals a potential exploit for OSX.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.880]   Now, this is supposed to be some kind of ad wear.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.360]   Now, it's not in the wild, so people don't have to worry
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:28.920]   just yet.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.920]   But is this a real thing?
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.880]   Is this just another one of these?
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.440]   We think we can do something that might work on a Mac, kind
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.520]   of, bugs?
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.360]   Well, yesterday they did a security update that allegedly
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.560]   patched 21, 22 holes.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.080]   I don't know if this is covered in that.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:44.480]   But--
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.800]   No, this isn't part of it.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.920]   This isn't part of it.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.480]   You know, every week I hear one of these,
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.080]   but you know what?
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.840]   Every single day I run my Mac, I still don't see any viruses,
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.880]   and I still don't see any ad wear, so I don't know.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.280]   Chris, do you think this is a real part of it?
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.720]   Is it something that we're--
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.640]   should we really start worrying about it?
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.920]   No, I don't think so.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.040]   It's like a lot of these things.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.360]   It's sort of a proof of concept.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.800]   Somebody dinks around inside the OS in one way or another.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.400]   And this has to do with a possible problem with Apple
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.640]   Disc Image controller, where something can--
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.520]   if a disc image is automatically opened up,
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.640]   this could be a potential security risk.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.600]   But this happened like last year where people were saying,
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.000]   you know, you should not allow Safari to automatically
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.440]   open disc images.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.800]   You should know what you're getting.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.480]   And so it wasn't long ago that we all turned that option off.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.160]   And by default, Safari 2 would open these things
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.120]   after downloading them.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.880]   But all you have to do is turn that option off.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.760]   So should you get one of these things,
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.720]   it's not going to burst open and then be an exploit.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.480]   An Apple script can do this as well.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.720]   So there are ways for funky code to get in there
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.280]   and make your Mac do things.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.440]   But there's nothing out there in the wild.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.080]   Generally, you have to acquire these things
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.680]   by downloading the wrong thing from the wrong place
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.960]   and doing something to make it happen.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.360]   Unlike Windows, where all you have to do
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.320]   is connect your PC to the internet and wait a while
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:16.760]   and then--
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.560]   I mean, it's-- so I'm really glad that people are doing
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.240]   this sort of thing.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.800]   And they're out there looking for these kind of vulnerabilities
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.480]   and that people then patch them.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.960]   So it's-- it's-- proof of concept is perfectly OK with me.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.880]   I'd much rather have that happen that something come through
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.040]   and then we're all hosed.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.240]   So no, it's not something to worry about.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.880]   And just be glad that people are doing this kind of investigation.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.560]   Someday, maybe someone will find one.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.720]   They can-- they can keep out the hope.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.040]   PC can--
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.560]   I know that semantic is rooting for that to happen.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.880]   Now--
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.480]   Just getting semantic.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.840]   We just kid you semantic.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.480]   We didn't mean that.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:54.960]   Now, speaking--
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.040]   Are they still making antivirus for the Mac?
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.280]   No, but they weren't--
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.320]   Are they making anything for the Mac anymore?
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.160]   It's not universal.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.080]   A guy named Ernie in the back room who's just hoping.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.200]   His job-- his job is dependent on it.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.560]   How can he-- how can he make this work?
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.560]   Now, speaking of bugs, the rumor is
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.440]   that the Beatles are close to an iTunes deal with Apple.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.720]   Oh, that was a nice segue.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.280]   I like that.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:18.840]   I get an--
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:18.840]   I get an--
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.040]   --speedles very nice.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.240]   You know, it took me a little while.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.040]   You guys were talking.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.920]   I was sitting there going, how am I going to get from fricking--
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.840]   how am I going to get from viruses?
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.880]   I was like, I was going to put this earlier with the iPod stuff.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.960]   How am I going to get over to the Beatles iTunes deal?
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.600]   That was it.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.280]   So anyway, thanks for calling me.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.200]   Good job.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.120]   Thanks.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.240]   So very good news.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:43.200]   It's about time is all I can say, because as a person who thinks
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.160]   all the stuff on the VH1, oldie show is still too new,
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.480]   I'm happy for the Beatles.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.360]   Well, I think the Beatles are actually running out of time.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.240]   I think they have to do this.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.480]   Did you see the thing about the copyrights in the UK?
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.920]   Yes, there's a time limit just like there is here.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.080]   But they're not going to extend it past 50 years, which
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:08.640]   means that the first Beatles tunes become public domain in 2013.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.120]   Wow.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.240]   And then over the next six to eight years, whatever,
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.680]   isn't it, six to eight years?
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:19.600]   Basically, all the Beatles stuff becomes public domain.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.280]   It's just very odd.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.360]   No, that includes performance as well.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.200]   Anything that-- the original tunes.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.120]   I believe it's the publishing rights, Chris.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.600]   So but their performance rights remain forever, right?
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:40.240]   I believe that the performance rights are in effect forever,
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.760]   although maybe not technically forever.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.600]   But the public--
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:48.200]   Yes, I'm suggesting that when 2013 rolls around, suddenly,
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.520]   you can't get download every Beatles tune performed by the Beatles
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.080]   for free.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.040]   But instead, you can play their stuff in public,
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.760]   and nobody's going to ask you for money.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.360]   And they're not going to arrest you when you're
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.040]   playing your harmonica in Japan.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.280]   And we're actually hoping, Chris, given your most people
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.080]   who listen to Mac Break weekly probably don't know this about Chris,
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.320]   but he is a world famous musician.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:14.120]   So 2013 at Mac World, my goal is to be sitting in the audience
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.560]   when you let it rip with, "I want to hold your hand."
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.360]   Yeah, I'm actually the 17th Beatles.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.040]   And it's time for me to claim that crown.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.720]   I just can't wait.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.680]   Now--
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.520]   Go ahead.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.480]   I'm happy to see the Beatles catalog potentially coming to iTunes.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.200]   I hope it does.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.680]   Now, the rumor is that it's only for a limited time.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.200]   So Apple could be on the verge of becoming an exclusive online source
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.920]   for the Beatles downloads for a limited time,
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.640]   so it won't be there forever.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.840]   Yeah, which is mostly about bragging rights, I think.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:49.120]   And particularly, if you can put it in a commercial, which would be--
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.760]   I mean, imagine you're some other MP3 player manufacturer,
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.680]   and you're sort of putting, I don't know, what, counting
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.560]   crows or something in your commercial, and suddenly you've got
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.480]   the revolution by the Beatles in the iPod commercial.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.920]   I mean, it's going to make you look puny if you're anybody but Apple.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.200]   Because if you're of a certain age, and I am of a certain age,
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.720]   you've already got all the Beatles stuff.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.760]   I mean, I've got it on vinyl.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.640]   I've got it on tape.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.520]   I've got 45s.
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.400]   I've got EPs.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.400]   I've got it on CD.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.360]   And my rips are going to sound better than anything
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.800]   that Apple's going to provide to me.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.400]   So unless Apple has in talks with George Martin about getting
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.200]   some material that has never been released before,
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.440]   and I think that would be tough to do, it's mostly so they can say,
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.800]   hey, we got the Beatles, and nobody else does.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.720]   There we go.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.000]   While we're speaking of the Beatles,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.640]   I know this isn't necessarily directly on topic,
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.440]   but I have to mention an incredible book I recently bought
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.240]   called Recording the Beatles.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.200]   It's over 100 bucks, but if anybody's interested in actually
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.680]   seeing what the gear looked like that they used to record the Beatles,
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.880]   this thing comes with charts, diagrams, pictures
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.240]   that nobody's ever seen, incredible notes from the people
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.920]   that recorded the Beatles album.
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.640]   So I happen to be a Beatles fan.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.480]   I think it's cool.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.560]   So sorry, but I had to throw that in there.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:11.960]   You know, the one thing that I do wander around some of the more
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.440]   odd places to find music on the web is for acoustic stuff.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:21.200]   And I remember I found one of, basically, it sounded like a raw
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   recording of yesterday.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.720]   Have you guys heard that?
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.320]   Is that on me?
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.520]   Box sets.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.800]   It's like you hear Paul McCartney going, you know,
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.920]   saying it's going to be in this key and in this key.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.360]   And this is what I'm going to do.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.040]   And then he goes and starts to play it.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.720]   And it sounded like a pretty much just a raw recording of yesterday,
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.040]   which I thought was very interesting.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.280]   That would be nice to have.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.040]   I'll see if I can find it for you.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:41.800]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.760]   It was very odd.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.440]   I was like, I wonder if this came from some kind of box set,
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.880]   but it sounded totally, you know, totally odd.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.560]   So it's amazing how much of that stuff is still floating around.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.560]   And not just for the Beatles, for a lot of bands.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.320]   I mean, there's so much music out there that never made--
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.880]   you know, never got released, never got, you know, never got
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.720]   popular and so on and so forth.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.960]   That's the thing that I think is amazing is there's a market
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.080]   somewhere there for all of this stuff that is still just never
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.800]   made it to the front page, so to speak.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.920]   By big bands and little bands, the question is how do you get
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.440]   back to it?
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.360]   How do you get people-- now that we don't have to wait until
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.600]   radio plays it or not plays it?
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.400]   And how do we get to a point where we actually know it's there?
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.440]   And the thing is, is that I think that what's missing is,
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.360]   is that people could be doing music podcasts, but the way
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.320]   the copyrights are all set up are a mess.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.600]   There's no way to find it.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.360]   You know, I think that's-- anyway, I don't know why I got
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.200]   into that.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.000]   It just came out.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.320]   It's true.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.840]   Because it's true, that's why you got it.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.840]   No, I think that there is a lot of that stuff out there.
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.000]   And if you-- I don't think I'm revealing any great secret,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.760]   I say, if you go to the Beatles news groups, there is a ton
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.520]   of stuff on those things that has never been released, even
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.360]   when they did those three big sets of Beatles music that was
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.560]   from the vaults and alternate takes.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.480]   I mean, that's just a minor amount of that stuff.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.800]   If you go to the news groups, you can find 75 takes of
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.720]   strawberry fields and painstakingly how they recorded
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.120]   this thing over months and months.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.600]   And I think the people that-- the real freaks about this
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.240]   kind of stuff that are that devoted are the kind of people
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.360]   that would go to news groups, that they have that sort of
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.120]   passion that any technology they can acquire that will allow
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.400]   them to get that stuff, they'll use it.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.720]   Because I certainly don't see EMI or capital releasing, you
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:41.480]   know, hey, look, it's a 17 CD set of strawberry fields.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.480]   Because who would buy the thing?
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.800]   But I would certainly download it if I had that sort of
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.800]   bent.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.880]   Scott, would you get 75 versions of strawberry fields?
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.160]   No, I'm a pretty ardent Beatles fan, but, you know, I've
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.000]   got three or four and I'm pretty happy with them.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.400]   I'm always interested, however, in raw concert stuff that
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.320]   because, you know, they do things a little bit differently
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.240]   at the concerts.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:07.000]   And to date myself, my very first concert I ever attended
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.120]   was a Beatles concert.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.760]   And in Indianapolis, Indiana, where I grew up, in the
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.840]   concert version is sometimes different enough.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.120]   It's nice to own that.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:20.200]   And, you know, I really do appreciate all the acoustic sets.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.960]   There was recently a very nice thing on PBS where Paul
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.960]   McCartney did a bunch of acoustic stuff.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.080]   It was good.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.640]   But what I think significant about this information is that
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.240]   it's not being released on the Zoom.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.960]   So on the--
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.320]   Not to rub salt in the wound, right?
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.680]   Now, on the rumor mill, just at the very--
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.400]   near the end of the show here and on the rumor mill, we've
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:44.920]   got Apple.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.160]   Is there a new keyboard with an iPod dock coming?
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.760]   Have you heard that?
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.520]   This is according to Think Secret.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.360]   Has anyone heard any of this stuff coming through?
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.640]   Given the fact that it comes from Think Secret, it immediately
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.200]   gets downgraded to me.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:26:59.520]   All right.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.240]   Well, there you go.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.880]   So that's one of the ones that's floating around.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.280]   So we'll see.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.760]   Also on--
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.960]   These are the people Apple who told us aperture was gone.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.360]   Right.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.080]   So Scott will never forgive them.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:09.920]   Nope, they're off.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.360]   We completely took them out of our RSS feed.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.840]   We don't even see what they say.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.040]   I mentioned it one time offline, and Scott was just--
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.160]   they're dead to me.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.240]   So I think Scott's going to be sending them a dead horse
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.320]   head soon.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.600]   No, nothing that drastic.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.920]   But however, they've lost my confidence.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.520]   Maybe Mr. Breen has a different take.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.440]   I don't-- yeah, I don't get it.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.760]   No, I don't see there being a keyboard for the iPod.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:46.120]   That is just so counter to the Steve Jobs world.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.400]   I mean, unless the two Steve's from the parallel universe
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.400]   have swapped places, and we can tell if he's got a little goatee.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.280]   No, no, this isn't-- this is actually a built-in.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.200]   I don't believe it's actually to type on the iPod.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.840]   I think it's a keyboard that lets you dock your iPod
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.760]   into the keyboard.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.640]   Yeah, yeah, right.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.160]   OK.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:02.640]   OK.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.000]   So I don't think it's actually-- you're actually typing onto it.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.560]   You charge it still integrated.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.040]   Oh.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.720]   So it's not an extra--
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.240]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.520]   So you don't have the extra wiring and all the other stuff.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.960]   I think that's kind of the flow of this thing.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.520]   Well, Matias does something sort of like that,
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.360]   except it's for the shuffler, for the first generation
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.080]   shuffle, where they have a USB 2 port built into the keyboard.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.600]   And it really does make you convenient for syncing your iPod.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.560]   You just jam the thing in the keyboard and you're ready to go.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.640]   But that said, there is no longer an iPod that
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.960]   has a built-in USB connector.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.720]   So you stick your cable in there and stand and do it that way.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.600]   I know.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.240]   Speaking of cables and iPod, do you
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.400]   know what I tried to do the other day, Chris?
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.160]   No.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:49.640]   I tried to connect my iPod with video to my MacBook Pro
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:54.760]   with my Firewire iPod cable.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.080]   Right.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.640]   So you're able to charge it.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.680]   And it gave me this message that said, I'm sorry.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.000]   This isn't supported, but it did charge it.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.920]   So it's not totally useless.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.240]   It takes time.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:04.740]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.760]   Now, Firewire cable is perfectly good for charging.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.280]   So if you have an older iPod power adapter
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.240]   and that Firewire cable, it's a great way to go.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.640]   Now, the other rumor, of course, is once again that Apple is
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.120]   possibly moving a tablet around or shopping
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.160]   a tablet around again, some kind of tablet computer.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.160]   Now, have the PC tablets done that well?
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:26.640]   Have you guys--
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.320]   I don't think so.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.080]   It seems like something that I'd love to have.
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.480]   But I think it'd be very cool.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.200]   But I don't think they've sold that well, Chris.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.000]   Do you know?
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.160]   No, I see them at restaurants as serving trays,
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.880]   but--
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.040]   Because they have to get rid of them somehow.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.720]   But no, they just haven't done anything.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.800]   Although, I've been thinking a lot about these tablets recently.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.360]   I was in the hospital for a while.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:57.720]   And I was really wishing that they had had some kind of tablet
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.200]   PC there.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.080]   They had a computer in every room,
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:05.520]   and they were using it to scan me and medications
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.240]   that I was taking.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.800]   And it takes a long time.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.840]   And if you're in need of some pain medication,
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.600]   you don't want it to take a long time.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.800]   You want it right now.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.720]   And I just thought, it's too bad that the Newton disappeared.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.800]   Because that's where the Newton was starting to be used,
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.080]   is in hospitals.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.680]   And I just thought, God, if there was a Mac tablet,
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.360]   this would be so easy.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.560]   I would have a little something on my wristband
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.680]   that alerted the tablet that I was there.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.080]   It would have my records right there.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.240]   It would know what medications I could have.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.920]   And it would just scan immediately.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.920]   And I would get what I wanted right away.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.960]   And they would make sure that I didn't get what I didn't need
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.400]   right away.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.840]   Because you're getting the wrong medications.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.760]   It's a bad thing.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.240]   So I would be OK with another Apple portable device.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:56.320]   I don't see it happening given that the jobs has killed
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.120]   the Newtonists whose first day at work
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.640]   and has always sort of brushed it off as being
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.000]   a non-priority at Apple.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.960]   That market seems to be generally a PC Windows kind of market
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.280]   anyway.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:14.920]   I mean, the tablets seem to have taken hold on verticals,
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.240]   certain industries use them.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.880]   And it's never been a mass market product, in my opinion.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.400]   So I don't see Apple thinking it's
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.560]   got a foothold and a bunch of different verticals
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.600]   that could use that in.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.160]   I just think it's another one of those things.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.000]   It could happen.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.200]   But I'd rather see them bring back the Newton.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.240]   I know I just--
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.400]   I would love to have one because I have to do a lot of markups.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.560]   So for me, I get a lot of data that I have to circle this
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.040]   and change this and make this go here and so on and so forth.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.640]   And so I end up carrying--
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.200]   to do a lot of that, I actually end up
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.520]   carrying a whack-em tablet around.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.560]   Little one of the little graphires, the cheap little ones
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.800]   that I could just throw in my bag.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.000]   And it's this wee little thing.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.040]   And I use it all the time.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.440]   That's how I do my all my feedback.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.560]   And a lot of times I use--
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.440]   I used to use snaps.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.360]   And now I'm using-- I show you.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.080]   And so it just turns the video on record
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.080]   and I use a program by panic called Destastic.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:13.720]   And I just use that to highlight the areas that I--
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.200]   could draw on anything on any document.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.240]   I can just draw over top of it like a--
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.720]   and so I sit there and I can--
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.880]   whether it's words or video or images,
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.360]   I can sit there and kind of correct them
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.720]   and so on and so forth and send them back.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.960]   And for me, I'd love to be able to just do that on my laptop.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.280]   So that-- I mean, it's all wishful thinking.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.320]   So we'll see how that goes.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.120]   So now I guess we're at that part of the show where
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.240]   we have to talk about some of our favorites.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.280]   What are your favorites today, Scott?
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:46.840]   Well, I'm going to talk about a beta product.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.920]   I rarely do this, but I'm so impressed with the concept
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.560]   of this product.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.920]   I'm going to mention it.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.360]   It's new.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.120]   It's called Gumba.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.120]   Gumba.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.400]   G-O-O-M-E-A-H.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.440]   And what it does is it works with your iTunes collection.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:06.440]   And it looks at your library and then compares it
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.560]   with all the other Gumba members libraries
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.400]   and tries to guess at songs you might like
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.960]   that you don't know about.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.680]   And it does two cool things.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.000]   It creates basically playlists for you
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.840]   that you can explore through the iTunes
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.480]   store, whatever, to figure out if you
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.280]   want to listen to that music and buy it.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.600]   But it also gives you free legal MP3s
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.040]   from emerging and established artists that
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.800]   are right down your pipeline, they think.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.240]   Now, it's in beta, and there aren't that many users.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.160]   So my first test of it was OK.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.200]   I wasn't like they hit the home run
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.560]   and figured out my musical taste right away.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.160]   But they got close, and I'm assuming,
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.960]   as more and more people use it, it will become more valuable.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.040]   So that's why I wanted it to be my tip today,
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.720]   because hoping lots of people download it
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.240]   so there'll be lots more musical things to look at.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.160]   So my recommendations will get better.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.240]   That sounds really interesting.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.520]   There's another program called pandora.com.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.920]   It's actually a website that doesn't look at your iTunes.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.600]   You just actually can play music and say,
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.520]   I like this, I don't like it, I like it, I don't like it,
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.480]   I like it, I don't like it.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.640]   And it just keeps on giving you more music that's just
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.680]   from you actually listening to the music and saying,
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.600]   this isn't my type, this is my type.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.440]   And when you just say yes, no, yes, no, yes, no,
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.760]   it keeps on trying to calculate what kind of music
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.320]   you'd like next.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.720]   And so it sounds kind of similar,
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:27.760]   'cause I think that Goomba sounds better
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.280]   because it's inside of your already,
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.000]   no, do you think it's more accurate
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.480]   when you use a larger library?
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.640]   - Yeah, I think that it's like all these deals,
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.520]   the more people that are contributing to it,
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.800]   and they, assuming that their algorithms are good,
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.040]   they start to compare who likes what,
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.800]   they see trends and it helps them make recommendations.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.120]   - I think it will only end up taking off
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.480]   if a lot of people do it myself.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.400]   - Right, excellent, Chris, do you have a favorite for today?
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.800]   - I do have a favorite for today
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:02.800]   and it's going to be controversial, favorite.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.920]   I'm gonna talk about Rhapsody.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.280]   - Really?
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.760]   - Does it work on a Mac?
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.040]   - Yeah, it works on a Mac.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.720]   It doesn't work as, it works differently on a Mac
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.720]   than it does on a PC.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.360]   You actually get a Rhapsody client
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.800]   and you can download music from the Rhapsody service
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.560]   to the PC and it will stay there
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.720]   as long as, you know, it'd be accessible
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.440]   as long as you are paying up every month.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.320]   But it works on the Mac through a web browser
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.600]   so I can access the Rhapsody music library
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.680]   through my web browser.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.560]   And if I feel like listening to four hours of Miles Davis,
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.560]   I dial that up, a creative playlist, and it just plays.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.760]   It's not that subscription services have been dinged
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.640]   by a lot of iTunes enthusiasts,
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.320]   and rightly so because they're not perfect for everyone.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.640]   But if you're someone who's deskbound, and I am,
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.600]   I sit at my desk all darn day,
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.160]   it is a wonderful resource to be able to pick out
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.520]   of their library, you know, millions of tracks
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.000]   and they have a very extensive library, anything I want.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.320]   And they have good recommendation services,
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.680]   the quality is good, it streams across pretty easily.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.160]   And I can go back and explore albums that I thought
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.720]   of buying at iTunes and thinking,
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.840]   "Gosh, I used to love that 20 years ago
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.240]   and then I listened to it now and I go, "Oh, that's crap."
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.800]   Oh, I had bad taste back then.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.800]   Or I can listen to stuff that they recommended,
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.000]   say, "I'd really like to own that,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.640]   but I'm not gonna pay Rhapsody for it.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.120]   I'm gonna go and buy it at iTunes
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.440]   so that I can then put it on my iPod."
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.680]   - Now, can you integrate the music on,
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.360]   that you're listening to on Rhapsody
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.280]   onto another MP3 player?
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.640]   - Yeah, you can, but you have to do it through a PC.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.160]   So if you have like a Sandisk Sansa,
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.560]   you can then subscribe to it.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.120]   Actually, they have a Sansa model
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.680]   that I'm gonna be getting in a couple of days
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.920]   that's a Rhapsody-specific model
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.080]   that supports some special playlist stuff
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.920]   that Rhapsody does.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.720]   And again, once you're a subscriber,
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.840]   you can then download that stuff to your Sansa player
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.800]   and carry it around with you.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.480]   - I know I've been really rethinking
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.680]   the whole subscription model thing for a while,
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.120]   you know, of whether I...
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.880]   Now, how much does the Rhapsody cost?
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.200]   - Gosh, I think it's like 15 bucks a month.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.200]   - Yeah, 'cause it's one of those things that,
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.640]   to me, I always think that a hybrid
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.440]   would be really interesting where you're,
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.280]   you know what I'm talking about.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.800]   Hey, everybody, this is Alex Lindsey,
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.520]   and that is where our show went sideways.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.920]   We're not sure exactly what happened there.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.280]   We've never had that happen before,
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.120]   but we had to cut it off before we made you all deaf.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.960]   So anyway, slightly shortened, you missed about 10 minutes
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.640]   of us dribbling on about Rhapsody
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.680]   and a couple other things.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.600]   And so you didn't miss much, it was,
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.560]   the show was almost over.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:50.320]   So sorry about that little breakup at the very end,
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.400]   but hope you enjoyed it.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.520]   And come back next week,
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.880]   and we'll have one that doesn't break up
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.280]   at the end of the show.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.080]   Also, we're doing a real behind the scenes
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.480]   on Mac Break, the regular video,
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.800]   so you definitely wanna check that out.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.520]   It's 20 minutes of us kind of showing you how Mac Break,
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.640]   it's done with all the green screen and everything else.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.800]   It's a new one with new things.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.560]   So definitely check that out.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.160]   Anyway, we'll see you next week.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:23.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:28.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:36.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
