[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.080]   and Google getting together to help track down coronavirus. Is it a privacy threat or
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.520]   a good idea? Both Renee and I will talk about the new Mac book air. I think we both like

[00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:01.040]   from the Twit LastPass studios where we are locked in and sanitized at all times. Fortunately
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.920]   our hosts have never left the house anyway so it's just they're right at home Renee Richie
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.720]   from Renee Richie's YouTube channel. I need a name for it. You have a name for it?
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.600]   Allow myself to introduce me. Allow myself to introduce me.com. I wasn't smart enough
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.920]   to get a show name Leo but I had this old Renee Richie YouTube channel and had all the features
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.920]   of Grandfather, Grandparent it in. I rolled with it. I took convenience over branding.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.600]   Perfect. And what does your hat say? Is that a Renee Richie branded hat? No, it's a
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:42.160]   new hat. I want the world to know that we're just a friendly people and that we're here
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.660]   in your hour of maple syrup. Renee Renee was on Twit this week fabulous with Georgia
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.640]   Dow and O doctor. We saw it. We saw it. Given we had Georgia and Owen that we needed somebody
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.880]   with some gravitas on the show so you did a great job holding down that end. It went
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.080]   so fast. It was really, it was like three hours later. It was a really long show and
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.680]   I, you know, it got really long because it felt like we had just gotten started even
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.080]   two hours in. It was really fun. How we might have declared war on Canada for about five
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.560]   minutes there like about five minutes. I think we were actually a war but we never quite
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.560]   know with Owen, you know, he's he gets on his soapbox and rants but that's what we love
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.120]   about him. So much fun. Andy and I co also here. It's great to see you Andrew. Great to
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.160]   see everybody. Exactly. I'm if if I have to say I'm doing fine but if the takeout place
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.200]   that has subs and burgers and pizza right next door decided to fold up tent. I would
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.400]   be I would be on hot dogs and rice very, very quickly and we'd be very, very sad. And he
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.120]   is standing with his flintlock at the border to keep the New Yorkers out and you keep up
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.080]   that good work right there. And it's not even postseason the major league baseball season.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.560]   Who knew it was good practice and we have a big, big anniversary to celebrate. No, I
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.760]   know you're thinking you see up here. It says the 15th anniversary of Twit. We are pikers.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:14.240]   We are children compared to this guy right here. Adam angst of tidbits. Hello, Adam and
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.560]   congratulations. Thank you so much. It's nice to be here. Was it is it exactly? It was
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.200]   it 30 years yesterday? It actually will be exactly on Thursday, April 16th, 1990 is the
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.480]   date of the first tidbits issue. And it's a little you can read all about novel and word
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.040]   perfect and screen savers. There's some stuff in screen savers in that first issue. It's
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.000]   kind of fun. A little embarrassing when you go back and look at what you did when you
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.520]   were 23. So you were just a kid at a school or what was the story behind it? Yeah, yeah,
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.800]   pretty much. Tanja and I had graduated from Cornell in 1989 and she was working at Cornell
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.840]   in 1990. And I was doing consulting in Ethica and she she was working in the group this
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.800]   sold computers and it's called micro computers and office systems at the time or Moss as in
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   a rolling stone gathers now. And her coworkers were not actually that up on a lot of the
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.400]   computer stuff because micro computers and office systems also sold things like copiers
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.320]   and fax machines. And that's where most of the other people had come from. So she decided
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.040]   she was going to do this little newsletter to keep her colleagues up on what was going
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.880]   on. And I say, Oh, that's a great idea. She wanted to do it in page maker. She's actually
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.520]   doing print. She had, you know, page background page layout background. I wanted to keep her
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.960]   skills up. And I said, Well, you know, if you're going to do it in page maker, I'll be happy
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.080]   to help you. I think it's a lot of fun. And I'm going to do it in hypercard because I
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.040]   was really in hypercard. Perfect. Perfect. The print version lasted two weeks, as I remember.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:00.200]   And the hypercard version lasted 99 and tidbits is now up to issue 1500 and nine. Wow, I'm
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:08.840]   looking at it's one from 16 April 1990. I love this. In a blow to industry leader Microsoft,
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.720]   Otis and novel merged last week to form a corporation worth about one and a half billion
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   dollars. How's my, I didn't know there was that much money in the tech industry.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:27.400]   The three hours of 1.5 billion. No, you mean, how's Microsoft doing? Is there, do they
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:34.640]   survive the merger? Well, one and a half. This is, I mean, it is fun. I, when I go back
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.920]   and look at, you know, old screensavers and stuff like that, it's just, Oh, in the second
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.920]   monitor for the SE, that was, I mean, I would be needing a second to monitor. I have been
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:52.080]   a two monitor guy from day one and I can prove it. Hypercard meet D base. Ooh, stand back.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:58.680]   Because yeah, you knew that was going to be big. Wow. Things have been changed. Now,
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.680]   this is it by the way. This is the whole, it was one page. Oh, no, no, no, there's a
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.560]   lot of articles. Oh, there's more. Okay. There's more. I'm just, I'm just a TLD or reading
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:14.800]   the summary. Oh good. All right. Mackerel, X more. All the founders were still at Microsoft.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:22.720]   Yeah. Yeah. This is, well, congratulations. 30 years in any business is a forever. But
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:29.200]   in the tech news industry, I mean, that's amazing. You know, well, it's been, it's been
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.560]   fun. And you know, periodically I go back, I actually get into these little, you know,
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.640]   like news will be slow for a little while. I'm like, Oh, I need some of the rights, I'll
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.840]   like dive into the archives and pull some article out from 15 years ago or 20 years
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.960]   ago and write about it. And it's, it's a huge amount of fun. And I think I should do this
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.360]   more often because it's so neat to look back. And then stuff gets busy again. And I don't
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.400]   do it for six months or a year because I got, you know, I mean, it's Apple. Apple doesn't
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.080]   slow down these days very often.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:02.920]   It's funny because when we go back to the first, you know, tweet, you know, go back 15 years,
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.920]   it's still a recognizable industry. But when you go back 30 years, for instance, here's
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:14.860]   the hot flash for anyone working on a two CI with after dark, the screen server from
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:22.080]   Berkeley systems, you should upgrade to version 1.1 C because it fixes a bug that causes
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:29.640]   crashes while DAs are open and the kicks greeted, the screen saver kicks in desktop accessories
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.720]   for those not in the know. But we still haven't gotten back to after dark level screensavers.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:43.120]   I'm sorry. No, I agree. There's a new randomizer in it, which allows a screensaver to switch
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:49.800]   modules. There's spheres, which draws 3D spheres on your screen. I always did like
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:55.120]   Dray now. I remember that one swirls your back down the drain of the screen. Tack tiles
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.920]   fills the screen with a tile pattern. Also shredded crystals and starry skyline. Of course,
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.960]   after dark was the Berkeley systems was the company that gave you the flying toasters.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:11.440]   Yeah. That's and that was back when you know, Bruce Burke, Halter was actually, you know,
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:17.160]   one of the guys working on it and would just post and be the fact that he had posted on
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.000]   something. I don't know. Infomac digest, you know, use.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.800]   His address is still Berkeley that EDU. So you probably still get in touch with him.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.040]   Yeah. Every now and then you do that. You look at something like, whoa, that's still
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:38.480]   live. Wow. Outbound the outbound portable Macintosh. Remember that? Oh, yeah. Oh, also
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:44.800]   knows the wallaby. It was it was a hackintosh because they took the Apple hardware and reconfigured
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:51.520]   it as I remember. There wasn't. Yeah. You had to pull the ROMs from your from your your
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:57.840]   Mac plus put them inside the wallaby. And then if you wanted to use the Mac plus again, you
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.600]   could tether the Mac plus back to the wallaby to get access to those ROMs.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:08.400]   I love this. And by the way, your correspondent there is one Alex Pournell, who is of course
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:15.280]   still around Jerry Pournell's son, refilling desk writer cartridges. Well, the ink is so
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:21.160]   expensive. You know, some things just you can never that that we're still doing. You
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:26.120]   can replace it with quality fountain pen ink. Yeah, I don't know if the phone and it still
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.480]   works. Where would you get that fountain pen ink these days? At the inquiry, Leo.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.120]   Oh, yeah. It's the three cars. Don't the don't the most skin people sell it? Yeah, maybe.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:42.000]   Oh, my. Hey, Adam, it's so great. Are you going to do anything to celebrate? You know,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:50.160]   we did an article in said bits, but it was short and you know, it's tough because as
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.680]   I was kind of saying, the article is things are just so weird right now. You can't exactly
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:01.880]   have a party. No, and you know, like it just you don't even feel like having a party. And
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:07.640]   so kind of what I what I where I went with the article was just that. Yeah, I got this
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.920]   term, the uncertainty horizon, you know, like we have no idea, you know, what the uncertainty
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.320]   horizon is at this point, you know, like you next week will probably be like this week,
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:20.760]   but after that, hmm, hard to say. And so, you know, in that kind of a sudden, you know,
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.120]   I think that the best thing I could say and when I say in the article is that what I can
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.720]   tell promise you with to this is you'll have it on Monday and next Monday and the Monday
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.640]   after that, how is it that you guys have done that? I mean, that's the thing that's most
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:40.720]   amazing in a day in age of people's, you know, 7,000 podcasts start every week of which fewer
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:49.720]   than 500 survived in the second week. Yeah, 30 years and and if you ever missed, have
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:57.040]   you ever missed an issue? So we take four four issues off a year, Memorial Day Thanksgiving
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.480]   and then two weeks at the end of the end of the year for Christmas and New Year's. So
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:11.040]   that's that's scheduled. And when we moved from Ithaca to Seattle in 1991, Mark and
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.560]   Binder's friend of ours actually kind of put out tidbits for us for a couple of weeks,
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.720]   simply because we couldn't get internet access. I mean, you didn't just get internet access
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:29.000]   in 1991. You had to find it. So that was kind of interesting. And there have been probably
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.040]   there have been a couple of others over the years where we've had to just call it for,
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.160]   you know, like we're not going to do an issue this week because of travel or something like
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.600]   that. But we've often, you know, it's been quite a few years now that we've had people
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.000]   helping us with tidbits, you know, we don't know, it's not just me. And so, you know, even
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:54.840]   you know, like in 1998, Tonya and I went, spent a month in Australia. And, you know, Jeff
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:01.560]   Duncan, Jeff Carlson, Glenn Fleischman basically put the issues out during that time for us
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:09.840]   with no, no interaction from us at all. So yeah, we do a lot. But, you know, it's it's
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.040]   the joke has always been that people think I write everything and it's so completely
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:19.520]   and utterly not true. But I think people do get that impression sometimes.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.520]   Yeah, you're definitely you definitely the Stan Lee of tidbits though. Everyone assumes
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.800]   that you draw it, you draw it, you write it, you edit it. Yeah.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:34.480]   Well, to be to be fair, yes. So even when I don't write stuff, I as long as I'm not,
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:41.480]   you know, traveling in Australia and it's 1998, I do read and edit basically everything.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.400]   And those who read tidbits know we have a pretty consistent voice because of that. So,
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.920]   you know, it's not, you know, I will I will let it pretty heavily. You know, so there
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.000]   are things in articles which I have written complete paragraphs of because needed to be
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.400]   there and, you know, happy to let the author recast what I wrote, but you know, there needs
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.960]   to be something about this. So it does change a little bit that way. But again, you know,
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.760]   you know, we we've got to go on vacation last year and so for a couple of weeks when we
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.760]   were in Switzerland, Josh centers put out the entire thing on his own with help from the
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.280]   usual contributors. So it was great. And how long did you stay in Seattle? That was
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:24.440]   it wasn't a long lasting trip. We were still from 91 to 2000. Oh, long time. But you went
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:29.440]   back home after a while. Yeah. And it's interesting. That was, you know, obviously during the
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:37.360]   dot com run up and bust, really. But Glenn Fleishman posted something on YouTube a while
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:45.920]   back. He found there was an NBC Nightly News report about the streaming of the first Hollywood
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:52.640]   movie on the internet. And it was a movie called Party Girl with Parker Posey. And it
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:58.800]   was streamed from Glenn's offices. He had a he had a company and I and he invited me
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:04.080]   and I was so I was there and Tonya was there and our friend Quinn, who is a long time still
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:10.280]   there. Apple DTS person was was visiting at the time. And so he came with us. And so we're
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:16.320]   all in this video that Glenn has found and posted on YouTube from what is must be like
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:25.560]   1998. I forget exactly what the date is. But we're all looking really. And the Parker
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:31.200]   Posey has an aged a bit and that's it's kind of it's kind of funny because I wonder if
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:36.400]   she knows she was the first hers was the first movie ever streamed. She does. She was interviewed
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:43.080]   on it as well. And this is, you know, posted stamp size video. And it's I think it was
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:48.160]   CUC me that they were using, which is the Cornell video conferencing software that kicked
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.920]   everything off. That's when you know you're getting old because when all of a sudden after
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:59.560]   so long, the that was the first time and very soon we're seeing the last movie on a CD or
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.600]   rather on a DVD or a Blu ray because they'll all be streamed. That's when you know you're
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.360]   you're well, I mean, we've already seen the news going on straight streaming. Yeah, that's
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:14.720]   right. That's right. No theater even. Yeah. I watched Invisible Man the other night, which
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:20.000]   was supposed to be on a screen right now, but it's not great movie. I'm never giving up
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.920]   my final movies Leo. You still have the movie record player. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. These are
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:32.120]   and those actually there were record. They were the old capacity. What were they called
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:37.960]   CED? CED. There's there's the optical there's the optical version, but then there was the
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:43.320]   CED capacity selected. I don't know what it stands for. CED by our CED. Select Division
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:48.040]   where the where the entire platter was like a huge cartridge. That was about the size
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:54.360]   of a prison lunch. It had grooves. Yep. No, it was it was an actual it was a needle that
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:59.480]   actually picked up an analog and analog signal then reconstituted his video, which was and
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:06.760]   the what here's it been a nostalgia. Like if you were if let's say that your family had one
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:13.640]   and you were like 12 or 13 year old boy who is just discovering that they like girls and
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:20.600]   there was one scene in a comedy where there was nudity. The drawback of the system was
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.160]   that when the family sat down to watch it like maybe a few weeks later, they would see that it
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:32.040]   seems to be skipping. I was watching that a lot over and over. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.760]   I'm a great deepest congratulations. I would send you a cupcake, but you know, we can't even do
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:42.120]   that these days. I think it's just really wonderful and we're going to be in exactly that same
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.800]   boat because Sunday will celebrate our 15th anniversary of Twi. Well, as a congratulations for that too,
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:53.000]   because let me tell you, you never expect these things. And then wow, I've been doing this for
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.800]   15 years and then 20 years rolls around and you're like, I can't believe I just thought I was 15.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.000]   Well, I wish I had started as young as you. That's my problem.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.160]   Another 15 years I'm going to be very old. So I don't know. I don't know if we're going to make
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.880]   30, but who knows? You never know. I mean, yeah, people have a floating chair. You'll be
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.440]   in my AI. Some guy was telling me he was looking forward to our 50th anniversary and I'm like,
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:22.680]   oh, really? That's kind of scary. Well, what about that? Do you and Tanya contemplate retirement at all?
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:32.600]   You know, it's hard to say exactly. I mean, at this point, I won't say it's not like self-sustaining
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:38.040]   or anything. I can't like it, do it itself on its own, but we're pretty good at it.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:44.440]   So it's not that hard and just kind of the way life is for me. It's part of your daily routine,
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:51.000]   I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah. And so, you know, I can't say that it's going to go on forever, but I have no
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.800]   particular plans to stop because I don't know what else I'd do. I mean, if I ever came up with
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.480]   something I wanted to do more, maybe I'd do that. I think it's a little late for that.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:08.920]   I don't want to say anything, but maybe you're stuck doing tidbits.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.720]   I want to play the violin too, but I don't think that's in the cards, you know.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:24.200]   Congratulations. That's wonderful. It's a really great. Let's take a little break and come back
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.360]   and there's actual news and so forth. You know, one of the things, there's one company a little
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:34.600]   older than tidbits, believe it or not. And it's our sponsor today. And I'm sure you
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.720]   managed at some point to talk a little bit about Matthias keyboards in your many years.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:46.600]   Edgar is a friend. Edgar's a great guy in Canada, but not, but I think he's is he in
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.360]   Toronto? I think they're around you. Everyone's in Toronto. Everyone's in Toronto. Yeah,
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:57.000]   we store most of our people there. Yeah. Edgar is a keyboard nut. They started Matthias keyboards
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:05.560]   in 1989. So only one year before tidbits, they're in their 31st year. They have always made keyboards
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.320]   and actually they were software companies. I remember when they first started, but when they
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:16.120]   started doing physical hardware, they've always made keyboards for Mac lovers and keyboards,
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:23.480]   you know, I should show you. I have a bunch of Matthias keyboards here, but this one, if you're a
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:29.880]   Mac fan, if you've been around almost as long as Adam angst, you'll recognize this as their
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:39.000]   tactile pro keyboard. And it will have a certain resonance for anybody who is a Mac fan. That is,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.160]   isn't that that? Apple stuff, Apple stop making these, but not Matthias. In fact,
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:50.040]   they've made them better. They're using Alps switches now. So they're the best tactile keyboard I've
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:55.880]   ever used. They really feel good. This is the tactile pro. It's got the little feet. You remember,
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:01.640]   still got the little feet, but it's now USB. I don't think this one was us. Maybe it was.
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:09.800]   I'm guessing this might have been ADB. So we wrote about that in 2004, the articles,
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:14.680]   the majestic Alps and the king of keyboards. The king of keyboards. Oh, so Apple was using an
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:21.960]   Alps switch to the out the the unfortunately, a lot of the tactile keyboards have gone to these
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:28.680]   cherry switches, but the Alps to me still are the best, I think. I remember having these great
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.000]   conversations with Edgar when this keyboard, he's working on this keyboard because initially,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.880]   he'd found a cache of them. He found a million that he could buy. They weren't being made.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:46.760]   Initially, he was working his way through that set. And then it was popular enough. He was able
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:52.040]   to get a factor to spin up and start making them again. Because they feel great.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:57.480]   Oh, they do. Believe me, when the ads are over, these are going home with me.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.560]   I'm not saying them back. If you want one, this little quieter,
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:10.040]   same great switches, but they've lost the clicky. But what I love about these is they have USB on
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:15.720]   both sides. So you connect the keyboard up and you've got room to connect the mouse on the other
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:22.360]   side. I just think in whichever side you prefer, and as a lefty, I really appreciate that. This one
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.560]   has three. So this connect the keyboard there. You connect your mouse on whichever side you
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:35.000]   prefer. And you still have a free slot for, I don't know, a USB key or any other device. It's a USB
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.120]   hub. They also make beautiful aluminum keyboards. If you want something that seems a little bit
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:46.280]   more modern, very much like the Apple keyboards, but these are like the Apple keyboards that Apple
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:51.880]   stopped making. This is the wired one. And this is the 10 key. So they make 10 keyless as well if
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:57.240]   you don't want the number pad. But they do such a nice job with the inverted T. It just feels good.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:04.920]   And this one's nice because it's got a backlit LEDs. And I love this little knob. I don't know,
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:10.520]   anybody else who does this, it lets you change the color of the LED, not software. It's got a knob.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:15.400]   So you dial in the color that you like best. They also have wireless. Now one of the things I really
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:22.520]   like about the wireless keyboards, these multi point pairing. So you can pair it to your Mac,
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:28.280]   but you can also pair it to a Windows machine or Linux machine and switch literally with a
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:33.720]   touch of a button. There are four buttons. Oh, look, it's rose gold. Now that no one's here,
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:40.360]   I can open all these. Finally, this is beautiful. They still make it rose gold one. Actually,
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:46.200]   that's what Micah took home. But embrace the pink. Just call it pink. Pink is a lovely color.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.240]   Beautiful pink. Christina Warren is on our way to steal it from you right now.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:54.040]   Yes. I think we were going to send her one just so she could have it. What's nice about this,
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:59.240]   they put a big battery in it. This is the battery. It's as big as a smartphone battery. So this
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:05.080]   keyboard, you charge it, it'll last all year between charges. But then I know, isn't that amazing?
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.800]   It was like, oh, I got to charge the keyboards January. It's January. Just, you know, when you
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:15.880]   change the batteries in the smoke burners filters and recharge the keyboard. And then it's got these
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.280]   four buttons here. This is the multi point pairing. So I press this button, suddenly it's a Mac
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:26.120]   keyboard with all the Mac functionality. Press this button. It's goes over to my Windows computer,
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:32.280]   and it's got the keys reconfigured to match Windows. So I think it's really nice because you get all
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:38.200]   of the functionality of the platform you're on. They work great with Windows, Mac, Linux, any kind
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:43.880]   of a computing system. Although I always hate getting keyboards and getting those Windows keys.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:51.080]   This is a true command key. You got your fan key. That's important. Matthias is the keyboard company.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:58.280]   Edgar is, in fact, when I met Edgar for the first time we talked, I feel bad for anybody else on
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:04.680]   the call because Edgar and I just went off on keys and keyboards. And it was keys, a real keyboard.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:09.800]   Did you get to talk about keyboard and matrixes? No. Oh, so here's the thing. This used to be,
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.560]   I don't know if it's an issue anymore. I don't think so. I think they may have dealt with it.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:23.640]   But it used to be that keyboards used one lead for like four keys. And the idea was you couldn't
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:30.040]   type those keys fast enough. So it always knew if there was a signal on that lead, it had to be
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:37.080]   far separated or something. They were separated. And I remember that for a while,
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:44.200]   there were issues, again, this is probably back 20 years ago, with if you did certain things
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:49.560]   too quickly, you could actually confuse the keyboard controllers because they weren't good
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:57.560]   enough with that. I think that's gone away. God, I only hope this one has 19 function keys.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.920]   It goes to F 19. Okay, I'm just saying, but this is the one I'm taking home because this is
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:09.080]   this is it. That's the classic, isn't it? Look, you're going to, if you like keyboards, if you
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:16.120]   type, you need to have a good keyboard. I know Apple doesn't agree, but I think so. And if you type,
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:22.520]   you're going to want to get a Matias go to Matias.ca, nice Canadian company, M A T I A S
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:31.800]   Matias.ca/Macbreak for 10% off. There's also an ergo keyboard with split, split key. Actually,
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.280]   this is the best ergo. You see it right there? It's the best ergo ever made because these
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:41.640]   gel cushions for your wrists are so soft and you split it so your hands not tilted an angle
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:46.520]   in your type, your wrists and everything is perfectly straight. It is the best ergonomic
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:53.320]   keyboard ever. You're going to love your Matias keyboard. The number one right now,
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:58.520]   a seller is the wired aluminum keyboard I have right here, but because it's a worthy successor
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.640]   to apples. But I got to tell you, you're no matter what you get, you're going to love it.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:08.040]   And if you don't, they have the best support in the world. Janet Carmel up there in Aurora
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.720]   will take care of you. And Matias is always happy to answer your questions.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:21.400]   Matias, I love this sponsor because I because I Edgar and I are one. Matias.ca/Macbreak
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:26.040]   to get the best keyboard you've ever had. Matias, the only hard part is choosing.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.560]   You know, you're going to go up to the site and you can say, well, wait a minute. I want that one.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.240]   Oh, but baby, so get a couple 10% off. Get a couple.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.120]   I feel like I'm at the airport and they're entering my reservation.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:43.480]   It's more like the guitar, you know, like the keyboard guitar thing that you're playing there.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.680]   The keytar? Yeah. The keytar. I'm playing a keytar.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.840]   Keytar Bear. I remember now. You are the slash of keytar.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.120]   You're just getting a keytar bear. There you go.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:28:00.360]   Matias.ca/Macbreak. Thank you, Edgar. Thank you, Matias. What a great team.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:07.000]   And, you know, a lot of people were working at home. So, you know, don't, you know, that keyboard
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.760]   was fine when you weren't hardly using it, but now that you're actually doing work on it,
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.200]   maybe it's time to do it. Maybe it's the rules. You have to have fancy coffee, bubbly water,
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.520]   and a clickety-clackety keyboard. Otherwise, you cannot be in this industry.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:20.040]   They won't know your work. Exactly. No, exactly. That's.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:26.440]   When you're on your imagine, when you're on your Zoom call, they'll know, man, I'm taking notes.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.080]   No, I'm writing it all down. You're not. You're playing.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.440]   That's why it's important to have two keyboards.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:38.920]   Every one of my desks, I have the really good, like a Cherry-Key Switch keyboard,
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:44.760]   but I also have a cheap one where you can't hear me typing. So, Justin, because you never know,
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.920]   maybe we're having an important call, but maybe I'm not. I'm just taking a note or I'm just looking
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:55.160]   for something to give you an answer. But, the thing is, ever since my grandma died,
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.600]   I mean, she was like a second clickly-clickly, Andy. Like, no, no, no, I was just
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:03.640]   I always ordering flop. I always said to you, I hate this feature of FaceTime,
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:09.000]   that if it's not the focus, it pauses the video because it's a dead giveaway that you're doing
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.240]   something else. So, I set up my Gypsy server. One of the things I really like about Gypsy,
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:21.720]   which is an open source, kind of like Zoom, is you can go, you can leave the screen. It looks like,
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:27.400]   it looks like you're paying attention. Don't tell anybody in my family, but I might be doing
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:32.360]   other things when they're talking to me. But they can't tell, they don't know.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:39.000]   All right, let's talk about this is not a COVID show, and one of the reasons we're still doing
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.080]   the shows and we're still getting together is because we know you need an escape. You need
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:48.040]   something fun in your life. But, Apple has, by the way, I'm not putting away these keyboards.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:55.560]   Seriously, right here. Not putting them away. This is my studio now. I'm the
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:00.280]   kid. I love to share these, but, you know, I've contaminated them now with my fingers. So,
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:05.400]   you can have them in two weeks. You know, I can't say. No, you just you lick everything.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:10.520]   You lick it. And then we have to punch it. Yes. I took my fingers. Like you're five years old
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:17.960]   again, but it works. Apple has done some interesting things. We're going to get to the Apple Google
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.640]   announcement in a second. But let's start with this one that just came out today.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:29.160]   Apple is making its mobility data available. Aggregated navigation data from Apple Maps,
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:36.120]   which will give regions like cities or counties information about its citizens and how they're
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:43.160]   moving around. It's anonymized. It's a downloadable CSV. So, presumably, you know, your data scientist
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:50.840]   in the county seat can can download this. What do you think, Renee? Good idea?
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:56.360]   There's just there's there's doing so much right now. Like I think in the last three days,
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:00.840]   we've had more more reports about the Apple Google partnership. We've had the Apple Maps stuff
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:06.120]   being added. And there was a third one, which is just to case memory now, but Apple has
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:12.120]   seen Apple is letting people with testing centers report to Apple Maps. And then once it's been
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:18.280]   verified, they'll put it on Apple Maps. So you can now go to Apple Maps and say, I need to get a test.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:23.000]   Now, if you look at the map, there's maybe a place in Des Moines.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.720]   There's one in place in LA. It's still the same thing for me. It's that I'm glad I'm so glad the
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.800]   tech companies are stepping up, but I'm so depressed that the tech companies have to step up. I wish
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.880]   it was I wish the governments were doing more so that the tech companies could add to it,
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:42.280]   but not seem to be the people who are filling a glaring void in our society.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.280]   Well, but actually I'm partnership, right? I mean, I think that this is a public private
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:51.400]   partnership is a good thing. Go ahead, Andy. I actually feel exactly the opposite. I would much
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:57.800]   rather Apple and Google be the company be the the entities that are responsible for these
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:03.560]   potentially really, really powerful tracking and identification tools, rather than the
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:09.400]   governments saying we have built an app that we now are going to order all men device manufacturers
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:14.760]   and OS manufacturers to install on their devices. Also, we're going to order them to include these
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:21.880]   APIs because I feel as though I can, as again, I don't I don't have a work right they be written
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:29.240]   in cobalt out of all. Yeah, what I'm thinking is no, it's it's more like I would be 400
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:33.800]   suspicious that yes, it will do the job was intended to do right now, but kind of like how
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:40.520]   TSA and ICE were initially created to deal with immediate problems that could have possibly been
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.800]   solved with these solutions. Two or three years from now, it will be we've decided that this is
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:53.640]   this is more this isn't a pandemic API. This is more of a national safety API. And so we are
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.920]   going to allow we're basically going to extend this the the breach so that we can we'll allow a
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:05.160]   local law enforcement and even just interested entities to do individual tracing without
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:11.160]   it would find the person. Well, yeah, exactly. So I'm I love the I like the fact that
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:18.760]   potentially Apple and Google could are going to implement this in a way that they think is safe
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:24.440]   for everybody. I also like the idea that they the things that they know how to do this.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:29.400]   Apple and Google together they they both between privacy and ubiquity of how to deal how to deal
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.160]   with mass data. They both have the same strengths and weaknesses and they complement each other
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:39.000]   very well. My fear when this was being discussed a couple of months ago was that someone who doesn't
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.080]   there well, the only way we can do this is to make sure that every phone always broadcasts
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:48.440]   location and a unique identifier to a central server in the government so that and then but
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:52.680]   Apple and Google say well, no, what we will talk about this later. But no, there's always
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:59.000]   there are ways to do this so that what you're asking for is information about a person who has
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.840]   been diagnosed who have they been in contact with recently. We can give you exactly that and only
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:09.880]   exactly that unless unless of course you're asking for an actual mass surveillance tool.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.320]   But I know you weren't doing that. So we're going to give you exactly what you want and it'll work
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:18.120]   great. So that's what that's why I'm more I trust Google and Apple more than I trust.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:23.160]   That's an excellent point. A government such as I don't know like the one we've got right now.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:27.560]   For competency and privacy ironically because again like they would they've tried to make data
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:32.520]   Canada famously has tried to make databases that cost 800 times what they said it would and
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.600]   never never never went online. And they would probably just go to the carriers and say just
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.760]   give us everybody's data. We'll sort of that later. So yeah, no point matching.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.800]   Yeah, I agree in general that being to get back to Leo's original point. However, though,
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:51.320]   when we was talking about the mobility tracking tool, I was intrigued when that popped up today
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:57.960]   and I went immediately type some stuff into it. Apple is only doing major metropolitan areas.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:03.080]   So you know, you can't get very granular data out of it. Unfortunately right now,
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:09.160]   whereas Google's mobility thing goes down to the county level. And so I was actually it's
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:14.040]   Google's isn't as you might expect and nearly as interesting to use. You type in a you can do
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:20.440]   a search and get a PDF you have to look at. But I was able to go and look at how like different
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:26.280]   counties in New York state are reducing their mobility. And I thought that was an interesting
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.480]   thing to do. And I mean, they're clear about how you can't necessarily compare, you know,
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:34.200]   New York city with well, where I live, Tomkins County, you know, just much, much smaller,
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:40.040]   less transit, et cetera, et cetera. But it gives you particularly for the more rural counties or,
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.920]   you know, comparing urban ones, a much better sense of it. Whereas I felt Apple's tool,
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:50.040]   it was pretty, but the, you know, you couldn't, I mean, you couldn't certainly couldn't look
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.040]   at it up and my managing under Josh centers is in Tennessee. So I looked up Nashville,
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:58.680]   which is a much bigger city. Nope, Nashville wasn't in it either. So I wonder why that is.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:03.880]   I mean, Apple obviously has data for all of those areas. It's not like there's nobody uses an
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:09.640]   iPhone or Apple maps in Nashville. Right. So that's, it, that's interesting. It confused me a little.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:17.240]   Yeah. Here's the map. The example from the United States. So the baseline, the middle line is zero
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:26.360]   change. The, you know, and then it's 20%, 60% up or 20%, 60% down. Purple is transit. It's
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:31.800]   interesting how spiky that is. I guess that's Monday through Friday. Yeah. We can, we can.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:37.000]   So you're, you're kind of. And then yeah, when, when transit drops, I guess driving goes up and
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.120]   walking goes up. So red is walking. Orange is driving. And you could see driving has gone down
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:49.320]   in the United States over the past three months, 63% walking, 66% transit 81%.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:57.240]   If you do our area, the San Francisco Bay Area, it's even more dramatic. 70% drop for driving 79
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.800]   for walking. Now, I think there's actually a difference in how Google and Apple are doing things
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.640]   here too. I mean, we'd have to go look at the Google mobility. Things to see what they're,
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:11.080]   there's something, but Apple was just saying change in routing requests. So that's basically
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:16.680]   how often are using maps to find the location to get directions for walking. So it's not
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:22.280]   nice. It searches. It sounds like right. Whereas I think move, I think mobility change was based on
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:29.320]   Google Maps tracking. I mean, yeah, that's very different. It's yeah, there's, there are two
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.160]   sides to the sword here. On the one hand, Google is in a position to give a lot better data,
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:38.440]   but it also illustrates how much data Google collects incidentally. There was a, again, this is,
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:43.240]   this is something that we're going to have to decide how we feel about it. When the most potent
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:49.160]   pieces of data, the data illustration that I saw in the past few weeks was
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:56.360]   all the, all the kids who decided to still go to spring break in Florida. And the, the ability to
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.600]   take all the, all kinds of anonymized data and say, okay, well, let's have, here's a map of everybody
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:06.600]   who was in the spring break locations who don't live in the area and where they wound up overlaid
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:12.840]   over where coronavirus infections rates are. And it was able to really show that because
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:21.240]   one, because of this one event, here's how many exposed people works. Here's how, how broad the
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:28.120]   reach of this, of these vectors were, and really spread across every, every, every major city
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:33.160]   east of the Mississippi and a little bit west of it too. So on the one hand, it's like, wow,
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:37.720]   that really does show how important it is that we, we really do shelter in place,
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:43.480]   that we limit contact, we don't travel necessarily. And then like in, in the other like 19 hours a
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:49.000]   day that you're stuck at home board, like, wait a minute, how were they able to get that data
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.680]   and make that map so precise? And it really is because of how much data is being collected
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:39:00.520]   just on an incidental basis. Do you remember the New York Times report from January,
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:05.080]   December? I can't remember exactly when it came out where they had gotten, someone had leaked them
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:10.120]   like three months of data from a couple of years ago from some of the location tracking
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.960]   companies. And these are, these are, that wasn't Google or Apple. Those were actually
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.680]   ad trackers. Yeah, those were just ad trackers. And they could, they could identify celebrities,
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:22.840]   they could identify security officials, they could identify, you know, that just shows you,
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:27.480]   if you make no attempts to anonymize that this information is incredibly valuable,
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:33.080]   I'm going to give Google and Apple some credit that they do attempt to anonymize it. It's not in
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:37.560]   their interest. They don't, they're not saying, Hey, how would you like to buy an ad to see for
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:42.760]   Arnold Schwarzenegger? They're saying, how would you like to buy an ad for men 25 to 54 in the San
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:48.440]   Francisco Bay Area? Very different kinds of information. Here's the, to your point, Adam,
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:54.280]   here's the Google information. And I think it's just a, it's not even a matter of whether Google
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:59.400]   knows more or less. It's just, they've sliced it very differently. So for instance, he's retail
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:05.000]   and recreation, grocery and pharmacy. So they're talking about trends for people going to parks.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.640]   There's just different ways of looking at the, and in their, in their guidance for this,
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:13.720]   they're saying that this is a tool for community leaders, that if you want to see how well your
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:18.680]   local rules and your local regulations are working, here is actual data to go by, because it's,
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:22.600]   it's the hardest thing in the world, particularly in, I don't, I don't mean this in a negative way.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:28.360]   This is simply yin and yang. There are some parts of the country where individual liberty is
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.520]   considered to be more sank, per seced than at other than in other parts of the country. And again,
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:37.720]   it's neither good nor bad. This is, I'm not denigrating anybody in other places, but in those parts of
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:43.320]   the country, it is so hard to say that I am the governor of your state. I am ordering you to not,
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:49.320]   not congregate. I'm ordering you to stay inside your homes, uh, between these hours. And I'm ordering
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:54.920]   all of these private businesses to be shut down, starting immediately. And the amount of kickback
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:41:01.560]   from that over the past couple of months has been amazing. Just an impossible thing for government
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:07.160]   to deal with. So when you have data that says here is, we are not simply arbitrarily saying we don't
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:13.080]   want you to be hanging out in bars. We are saying that here is the graph of how bad you are doing
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:18.440]   at voluntarily going along with things that we are asking you to do. And here is other data that
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:23.800]   we're saying that we can see from other communities that are earlier along in the, uh, in the, in the
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:28.680]   coronavirus timeline that here is how effective it is to isolate and how bad it is when you don't
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:35.160]   isolate. So this is why getting this data out there to giving giving these data realization tools
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:39.800]   in the hands of the leaders who have to make a case for here is why we're asking you to do these
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:46.440]   unusual things is going to be a critical part of this toolkit. But even, uh, people privacy advocates
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:52.600]   like pro publica, which has been very vocal. They are making maps available. I mean, everybody's doing
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:57.560]   this because this is the time when we need to get this information. This is, if I were a Sonoma
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:02.200]   County supervisor, this is the county we're in in Northern California, this information would be
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:08.040]   very valuable to me to know people are staying home. Actually, this is really encouraging. 43% fewer
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:13.800]   people going to work. Uh, that's fairly encouraging. Even grocery and pharmacies drop 24%.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:18.120]   Yeah. It's an interesting point with all of this stuff. I mean, this is against things I was
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:24.440]   writing about with our anniversary article, which is that we're in what I, uh, is being called a
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:29.480]   state of narrative collapse. We don't, our stories don't make sense anymore. And when our stories don't
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:35.480]   make sense, we all as individuals reach for the data. Like we've got to make sense of this again. So,
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.280]   self-seaving behavior. Right. It's like, so, so I mean,
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.840]   they're right. That's a good point. It's a good point. It's actually make a difference to us,
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:47.480]   personally. No, but it's, but it's still reassuring to see. Well, there is some value to it. If you're
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:52.040]   staying home, you want to see if everybody's doing it. You're not just the putts, the patsy,
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:58.680]   the self-war is right. It's good to know. Right? I did, I did go out. I was, I actually drove for
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.240]   the first time in two weeks on Saturday because I was going for this hike and the wilderness with
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:07.880]   my friend. And I was just shocked at the number of people who were out. I know. I made cars and stuff.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:12.200]   I thought it was going to be a ghost town and know there was actual traffic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:19.880]   I joke about living in the Times Square of a 300-year-old quaint New England seaside community, but
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:25.640]   truly, I'm looking up a window right now and you can see dog walkers, you can see cars. It's busier
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.720]   in my Times Square than it is in the actual Times Square. Well, I'd have to say that,
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:37.320]   to that point, I've never seen so many people walking, biking, running. We went on a bike ride
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:42.680]   last night and everybody was out because everybody's dying to get out. But the good news is they're
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:47.480]   wearing masks, they're social distancing. They're doing it safely. But, and the other good news is,
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:52.840]   this is, I've got lots of reasons. Obviously, there's lots of reasons to worry about what happens when
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:59.160]   we can say that this crisis is over with, when we have a vaccine and essentially we can legitimately
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:06.360]   resume to normalcy. I like the thought that this exceptional period is going to cause a lot of
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:11.560]   communities and a lot of government to rethink a lot of basic things. We have, I'm trying to
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:19.880]   remember what city it was, but in, oh no, it's actually in Oakland, where they, because of reduced
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:26.520]   traffic, they were shutting down a number of streets and making them pedestrian and bike only,
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:33.240]   partly because they can do that and will encourage people to not get sick by staying inside,
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:38.840]   getting some exercise. But also, it's an interesting experiment and maybe a year or two from now,
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:44.120]   they'll decide, maybe we should now do a lot of what's being done in Europe, which is to shut down
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:50.840]   certain streets to vehicle traffic and make it pedestrian only, make them bicycle only.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:56.280]   And the other thing is that the access of communities to data like what Google is providing
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:02.040]   can give them a lot more insight into what needs they are not serving in their communities. When
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:08.920]   they find out that here is, here is, here is, broadly speaking, how this community is relying on
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:15.560]   public transportation. And here is how this community is relying on social events. And to be able to
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:20.440]   see that, wow, we are, we are basically, we basically have a community where people like to congregate
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:25.720]   in places of free recreation, but we're not giving them ways to get there. Perhaps this is
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.520]   something that we could be addressing in order to strengthen our community.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:35.240]   But then there's this video from the San Francisco police, from the San Francisco Gates Instagram
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:42.440]   of a late night club, where they had surveillance video of 150 people. This is just last week going,
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:48.200]   going in the party. So there are, you know, maybe I am the pansy. There are people still,
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.000]   the good news is they're all going to get sick.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:58.040]   Every week about somebody who refused to do this or and let other people to refuse to do this,
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:02.920]   dying of coronavirus, like literally dying. So the way the police shut it down. So that's, that's,
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:08.840]   no, I honestly think that the proper response for the police to do this as soon as they, when they
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:15.160]   see this happening, they basically get the, bring in a couple of like heavy loaders, dump like tons
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:20.920]   and tons of sand in front of every single door and say that, well, you wanted to congregate. Well,
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:26.120]   guess what? You're all going to congregate there for two weeks until it's safe for you to let you
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:30.680]   out. We will, we will be air dropping you Twinkies and bottled water to make sure you don't die.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.520]   But so this is what we have to do.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:38.520]   Other story, which you started to refer to Andy of the, and this is not an app.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:45.640]   This is something Google and Apple got together to create an API for that would support down the
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:51.240]   road, the kind of containment that's going to be required once quarantines are lifted and people
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.800]   moving about what you need to do if that, when that happens. And what has been done,
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:01.080]   supposedly being done in China, South Korea, Singapore is people can move about a little bit
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:07.560]   more freely. But when somebody is tested positive, you immediately not only quarantine them, but find
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:12.680]   out everybody who had contact with them over the past few days and quarantine that group as well.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:19.320]   You, you, you basically do small little containment. And that has worked very well.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:25.320]   It requires a few things though, most importantly, besides immediate and easy testing, the ability
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:34.120]   to figure out who saw whom. So Google and Apple have come up with a, an API. It's kind of interesting
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:40.040]   the way it works. It's a tracing technology. Now, as I said, it's an API. The idea is not that
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.880]   they would ever implement this. I don't think they want to go near it with a 10 foot pole,
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:53.880]   but that health officials would create a app that would then be voluntarily or not so much. I guess
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:59.160]   Apple thinks it'll be voluntary downloaded by citizens. The way it's going to work, and I'm
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:04.520]   going to quote Moxie Marlin spike here, the security researcher who created signal open,
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:10.680]   signal open whisper systems. Here's how it works. Once a day, your device, and again,
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:18.600]   it works on Android and iOS, derives a daily tracing key, a unique key, unique to your device.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:24.600]   And then it uses that to derive a new proximity ID every time your device's Bluetooth address
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:33.240]   changes, which is every 15 minutes. As you walk around, your proximity ID is broadcast,
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:39.400]   and everybody near you running this app or their Bluetooth sensors will keep track of
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:46.680]   your proximity. And similarly, you'll keep track of everybody you see. If someone tests positive,
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:53.320]   they choose, by the way, notice this voluntary apart. They choose to publish their previously
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:49:02.760]   secretly day secret daily tracing keys. So your device frequently downloads all the published daily
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:09.000]   tracing keys to see if they match somebody you were near. And at that point, you would,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.560]   I presumably get an alert saying you were near somebody who's tested positive, you need to
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:21.000]   quarantine in place. So that's how it works. Moxie brought up a few issues. It's using Bluetooth
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:32.360]   LE. He said, it seems likely some kind of personally identifiable information would have to be combined
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:40.200]   so that authorities could say, okay, you need to quarantine. He also points up, points out a couple
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:47.720]   of potential problems. Keys published by a device have to be published to all devices in the world.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:53.400]   That's a major denial of service vector, because we're talking potentially 100 megabytes or more
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:59.880]   of data. If anyone can anonymously blast up keys, in other words, if you could say, hey,
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:05.720]   I tested positive. Well, actually, first, let me say if anybody can anonymously blast up keys,
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:10.600]   they can create a situation where there's gigabytes of data for every device in the world to retrieve
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:17.960]   and compute. That'd be a problem. He also points out there's a prank problem, because you could say,
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:25.320]   I have have it. And everybody who we've been exposed to now will be told they've been exposed to COVID
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:31.880]   without knowing who said he was testing positive because that's protected. So there is a kind of
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:38.200]   problem there. Now, maybe Apple and Google have solutions to that. Here's the biggest issue,
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:45.240]   and I agree with Moxie. He says, there's going to be issues with this, as you point out Andy,
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:51.880]   with this API and other uses of it, maybe by ad tech. But he's also not super optimistic about
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:59.320]   opt-in contact tracing, because he doesn't think people will opt in. I anticipate someone will
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:06.440]   end up using this for some other interesting thing, though, he says. So go ahead, Adam. You said
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:12.280]   Apple has mitigated these two issues. Yeah. So yesterday, Apple and Google had a briefing,
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:18.200]   and we were writing about it. Glenn Fleischman had done an article for Tibbets about it. And so,
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:22.120]   he was updating the article with all of the details that came out in the briefing. And
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:28.840]   obviously, it's at the API level right now. So there's nothing really-
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:33.880]   Anything's possible. Anything's possible. That said, they're fully aware of all this stuff.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:38.840]   This is Apple and Google we're talking. The two most attacked companies in the world.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:43.880]   No questions asked. There is no one who has hit more than Apple and Google.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:50.040]   And so I have to believe that they're thinking about this in a really big way.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:55.480]   One thing is that they did say that they would be producing some kind of model apps, because
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:52:01.560]   governments may simply not be able to produce this stuff, even from the API.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:04.920]   It does have to be a reference. Right. And so Apple and Google would do this,
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:10.040]   and then the governments could either just kind of white label them, look, it's the US app.
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:17.160]   Or they could do it themselves and have their own app that just uses the API.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:23.480]   In terms of the pranking, yes, there will have to be some kind of verification that you actually
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:28.280]   got tested. You don't just get to say, "Oh, I'm positive." That's not good enough. And everyone
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:36.200]   knows that. The question about whether the uptake will be there is an open one. And I think the
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:43.720]   hope is that people can be encouraged to do this because it is for the public good.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:54.680]   That if people don't do it, if there's only 2% of the population downloads these apps and uses them,
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.200]   that's when it starts to be more of a question.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:05.160]   And I'm encouraged by the fact that we are all putting ourselves a great discomfort
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:09.240]   and following the rules. And I think that it's pretty widespread agreement.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:13.880]   If people don't do that, then governments will, that's when the question will be,
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:19.800]   does this dumb become compulsory? Apple and Google are building it into the OS stacks next.
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:28.840]   One of the ways to get people to sign on into this and to opt in is if in the coming months,
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:35.960]   if this gets built out properly, to say that, "Okay, we are now saying that we can open up
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:41.240]   movie theaters, we can open up live venues. However, you are going to be required to tap in."
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:49.160]   And if your phone can provide a key that says that no, you have not been in contact with anybody,
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:52.280]   then we will allow you to get in. Otherwise, we're not going to quarantine you, but we're going to
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:55.880]   say, "No, you're not allowed to be into this. You're still subject to six foot distance."
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:59.720]   I can see that happening. I can see a local government saying to movie theaters,
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:06.280]   "You can open, but everybody who comes has to somehow identify themselves. So should somebody
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:11.640]   who is there test positive, we can notify them all." I can see that happening. No,
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:14.440]   the movie theater is going to love that to say, "Oh, do I get their email address?"
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:20.680]   Anything to it. Yeah. Well, no, I think that you're in a good bargaining position when you're
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:26.600]   opening gambit is, "Do you want your theater to be a business to close permanently or do you
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:33.000]   want to actually make money?" Or drugstore or coffee shop, etc. I mean, honestly, though,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:42.280]   if you want to open for business May 1st, June 1st, even July 1st, that's a lot of infrastructure
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:45.400]   to put in place in a couple of months. Can you imagine the insurance liability too?
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:52.200]   Yeah. Like what? Well, I mean, if people get sick in your establishment because you open without
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:58.440]   everything being in place or against somebody's recommendation. This is where government comes
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:04.520]   in. It's possible for lobbyists to carve out exemptions just like the gun industry
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:08.360]   can't be sued for liability when their product is in a crime. They wouldn't have to be an exception.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:14.360]   Yeah. If they said that your business is not under liability for
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:20.280]   coronavirus infections, if you observe these rules that we're giving you to observe.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:26.200]   I mean, actually, the more specific one would be how the government funds, has a fund for people
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:30.680]   who are hurt by vaccines that you can't sue pharmaceutical companies for any problems caused
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:35.480]   by that vaccine. And that's again. It's a public health issue. It's a public health issue. Yeah.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.040]   Public health issue. Yeah. So.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:45.720]   If it weren't so deadly, it would be fascinating. You know, if this would be a great sci-fi novel,
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:51.000]   because it's going to be a weird thing. It's not deadly. Like if it was Ebola or
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.320]   Lassa or one of those things, it would be a problem almost immediately. And if it was less of a
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:59.400]   problem, like if nobody really died from it, it'd be like the flu, it wouldn't really, it's like,
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:03.160]   it's just tedious enough. Just deadly enough. To really screw us over.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:07.240]   Just deadly enough. And we lose like 60,000 people a year from the flu.
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:12.040]   In the US alone, on a bad year. I mean, it varies quite a lot by the year, but
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:16.120]   60,000 people can die a year from the flu. So this is not in some ways.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:22.120]   Well, no, it's every time that that comes up, we have to address that and say that the difference
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:29.720]   is that people get the flu that gets sick almost immediately. They go to bed and then they're
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:34.360]   pretty much done with it. The difference between this is that you're carrying it, you're spreading
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:38.200]   virus for two or three weeks before you even know that you're sick. The other problem being that
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:44.520]   it is way, way, way more fatal than any flu vaccine. There is a flu vaccine. So there is a
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:50.040]   mitigation that you can pursue for the flu. We're stuck. There is no mitigation. There's no
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:55.800]   treatment and there's no vaccine. But again, I don't want to minimize what Andy said, but I do
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:01.560]   think that we get accustomed to things. No, I agree. More people get killed in car accidents.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:08.120]   All those 1000 people. I think I think we might hit that number in a few ways. We're
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:12.920]   in again, growing pretty fast. So I think it's just important to run around and come back at you.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:19.000]   Yeah, exactly. The fact that I'm a bad driver, I can kill maybe two, three people.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:26.520]   If I'm a jerk who decides, hey, I'm going to spring break, I can kill dozens and dozens.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:30.840]   And mostly people that I love and that I know people I've been in contact with. So
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:39.080]   Frederick Philu writing in the Monday note says, and I think maybe it's worthy of conversation,
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:44.680]   it's time to put aside some privacy principles temporarily and with numerous guarantees
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:49.800]   to alleviate lockdowns and try to restart the economy. But the widespread lack of confidence
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:55.720]   toward political leadership and big tech will not help. It's it's you know, this is an opportunity
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:04.120]   for both government and big tech to burnish their image a little bit by doing this intelligently,
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:11.000]   correctly, and with some regard to the long term privacy issues, I would think.
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:20.120]   And one thing that I've been again, maybe it's a little bit Pollyanna-ish, but we have been in a
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:26.360]   major bad space with privacy for some years now that New York Times article that showed the
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:33.960]   location tracking. That was the very definition of chilling. And what's happened after that article?
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:40.360]   Diddly squad. You know, that I mean, they go and reveal that the everyone's surrounding the
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:45.800]   president can be tracked instantly, you know, in real time by these companies and nothing happens.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:53.880]   And so maybe, just maybe, fingers crossed, knock on wood. This will actually allow these
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:59:00.360]   conversations to start and result in some legislation that says, we know this is happening already.
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:06.440]   It's already a privacy nightmare out there. Maybe we can get some legislation to allow
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:16.200]   some of this stuff to continue in a real way while dealing with the abuses of it at the same time.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:20.200]   It's a big good time to do it. Those articles over and over again about the cell phone companies
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:24.120]   selling our location to bounty hunters and debt collectors. And then they swore they'd stop
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:27.560]   doing it, then they did it again, and then they were fought, vice caught doing it a third time.
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:35.720]   This is a good point, Adam. This is an opportunity to both fix that ill and to do something about
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:42.040]   COVID and go forward in a way that's much more positive. Apple says that starting in mid-May,
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:49.720]   so exactly a month from now, the iPhones will start getting these new APIs.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:56.200]   And then later in the year, iOS and Android will receive updates to let you opt into contact
[00:59:56.200 --> 01:00:00.040]   tracing without installing an app. So there will be...
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.400]   And it's like Android is going back further than iOS. Like, Apple's only doing the latest iOS
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.800]   and Android is going back several versions.
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:10.840]   Yeah, because the way that Google is doing it is that they're making it an update that goes
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:16.760]   through the Google Play Store through the app store. So basically, any phone that is four or
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.760]   five years old has access to the Google Play Store.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:22.200]   It sounds like it'll do it silently, right? It'll just put it on your phone.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:27.080]   Yeah, they have a bunch of hunks of the operating system that are updated through
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.760]   Google Play, and I assume it would be through one of those big hunks.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:37.720]   So next month, you'll be able to download an app that's for your region that will do all this.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.360]   Apple will release a software update that will make this API function in the designated app.
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:45.960]   Is there anybody here who would not install that app?
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.360]   I'll install it day one.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.640]   Oh, yeah, I'll install it.
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:55.640]   We all will. It's funny because on Sunday we talked about this, and Georgia Dow and Owen,
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.480]   right? Am I wrong, Renee? They said, "Absolutely."
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:01.400]   Oh, and I always... My mind agrees with them. My heart is terrified.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.920]   That's where they're like... I mean, it's like using Facebook or Zoom. It's like,
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:09.480]   I don't... In a perfect world, I would never ever do it, but the world we're in is so far from
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:13.800]   perfect that I'm a person divided against myself.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:21.560]   I think something that you constantly reflect upon in adulthood is that you stand by your
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:26.360]   principles, but principles is a plural. You have many principles, and sometimes they're in
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.560]   direct conflict with each other.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:31.000]   Well, and I think I've been talking about this with other people as well,
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:41.480]   as we all have the meter, the privacy meter. As Andy says, you change your actions based on that,
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:49.400]   but only very occasionally are you forced into a situation where you have to make a decision
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:53.560]   that reveals your true spot on the privacy meter.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:00.840]   I don't want to imply this is... Oh, complete privacy is the best, and no privacy is the worst.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:05.960]   There's no right or wrong necessarily, and it's even cultural. One of the reasons why
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:10.760]   the Asian countries have done better in some of these is that in Asian cultures, there's more of a
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.440]   support of the group. A collective mentality.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.680]   Right, and that's something the US rules.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.680]   But you know, we're learning... Of course, in Europe.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:24.040]   This is a very interesting moment in American history because we have been
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:30.440]   really individual. And now I think there's a more collective mentality because of this.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.480]   Not a bad thing.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.880]   Right, and I'm a systems guy.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:41.480]   I like putting systems together, and I've discovered that as I think about these things,
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:47.800]   I'm certainly, again, utterly freaked out by all the location stuff that you add tracking
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:52.120]   companies of what's done. But when I see that there's a real utility to this,
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:55.000]   my privacy meter moves over towards the public health side.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:55.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.640]   That I'm like, yep, do the contact tracing.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:57.800]   I would.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:58.600]   We need the contact tracing.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:05.320]   I was very heartened by how... Maybe it's just because I'm in a small suburban town or ex-urban
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:11.880]   town. But people really are pitching in and they're waving at each other, and they're making
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:17.480]   dinner for each other. They're donating. They're making a point of ordering food if they can afford
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:22.760]   it to take out from their favorite restaurant to keep them in business. If they can't, people
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:30.840]   are neighbors are pitching in. There's food banks. And it's remarkable, and it's very heartwarming
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:36.360]   to see it. And sometimes it does take that, something like this, to get people back together again.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:40.360]   It's not even this. We're so strange. I remember years ago, I had this conversation in my head
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:44.920]   where my brain's like, I will never use Google Mail because I object on principle that they are
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:48.040]   scanning all the emails coming in. And they're like, but it's so good.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:48.520]   Right.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.560]   It's like those things.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:53.080]   It's so good. It's so much better. The spammers are so much better. The thing,
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:58.200]   you keep making these sort of... You have actual conversations in your own head about these things.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:03.560]   All right. Yeah. Whenever I go, I'm sorry, I'll end this. But whenever I go into the public library,
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:08.520]   and I see people who are using the public computers because they don't have computers or
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:12.600]   they don't have internet access or they don't have homes, they're not signing in to Microsoft
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:17.480]   Outlook. They're starting to get to Gmail to get, find out if they got the job or if they got those
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:21.880]   benefits or they didn't touch with people. So, like I said, multiple principles, sometimes competing
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:28.680]   in your head for security. Speaking of which, I don't know how this works with the vast number
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:33.160]   of people who don't have smartphones or don't have Bluetooth LE on their phones. I mean, I don't
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:38.840]   know. Maybe you have an oyster card that governments distribute or something like that. I don't know.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.640]   I think that falls into the... We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:49.880]   I mean, what I'm actually most happy about is that Apple and Google are stepping up to do things
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:55.480]   that only Apple and Google can do. I mean, there's been all these great announcements. We're giving
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:01.400]   15 million to that. We're donating 100 million masks, whatever. Great stuff. Don't get me wrong.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:07.400]   But that requires writing a check. That's it. Any company could write a check. I want to see
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:11.320]   Apple and Google and the companies like that doing the things that only they can do.
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:16.840]   Well, and I think they are. And you're right. I think honestly,
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:22.840]   we would be up a creek if this had happened pre-internet.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:27.560]   Just imagine. Just a movie that's beating on each other in the streets.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:31.240]   Yeah. It's not just being able to create a tracking app. It's having Netflix. So,
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:36.920]   you don't go crazy being able to do this or do what we're doing. This has not in any way changed
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:42.920]   how we do our shows. I mean, you think, we think back 30 years to the beginning of tidbits.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.200]   Just just go back through some of those histories. Like, could we have done it 30 years ago? No,
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:50.120]   it would be terrible 20 years ago. No, unless you want a postage stamp size.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.280]   So, you don't need a little mule. You're going to be.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:57.320]   And it was only Parker Posey who could do it. I'll be watching Parker Posey.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:03.240]   All right. Here's an uplifting story. You can now buy a Mac Pro on the Apple outlet,
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:10.040]   refurbbed. You can save the price of a Mac Pro. It's not even that much.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:16.680]   Is it? Well, I guess, look at that cheap cheap. Here is a refurbished Mac Pro 8 core Intel ZNW
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:24.840]   Radeon Pro. Just one GPU. Sorry, kids. $5,689. So, that's what that's 400,
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:32.840]   almost $400 less than it costs new. How high can we go though? Let's go. Let's see what the most
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:38.920]   expensive. And you got to wonder, where did this refurb come from? Like, oh, no, I think what
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:44.120]   we're seeing is every journalist and YouTube blogger who bought one so they could do a video about it.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:48.760]   It's Marcus Brownling and returned. Yeah, that's what it is. No, he's, he has a whole closet full
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.800]   of them, I bet. But it's like, probably every other year. He is. When he was on the 20s said,
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:57.480]   well, all the editors have to have one. I think I have four or five. He's doing his closet when he
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:01.320]   was moving his studio and he had a closet full of reds. And I just thought, you have a Mark Edgworth.
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:05.160]   It's amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing. What, Marcus, what, what, what day is trash day in your
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:10.200]   neighborhood? I want to be there at 3 a.m. with, with a bucket. But you're right. These are,
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:15.720]   so, and these also would be probably not a few of them would be people who had buyers or
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:20.280]   moors. They, they, they, they, they got the box and they went, oh crap, I can't afford this.
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:27.560]   And they sent him right back. $10,449. Oh, here's the most expensive one. This is one with an
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:32.840]   afterburner. You're going to love this. Now how much would you pay? It's like cost of a small car.
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:40.840]   3.2 gigahertz, 16 core, two radians, an apple afterburner, a mere $22,439.
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.080]   Some of them might have also had small issues at launch because I was,
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:46.440]   though it sometimes happens and they got brought back and apples, swapped them out and then they
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:51.080]   fixed them up and we sent them. I mean, this only has 192 gigs of RAM. Come on.
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.680]   How many kilometers? How many kilometers?
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:59.160]   8 terabra. I guess it's a run-pro on this thing for God's sake. So we have a review coming up on
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:05.000]   Hands on Technology. We finally found somebody who bought one of these. And it's the Lindsey.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:12.280]   It's your, your neighbor Ray Maxwell and Vancouver. Oh, nice. Ray used to be on the show I did up
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:17.480]   there, a lab with Leo. He was on 40 times. We did a show with him in the early days of Twig called
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:23.480]   Maxwell's house that was all about science and flying and math. He's a drone pilot. He uses it to
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:30.040]   edit the six K and eight K videos he gets from his drone shots. He bought a very nice machine. In
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:39.240]   fact, he bought it with a 32 terabyte RAID array internal. That's amazing. And actually,
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:44.440]   because of that, he came up with one of the first flaws in the Mac Pro, which was that the fans
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:50.040]   weren't keeping it cool enough. So it shut down within a day. Called Apple, Apple, I think probably
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:54.280]   if you spend, I don't know what, 20, 30,000 on a computer gives you pretty good support.
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:59.160]   You get a person. You get a, you said that's exactly right. You get, you get the Mac Pro person.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:05.960]   And they, and they pushed out an update to the fans that made it work. He also had a problem with
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:12.920]   his USB ports after 10, what's the most recent one? 10, 15, 14, I don't know.
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:13.400]   >> Or four.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:14.680]   >> 15, four supplemental.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:19.240]   >> 10, 54. Well, that's the thing. The day after he reported this problem with the USB ports,
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:25.160]   supplemental came out and magically fixed it. So, I think there are a couple, at least a couple
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:29.640]   of Ray Maxwell fixes. He tells the story, it's going to be a fun hands-on tech a little longer
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.840]   than neutral. >> I want to forward to it.
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.560]   >> Yeah. He also reviewed the XDR display because he's a color scientist. And so he really
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:41.640]   understands, we found somebody who's the perfect guy to review this stuff. Alex Lindsey can't even
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:47.800]   afford one. This is, this is, this is, well, he, he couldn't a few weeks ago now.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:53.320]   >> Now maybe. Now that he's gotten a lot of business, companies that want to do their conferences
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.760]   online. >> It's using one for every Zoom now.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:55.160]   >> Yeah.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.440]   >> Anyway. >> I thought he did a great job on the
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.080]   Queen's message. I thought that was a pleasure for us.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:06.360]   But, you know, I just, he don't recognize it. I know Alex didn't do it. You know how I know?
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:11.960]   They let her wear a green dress. Alex would never, never have let her wear a green dress.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:14.600]   Your majesty, can I suggest another color?
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:18.360]   >> Something that you're going to be, you're going to be wearing a West Ham United football
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:23.160]   jersey tomorrow. I guarantee it. >> Perhaps. But Alex did post his Zoom set up yesterday. It had
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:28.440]   like giant lights and giant computers and eight lights. And it was just, yeah, it was like 20
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:35.400]   Starks Zoom set up. >> I do. I have to say even our humble set up here is far superior to anything
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:41.480]   I'm seeing, even from the major networks is now they have everybody streaming from home. It's like,
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:45.000]   all right, what is going on, you guys? >> It's so weird.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.640]   >> Get a better microphone for crying out loud. >> It was, it was.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.760]   >> And they adjust the phone. Like they reach up and they adjust the phone while they're doing
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.280]   their talk show. It's the most. >> Yeah.
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:56.760]   >> I was watching MSNBC last night and they were interviewing somebody, her iPhone went off.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:02.360]   And you can see, you can see your kind of consternation. And she, she, she kept talking.
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:06.200]   But she got out of turn it on. >> All that reporter with the kid behind us now, Leo.
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:09.000]   That used to be like the funny video we watched. Now we're all that reporter.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.440]   >> Absolutely. Actually, there's a very funny, I see if I can find it quickly enough. There's a
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:22.200]   Reddit post I showed on iOS today on maybe, maybe, maybe. >> You're Andy and then Cramcan 2000 just
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:29.240]   gets in your shot. >> This was, this was a professor who was teaching a class.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:35.560]   Let me show you this. He was teaching a class on Zoom and his son decided,
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.040]   because a professor apparently couldn't see he was, you know, sharing his screen. So his
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:44.680]   son decided to zoom, zoom, bomb it. He had many different costumes.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.160]   >> That is the best.
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:53.480]   >> I wouldn't pull the tiger's tail when I'm quarantined with the tiger.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:58.920]   You want to be able to run away. >> If you keep watching the tiger, we'll get his revenge in a
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:04.280]   moment. >> I have to say. >> I have a friend, I have a friend whose husband is a professor at Cornell.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.120]   And, you know, Cornell had two weeks off and then spring break and they just started
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:13.160]   classes again a week ago. And I had sort of a doctor beforehand and I said, "Oh, how are you doing?"
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:17.320]   And she's like, "Well, it was fine. It was just the kids before, but sorry."
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.760]   >> Get him. >> It's like perfect. My husband, now the
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:27.080]   problem is my husband because he's a lecturer. He's used to having a hundred people
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:31.800]   rest watching him nodding along and now he's got to talk to a wall.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:36.040]   >> He's still got the same tone of voice and she's in the same small apartment.
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:40.360]   >> Oh no. Oh no. He's talking like this. He's declaming.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:45.880]   >> And he's a math professor. >> Oh geez. How does he do it without the sliding blackboards?
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:50.200]   I don't know how you would do that. >> I got this amazing message yesterday from
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:55.640]   the University of Albany saying that my Apple versus FBI video was used on their online cybersecurity
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:01.000]   class. They had to watch it and then decide whether Apple or the FBI was right or wrong.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.640]   >> Oh, that's cool. >> Which terrified me, Leo. It makes you really think before you put words
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.920]   up on the internet. >> Well, that's right. It means the words were the right words.
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:16.600]   If you go to Walgreens Drive-Through and use your physical Apple card, 3% cashback.
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.560]   Thank you, Apple. >> That's a little thing.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:23.720]   >> They should give you more for using contactless now. You should be rewarded for touching things.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:28.520]   >> I went to Lucky. I'm not going back, but a couple of weeks ago we had to have food.
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:33.320]   Fortunately, they have a plexiglass between you and the checker and everything.
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:36.440]   And then they wanted the money and I was so happy I could just dip.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:43.640]   >> Yep. >> So I don't know if you guys have covered this before, but my managing editor,
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:48.520]   Josh Centers is in rural Tennessee. He's gotten very happy because tractor supply,
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:52.840]   which has been one of the Apple pay holdouts, just started supporting it because of this.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:58.680]   >> Wow. Thank God, tractor supply. By the way, we should be clear. It's not just tractors.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:06.360]   No, you get combine harvesters, you can get bulldozers, chickens and chicken feed.
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:10.840]   >> Chickens, chicken feed? >> I have to say, I have a tractor.
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:13.880]   >> No, we have a TSC down the road right here.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:17.480]   >> I think I mentioned this before, but there was a concept video about like Walmart's in the
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:22.040]   future where it would be all based in driving because COVID would mean nobody gets out of their
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.960]   cars and the guy's going through his driving and he's getting these groceries by a robot put in
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:29.880]   his car. And then he gets to the end, has to get out and hand somebody his credit card.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:35.240]   Now, even in the dystopian future, Walmart still won't take it.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:40.920]   >> Still won't take it. >> The very definition of A for effort.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:48.280]   We, I think, you know, we're not getting a lot of information about China. China's claiming
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:52.680]   it's better and things are going well. But there is one data point that might support that,
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:15:00.440]   according to Reuters, Apple's iPhone shipments in China were up 500% last month.
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:08.120]   Up from the bottom when nobody was buying anything, but they shipped 2.5 million iPhones
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:15.080]   in China last month. Mobile phone shipments overall, 21 million. So I guess people in China
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:21.160]   came out of their houses and bought phones. >> They went outside, they blinked at the sun and
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.680]   they're like, oh, this is what outside is like. And then they, oh, I need an iPhone and they went
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:28.920]   to the Apple store and got a phone. >> So the stores are reopening. In fact, that's the only
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:34.280]   place you can go to an Apple store is in China. It's good to look ahead and see that maybe there
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:38.920]   is a light at the end of this tunnel and get some money. You're going to need to buy a phone.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:47.080]   >> We thought maybe today would be the iPhone SE. Have you seen anything?
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.560]   >> Today is one plus daily, Leo. >> Yeah, that's right.
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:52.360]   >> I was not going to share a news cycle. >> The eight comes out today, doesn't it?
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:57.480]   >> Yeah. Apple wants to come right after, they always wait until somebody launches and then
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:01.400]   they come afterwards so that that person ends up being B-roll. That's just a strategy.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:05.960]   If you're on the same day or earlier, then you become the B-roll.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:08.360]   >> Kicking myself. >> Malibu Stacy has a new hat.
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:13.720]   >> We probably should have done the OnePlus event. I didn't think of that.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:20.360]   120 Hertz display, they're very good at that kind of thing. 48 megapixel. 48 megapixel.
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.680]   >> It's really 120 Hertz. You don't have to lower the resolution to get the 120 Hertz. It is variable.
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:31.160]   It can dynamically shift based on the content, but it's like a grown up 120 Hertz now.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:36.920]   >> Not cheap, $1,000. >> I wonder for the pro, yeah.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.640]   >> Yeah. I wonder if I could buy one right now.
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:45.480]   I think, I don't know, but I would guess that somebody around here probably has one.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.920]   >> And it's got wireless, well, the bargal lifted this morning.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.280]   >> Oh, I can say. >> It's got wireless charging.
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.600]   >> Then Jason has one. >> Okay.
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:56.200]   >> And we did a hands-on tech review and you'll see it tonight on all about Android.
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:00.200]   >> The videos went live, I forget when like 11 a.m. suddenly my entire YouTube feed was
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:10.120]   one plus eight. So honestly, I'm really reluctant to buy an Android phone these days.
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:14.840]   I just, if I were going to buy one, this is the one I think they're much better than the Pixel
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:21.400]   phones. The oxygen OS, the version of Android that OnePlus puts on there is very pure, very
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:25.000]   close to the original. The hardware is easily better.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.280]   >> It's got wireless charging now. >> Yeah, which they didn't have before.
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:31.640]   I love the OnePlus 7. >> And IP rating on the carrier versions,
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.440]   although I think the non-carrier versions are identical, they just didn't bother to rate them.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:37.880]   >> So that's waterproof to what, how high?
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.520]   What should I get? >> I think what I asked,
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:43.480]   eight level. >> Black, green or ultra-multer marine?
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.720]   >> Ooh. >> The blue looked matte.
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:47.400]   The blue looked nice and matte, but I don't know.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.600]   >> Yeah. >> More cars had the ultra-range.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:54.520]   >> That's kind of bluey. 12 gigs of RAM, 250 gigs storage, a thousand bucks.
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:58.040]   That's it. >> It's a OnePlus for a thousand bucks.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.280]   It's going to take my brain a little while to adapt to the machine.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.040]   >> Yeah, that was one of the things that was so cool.
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:05.000]   >> Yeah, one of those, yeah, the green one's eight.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.760]   >> Yeah, it's 899. That's the cheap one. 8 gigs of RAM.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.280]   >> 8 gigs of storage. >> And you start off being the rebel,
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:15.320]   you end up being the self-appointed king.
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.080]   >> Yeah. >> It's like, you know what?
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:23.000]   I, now we are successful. Now, we should make our own ceramic-based
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.360]   translucent aluminum screen. >> Oh, thank God.
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:31.960]   I can't buy it for 19 hours, 43 minutes and three seconds.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:32.760]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.720]   >> You're safe. >> Thank God.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:37.800]   >> I almost fell for it.
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:42.200]   >> They should take pre-orders. They should take your money whenever you are
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.320]   willing to give it to them. It's not the best economy right now, one plus.
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:48.520]   If Leo wants to give you the money now and you send it to him later,
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:49.800]   take Leo's money. >> Yeah.
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:53.160]   Well, I'll take a look at Jason's before I make up.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.680]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:57.560]   See, classic mistake. >> [LAUGH]
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:00.600]   >> I'll add you. >> Apple's not threatened by these.
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:06.520]   >> Up starts in any way, right? Andy, you still use an Android phone though, right?
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:12.760]   >> I still use a Pixel because it is, I like the pure Android experience.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:17.080]   I really like the camera. And I just like it. I think it's really good.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:23.080]   I will say though that there were specific reasons why I switched from my iPhone to
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:28.120]   an Android phone three or four or five years ago. And a lot of those are really not operative now.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:35.880]   So the fact that I still own a Pixel 1 and a Pixel 1 is still my daily driver, believe it or not.
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:41.560]   But and so I'm really, year after year, I'm thinking that if I want to buy myself a new phone,
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:48.360]   I can. And year after year, it's like, ooh, the new iPhone 11 looks really, really good.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:52.440]   >> Yeah, I will get you back. >> And unfortunately, I get to borrow one
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:57.640]   for a couple of months. And it's like, ooh, I really do. It's actually not as expensive as it used to
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:02.360]   be. Like, oh, do you mean that we're going to get like time of flight? A time of flight on the
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:08.840]   new? Oh, interesting. >> I have to say that the camera in this, it continues to blow me away.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:12.520]   I just I've never got this here. >> I take pictures of this thing and I go,
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:16.920]   that's as good as my much more expensive cameras. I don't know why I even carry those.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:26.200]   Well, across the board, I still carry my $2,000 worth of Olympus lenses and body.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:31.720]   But now I used to have like my B camera would be like a nice pocket camera with a Sony sensor
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:36.040]   for when I just need to take a quick grab or if I have like the really big telephoto
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:40.520]   and I needed to get something close. And now it's like, no, I can leave that at home and leave
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:44.920]   those battery chargers at home because I really think that anything that I would want to shoot
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:50.120]   close up will be as good if not better on the phone, particularly because of the phone is making
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:54.360]   much, much better choices than I am in the heat of the moment. >> This is a picture I took of
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:21:01.000]   downtown Petaluma of Lisa playing Pokemon Go. You'll be happy to know Renee. Completely unopposed.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.800]   Nice. >> She's taking all the gems. >> Yeah, but I mean, I just think the color,
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:12.760]   the detail, the sense of space and stuff like I can still get really good video off of fancy
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:17.480]   camera. But if I'm, but like we're, the iPhone is so great. And even some of the other modern
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:21.000]   phones now is you're walking and the lighting and the white balance and everything is changing.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.400]   And additional camera still doesn't have a processor to recalculate that fast enough.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:28.920]   And so you get like it's yellow and then it's blue and then it's dark and then it's bright.
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:34.280]   And like the iPhone, the video, it just sometimes you can't tell that you actually walked
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:37.320]   through those areas and were bouncing up and down for a while when you did it. >> Yeah.
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:43.800]   And having the super white, this is the extra wide, it's just really nice to have that capability.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:50.040]   >> Yeah. I mean, Renee has helped really inspire me to try to, every, every couple of years I try
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:54.200]   to learn how to do video. And it's always an object failure because I can't find a really,
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:59.240]   I can't get into the groove of it. But Renee inspired me to try it again. And the first step was,
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:04.280]   well, let's get everything I've got in the office that can like shoot video again, including like
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:11.320]   this camera body that I spent $1,400 for attached to an $800 lens. And like, you know what, it's the
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:17.000]   iPhone is actually doing a much better job. >> No, it's depressing. It's like, damn.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.760]   >> It's like, it's okay because I didn't buy, it's not like I spent like $5,000 for a red.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:27.000]   And now I need to learn how to use it properly because out of the box it doesn't do good. But it's
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000]   like, damn. >> I know. >> Andy, you're overthinking this.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.880]   >> I know. >> Come on, Andy, you don't want to just use the built-in webcam and a MacBook Air.
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:43.320]   >> Oh my God. So this is ridiculous. I started using this. This is a C500.
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:46.680]   And I was specifically for shooting video. That's the cinema camera.
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:51.960]   >> Yeah, I mean, and it's ginormous. It's like a ginormous. But I had to do it fast. And so I
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:57.000]   ended up using my iPhone for a little bit. >> And it was probably, at least for this, for YouTube,
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.040]   for the good. >> Everything but depth of field. It is amazing for everything but depth of field.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.880]   >> Right. And that's because the sensor is very small.
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:08.440]   >> And some low light, like low light is still harder on video because it's doing so much more
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:13.800]   work. It can't run everything, it can run on a stealth photo. So you do see the noise on the
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.520]   low light. >> What you're really seeing is the effect of,
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:20.920]   in a still stacking, all the stuff that are behind the scenes of taking multiple images.
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:26.520]   You're seeing how much computational photography goes into a still, which you just can't put into
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:29.080]   a video. >> And it's why some people say, well, how come
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.720]   Canon doesn't do that? And they probably don't have the silicon.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:35.960]   Plus, try to do a 4K feed at 60 frames per second and doing all that.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:39.400]   >> Yeah. >> It's not trivial. >> So, by the way, Andy,
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:43.880]   the Pixel 4A, I'm sure it's going to be out any minute now. We keep seeing these leaks and
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:48.840]   everything. That will be a low priced version of the Pixel that probably will be worth your money.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:56.920]   >> Yeah, I still have the Pixel 4 on loan. Because of personal ethics,
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:02.760]   I'm not allowed to put my own SIM card in it. And I love how they're moving things forward.
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:07.320]   I love that they have this motion sensor based on solely. But it's like,
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:13.800]   if the motion sensor, if this weren't on an Apple product, within three months,
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:18.920]   every single app would not only support next track, previous track, but there'd be the one that
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:23.800]   changed the volume. Switch cameras up and down instead of-
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:26.440]   >> I set my banking app up. >> Just got Face ID support on my Pixel.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:29.080]   I took forever. >> Yeah.
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:33.880]   >> Yeah, that's another reason why I couldn't write about my Pixel experience because,
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:39.960]   again, part of it is, as we all know, at some point, you have to put your own SIM in it and
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:46.680]   use it as your daily driver. And I was not willing to give up of biometric authentication for my
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:51.160]   banking app and for PayPal and for one password. And it took months for all of that to click in.
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:56.120]   >> So when do you think the SE, they're not doing it today because of the eight?
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:59.800]   >> Although honestly, they could have. >> Yeah.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.000]   >> Basically, they don't care. >> I think they don't care.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.600]   >> One plus a lot more than what a better aspect.
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:05.640]   >> I tried to explain it because a lot of people were saying that they would do it to screw with
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:11.480]   one plus. My thing is they're the rich cousin. They show up to your house when they show up to
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:14.600]   your house. They don't care what other cousin is there. They don't care what your plans are.
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.120]   They're not being beat. They just don't even think.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:18.760]   >> So what's holding it up? Normally, they do it on a Tuesday, right?
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:23.160]   >> Process that it was Wednesday. He's been saying that for, I think, six weeks, John
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.960]   Prosser, that the date was tomorrow? >> It was tomorrow.
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.880]   Yeah, so we'll have to wait and see. >> Okay.
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:29.320]   >> Yeah. >> The 15th.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:33.960]   I mean, everything is up in the air because of COVID. I mean, it's not a normal release cycle by any
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:37.160]   means. >> And they have to do it after Mac break. There's no way they'd do it before Mac breaks.
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.760]   We could talk about it. >> Oh, sunset.
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:44.440]   >> So worst is when they do it on Mondays, what I have to cover the damn thing,
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:49.000]   and trying to get the issue out. >> While you're typing, they release it.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:49.800]   >> Oh! >> Yeah.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:53.400]   Monday afternoon is when it really gets us.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.160]   >> They dubbed up keynote Adam every year.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.000]   >> Yes. >> Yes.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.800]   >> Well, it happens to us. I don't know why, but I guess because of close-up market or something,
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:06.360]   but almost all, like Microsoft always does stuff after Windows weekly.
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:10.120]   Apple only stuff after Mac break. And I think it has more to do with it.
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:12.520]   >> And if you move the show, they move too. It's really weird.
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:14.200]   >> That's what's weird. That's the thing that's--
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.400]   >> That's the most important part. I think that's it.
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.000]   >> Yeah, I don't think they're paying attention.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:25.400]   I have to say, the reason I still, I think Android is superior in one regard,
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:31.880]   and it's the springboard on Apple. The user interface is so awful.
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:37.160]   Just moving an icon, the jiggle, jiggle, jiggle,
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:40.920]   falls into this pit of another folder.
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:41.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.360]   >> You can't get it out. It drives me insane.
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:48.200]   >> I did a whole video on it last week about, I go through it step by step,
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:51.240]   saying I want them to give me the option to have the search bar there.
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:54.040]   Then I want to have complications like Apple Watch.
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.960]   Then I want to have some serious suggested apps.
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:58.200]   Then I want to dock. And then at the end of the video, I say,
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.600]   "Oh, it's just swipe to the left." That's what--
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:01.640]   >> Oh.
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:04.280]   >> But it's also, for five years, Apple has had this minus one home screen,
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:07.640]   where you can just swipe to the left, and they do this really intelligent,
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.640]   like assortment of widgets. And it's like they're too timid to make that the home screen.
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.960]   It's like they've been beta testing that for five years.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.480]   >> I understand.
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:19.240]   >> Now, of course, they do make it the home screen on the iPad, on iPad OS.
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:21.880]   But I understand that they want to segregate the widgets,
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:24.840]   because I know they're looking at an Android.
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:29.960]   >> That is so ugly. He's got the weather and the clock on his own base.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:33.000]   >> No, but they are pretty. So HTC set a while back.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.080]   HTC published their usage statistics,
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:38.040]   and there is a bunch of nerds who just love them and use them all the time.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:41.080]   But the vast majority of people never use them and never change them.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:44.520]   They're ornamental. It just looks super cool having those giant weather things
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:47.000]   on your home screen. So it's not a utility thing,
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.560]   but it makes people feel-- and you can turn them off,
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:51.960]   but it makes people feel like there's some action going on there.
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:56.680]   >> Yeah. Well, it's one of those things that I keep going on about is that
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:28:03.640]   the thing that makes a phone perfect is getting right all the features that 90% of the people
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:09.640]   are going to use and appreciate. But also, there are all kinds of features that 5% of the users
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.440]   are going to love, but it's a different 5% for each feature.
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:12.680]   >> Yeah.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:13.480]   >> So I don't--
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:14.120]   >> You photoshoot.
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:19.720]   >> Yeah, well, exactly. I don't-- I mean, I don't use-- my life is not all about widgets,
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:23.720]   but the first thing I do when I set up a new Android phone is I want to set up my weather widget,
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:26.040]   because that's one of the things I want to be able to see when I light up,
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:27.400]   and I would miss it if it were going.
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:32.200]   >> Well, and it irks me that I have to keep clocking calendar on my front page,
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:36.440]   just so I can know what time it is and what the date is. It's ridiculous.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:40.040]   >> Well, of course, now that Apple's bought Dark Sky, you know,
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:42.120]   weather is going to be front and center in the whole thing.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:43.640]   >> Yeah, maybe. Maybe it'll be the--
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:44.360]   >> Hyper-localize.
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.600]   >> The whole screen is going to be the weather behind it.
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:50.840]   >> So that's the rumor, right, that iOS 14 is going to finally add some sort of widgetting
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.880]   and complications.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.680]   >> Kind of? I think some people said no.
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:57.320]   >> Oh, really? That was just a test thing?
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:00.920]   Oh, that will be disappointing.
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:05.240]   >> They were supposed to do it a couple of years ago, and they got pushed back,
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:06.680]   because they did that big maintenance thing.
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.960]   And when you talk to people, it's like, well, we rewrite springboard every year,
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:13.080]   and it's like, no, you mean you-- it's like the Golden Gate Bridge.
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:17.160]   You start painting it at the beginning of every year, and you finish painting it at the end of the year.
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:20.120]   But it's not having reimagined experience by you.
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:24.600]   >> Having said all that, I still am-- finally, just kind of--
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:28.520]   I have a Pixel 4, but I finally just said, you know, the iPhone really,
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:34.040]   from a point of view of privacy and security, I just can't use--
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:39.560]   I just don't-- I'm worried about Android these days, and I just know I'm safe in an iPhone.
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:42.120]   So, you know, I'll put up--
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:43.640]   >> It's lucky we have options with springboard.
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:44.360]   I just put up--
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:46.440]   >> I'm super happy we have a bunch of phones that are all--
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:49.800]   like, there are phones from so many vendors now that I can recommend,
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.000]   and that not wasn't always the case.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:51.400]   >> Yeah.
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:52.920]   >> It's like, you have to compromise on the video.
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.520]   You have to compromise on the camera.
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.280]   You have to compromise on this or that.
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:58.840]   And now I feel like if someone doesn't like an iPhone,
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:01.400]   there's like three or four really good options I can give them,
[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.600]   and I'm really happy about that.
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:03.400]   >> Yeah.
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:04.040]   >> Yeah.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:08.360]   Apple has the highest share of US activation since 2016,
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:09.720]   so I don't think I'm alone.
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:15.480]   It is-- you know, it always was kind of 50/50 iOS Android.
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:18.120]   It's not looking that much like that anymore.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:21.560]   I don't-- well, oh, that's in the US since--
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.560]   it's hard to get these numbers right,
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:26.040]   because it is also technically true that--
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:28.280]   I think that Android just passed a certain milestone
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:31.400]   where it is now the most widely installed operating system,
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.360]   point blank.
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:32.840]   >> Everywhere.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:33.400]   >> Yeah.
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:34.600]   >> Yeah, and so, oh, well, that's--
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:36.200]   and that's-- if you're an Android weenie,
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:37.640]   oh, see, that's right.
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:41.080]   We will soon grind the iPhone beneath the wheels of our justice.
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:41.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:44.440]   >> And it's like, well, no, that also includes, like,
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:46.040]   embedded Android devices.
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.960]   It also includes really, really terrible phones
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:50.280]   that no one should be using in Blister packs.
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:50.760]   So--
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:52.760]   >> And I should point out that,
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:54.840]   even though it's the highest share since 2016,
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.600]   it's only 44%.
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.840]   So they're just fighting over these seats.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:01.560]   >> It's weird, because, like, some analytics companies
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:03.000]   always make it iOS versus Android,
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.760]   even though there's only one iOS vendor,
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.440]   and there's multiple Android vendors.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:08.280]   And then some say that's iPhone versus Samsung,
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:11.240]   and they ignore the reality of there being multiple Android
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:11.640]   vendors.
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:15.320]   So it's very hard to do an Apple's to Android comparison.
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:16.920]   >> Yeah, that's true.
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.440]   It's not fair.
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:18.680]   Yep.
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:21.160]   It's just not fair.
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:26.520]   So Apple has fixed with that supplement.
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:30.760]   Now, I've also heard problems of the supplement.
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:31.240]   Am I right?
[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:32.120]   >> Yeah.
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:37.000]   There haven't been widespread problems,
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.760]   but they've been kind of ugly.
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.600]   >> Yeah, like your whole machine boot.
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:41.800]   >> Like your bricks machine.
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:42.200]   >> Yeah.
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:45.080]   >> And so we've been following a few of these,
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:51.240]   and my guess at this point is the problems are not--
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:54.440]   really problems.
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:57.800]   There are things happening with the bridge OS
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:03.560]   on the T2 chips, such that when the update takes--
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.160]   it takes a while to install,
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:07.960]   and when it has to redo the bridge OS,
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:10.760]   the machine just goes black and just sits there.
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:13.480]   And it can be a while, and there's no progress,
[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:14.440]   no feedback.
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.280]   You have no idea what's going on,
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:18.600]   and it doesn't take much interrupt--
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:21.400]   if you interrupt that, bad things happen.
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:25.000]   So that's one class of another friend of mine--
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.240]   >> So be in other words, be patient.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:27.800]   >> Be patient.
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:30.680]   Do not stop this install.
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:32.920]   Let it go hours if it has to.
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:36.840]   Do not stop, because you're not going to do anything good
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:38.440]   by stopping it.
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:39.400]   So--
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:41.160]   and then another friend of mine had an interesting problem
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:43.880]   where it installed, and then put him through,
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:48.040]   for start scenario, where it wanted to make a new account
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:49.080]   and everything.
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:50.600]   And all his data was there.
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:53.000]   I mean, he canceled out of this.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.600]   He didn't want to make a new admin account,
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:55.480]   and all that.
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:56.520]   He was afraid he was going to lose the data.
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:58.840]   He canceled out and checked, and the data was all there.
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:02.280]   And he made a backup and ended up letting it go,
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:03.880]   and it worked in the end.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:07.560]   But it was an odd situation.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:11.400]   So it's just so weird when it's a supplemental update,
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:17.000]   which fixes like four bugs, and doesn't even get its own version number.
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:20.040]   And yet, causes some of these problems.
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:20.520]   Who knows?
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:25.960]   Well, so I would say you should do it.
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:29.000]   Or should you wait?
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.280]   You know, the bugs are so specific that you'll know.
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:32.760]   You could wait.
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:33.320]   You could reason.
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:33.480]   Right.
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:36.920]   I mean, the big one is the FaceTime backward compatibility issue.
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:41.000]   So if you're not talking with anyone who's using
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.600]   my OS 9 earlier, that kind of stuff, just let it sit.
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:48.360]   You know, it's not fixing very much for most people.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:51.560]   So I think you can just look at that list and say,
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:53.000]   you know, I'm not Ray Maxwell.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:53.880]   I'm going to hold on.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:56.360]   He was having trouble with his USB-C port.
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:59.800]   He had to reset the SMC, and that fixed it.
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.880]   But then the update came out the way to say.
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:04.040]   And we always have to remember there's, you know,
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:06.120]   there's the population problem.
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:08.680]   You know, you have enough people doing something.
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:12.040]   Problems are going to happen in that population
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:14.120]   that coincide with these installs.
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:14.840]   Right.
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.120]   And are completely irrelevant and related.
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:17.320]   That's what happens to Windows.
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:18.840]   At least that's what they say.
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:23.960]   Every time they say.
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:24.840]   Every time.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:29.240]   Our show today brought to you from the LastPass studios.
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:33.480]   And of course, our sponsor is LastPass.
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:36.280]   As you're preparing your remote workforce boss,
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.920]   you got to keep security top of mind.
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:41.800]   And yet you can't cut and employ productivity.
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:43.480]   That's why I love LastPass.
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:46.440]   Transitioning to a full work-from-home environment.
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:50.600]   I think you already know can be very complicated,
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:52.440]   but LastPass will help you make it easier
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:53.960]   without decreasing security.
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:57.400]   For one thing, we're already seeing a massive uptick
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:59.960]   in coronavirus-related phishing attacks.
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:03.080]   LastPass reduces the risk of phishing schemes
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:04.920]   because it doesn't auto-fill passwords
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.600]   on suspicious websites.
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:09.240]   And in most cases, your employees don't even know the password,
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.520]   so they can't end around it and say,
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:11.560]   well, I'll type that in.
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.760]   For remote employees accessing your corporate VPN,
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:17.000]   LastPass adds an additional layer of security,
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.520]   directly to your VPN,
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:21.320]   through biometric, multi-factor authentication.
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:24.920]   More than just fingerprint or face ID,
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:27.400]   it actually can look at IP addresses,
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:28.920]   geo-location information
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:30.760]   to really make sure that that employees
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:34.120]   the right person to be accessing your corporate network.
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:37.160]   Regardless of where or how your employees need access,
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:38.680]   LastPass ensures your employees have
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:41.080]   secure access to their work applications.
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:42.760]   Single sign-on, which I love,
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.840]   there's over 1,200 single sign-on apps
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:46.040]   that work with LastPass.
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:49.240]   That means you don't even have to worry about a password.
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:51.480]   You just say yes in your phone and you're in.
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:52.680]   Password management, of course,
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.800]   this second to none,
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:56.120]   LastPass generates long, strong passwords,
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:57.480]   and then keeps track of them.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:00.920]   They're never decrypted anywhere but on your device.
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:02.600]   LastPass doesn't have the keys,
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.360]   they don't have any way of decrypting it,
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:06.120]   so your privacy is guaranteed.
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:08.440]   And they even offer an offline mode,
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:09.800]   both for password management
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:11.800]   and multi-factor authentication.
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:14.360]   So your employees gain access,
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.320]   no matter where they are.
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.120]   And a lot of times,
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:18.120]   employees are going home to some,
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.960]   some Wi-Fi that may be a little spotier
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.160]   than what they're used to at work.
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:23.320]   So it's nice to have that offline mode.
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:26.600]   Seamless collaboration,
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:28.920]   that's absolutely true of LastPass.
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:31.560]   In fact, we have it set up so that there's folders for ops,
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:35.080]   engineering, bookkeeping, marketing,
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:37.400]   and each of them gets a separate set of passwords.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:38.520]   It's great for onboarding.
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:39.800]   A new employee just said,
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:41.080]   "We just give them access to the folder."
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:44.280]   Suddenly they have access to all the resources they need.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:46.360]   Same thing when they're working remotely.
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:49.480]   Also, it's very easy for remote employees
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:51.000]   to share passwords across teams.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.520]   There's a very nice admin interface.
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:56.680]   You have over 100 policies.
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:58.120]   You can enforce Wi-Fi, for instance,
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:00.200]   say you have to use two-factor,
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:02.360]   you have to, that's just part of the deal.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.880]   We also have minimum requirements for the master password.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:07.640]   Make sure our employees are doing the right thing.
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.680]   And LastPass has a globally dispersed,
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:13.080]   ready-to-response support and success team.
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:15.560]   And yes, they are online right now.
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.000]   They're working right now
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.480]   to help you with an efficient LastPass deployment.
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:21.000]   If you have any questions,
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000]   if you want any advice or support,
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.800]   getting your employees out into the field,
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:27.080]   LastPass is there for you.
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:30.760]   With LastPass, your IT team is in complete control
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:32.360]   over who accesses what,
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:34.200]   no matter where they're working,
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:36.120]   and you get complete visibility
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:38.120]   over access and authentication.
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:39.160]   There is no better way.
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:41.800]   That's why we use LastPass and we have for years at Twitch.
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:44.440]   I've used LastPass personally for more than a decade.
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:49.400]   It is so nice to know that I have somewhere I can trust.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:51.880]   I could put my even not just passwords,
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:54.360]   but passwords and drivers licenses,
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:55.480]   social security numbers.
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:38:00.200]   It's my secure enclave for everything I do on every device I use.

[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.920]   You better believe when I got that
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:07.800]   new MacBook Air.
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:10.200]   The very first thing I do is put LastPass on it.
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:12.120]   Then I can put everything else on it.

[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:17.720]   LastPass, thank you for your support.
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:21.800]   I did finally get the MacBook Air 2020,
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:23.000]   by the way, I got it last year.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:23.480]   Oh, nice.
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:26.680]   The keyboard is much improved, usable.
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:27.800]   Sweet.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:29.480]   Not as noisy.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:34.200]   Yeah, it doesn't stub my fingers when I try to type.
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:36.120]   What else?
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:43.240]   You put out your one month in review on iMore,
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:44.520]   because you still do stuff for them.
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.840]   What's your general take on it?
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:48.520]   You're happy with it?
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:51.080]   Is it your full-time MacBook or what?
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:53.720]   No, if I didn't have to do a video,
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:55.080]   I would be very, very happy with it.
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:55.720]   It's so light.
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:57.080]   Traditionally, I was happy with it,
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:59.640]   because I could travel everywhere, coffee shops,
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:01.960]   briefings, all those things, and it was so light and so easy.
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:05.160]   Now it's like, I could take it from the sofa to the bedroom to the desk.
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:06.120]   [laughter]
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:09.240]   This is how I've adapted, but I need to use Final Cut.
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.080]   And I was actually really surprised,
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:12.600]   because I still call them CoreM,
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:15.880]   because I don't like Intel rebranding them as big boy chips.
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.280]   But I was surprised, because the first generation,
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:21.240]   the ones in the first 12-inch,
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:24.280]   they would choke on 4K really, really hard.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:27.720]   And I don't believe that this is not a pro computer.
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:30.440]   Nobody should assume that this is a way to get a pro computer,
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:32.040]   in a light, cheap body.
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.240]   And I think a lot of people,
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:37.640]   especially early on, made that mistake and got upset that it wouldn't do 8K Final Cut Pro
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:40.360]   without ramping down the processor.
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:41.240]   So it can do it.
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:45.480]   It can do 4K video, but it takes like two and a half times longer to export
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:47.720]   than my MacBook Pro does.
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:50.520]   And that's not a good use case for me.
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:55.160]   But if you aren't doing anything like heavy pro work, it's really good.
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:59.480]   I recorded all the, from 2015 to 2020,
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:01.080]   all the different keyboard generations,
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:03.320]   and what they sounded like, all the different cameras,
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:05.160]   and what they look like, because the camera's still
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:06.680]   for a company that makes the iPhone camera,
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:09.640]   the Mac cameras are just not in an acceptable place.
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:12.840]   And I got Ian Cutress from Anantek to actually explain to YouTube
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:16.760]   what thermal ramping is, and what thermal ramping isn't,
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:19.160]   and what the expectation is for these classic chipset.
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:22.840]   So if you are looking for a Mac that is like,
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:25.000]   if you don't like iPads, you want an actual Mac,
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.320]   but you want it to be super portable to do all sorts of mainstream computing things,
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:31.320]   not pro things.
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:35.800]   It's finally, it fixes everything that was wrong about the 2018 version,
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:39.800]   and makes it like that really fabulous 2011 version that most of us love.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:40.680]   I'm very happy with it.
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:45.400]   I got that i7, I got the 16 gigs of RAM and a terabyte R drive.
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:48.120]   So it was $2,000, which I'm not happy about.
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:50.760]   But I've always loved the MacBook here.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.680]   It's always been, you know, I think my--
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:53.800]   You read the fine laptops.
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:55.400]   My favorite Mac, yeah.
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:58.440]   And you know, when I have an iMac Pro, if I need to do video editing,
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:02.520]   I don't need it. In fact, what I did, because Anthony Nielsen,
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:05.240]   who does a lot of our, is like our, you know, artsy editor,
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:09.080]   he does a lot of our fancy editing and graphics and so forth,
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:12.120]   his MacBook Pro that we bought him last year died.
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:15.640]   So I said, look, take my i9, the 16 inch,
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:17.160]   because I'm just going to use this MacBook Air,
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:19.160]   because I don't need all that horsepower.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:22.600]   And I think trading horsepower for thin and light,
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:25.960]   for me, was a perfectly sensible thing to do.
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:28.440]   It's really a nice package.
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:30.120]   It's very comfortable, easy to use.
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:31.720]   And because it's got those chips,
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:33.960]   those chips are really good at quick ramp-up.
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:35.240]   So it doesn't feel slow.
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:36.360]   Like those apps launch fast.
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:36.840]   Not at all.
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:37.960]   If you try to do like a quick--
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:40.280]   It feels snappy, which is really nice.
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:41.720]   It's not the fast i7.
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:44.200]   It's a mobile low power lye 7.
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:46.360]   It's meant to give you instantaneous results.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:47.880]   It won't mean to--
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:48.600]   So this is the thing.
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:52.120]   If you want stuff to just feel generally snappy,
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:52.920]   get the MacBook Air.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:56.520]   If you need long levels of sustained load,
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:57.720]   then you really need a pro.
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:59.480]   Rendering or crunchy.
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:02.040]   Anything that takes a long time is a long contiguous.
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:03.720]   And even some rendering isn't contiguous.
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:04.520]   It has highs and lows.
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:07.400]   But if you really need contiguous workflows,
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:08.520]   absolutely get the pro.
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:10.600]   Just irks me, though, that they couldn't put
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:12.680]   the second USB-C port on the other side.
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:13.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:15.640]   I asked about that.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:17.640]   And it's just because of the way buses work.
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:19.560]   It makes it a much more complicated machine.
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:22.120]   And I hate it, too, because it's on the wrong side for me.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:22.760]   I'm a lot to do.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.920]   All my power is on the opposite side from that plug.
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:27.160]   And it's just too far for the cord.
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:28.160]   I have to--
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:29.240]   It's almost there.
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:30.680]   Instead of doing a standalone review,
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:32.360]   I'm going to do a hands-on tech that
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:38.120]   compares it to the 2020 Dell XPS 13, which is Dell's version.
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.000]   Much better keyboard, bezel-less screen.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.200]   It's not a better screen.
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.840]   Apple still does the great best LCD screens.
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:47.640]   But it's a very, very good screen.
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:50.920]   And it has ports on two sides.
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:52.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:54.280]   Which I really like.
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:54.760]   Thank you.
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:57.200]   So fortunately, I don't have to use Windows on it.
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:42:58.520]   I put Linux on it immediately.
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:01.440]   But it'll be an interesting comparison,
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:03.520]   because they're very similar.
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:05.160]   I mean, this Dell was inspired.
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:08.240]   The XPS 13 really was inspired by the MacBook here.
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:09.000]   And so--
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.560]   The thing I like is the build quality.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.680]   It's like my 2011 MacBook.
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:14.000]   I gave it to one of my siblings.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.720]   And it is still rock solid.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:17.920]   The screen is old.
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:20.080]   All the things about it, the I/O is older.
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:22.280]   But it is still perfect.
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:24.280]   There's no plastic cracking on it.
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:25.280]   There's no parts coming out.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.520]   It feels like a solid brick of aluminum.
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:29.200]   The whole thing just feels like--
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:32.080]   The Dell not quite that solid.
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:33.720]   On the other hand, it has a Real i7.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:37.840]   And it has a 2-terabyte hard drive in it.
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:39.480]   And it was $400 less.
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:41.840]   So--
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:44.120]   Just I think if you want Mac OS, the MacBook
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:45.800]   here is a good choice.
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:48.160]   That's really the bottom.
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:51.440]   What's great about the MacBook here these days is you can really
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:54.680]   see how the hardware experience of designing iPads has
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:57.640]   influenced and improved the Mac.
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:43:59.520]   Because it really is.
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:04.880]   Like, if Apple ever decided to make an iPad with a keyboard
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:07.720]   and a trackpad and a hinge connecting the two,
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:09.440]   it really wouldn't look much different than what they're
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:11.120]   selling as the MacBook Air.
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:14.840]   Is it an Iris Plus graphics?
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:15.960]   Yeah, it is.
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:18.040]   So at least it has a fairly--
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:20.880]   Intel has seemed to have done pretty well with the new Iris
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:21.720]   Plus graphics.
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:25.040]   I mean, they're no AMD, but they're pretty funny.
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:26.360]   I say as someone who really would like AMN--
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:28.200]   If I were writing a newsletter--
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:30.800]   if I'd been writing a newsletter for 30 years,
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:33.760]   I'd think the MacBook Air would be just right.
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:36.560]   Well, I have to say that when I was writing about it,
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:40.640]   I was like, finally, I can replace my 2012 MacBook Air.
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:41.760]   Yes, exactly.
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:44.480]   Because I've been holding on to that machine for so long
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:46.400]   now waiting for the keyboard to get fixed.
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:49.040]   So you think the keyboard is good enough now?
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:52.520]   It's still not great, but it's good enough now, right?
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:53.720]   That's my hope.
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.920]   I haven't actually set hands on one yet.
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:57.920]   No, OK.
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:58.920]   I was like you.
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:01.760]   I was like, I'm so close to pushing that order button
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:03.320]   on the day it came out.
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:07.080]   And I decided against it because it
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:09.840]   feels like something's going to happen with a low-end MacBook
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:14.160]   Pro that the 13 or maybe it'll be a 14, whatever rumors
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:15.320]   are saying right now.
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:19.680]   And I kind of want to see that first.
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:22.480]   Apple hasn't done a very good job in recent years
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:23.800]   at differentiating their lines.
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:25.480]   It's actually getting a little better now.
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:28.760]   But for a while, there was so much overlap between the MacBook
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:31.360]   and the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:33.800]   that it was confusing on which one to buy.
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:38.800]   And so I kind of want to see what happens with the low-end MacBook
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:41.840]   Pro rev that's probably do out relatively soon.
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:42.360]   Interesting.
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:43.440]   And I'm going to see that.
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:45.040]   And then I'm going to buy a MacBook Air.
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:47.560]   I just love that form factor.
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:50.840]   Exactly for the reason you mentioned Renee because it's solid.
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:51.280]   Yeah.
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:52.720]   It just feels like it's a--
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:54.080]   it was milled out of aluminum.
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:57.120]   The whole damn thing, just one solid piece of aluminum.
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:59.280]   I don't know how they put processors in there.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.880]   And it's just--
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:01.240]   It's--
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:04.040]   Tony told you, remember they use water drill to carve out
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:05.120]   exactly the size of the--
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.520]   Exactly.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:07.000]   Exactly.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.840]   Let's talk chamfer angles.
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:10.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:12.440]   There was some concern, some people--
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:14.600]   because they opened it up and they saw that the fan
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:16.200]   wasn't connected to the heat pipe.
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:17.920]   So I asked a bunch of different architects from a bunch
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:19.080]   of different places about that too.
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:21.680]   And they said that putting the fan on the heat pipe
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:26.000]   is just a 100% way of knowing that the airflow is going to be
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:26.480]   there.
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.400]   But it's not necessary.
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:29.080]   It's just like if you don't want to think about it,
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:29.760]   that's what you do.
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:33.640]   But if you model it and you're really confident that your airflow
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:35.040]   will still work even if it's not there,
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:36.480]   then it doesn't change anything.
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:39.160]   So it just means that Apple is really confident
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:40.240]   in their airflow modeling.
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:43.120]   I haven't noticed any fan noise.
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:44.480]   What do you even say about the thermals?
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:46.160]   They're pretty good.
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:48.160]   Either they're basically exactly what Intel--
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:51.600]   so Intel, a couple of years ago, changed their messaging
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:52.000]   on this.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.120]   And some say it's because they fell behind AMD.
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:55.840]   And this is what they had to say.
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:59.480]   But Intel only guarantees base clock speeds now.
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:02.480]   Turbo is designed for them to increase responsiveness.
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:07.720]   So they don't expect you'd ever get sustained turbo
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:08.520]   frequencies.
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:11.120]   They expect those frequencies to ramp up momentarily
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:13.960]   for like 5 to 15 seconds in order to launch your apps,
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:16.360]   handle whatever tab you're switching to,
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:19.360]   do quick processes like an Excel or things like that.
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:22.840]   And then as it gets hotter, it goes back down
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:25.800]   to base frequencies to continue on the workload.
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:27.280]   And that's what they deliver with this.
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:28.240]   Perfect.
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:29.600]   I think that's fine.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:31.720]   And really, you're paying too much attention
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:35.360]   if you're watching your I-stat menu.
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:36.880]   And it's a CPU.
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:39.040]   What's going on?
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:39.680]   I get calls.
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:40.840]   Macopro does that.
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:43.120]   It's problematic because you want to pro to do sustained
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:43.720]   workflows.
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:45.280]   But this is not, again--
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:47.360]   And while I'm off for a 10-1-4 bread on this,
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:49.400]   where it's like every tech review reviews it
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:51.560]   as if they're using it for their niche techniques.
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:54.120]   And they forget about another 95% of humanity.
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:58.120]   And the 16 fixed that perfectly, the 16 inches.
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:47:58.720]   A beast.
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:47:59.600]   It was really good.
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.600]   Yes.
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:05.440]   Why is the HomePod so cheap?
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:07.560]   $90 for a limited time.
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:11.080]   And the reason is the beast's headphones last week.
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:12.160]   $90 off.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:12.960]   $90.
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:13.480]   Oh, yes.
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:15.040]   $90 is $200.
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:16.840]   But that's roughly $90 off.
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:22.800]   They're definitely having that Apple TV curve moment,
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:23.600]   aren't they?
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:25.040]   Where they had this thing out.
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:25.840]   It's just a hobby.
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:26.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:29.360]   And they have to get the hardware out to figure out
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:30.320]   how people are using it.
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:34.040]   And then that'll tell them how to make the 4K hockey puck
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:36.560]   size one that people will actually want to buy.
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:37.280]   Right now they have--
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:38.600]   It's a lot to go.
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:40.480]   Yeah, it's tough.
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:43.840]   I thought it was interesting that they move to TVOS.
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:46.280]   But it's good to see that they haven't forgotten
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:47.640]   that this product exists.
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:49.600]   And they're trying to up it a little bit.
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:50.920]   What does that mean?
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:54.680]   Aren't all the iOS is pretty much the same?
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:57.080]   They're just optimized for different purposes.
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:01.680]   One of the highlights of TVOS, as opposed to regular iOS,
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:04.280]   is that on the phone, there has to be power management
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:05.840]   because you have to maintain a battery.
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.400]   On TVOS, you're expected that you're always plugged in.
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:13.200]   And so if you want to optimize apps or optimize features
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:17.320]   for being a steady on beacon, beyond that, I can't even guess.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:22.000]   But if rumors of them creating a cheaper version,
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.520]   or they can't--
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:27.480]   I've created and called a pro, but to have a less expensive
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:30.080]   version of it that just simply gives you a really good,
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:34.880]   serious, seriously activated smart speaker that will also act
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:39.440]   as a home pod connector, that'll be a good thing.
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:43.240]   Because right now, I don't know anybody who
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:45.080]   recommends them to anybody.
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:47.640]   It's not a terrible product.
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:51.680]   It's one of the rare occasions where Apple looked
[01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:55.880]   at a successful product that Google and Amazon and others
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:58.080]   have been making and said, we'll make one of those,
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:01.240]   as opposed to what can we bring to the table that will give
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:03.080]   the best experience for our users?
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:04.600]   I think it's even worse than that.
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:06.240]   That was an old project.
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:07.760]   They were working on that for years and years.
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:09.320]   And I think their initial thing was,
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:13.720]   we're going to do that iPod Wi-Fi again.
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:15.240]   And it was like, well, we're making a speaker.
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:16.000]   How do we control it?
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:16.500]   Siri.
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:18.720]   And it was like, that was just the way to control the speaker.
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:20.360]   And then while they were building it,
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:21.640]   the echo came out.
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:24.520]   And instead of stopping and saying, wow, people really want
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:25.320]   smarts.
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:27.640]   And maybe they just didn't think that people really wanted those.
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:30.040]   Because it's still a very establishing market.
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:31.440]   People really want cheap speakers
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:32.800]   with really good assistance on it.
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:34.520]   They're like, we're shipping a really good speaker.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:35.920]   And oh, yeah, you can pull it.
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:36.400]   Really crap.
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:38.120]   Made in this office, say maybe we should change
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:40.120]   the paradigm of this product.
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:43.560]   Has anyone ever actually published information
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:48.560]   on what kinds of queries are actually
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.760]   asked of these smart speakers?
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:51.560]   It's almost always--
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:52.120]   Is it time really?
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:53.120]   Yeah, a list.
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:53.620]   Yeah.
[01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:55.480]   It's like, I think Ben Beherin or somebody
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:56.720]   published a survey on it.
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:58.640]   It was like, timer, play music.
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:00.160]   And then everything else was 1%.
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:01.280]   That's not what you're allowed to.
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:01.800]   Yeah.
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:02.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:04.200]   That's because I mean, that same thing.
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:06.920]   I play music and set timers.
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:08.720]   Turn off lights occasionally.
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:10.880]   And now I don't even ask it what the weather is,
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:12.520]   because I'm not leaving my house's office.
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:14.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.000]   That's what I want to see.
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.040]   The graph of weather queries and how it's plummeted.
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:18.760]   It's exactly--
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:19.640]   Things are so weird.
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:21.320]   It's like I say, what time is sunrise?
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:23.040]   And it tells me sunrise for today.
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:24.800]   And I never need to know sunrise for today
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:25.760]   when it's already happened.
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:26.960]   Like just a steal, but--
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:29.440]   And all these things that be human would naturally do,
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:30.920]   that all of these things still don't do.
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:34.520]   It's really close to the same time tomorrow, I would think.
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:37.320]   It is, but then-- but it still feels like you're giving me--
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:39.680]   it's like I do these tests where I run Google Maps,
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:41.920]   Apple Maps, and something else at the same time.
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:43.640]   There's a lot of fishing or something.
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:45.360]   What do you need to know the sunrise for?
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:47.040]   It's the time you want to see it.
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:49.120]   He queries the tides a lot too.
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:49.560]   So--
[01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:50.200]   Yeah.
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:52.840]   He's one of those Canadian vampires.
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:54.480]   Is it a nip tide, Siri?
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:56.360]   At nip, I want to know.
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:59.200]   Pics of the week.
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:03.080]   Adam, what would you like to pick here on your 30th anniversary?
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:05.160]   What kind of cake would you like?
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:07.760]   I believe that I was prompted.
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:10.880]   There's this newsletter, this website that you--
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:13.480]   you know, I just run across it recently.
[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:13.960]   It's so good.
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:15.160]   It's kind of cool.
[01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:15.960]   So good.
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:18.280]   You know, yeah, tidbits.com.
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:18.720]   tidbits.com.
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:22.080]   And you know, it's funny, I was watching--
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:23.520]   I mean, I look at it all the time, of course.
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:25.680]   But watching you look at it on the screen, particularly
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:27.720]   that issue number one, I was like, hey,
[01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:30.600]   our redesign of a year-- actually almost two years--
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:31.080]   It looks great.
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:32.080]   --of the second years ago now.
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:33.520]   It looks great.
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:37.120]   And after those of us who have been around for that long,
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:38.840]   I cannot tell you how many redesigns
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:41.640]   and infrastructure transitions and things like that we've
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:42.240]   been through.
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:45.280]   And the site, it looks great.
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:47.880]   I love using it.
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:49.440]   It's just so much fun.
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:52.240]   As somebody who's always putting sites on screen,
[01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:55.800]   there are very few sites that really are this readable,
[01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:58.640]   this easy to look at and understand.
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:52:59.360]   Your site is so--
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:00.400]   We've put a lot of work into that.
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:01.640]   Yeah, it's so good.
[01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:04.200]   And I can-- you know, of course, I zoom in a little bit.
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:06.440]   But so we can read the text and everything.
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:08.800]   And your site totally handles it beautifully.
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:11.000]   I mean, it really-- it's awesome.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.080]   So not only is it a great newsletter,
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:15.960]   but it is a beautiful newsletter.
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:16.640]   And if you're not--
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:17.120]   That's it.
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:18.360]   --you can read it for free.
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:21.240]   But by all means, get the membership.
[01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:22.720]   You know, support this guy.
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:24.880]   You want another 30 years.
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:26.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:29.680]   And you know, you didn't even scroll enough to find one of them.
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:31.840]   We have some ads.
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:37.280]   But honestly, I got so irritated by all the trackers.
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:39.680]   And this and that and the other thing,
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:41.040]   we build it ourselves.
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:42.480]   It shows a graphic.
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:43.440]   That's what it does.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:46.000]   There's no trackers anywhere on the site.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.280]   And it's a first party ad, so it won't be blocked.
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:49.440]   So that's good too.
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:50.520]   Precisely.
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:55.800]   And honestly, most of them are house ads anyway.
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:58.880]   Because I'm just not into the ads.
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:01.400]   I'm working for the members, honestly,
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:05.480]   that those are the people who are voluntarily giving us money.
[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:07.040]   And there's the people I'm writing for.
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:08.960]   I wish I could say the same thing, but I'm not.
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:10.160]   I'm not working for you.
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:12.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:14.760]   Well, Matthias and LastPass, I'm going to have to say two
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:15.760]   of my favorite companies.
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:16.280]   There you go.
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:17.880]   I'm a big glass.
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:20.200]   At least we have advertisers we like.
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:21.200]   Yeah.
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:22.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:24.280]   Yes, absolutely pick it.
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:26.680]   Now, do you want to pick anything else?
[01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:28.760]   Well, I did actually have one other thing, which I--
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:29.640]   I see you do.
[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:31.520]   So I want to give you that opportunity.
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:35.440]   So there's a note-taking project management
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:37.120]   to-do app called Agenda.
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:38.600]   And Agenda.com.
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:42.000]   And it's Mac and iOS.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.960]   And you can use it for free.
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:48.680]   And then you can subscribe to get more features, which
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:50.600]   is kind of a neat way of doing it.
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:52.680]   And they don't do it quite like other people
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:55.360]   where when you've subscribed to get new features,
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:57.400]   you get those features forever.
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:54:57.920]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:00.040]   And they'll keep promising they'll give you more new features.
[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:00.960]   Well, this is pretty.
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:02.040]   I like how this looks.
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:03.440]   It's pretty.
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:07.680]   It's-- I can't say-- I mean, I've been using it for a while.
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:10.840]   I've taken on some more work on a board,
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:12.040]   nonprofit board that I'm on.
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:13.960]   So I need to be tracking things a little bit more
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:16.600]   and taking more notes and doing agendas and whatnot.
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:19.640]   And I'm doing my agendas in Agenda.
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:22.920]   It's kind of calendar-focused note-taking.
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:24.240]   That's what I got from it.
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:25.240]   Is that right?
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:32.160]   It is with-- yes, although it's also just really well-thought-out
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:33.120]   note-taking.
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:33.640]   OK.
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:37.000]   You know, there's 10 million note-taking apps, right?
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.880]   This one seems to be well-thought-out.
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:41.880]   And being able to tie some things to calendar events
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:44.360]   is a really nice way to do it.
[01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:46.840]   Being able to have the same thing, iOS and Mac,
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:49.000]   constantly updating, all that.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.560]   And it works.
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:55.640]   And I'm really impressed by their innovative business
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:59.800]   model in terms of not just doing it with, oh, you've
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:01.680]   got to pay a subscription fee forever,
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:03.720]   but you subscribe, you get these features,
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:05.560]   you have those features forever,
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:07.520]   and we'll give you new ones, again,
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.360]   that you can pay for again later.
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:11.920]   Nice.
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:13.040]   Agenda.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:15.440]   How much is it?
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:16.560]   A good question.
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:18.040]   We should look.
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:18.760]   I don't remember.
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:19.920]   I don't think it's very expensive.
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:20.920]   It's very download.
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:26.440]   And then another feature is not terribly expensive, $10, $20.
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:29.280]   So it's a promising reviewer, as you sometimes
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:31.160]   don't internalize those things.
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:33.800]   Yeah, I know, yeah, exactly.
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:36.760]   Andy Finotko, your pick of the week.
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:38.360]   I got two tips.
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:40.400]   One pick and one tip.
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:41.640]   I was right at that.
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:45.800]   A good friend of mine, Trish, who's a colorist for DC Comics.
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:48.560]   He's been coloring comics forever.
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:53.320]   Post it a tip on Twitter that you can't get latex or you
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:56.480]   can't get nitrile gloves on Amazon or in stores
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:59.600]   because they're restricted to medical.
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:01.920]   But what you can get are these things, which
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:05.000]   is things that she uses or used to use when she was coloring
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:05.960]   non- digitally.
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:07.320]   These are finger cuts.
[01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:13.760]   These are little just latex or nitrile finger gloves.
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:17.440]   So that if you're in a position where you're picking up
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:20.440]   a pizza and you know you just have to type in something
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:21.560]   on the little touchscreen.
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:22.480]   It's a great idea.
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:24.920]   And you can't get regular gloves.
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:25.720]   And they're cheap.
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:29.200]   You get back like a hundred for basically nothing.
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:31.280]   I think you would look silly having one on each finger.
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:33.160]   But also--
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:35.640]   I can see somebody saying, gee, Andy, those condoms
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:36.600]   are awfully small.
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:37.800]   [LAUGH]
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:38.640]   No, no, no.
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:39.560]   I was avoiding that.
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:40.480]   But that's your finger.
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:42.320]   That's what they are.
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:45.040]   And as with you do have actual real gloves,
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:47.080]   when you take them off, make sure that you don't touch
[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:49.280]   the actual surface that you've contaminated.
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:51.520]   But some people were asking like, where do I get gloves?
[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:52.120]   Where do I get gloves?
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:54.000]   Well, you can't, but maybe this will work.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.840]   The other thing, though, is I've always
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:01.600]   thought that one of the casualties of my job
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:05.720]   is that I will know about a certain feature in Mac OS
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:07.640]   because I wrote about it or I talked about it
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:09.720]   when the OS was updated.
[01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:13.880]   But then that was processed by my learn about something
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:15.440]   that I've explained to other people
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:17.920]   brain as opposed to my Mac user brain.
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:22.680]   And so I was kind of chagrined a few months ago
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:25.480]   to realize that ever since Yosemite,
[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:29.200]   the Finder has had this wonderful batch rename feature.
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:32.320]   Where if you just select a bunch of files,
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:39.080]   I've been downloading like unavailable in the United States
[01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:42.680]   of America, like British TV that I've kind of gotten hooked on.
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:47.080]   And to add it to my Plex server, the beginning of it
[01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:49.600]   has to be what is the name, the official recognized name
[01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:53.240]   of the series, plus like the year it was released.
[01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:56.640]   The last part of it has to be the episode series number
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:58:57.320]   of blah, blah, blah.
[01:58:57.320 --> 01:59:00.320]   So I'll have like 19 of these files have to be modified.
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:04.640]   And all you have to do is just select the files in the batch,
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:11.120]   just go to the file menu or the contextual menu rename.
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:14.240]   You can essentially say do a search and replace
[01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:17.480]   over the text of these names, put something in the front,
[01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:18.920]   put something in the back.
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:21.320]   It's so, so easy that it was one of those.
[01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:22.680]   Oh, that's right.
[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:23.920]   I do remember that.
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:25.360]   OK.
[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:28.040]   I could have been doing that all along for the past two
[01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:31.040]   or three years instead of just for the past two months.
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:33.040]   OK.
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:35.560]   Live and learn or live and relearn.
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:41.760]   You, your finger cut inspired me to mention this thing
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:44.600]   that Micah Sargent talked me into buying.
[01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:49.880]   It's called the hygiene hand antimicrobial brass, EDC door
[01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:51.800]   opener, and stylus.
[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:54.480]   It is-- so how many times have you
[01:59:54.480 --> 02:00:00.360]   had to touch a bacteria laden thing with your hand
[02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:02.680]   and wish you had more sanitizer?
[02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:05.000]   Well, now you have the hygiene hand,
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.560]   which is a brass thing attached to your key chain
[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:13.680]   with which you can punch, hook, or press.
[02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:14.200]   There you go.
[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:14.920]   Look at that.
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:15.440]   Look at that.
[02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:17.800]   Aren't you glad you got the hygiene hand?
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:22.920]   They have, believe it or not, raised $388,000 on Kickstarter.
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:27.320]   They were looking for $5,000, eight days to go.
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:31.280]   And you can even put it on one of those carabiner, squishy things
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:35.360]   so you can just get your hygiene hand out any time you need it.
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:36.920]   I'm going to add that to the list of things
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:39.000]   that would have made someone look absolutely
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.920]   that bit crazy a year ago.
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:41.280]   Like a--
[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:42.840]   But which kind of thing is it?
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:44.880]   What's that URL again?
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:50.880]   Like a bit of Hitler with kickstarter search for hygiene hands.
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:53.160]   Renee Richie, pick of the week.
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:54.880]   So we talked about this in passing before,
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:56.760]   but I just wanted to highlight it.
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:00.560]   So Apple has a bunch of stuff that they've been putting online.
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:02.720]   Traditionally, Apple stores did this big revamp
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:04.160]   where they became all about the community,
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:06.160]   and everything was designed to have people
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:08.480]   in close proximity touching everything.
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:10.000]   And the Apple stores are shut down.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.360]   And unfortunately, that means you can't get today at Apple,
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:13.960]   which are these magnificent classes
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:17.120]   that they teach at almost every Apple retail location that
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:22.880]   includes design and prototyping and development
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:24.440]   and photography and music.
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:26.000]   And they're starting to put those online.
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.720]   So you can go to apple.com/today.
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:32.400]   And there's only a few now, but more and more,
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:36.040]   keep coming and basically take these classes online, which
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:36.840]   is great.
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:39.000]   And they also have sort of a fun PDF up
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.320]   at apple.co/creativityforkids, which
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:44.560]   just walks you through a bunch of different stuff
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:47.000]   that you can do with your kids while they're--
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.080]   while they're staying at home.
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:50.040]   So there's also teacher resources,
[02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:52.440]   and they're putting just a ton of stuff online for people
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:53.600]   over the last month.
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:55.600]   And I've been linking to as much of it as I can.
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:57.520]   But in terms of just--
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:00.240]   they're spending millions on free resources for parents
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:01.360]   and teachers and kids.
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.360]   And if you haven't checked them out already,
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:04.960]   it's well worth your time to go look through them
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:06.520]   and see if any of them are of interest to you.
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:08.640]   So these are people who would be in the stores,
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:09.480]   but they can't be.
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:11.480]   So they're doing it out of their houses.
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:12.040]   Yeah.
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:12.800]   And which is great.
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:14.240]   Better than the late night talk shows.
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:15.080]   Yeah.
[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:15.880]   Yeah.
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:18.160]   Well, Apple has made sure they're better produced.
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:19.560]   I have to say that.
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:20.920]   Yeah.
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:25.880]   I will admit, there's obviously people who are completely
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:29.360]   at home, nothing to do, because their jobs don't exist anymore
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:29.880]   or whatever.
[02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:31.240]   And I certainly feel for them.
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:33.120]   And they are looking for things to do.
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:35.520]   And then there's the spectrum over to the people like us
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:38.760]   who have, if anything, all the same things to do and more.
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:41.320]   And I'm like, but I want to take those classes.
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:42.400]   Well, come, I can't have fun.
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:43.480]   It's really true.
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:44.280]   It's really true.
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:45.480]   I completely agree with you.
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:48.520]   I still have exactly the same duties as I've had before.
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:51.640]   But somehow I feel like I should have more free time
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:54.320]   to do all of these fun things that are being offered.
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:56.920]   I bought a sewing machine, Adam.
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:02:58.600]   And I'm--
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:00.520]   And a sourdough.
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:01.960]   And a sourdough maker.
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:03.720]   And I am making kabucha.
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:04.080]   Half-life.
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:04.760]   Oh, there you go.
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:05.280]   Half-life.
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:06.720]   That's just half-life Alex.
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:11.120]   And I just-- the pressure on me to do leisure time activities.
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:12.480]   You're only one Leo.
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:14.960]   I'm only one of me now.
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:16.760]   We need staff to do our leisure.
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:18.280]   And you're trying to learn cobalt.
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:19.160]   I mean, like--
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:20.080]   When is it going to--
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:21.920]   It'd be useful for me to know cobalt.
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:30.120]   Actually, we just got word from the Sonoma County Health
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:32.800]   Department this morning that starting Friday.
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:36.280]   Everybody in everywhere except at home
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:38.120]   will have to wear masks.
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:40.360]   So it is a mask requirement.
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:42.400]   And all employees in buildings that
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:44.560]   are there as essential employees, which
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:46.800]   includes the handful of people who come in here
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:48.720]   will have to wear masks the whole time.
[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:50.920]   And who has masks?
[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:53.160]   So I thought, well, maybe I could just, like I said,
[02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:55.440]   up a little roadside stand.
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:57.160]   Masks for sale.
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:01.360]   Be nice, a little sideline for me.
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:03.120]   Do you paint a face on them?
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:04.040]   Do they work with face ID?
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:04.680]   That's a good idea.
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:07.440]   I've watched more mask-making videos.
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:10.240]   Some of these videos have 10 million views.
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:12.840]   I guarantee you, they had none until now.
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:16.560]   My entire feed is souffle pancakes, whipped coffee,
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:17.400]   and face masks.
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:17.840]   It's like--
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:18.240]   Lipped coffee.
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:19.280]   Those are the things that--
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:21.360]   That's another thing I got to make.
[02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:23.040]   It's the year of meringue and face masks.
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:25.320]   That's apparently what it is.
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:28.800]   I cannot believe that the Cafe Press type sites of the world
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:31.920]   are not yet spun up to do custom masks.
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:32.640]   I know.
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:33.280]   Well, there are.
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:34.520]   I mean, there are on Etsy.
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:36.280]   I mean, it's been a boon for Etsy sellers.
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:38.760]   Yeah, but no, I mean, the true Cafe Press ones.
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:39.280]   We're literally--
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:39.780]   I know.
[02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:42.800]   I want Twit 15th anniversary Facebook.
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:43.360]   Yes.
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:45.360]   I want all the news you can buy for tippets.
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:46.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.160]   Or a little tag.
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:50.040]   Don't you think that I am of an opinion
[02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:52.000]   that this is going to be the new fashion trend?
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000]   This is how neck ties started.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:57.160]   Instead of neck-- people are going to wear fashion.
[02:04:57.160 --> 02:04:57.640]   Yeah.
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:04:58.720]   It's like the Princess Bride.
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:04:59.720]   They're really very comfortable.
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:00.840]   Everyone's going to look like ninjas.
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:04.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:05.600]   You guys are great.
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:07.920]   I can't imagine any bad weather be quarantined with.
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:08.840]   Congratulations.
[02:05:08.840 --> 02:05:12.200]   30 years, Adam and Tanya, aced.
[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:12.400]   Oh.
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:14.400]   Fantastic.
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:15.920]   So much fun to celebrate with you guys.
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:16.920]   You are such a--
[02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:18.600]   I had my 30th year.
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:20.200]   Oh.
[02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:24.640]   Seriously, what a contributor to the Mac community.
[02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:27.360]   If you love the Mac community, part of the reason
[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:29.400]   you love it is because of this guy right here.
[02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:32.520]   AdamTidbits.com, everybody should give you 20 bucks,
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:34.400]   become a contributor.
[02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:35.240]   It's really worth it.
[02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:36.480]   It's such a great newsletter.
[02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:37.280]   Thank you, Adam.
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:40.000]   It's really nice to see you.
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.360]   Good to see you, too, and at least when I can still
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:44.280]   see your face because I guess next time the boobie
[02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:44.840]   won't mask.
[02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:46.760]   Well, I'll be wearing masks.
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:48.320]   It's like Mortal Kombat characters.
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:50.720]   It's going to be a little weird when we're doing the show.
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:51.320]   I don't know how many--
[02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:53.120]   We're like Cobra.
[02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:55.760]   Do I say right, Bane?
[02:05:55.760 --> 02:05:57.520]   You're full of talk to her.
[02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:58.840]   It's amazing.
[02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:00.920]   And you're not cool.
[02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:02.080]   Thank you for being here.
[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:04.920]   Are you still doing the radio thing, dude?
[02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:07.120]   Yeah, but this is now what you're seeing here
[02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:12.600]   is GPH Studio South, or the best one to be calling the government.
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:15.520]   So that's how I'm doing it for text purposes, I think.
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:21.720]   Yeah, so I'm doing still roughly every Friday from right here.
[02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:24.280]   And oh my god, it's so--
[02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:27.800]   the great thing about doing the radio at the DBGBH
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:31.160]   is that it was the one time that I'm doing essentially this,
[02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:33.240]   but I have to shower, I have to shave,
[02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:34.640]   I have to put on a shirt.
[02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:37.800]   I oftentimes opt to put on a tie just because, hey,
[02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:40.000]   I'm going to be taking the commuter rail into work,
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.440]   just like normal people.
[02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:44.960]   And then-- but now it's back to, yeah, just
[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:46.040]   knowing there's no video.
[02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:51.200]   So just mute the microphone when you're
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:52.520]   biting into the sandwich.
[02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:53.600]   Tony, it's dance.
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:56.280]   Right, pants are overrated.
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:57.000]   Thank you, Andrew.
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.240]   Thank you, Renee, Richie.
[02:06:58.240 --> 02:07:00.680]   Congratulations also.
[02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:02.600]   Here, Adam, is at the end of his career.
[02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:03.720]   You're just beginning.
[02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:05.600]   It's a wonderful thing.
[02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:07.360]   Oh, please, if I could accomplish a thousand
[02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:08.000]   to what he's done--
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.000]   I know.
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:09.760]   I would be proud.
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:12.720]   I just hope I'll be around in 30 years to congratulate you
[02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:13.960]   and your 30th anniversary.
[02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:14.920]   YouTube.com--
[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:17.440]   Well, look, where'd AI will be fully functional?
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:18.960]   How do you know it's not already?
[02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:22.800]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:24.520]   And he's ReneeRitchie on the Twitter,
[02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:26.800]   and it's so great to have you stay warm.
[02:07:26.800 --> 02:07:28.960]   Don't get flooded out.
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:29.400]   Try it.
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:30.920]   Geez.
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:31.440]   Try it.
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:35.080]   We do "Backbreak Weekly" from our sterilized studio,
[02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:36.680]   the beautiful LastPass--
[02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:40.040]   sterile LastPass studios in Petaluma.
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:43.360]   Every Tuesday, we're at 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time,
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:44.520]   1800 UTC.
[02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:46.440]   You could stop by.
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:47.400]   Not the studio.
[02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:48.400]   We've locked that down.
[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:50.480]   But you could certainly watch us live.
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:53.920]   Twit.tv/live, there's audio and video.
[02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:54.920]   Does my nose look funny?
[02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:55.800]   And this mask, mate.
[02:07:55.800 --> 02:07:58.800]   My nose looks fat.
[02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:00.320]   Looks like it's cold there in the studio.
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:01.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:04.040]   And lights are on.

[02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:09.680]   It's just a dart.
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:12.760]   I swear to God, it's just a dart.

[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:50.000]   to making sourdough bread because great time is over.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.520]   [LAUGHTER]
