[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.520]   It is time for Mac Break Weekly and we are gathered weekly.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.040]   I feel very weak actually.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.080]   To talk about the Macintosh, Scott Bourne is in studio with us today
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.440]   in the new Twit Studios.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.240]   >> Hi Leo, I am very honored to be the second guest ever here.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.240]   >> It is really great.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.440]   He is on camera and everything.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.040]   >> That is the bad part but I am here anyway.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.640]   I did bring my hat.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.840]   >> It is really great to see you.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.640]   We are still on a one camera operation.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.240]   As you can see, the lights come in Friday.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.140]   The tricaster is here but it hasn't been hooked up yet.
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.040]   We are getting there though.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.040]   >> It is very exciting.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.040]   It is sort of like day one at the racetrack.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.040]   >> It is kind of.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.840]   >> I invited you because you have been through this.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840]   You know what it looks like when a studio is getting built.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.840]   You won't have any.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.840]   You know, Merlin on their hand would be just devastated.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.840]   >> He would be devastated.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.840]   >> He would be whining about everything.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.840]   >> Merlin man is here.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.840]   >> I want that cobbler.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.840]   >> His new podcast, You Look Nice Today is at You Look Nice Today.com.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840]   >> Hello Leo, how are you?
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.840]   Are you enjoying your new studio?
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.840]   >> I am.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.840]   I can't wait to get you guys up here.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.840]   Hey, we are having falafel in an hour.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.840]   >> For me and Leo are anyway.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.840]   >> Free falafel.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   Wait a minute, Scott.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.640]   I didn't give you your special chocolate.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.640]   >> My special chocolate?
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.640]   >> Oh, there is special chocolate.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.640]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.640]   Somebody opened it.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.640]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.640]   >> It is very special chocolate.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.640]   >> This is unopened.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.640]   This is TCHO.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.640]   You know who is -- this is Lewis Roseto, the guy who found a wire magazine is now making chocolate.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.640]   He just said it is some chocolate.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.640]   So you see you get chocolate when you come up.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.640]   >> I am very honored.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.640]   >> Thank you.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.640]   >> Leo, just make sure you are kind of near a bathroom after you eat that.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.640]   I have heard about most special chocolate.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.640]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.640]   >> What is this?
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640]   That is how it is made.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.640]   >> It is Belgian, it means quality.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.640]   It means premium.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.640]   >> Oh, good.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.640]   It means perishable.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.640]   So eat them really quickly.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.640]   >> I think that is from the library.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.640]   >> That is Andy and Akka broadcasting from his garden.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.640]   >> From the fabulous mom's place, in suburban Boston, when he went in,
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.640]   he was in the house in the middle of the house.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.640]   >> You know, I think you are in the house.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.640]   >> In the house, you are in the house.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.640]   >> My mom is in the house.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.640]   >> You always win and the food is hot.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.640]   >> I am sorry they are not here, Alex.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.640]   >> He is really not here.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.640]   >> He is pouting.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.640]   >> I look chocolate.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.640]   >> Maybe he wants chocolate.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.640]   >> I have been asked to read a short statement from Alex.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.640]   [ Laughter ]
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.640]   >> In protest of the treatment of Native Americans in 1971,
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.640]   and the treatment of Marlon Brando's refusal of the Academy Award.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.640]   >> You know what turned 10 yesterday?
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.640]   The iMac.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.640]   >> And you know who didn't write about the iMac when it first came out?
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.640]   Macful magazine.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   They got to blew it off.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.640]   >> You kidding?
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.640]   It is funny how much coverage it gets now compared to how much they do.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   >> They thought it was not going to be a big deal.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   >> Well, I am just going to pick on them.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.640]   Nobody.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.640]   I should be more accurate.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.640]   It was not, you know, it was people were like, ah, it is kind of a gimmick.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.640]   There is all this stuff in one box.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.640]   It will never work.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.640]   >> Be fair.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.640]   This was like after the dark ages of the 90s when Apple was coming out
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.640]   with like a new computer every three weeks.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.640]   They would have a brand new product number.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.640]   You can try to find out what the difference is.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.640]   >> Well, the difference is that the, the, the, the Pro4-620A is at a rage box.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.640]   The Pro4-625C is at a metallic gray box.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.640]   >> Well, there was no question this was a different computer.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.640]   It was in Bondi Blue, remember?
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.640]   >> Yes.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.640]   >> It was all in one.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.640]   A 233 megahertz G3.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.640]   >> Hey, whopping 32 megabytes of RAM.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.640]   >> And who would ever need more?
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.640]   >> Well, you could go up to 128.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   >> Wow.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.640]   >> But the most significant feature was what they left out.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.640]   People were, as I recall, when it was introduced, we were all in the journalism trade so excited about it.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.640]   It took us a full 24 hours to realize, oh wait, it doesn't have a floppy drive.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.640]   >> No floppy.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.640]   That was the first major computer not to have a floppy.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.640]   And everybody said, well, how do you get your data into it?
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.640]   It had USB ports, two of them.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.640]   Had a CD, a ROM, but not a burner.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.640]   Had an ERDA port.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.640]   Remember infrared?
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.640]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.640]   >> But I remember, because Tech TV had just launched in May.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.640]   This came out in August of, you know, it was announced in May.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.640]   We launched Tech TV May 11th.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.640]   So we were looking for a gimmick.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.640]   And so the iMac, you know, even the name was kind of a gimmick.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.640]   And I remember we found a bunch of things.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.640]   We found an iVacuum.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.640]   It was Bondi Blue.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.640]   It looked exactly like the iMac.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.640]   We found a bunch of home appliances.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.640]   If you looked at them, it looked like Apple had been paying attention and said, hmm, we
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.640]   like that little handheld vacuum.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.640]   Let's make a computer that looks like that.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.640]   And we had a whole thing under the table.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.640]   I remember Cape Hotel arranging it.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.640]   But it was a big deal for us because, hey, we were in a new channel.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.640]   We didn't have anything else to talk about.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.640]   >> I don't think the press gave it much coverage back then, but they sure have paid
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.640]   more attention now.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.640]   The new ones are, I have one in the brand new 20,000.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.640]   >> Oh, those new iMacs are beautiful.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.640]   >> I got to tell you, it's a speed demon.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.640]   >> Is it really?
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.640]   >> It is.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.640]   It doesn't compete with my super duper mac pro, but darn close for a computer that's
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.640]   sometimes relegated to somebody thinking it's not a serious computer.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.640]   And the 24 inch screen, come on, it's gorgeous.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.640]   >> You're reviewing one now, Andy.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   >> I actually bought one for my own self.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.640]   >> Wait a minute, you paid for a computer?
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.640]   >> Yeah, well, you know, I get so many loners from so many people and they come in and
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.640]   out of the office so fast that it takes a while to my real life because I haven't actually
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.640]   bought a desktop Mac in like four years.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.640]   >> What?
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.640]   >> And I thought maybe I should own one of these quote intel acts, unquote, that I've
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.640]   been reading so much.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.640]   >> Loners are designed to break your heart, though.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.640]   It's like a bad relationship, you know?
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.640]   I mean, they come and they go and you know, you just start getting attached to them and
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.640]   you got to ship them back.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.640]   >> I'm the sonatra of PC ownership.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.640]   They come and they go and that's just the way I like it, baby.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.640]   >> Yeah, baby.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.640]   See ya.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.640]   >> That's my first love, just my latest love, man.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.640]   >> Ring a ding ding.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.640]   So how does it feel to actually own one?
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.640]   >> Ah, it feels -- I feel drunk with power, Leo.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.640]   Usually because it's all like having foster kids where you can't tattoo or pierce them.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.640]   Because you're sending them back to their original owners at some point.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.640]   >> So you're going to tattoo your Mac?
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.640]   >> Well, I've had a customization idea for this latest revision iMac since they came
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.640]   with a new case design.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.640]   And I'm happy to say I have the materials for it.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.640]   It's going to be a simple mod.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.640]   I will take pictures when it's done and you will agree that it is the most fascinating
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.640]   and wonderful thing.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.640]   You will say, my God, I have not seen perfection until I saw this picture.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.640]   The flash is off.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.640]   >> Wow.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.640]   >> But is -- I test fitted the materials yesterday, like an hour after I unbox the iMac.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.640]   Just to make sure --
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.640]   >> You test fitted the materials?
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.640]   >> I test fitted the materials.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.640]   >> I don't even know what -- what could you be doing?
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.640]   >> Wow.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.640]   >> All right.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.640]   So we're going to see a picture of that on Flickr.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.640]   >> You're going to see a picture of this on Flickr.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.640]   I'll Twitter about it.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.640]   I'll put it on my blog.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.640]   You'll find out about it.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.640]   You will be duly impressed.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.640]   You will want to buy another iMac just to do the same sort of custom -- simple, but straightforward,
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.640]   but brilliant customization that I'm going to do on mine.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.640]   >> I want to do that.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.640]   I don't know what it is and I want to do it.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.640]   >> It sounds exciting.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.640]   >> It's a big picture of Leo Laport being spanked.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.640]   >> Ah!
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.640]   I knew it.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.640]   >> Again.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.640]   >> Again.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.640]   >> What else could we talk about?
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.640]   I don't know what else there is to say.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.640]   Another Mac clone maker spotted on eBay.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.640]   Not as big a deal as SciStar.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.640]   By the way, some of the SciStar computers are out now, I think.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.640]   People have been playing with it.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.640]   >> Do they actually work?
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.640]   >> Yeah, they seem to work.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.640]   That's Alex Lindsey breaking up.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.640]   >> Am I still working?
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.640]   >> You got the silon now.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.640]   >> You were just mini-silon before.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.640]   >> Am I -- am I serious?
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.640]   >> Serious silon.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.640]   >> Serious silon.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.640]   >> Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.640]   >> You got your Skyping.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.640]   I can't believe it's you.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.640]   >> There it is.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.640]   >> He's the one with the T1 line.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.640]   >> Meanwhile, Andy, who's on an ACES EPC on the back yard, that bird is crystal clear.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.640]   >> I've got the cheapest hardware of anyone, you guys.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.640]   And you can hear birds singing outside.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.640]   >> Isn't it always that way?
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.640]   >> You can hear photosynthesis happening in the trees behind.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.640]   >> That little crackle of chlorophyll just running through the veins.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.640]   >> Am I still racking?
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.640]   >> Yeah, you're going to also get this weird echo effect too.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.640]   It's really nice.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.640]   >> Today, today.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.640]   >> I consider myself so.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.640]   >> I'll give you a podcast through your test, through your test.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.640]   >> Well, what do we want to do?
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.640]   >> Alex?
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.640]   >> I -- if I'm -- yeah, I probably should just drop out of my hand.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.640]   >> Do you know what -- do you have any thought about what might be wrong?
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.640]   >> You're not watching Stikum, are you, or something?
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.640]   >> I'm watching you.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.640]   >> I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm directly to a thing.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.640]   >> Wait till you hear this.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   >> When do you download this in here?
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.640]   It's really a cool effect.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.640]   >> I found out that the problem with my system was that I was plugged into the wrong USB port.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.640]   >> Okay.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.640]   >> I saw that.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:18.640]   >> Tell us what that was, Annie, because you got some emails about that.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.640]   >> I got a email that -- this is something that I didn't know about the MacBook, that
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.640]   there are two USB ports on the left-hand side.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.640]   One is closer to the keyboard, one is closer to the screen.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:33.640]   The one that's closer to the screen, the back one, is actually on a USB hub that is shared
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.640]   with every other internal device on that machine.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.640]   >> Am I -- am I -- do I sound better now?
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.640]   >> Yes.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.640]   >> That's the USB hub.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.640]   And I suddenly realized when Andy said that that's the one time I've ever plugged it into
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.640]   that one side.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.640]   >> So plug it into the one nearest to -- the Mac for the MacBook Pro.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.640]   >> The one on the -- no, it's not the same for me because I have a MacBook Pro.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.640]   It's the one on -- and it is the one on the -- the one on the left is good, the one on
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:02.640]   the right is bad, and I have superstitiously been plugging it into the left because it worked
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.640]   over and over and over again, and I happened to just sit down and plug it into the right
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.640]   one.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.640]   >> Right.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.640]   >> So superstition --
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.640]   >> One of them is not on a hub, one is on a hub.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.640]   Not only that, but the one that is not on a hub also has more power, so you might find
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.640]   that some devices will not charge off of one port, but it will charge off of the other
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.640]   one.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.640]   >> I felt 1.2 grams less dumb when I --
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.640]   >> I had never heard that.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.640]   >> I couldn't believe I didn't know about that.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.640]   >> Yeah, it's been around on the MacBook Pro that way for a while.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.640]   >> Oh, it's odd.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.640]   My superstition actually started with Scott because Scott mentioned it, and then I was like,
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.640]   "Oh, I'm crazy, but I'm going to start plugging into the left," and sure enough, Scott was
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.640]   right.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.640]   >> So Scott knew this.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.640]   >> Scott knew this.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.640]   >> This should be for me.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.640]   >> Trial and error.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.640]   >> Wow.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.640]   >> We were having trouble getting good signal out of the right port.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:55.640]   >> I had a problem with my USB ports in a self-powered USB drive that when I used a long cable, it
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.640]   didn't work, and when I used a short cable, it did work.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.640]   So there's a little voodoo in all of this, isn't it?
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.640]   >> You know, Andy, somebody, Andy or Merlin, someone smarter and wittier than me, needs
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.000]   to come up for a better acronym for what USB really stands for.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.240]   >> You suck big time.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.040]   >> But something like that.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.040]   Or maybe not.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.040]   I don't know.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.640]   Merlin, what are you doing these days?
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.640]   There's really nothing.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.640]   There's no news.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.640]   Apple didn't announce nothing.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.640]   They had their quarterly report last year.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.640]   >> Well, we got WWDC coming up.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.640]   >> Okay.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.040]   >> And Apple is so busy preparing for it that you can't hardly even get a meeting down.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.520]   >> Maybe that's why it's very quiet.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.520]   >> That's why it's very quiet.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.840]   That's going to be the, that's going to June, it's June what?
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.040]   June 1st weekend and June 1st week?
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.400]   >> 1st week, 1st week of June.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.800]   >> That's going to be where they announced the 3G iPhone.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.800]   >> Yep.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.440]   >> That's where they roll out the iPhone store.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.440]   >> Yep.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.040]   >> So you can buy, you know, software on the iPhone.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.440]   >> 2.0, software comes then.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.600]   >> That's when 2.0 comes.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.200]   So yeah, you know, it's probably pretty busy in Cooper Tatum right now.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.720]   >> Well, I was at the mothership last week, and I will put it to you like this.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.800]   This is a very odd thing I observed.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.120]   I was going to lunch with some of the guys from the aperture team, and I noticed that
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.120]   everybody was like race walking.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.120]   >> Oh wow.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.120]   They don't want to race.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.320]   >> And I said, I mean, everybody, not just four people.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.280]   The whole company was race walking.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.280]   >> Wow.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.400]   >> And I said, so which, they have this huge cafeteria with all this different kind of
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.400]   food you can eat.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.640]   And I said, well, which place do you guys go?
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.480]   They go, whichever the shortest line is.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.680]   And I'm kind of, is there some urgency here at the company that I should notice?
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.180]   I mean, wow.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.480]   And they don't like to be seen sitting down.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.360]   I think the bottom line is they are really into like working on stuff and they move fast
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.360]   and they're busy.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.280]   >> CK5 came out yesterday.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.200]   So they're, I mean, that's five iterations of the software development kit over the last
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   two months.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.200]   So they're really banging that thing.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.280]   >> I think what's going on there is they're just really busy.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.280]   Aperture 2.1 is busy.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.280]   Lots of stuff going on.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.360]   They're building, you know, they're building alliances with plugging companies.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.520]   There's just a lot going on and maybe they're too busy to make noise.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.520]   >> Could be.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.520]   >> I mean, could be.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.400]   >> I never seen an area where people seem to be so just really into it.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.320]   I mean, they were just, like I say, race walking.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.880]   I couldn't keep up with them.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.880]   >> I think that's great.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.080]   It was very, it was an interesting cultural experience.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.120]   By the way, I got to go to the special Apple store.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.120]   >> Special room?
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.120]   >> The special Apple store.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.120]   >> I mean the special Apple store.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:18.880]   >> The one, the employee store, the one there at one, one, one, one, infinity loop.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.360]   And you can buy things that you can't buy.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.360]   >> Anybody can go there.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.360]   >> Yeah, I know.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.680]   But you can't buy the stuff there.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.680]   >> Oh, really?
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.680]   >> And any other app, the clothing.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.680]   >> Oh, the clothing.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.680]   >> Like in cool stuff.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.080]   >> I went with Alex a couple of events ago.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.800]   And he looks at the labels of all the clothing because he says, he says, Steve's very careful
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.440]   about picking the best clothes.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.160]   So I just buy the same for our pixel court shirts.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.920]   >> Yeah, I'll go ahead and drop off.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.640]   I got to go in four minutes anyway, so I'm just going to drop off.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.640]   Is that cool?
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.640]   >> Yeah, Merlin, we're going to miss you.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.640]   How's the baby?
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.640]   >> Awesome.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.640]   >> How's the podcast going?
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.520]   You and Scott Simpson and Lonely Sandwich.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.440]   >> Yeah, no, that's very fun.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.440]   I apologize.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.000]   Are we on for, is it 11 next week?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.240]   >> Yeah, I'm going to move it to 11.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.240]   Is that work for everybody?
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.240]   >> Fantastic.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.240]   >> A little easier for everyone.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.240]   >> I'll bring it just, you know.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.240]   >> Oh, and justine will be here.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.240]   So I better save some chocolate.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.120]   >> Okay, I'll see you ladies later.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.120]   >> Thank you, girls.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.120]   Well, I don't know what that was all about.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.240]   All right, Merlin's bailing.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.080]   This is going to be the worst show ever.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.680]   >> I'm really glad I came up for this, Leo.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.040]   I feel like what I wanted you to come up with is to play with this.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.040]   >> I understand.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.040]   >> You're going to play with a tri-cat.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.960]   >> I should explain what I'm pointing at.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.040]   >> And by the way, that hat on your lap looks like you're hiding something.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.040]   Could you put it somewhere else?
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.120]   It looks like Scott's not used to video.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.800]   He's got a hat in his lap.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.480]   >> I'm a radio guy.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.880]   I have a face built for radio.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.880]   >> No, you look good.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.280]   Except for the hat in his lap.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.280]   He looked like kind of maybe there's something going on.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.680]   You were going to look excited about aperture.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.680]   >> I was.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.680]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:51.920]   >> Okay, we're going to see a new iPod announcement anytime soon?
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.720]   >> I don't know.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.560]   I'm just waiting for the iPhone announcement.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.720]   >> I think it's all about the iPhone.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.000]   >> I don't think they're going to do an iPod on the heels of the iPhone.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.840]   The iPhone would -- they want to keep all the thunder for the iPhone.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.200]   >> The question is, we see the usual Mac Pro kind of announcement.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   We sometimes do it.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.000]   >> At WWDC, because it's the developers' conference and that's what developers care about.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   What would they do though?
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   They just did the --
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.880]   >> Well, they just did the iMac update.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.480]   So we know we're going to see that.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:22.200]   We could see a Mac Book Pro because it's long on the tooth in terms of a real update.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   >> I'm not just talking about the --
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.840]   >> They've had these little slipstream upgrades.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.640]   >> In fact, the last one actually benchmarks a little slower on this.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.640]   >> Does it really?
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:36.840]   >> You can see them speed up the chips on the slight upgrade to the Mac Pro and possibly
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.480]   some faster bus speeds.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.920]   >> They're already using Intel's kind of latest chips, so I don't know how much more
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.920]   they could go.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.920]   >> Maybe they could do something revolutionary with regard to the Cinebit display.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.440]   >> I want to see Blu-Ray.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.480]   I think it's time for Apple to put a Blu-Ray burner in their machines.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.240]   They're now -- the prices on standalone Blu-rays are now a couple hundred bucks.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.880]   Blanks are still pretty pricey, fifteen bucks.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:02.120]   But that's -- I mean, look, when they put DVD burners in, that was how expensive it
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.120]   was.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.960]   When they put your first CD burners in, you saw that on that iMac.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.960]   They didn't have a burner.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.960]   >> So --
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.120]   >> I'm just -- I'm over plastic.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.960]   >> You're over plastic.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.960]   I rented an HD movie --
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.960]   >> I don't want to burn anything anymore.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:21.080]   >> I rented an HD movie on iTunes last night.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.240]   The Wes Anderson movie, which wasn't very good.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.240]   >> Well, it --
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.680]   >> The Dargealing Limited.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.680]   >> Oh, okay.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.600]   But it wasn't really -- those aren't high-def, are they, Alex?
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.280]   I mean, it didn't look like a Blu-ray movie.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.280]   Let's put it that way.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:42.600]   >> No, I mean, well, even if they have the same "resolution," everything's heavily compressed.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.320]   But everything's compressed to some degree.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.560]   I mean, my problem is I went to look at a Blu-ray at the Virgin Megastore across the street,
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.040]   and I still saw all the little blocks.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.000]   And so, Alex sees the little blocks, then forget about it.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   >> What?
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   >> If you see the little blocks --
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.240]   >> You see the little blocks and things that I don't, then I start to see them, and it
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.240]   ruins my --
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.240]   >> Don't let them tell you.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.240]   Do you see that?
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.240]   It ruins my view of my experience.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.240]   >> Oh, did you see that?
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.240]   No, I didn't see it.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.240]   I don't want to see it, and don't tell me about it.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.240]   It's not there.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.240]   I don't know about it.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.680]   I used to be completely ignorant of that stuff, and now you see it, and I can't enjoy
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.680]   anything.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.240]   >> Well, the thing is, the only time I've ever watched HD -- I mean, the only time I
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:20.120]   watch -- and I think the problem is that we shoot HD, and we see what crystal clear HD
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.960]   looks like uncompressed a lot.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.320]   >> Yeah, you're the only people who see it, though, because you're the only people who
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.320]   could play it.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.320]   >> Right.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.520]   So we see this stuff, and then when you look at what they're broadcasting, and --
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.520]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.520]   Yuck.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.360]   So to me, I might as well just have a DVD.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.360]   I mean, you know, it's fine.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.000]   I mean, it's not that high resolution.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.800]   >> Well, for those of us who don't have, you know, four, four, four cameras in our
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:50.600]   bathrooms, the -- I think the HD quality, while it's clearly not HD, and by the way,
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.240]   neither is Comcast or anything else, it's certainly very good.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.240]   >> It's okay.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.240]   >> Yeah, it's great.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.240]   >> I would say this --
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.240]   >> I don't think it'd be any better than that.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.240]   >> The regular expectations.
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.680]   >> Well, if you're watching Blu-rays, though, I think it's significantly different.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:08.240]   >> But, I mean, in terms of the iTunes store buying movies for Apple TV, which is what
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.760]   I'm doing, I will say that I'm not happy with the quality of the non-HD.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.360]   I see lots of those artifacts in the regular ones.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.400]   >> And they do that because they're fast to download, right?
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.240]   I mean, they want you to be able to start them up right away.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.480]   >> So I won't rent the ones that aren't -- the only thing I'll rent on my Apple TV is HD.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.480]   And it's fine for me.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.920]   And I have to say, I'm just -- I am not going to get into buying Blu-rays just because my
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.320]   whole thing is that it's a disc that costs about the same amount of money as the DVD,
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:41.040]   and it just -- there's something about it fundamentally wrong to charge three times
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.640]   as much for the -- it's the same content that was created used.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.600]   >> Oh, so you're saying they're just overpriced?
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.600]   >> It's just way overpriced.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.400]   I'm not going down that path.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.200]   You know, they look so good.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.200]   >> I've just had sort of an experience in the past couple of months that sort of reminded
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.280]   me that the format doesn't -- I don't care so much about the format.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.960]   I don't even care so much about the definition.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.640]   It really is all about the content.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.880]   I had a video store open, like within a couple of miles from my place, that a big part of
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.520]   their business is they buy in bulk used DVDs from Netflix.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.120]   So you just get the raw disc, but just big, big hoppers full of just discs and plastic
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.400]   envelopes that were just $3, $4 each.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.920]   And you just -- you think through them, you --
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.920]   >> Wow.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.920]   That's a great deal.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.600]   >> Last week, I wound up buying the entire like second season of "Churama."
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.960]   I managed to find all four discs.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.960]   >> Of what?
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.960]   >> I got for $10.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.960]   >> Compared to $30 or $40.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.040]   >> We've got a little break up of what was it about the season of what?
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:34.800]   >> The entire second season, the four discs set season two of "Futurama" for like $10.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.760]   I got season five of the Shield the exact same way.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:43.280]   For $3.99, I'm willing to buy it as a piece of software that I then rip and then don't
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.840]   care about the DVD anymore.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.720]   It makes me more adventurous, it makes me more interested.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.160]   I don't actually own a Blu-ray player at my house yet because I'd love to have the Blu-ray.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.840]   I've had them on loan for a couple of weeks and I've had some samples, but --
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.840]   >> They look good.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.840]   >> They look great, just about interested in spending that kind of money for a movie that
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.240]   they're very few movies that I'm willing to spend that much money to own.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.720]   I think that's the failure point of retail movies now.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.000]   >> The truth is, there are so many things to watch.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.680]   I don't really watch movies over and over again.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.760]   We had this conversation before you do, Scott.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.640]   >> Yeah, I watch them a couple times, I realize.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:21.840]   I'm wondering if Apple wouldn't be smart to put the Blu-ray players in the computers
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:28.360]   as some sort of mea culpa to the movie studio saying, "Hey, you're worried about the revenue
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.120]   you might lose when you put stuff on our iTunes store.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.120]   How about this?
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.560]   We'll put the Blu-ray players in there which might induce more people to buy your Blu-ray
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.560]   content."
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.160]   >> For no other reason than that.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.000]   >> Wouldn't you, and let me ask Alex, both of you guys do a lot of content.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.120]   Wouldn't you like a Blu-ray burner as a data disc?
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.120]   What is it, 58 gigs?
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.520]   >> We've already got one in the studio.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.520]   >> It's nice, isn't it?
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.800]   >> I mean, I'm just -- it's not enough for you, Alex.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.320]   >> I don't want to sort through this stuff, but the 50 gigs is nothing.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.080]   I mean, 30 gigs for me is -- that's --
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.840]   >> It's true, a hard drive isn't that expensive.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.760]   A 500 gig hard drive is not that expensive.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.840]   >> Yeah, but the thing is, you can't park a hard drive on the shelf for two years without
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.800]   spinning it up and expected to be viable.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   >> Right.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.440]   >> Well, we're actually testing two different things right now.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.440]   We have the Drobo that we're kind of Drobo in a lot of stuff right now, and then the second
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.560]   thing which is a much bigger solution, not something that most of our listeners are going
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.720]   to use, is the Matrix Store, which is -- this is -- the Matrix Store is basically three-rayed
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.720]   fives with where the --
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.720]   >> Here we go.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:28.080]   >> The content is actually mirrored on two of the different great hot --
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.800]   >> You know, I got criticism for being elitist because I talked about wine and cheese.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.400]   >> And this guy's talking about how much is that going to cost?
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.680]   >> We're testing it right now.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.680]   But it would be about $40,000 or $50,000.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:44.760]   So he asked me if I -- he goes, "We've got spec opsin from the Navy Seals with this special
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.760]   million-dollar hard drive.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.240]   You want to come look at it?"
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.240]   I'm looking at $50,000.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.480]   >> I love these covers that we have on this podcast.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.240]   We started to talk about 15 grand, 20 grand.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.960]   We charge you like $80 for each of these podcasts.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.720]   That sort of market that our audience is in right now.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:07.560]   >> So the thing is, on one side, though, with the Drobo is $500, and it's actually --
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.200]   >> With no discs, I might add.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.200]   >> No discs.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.640]   >> But you put in -- I'm putting --
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.560]   >> I'm putting 400, 500, so you get two terabytes.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.600]   And it's not rate five, but it's like rate five.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.600]   It has redundancy.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.600]   It's hot, swab, blah, blah.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.600]   >> It is.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.600]   >> I'm slowly putting all my personal stuff I'm putting on.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.600]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.600]   I use it.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.600]   >> I'm going to have a Drobo one.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.600]   >> I have one.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.600]   >> I have one.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.600]   >> We're drobatizing everything.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.600]   >> That's what he said on this.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.880]   >> Well, actually, let's go around.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.480]   I think that we are an all Drobo podcast, because I have one too.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.600]   I think it's great.
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.360]   I think it's better than rate five, because it's not as itchy as rate five.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.800]   You just plug it in, and it works.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.840]   >> And you don't have to migrate your data if it fails, Andy.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.040]   >> Oh, you just plug in another drive.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.200]   >> You'd have to migrate all your data off a RAID 5 system somewhere else, fix the drive,
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.200]   migrate it back.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.200]   That would take a long time.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.200]   We've tested this thing.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.200]   >> I've done it.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.200]   >> Well, right in front of Alex, I just yanked one of the drives off the other side.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.200]   >> With a hand.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.200]   >> He had a connection.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.200]   >> He had a connection.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.200]   >> It's pretty cool.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.560]   So can you do that with your $50,000 high-fives, sci-fi?
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.880]   >> Actually, if a drive, the way this thing sets, the way the matrix store works is if
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.720]   a drive fails on one of the RAID, it actually takes the data.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:18.520]   >> Neo comes over on another RAID automatically, so you don't really know about it.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.480]   It's not something for a typical user, but for a production facility.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.480]   >> You think?
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.000]   >> But for a production facility, this is like--
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.640]   >> It's only 71 Alexes.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.360]   >> It's a lot of Alexes, but as said, it's not-- when you look at the other solutions
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.200]   in the same market, it's a lot cheaper.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:42.840]   >> We put four Western digital-- one-terabyte-sized drives in the Drobo, which gives us three terabytes
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.120]   of protected data.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.120]   >> You can get terabyte drives?
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.120]   >> Wow.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.120]   >> Under 250 bucks on Amazon.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.120]   >> 250 data.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.320]   >> So I spent a thousand bucks to go in the $500 thing.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.800]   So I got a $1,500 solution.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:58.080]   It gives me three terabytes of protected data, and it just shows up as a giant hard disk.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:02.720]   >> But so even though you only have four terabyte drives, you only get three terabytes protected
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.720]   because of the redundancy.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.720]   >> Because of the redundancy.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.360]   >> But you can swap any of those drives out, and you're cool.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:13.920]   >> The rule of thumb on the Drobo is it's the entire sum total of all the storage you have
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.120]   in the box minus the largest drive you have in there.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.040]   So it would be one terabyte drives, minus one terabyte would be three.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.560]   >> Oh, cool.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.720]   >> And it really worked.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.880]   >> I have to say, initially I was underwhelmed by the Drobo because of its initial cost,
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.640]   500 bucks is a lot.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.760]   And because it's kind of pseudo rate five, but you're right.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.960]   I think it's less finicky.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.320]   I mean, it's the same.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.320]   It's impacted the same.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.000]   >> There's a hundred thousand dollars worth of technology in that five hundred dollars.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   >> Is it really?
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.640]   >> I think that's what people don't know.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.800]   >> They aren't involved in that.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.760]   >> What I want to see is a bigger one, like a bigger Drobo that held like 12 drives.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:54.040]   >> You got to get, you got to get.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.240]   >> You want to be the size of a small refrigerator.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:02.680]   >> You got to get, I have a hundred, I have a, we have 140 raw drives with data, like,
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.400]   in one office right now, like 500 gig drives.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:09.880]   We've got 70 terabytes that are just in little raw drives in their little static packs because
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.520]   we don't have anywhere else to put them.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.960]   And we're looking for how do we solve this problem because this is not sustainable.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.720]   >> Now they have a network attached device to attach to it so it can make it ethernet
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.720]   instead of USB, right?
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.720]   >> And we're just testing that.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.720]   We haven't tried it yet.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.720]   >> And they're going to, are they going to do fire wire?
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.360]   They have not said publicly that they're going to do that.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.440]   >> I do have the Drobo share.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.640]   It does work really well.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.320]   >> That's the network attached to everything.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.320]   >> That's the network attached drive.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.320]   >> So what is it?
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.320]   >> Just a plug in that knows on it.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.160]   >> It's a USB to plug the USB from the Drobo into the Drobo share.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:48.960]   The Drobo share is ethernet so you can plug it into your network hub, excuse me, your
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.760]   network bridge and then it's just there and it just works.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.440]   The natural, I mean the natural evolution for the Drobo is to have that networking built
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:01.560]   in for super double plus bonus points would be for it to have 8 out to 11 and networking
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.560]   built in.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.560]   So it's just a box.
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.080]   You just plug in anywhere that's convenient.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.800]   And then magically every windows and Mac in your house can just have this access to these
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.800]   terabytes.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.960]   >> Is the Drobo share gig a bit or a hundred megabit?
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.000]   >> I have to check.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   I believe it's irrelevant because the USB connection can't keep up with giga.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   >> Of course.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   >> Right.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   >> Of course.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.800]   >> The kill seal of the Drobo has been at speed and that's why a lot of people dismiss
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.800]   it.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.240]   Some for good reason because they need enterprise level performance.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:34.960]   But I mean I'm in any room you got to have someone in that room with bionic parts to
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.480]   beat me at being the biggest geek in the room.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:41.480]   And even I think that this Drobo is perfectly adequate for most of my mass storage.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.720]   Well for instance here's a real workflow.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.080]   I'm using it for my aperture vault.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.680]   Now my aperture vault is an incremental backup.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.880]   It only works on whatever changes I made to aperture since I opened the program.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.880]   That can work in the background which this does.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.040]   It doesn't need to be speedy.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.920]   I'm not using it as a primary drive.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.320]   So I don't care that it's USB.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.600]   I wouldn't use it for aperture as a primary drive because I have lots of big files.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.680]   I'm getting a camera that makes, it's got a 21 megapixel sensor.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.360]   That's not going to work.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.080]   That means every picture is turning on megapixels.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.480]   No 21 megabytes I should say.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:21.920]   And so the thing is but as a vault drive for my aperture library it's perfect.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:27.360]   I have three terabytes and it's kind of really cool because normally if I just bought, let's
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:32.840]   say I just could buy a three terabyte drive and that was my vault I would have one backup
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.040]   of my aperture library.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:40.000]   But since this is protected storage I kind of have two on one box because if anything
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.880]   fails I can just swap it back and I still have a good vault.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.360]   You have one Drobo but it's like having redundancy.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.160]   It's like having redundancy for my redundancy.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.240]   Well I think you guys all love the Drobo.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.400]   Well for 500 bucks when it does if you really stop and look at it because I hear people
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.400]   say I'm Twitter.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   That's what stopped me.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.400]   They'll say well it is.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.400]   It's a rat.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.480]   You're paying 500 for a rat.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.760]   I sat and talked with the CEO who he explained to me how this works.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.400]   He explained to me how the same technology goes into systems that cost a lot more money
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.400]   two years ago.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.560]   It's kind of funny if you make it too easy and too simple.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.080]   People don't, they don't appreciate it.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.080]   Right.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.120]   The biggest explanation of why I love it is I actually have a milk crate in my office
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.920]   that is filled with nothing but old hard drives because you know years ago I bought
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.360]   a hundred gig and I filled it up so I retired that one bought a 250 gig.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.400]   Filled that one up, retired that bought a 500 gig.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.800]   The buck stops exactly there.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.440]   It is a $500 empty box.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.640]   That means that that will be your hard drive for the foreseeable future until not until
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.520]   the end of time because you know molecules tend to decay.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:44.640]   But it means that for the rest of you know mind storage needs I'm just going to be buying
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.040]   you know which replacing 250 gig drives with 500 with one terabyte with two terabyte with
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.960]   four terabyte drives as they become available because supposedly this will continue working
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.200]   as larger drive mechanism capacities become available.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.560]   That's the reason why I love it.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.000]   And as it happens I will never have to just copy everything from the old drive to the new
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   drive.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.760]   Yeah mine mine mine's running mine ran low at space so I put a 500 replaced one of those
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.760]   little ones I think a hundred hundred sixty in there with a 500.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.560]   Now it's running low again I have another one but I don't know they're a terabyte so
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:16.040]   it's great it keeps up with the technology and they tell me that they've talked with
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.840]   a lot of the drive companies that are in fact making four terabyte drives are going to be
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.680]   available in the next six months.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.760]   So that could be a 16 minus four so be a 12 terabyte protected Wow.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.760]   Wow.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:34.320]   Yeah and then we'll be came so for a bit at 1 or 4 am on all the rest of it became to
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.480]   that book at an expense and rate.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.120]   Shall we play a game?
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.360]   Yeah this is good this is what's bad like all the Twitters we all have Drobo's and then
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.960]   we'll all be asleep one day and then we'll wake up and be taken over.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.440]   We were you know in fact we were twittering back and forth with Stu Mashowitz over at
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.640]   the orphanage and he has a Drobo for his personal stuff and we were trying to come up
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.240]   with a name a word for how you feel when everything is on the Drobo and you know that
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:02.080]   it's backed up and everything is good and we decided it's droovy.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:08.040]   Now I don't use what is it time machine to back up to the Drobo I just use like Chronosync
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.040]   with it right.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.040]   Do you use time machine with it?
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.480]   I use good old fashioned Apple backup.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.960]   You know the .Mac backup program.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.320]   Well I don't think about like about Chronosync it's just automatically.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:20.400]   Well we're going to try that because I found out that you like it but the thing is then
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.440]   you see those files unlike backup those files are there and you can tell them.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.480]   The Drobo people don't sell backup software.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.360]   I like that for the actually.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.360]   I think that's good.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.520]   And by the way this works perfectly good on a Windows machine too.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.680]   You just get this thing in format however you want there are no drivers to install and
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.760]   then you use any backup program you want.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.400]   I know Andy like Super Dooper are you using that with Drobo?
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.080]   Yeah it's still my favorite ongoing solution.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.720]   Actually I use Super Dooper and backup.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.600]   I think that's one of the best benefits of .Mac it's a great little program it works
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:58.200]   so simply that's what I used to backup all of my change data overnight to .Mac every
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.200]   single night.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:04.160]   Well we didn't I didn't mean to get a Drobo discussion but I think I was really interested.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.160]   There's nothing else.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.960]   We do have some questions one of the things that's good about doing this live is that
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.520]   people are watching and they can ask us questions during the show Pete is in our chatroom he
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.720]   said is there a NAS RAID or maybe a Drobo or something that I could use with two and
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:21.520]   a half inch drives laptop size drives instead of the big ones he has a bunch of extra laptop
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.520]   drives lying around.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.280]   I don't know not the Drobo that works with the standard standard drive.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:31.840]   And they have to be SATA drives yeah and by the way it's it's they say the cheapest
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.800]   set of drives you can buy will be fine.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.640]   The only matters to people like us in the media if you want to be quiet then you need
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.600]   to get the Western Digital because you do want quiet.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.320]   We've tested those with four drives it can be noisy.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.920]   Well keep in mind the newest case the Drobo 3 they upgraded my case.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.880]   They like a plane I said this thing like it's like an airplane ticket.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.040]   It's much quieter and then it's your choice on the drives it has a lot to do with and
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.680]   also where you mount it.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:59.040]   We had it sitting on a 14 foot long wooden table which became a giant kind of guitar
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:03.600]   it just resonated put it on our rack and then we'd never heard.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.320]   No it's much quieter than it was.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:11.120]   Do you Andy have you seen any sort of network attached storage that uses laptop drives?
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:15.880]   I don't know really nothing that nothing I've ever experienced with no.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.440]   This is kind of like tech TV.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.440]   It is isn't it?
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.920]   Alright I got more for you Rod wants to know.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.160]   Wait a minute I'm enjoying my first kind of like tech TV moment.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.160]   Don't just gloss over that.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.160]   This is kind of cool.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.400]   When you're all here it'll really be like we're answering questions.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.840]   Do you want a sledgehammer?
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.600]   You want to bang something up?
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.360]   You kind of remind me you could be like the next Patrick Norton.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:40.360]   Well I mean he was the crumudgeon in training I can be the crumudgeon in crumudgeon in training.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.920]   Would you wear a kilt?
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.920]   Never.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.280]   I don't know you look like you might have hair.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.280]   I wear my trolley Bahama hat.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.400]   Trolley Bahama hat's good enough.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.400]   This is from Rod.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.440]   Do you think the Yahoo Microsoft acquisition fuss will affect Apple?
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.600]   It's certainly good for Google.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   Google stock going up.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.760]   Apple stock's gone up.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.200]   It's 185 bucks now.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.920]   It's back on track for the $200.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.840]   There's a $250 price point on it by a couple of the analysts.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:10.280]   I don't think Microsoft Yahoo would have impinged anywhere in Apple's business.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:14.160]   I don't think it has any real impact one where the other one.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.800]   I'll tell you one thing that's kind of interesting.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:21.640]   It's an admission by Microsoft that the idea of desktop software and operating systems
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.160]   is obsolete.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:26.960]   So you could go both ways on this because that's Apple's business kind of his hardware and
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.960]   desktops.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.680]   But on the other hand it might be good for Apple because it's an acknowledgement that
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.120]   it's not a Microsoft world.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:37.200]   In fact the new Microsoft Live Mesh works on Macintosh.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.920]   In a way Microsoft's saying the future isn't Windows.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.840]   It's not desktop acts.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.400]   It's computing in the cloud, internet computing.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:50.560]   And as long as you've got a good browser which could be Safari or Firefox, we don't
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.160]   care what operating system you're using.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.280]   So maybe it's an acknowledgement that times have changed.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.400]   Either that or that their search engine sucked.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.840]   Well that too.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.000]   Alan wants to know if you'll see a 32 gigabyte iPhone in this new 3G.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.400]   I believe the answer is yes.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.400]   As an option.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.400]   32 gigs of size.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.800]   There's no, there's not going to be an eight.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   You already dropped the four.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.040]   So they're just sliding off these lower ones.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.040]   There's going to be a 16.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.040]   That'll be the, it'll either be.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.120]   It'll either be a 32 gig iPhone iPod touch which I love.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.120]   That's not a lot.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.960]   It'll either be a 16 and a 32 or just a 16.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.960]   Agreed?
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.960]   Gentlemen?
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.160]   Yeah, I think there's many, the AIDS too small.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.920]   Well, I don't think it's necessarily too small right now but it's definitely going to
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.520]   be too small once the app store opens up and you're adding applications and not only that
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.680]   but you're adding applications that can now download and store information on your iPhone.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:43.440]   And once I got that Oracle database on my iPhone 8 gigs, it's not going to make it.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.440]   Right.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.920]   Here's another one.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.440]   This is from Andy and it's for Andy.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.160]   Maybe Andy gave us this question.
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.000]   He likes my time.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.360]   Isn't it time you went inside and got you and Sothner the soda.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   Good question Andy.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.360]   Next question.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.280]   Full offals here if you want some full offal.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.160]   They want to know why C.W.O.B. is still beta.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.920]   Because I learned lessons from some of the titans of industry including Flickr that you
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:15.480]   can basically get by with dodgy features that don't work right properly, having great
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:20.440]   ideas and you have no interest or time to implement just by sticking the label beta on
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.360]   your Web 2.0 application.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.400]   That way you can sort of nurse it along for two, three, four, five years and then at some
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.520]   point you gradually decide you know what, maybe it would be okay to let people add comments
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.840]   to blog posting.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:38.760]   Then you have, they go to gamma then to delta then, if off beta gamma delta they deliver
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:43.920]   Muparo Sigma Phi Omega at which point you then, after Omega you then have to sort of
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.880]   decide that okay it's rolled out for real.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.400]   No that's the Zeta, Zeta comp.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.800]   What about Munu Kesero Phi Sigma Lei?
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.040]   Absalom, I don't know.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.120]   I used to know the whole Greek alphabet like that.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.120]   Leo's a gentleman.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.760]   Oh yeah man, I studied Greek actually.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.600]   I studied for about a minute and then I realized this is hard.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.800]   The alphabet looks different.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.080]   The more serious answer is that right now I'm working on a WordPress theme that I downloaded
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.080]   and really enjoyed.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.600]   I decided it's going to be beta until I develop my own WordPress theme that makes it look
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.520]   exactly the way I want it to look.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:20.760]   One of the cool things about moving to WordPress and choosing new servers and things like that
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.760]   is that I get to eat my own dog food and I really get to learn how these things work
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.600]   not by talking to people and not by having one week with something.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.600]   I agree.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.200]   That's the best reason I have stuff.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:34.120]   I mean, I'm so I've been building themes that you can't see yet and they really really
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.120]   suck.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:39.400]   At some point they will suck to such a little extent that I'm willing to put them out there
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.240]   and have people tell me how much my word per thing is suck.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:49.000]   But when it's out of beta then you know that it's nearly where I want it to be as a website.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.080]   We got from Twitter we got a mention from Maldraoth who says, "You know you guys should
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.880]   be getting money from Drobo for this episode."
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.880]   We aren't getting money.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.880]   Wait a minute babe.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.880]   They didn't call you.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:06.080]   I don't want to emphasize it as far as I know.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.080]   Nobody on this shows me.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.080]   No, they're not paying us.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:12.280]   It was one of the Star Jones things where as long as we just keep mentioning that our
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.960]   wedding is being there we're going to have Michelobut our wedding that Genos Pizza Roll
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.440]   is going to be at the reception.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.720]   Well they say that about anytime we if we talk about aperture they say we're getting our
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.200]   aperture money if we talk about it.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.400]   I mean, you know, hey, we got to have something to talk about.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.760]   Would you rather we spent hours talking about something that sucked?
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.760]   We talk about the stuff that's good.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.000]   Now we will disclose if there is a case where somebody's making money off of something
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   will certainly disclose.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   We have not been paid.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.200]   I should say that I think our agency has had discussions with Drobo about or maybe it's
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.640]   my radio show about sponsoring and they said it was too expensive.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.880]   Maybe they knew we'd just give it away.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.960]   You will not see an ad for Drobo on any of my shows.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.960]   Why not?
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:48.960]   Because they're not a sponsor.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.960]   Well of course.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:50.960]   We're sold out and we can't sell them.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:51.960]   Oh you can't sell them.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.960]   We're sold out.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:53.960]   Well we can if anybody's watching.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.560]   I could put a Drobo right on that desk there.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:02.000]   I also like to remind people that I am a freelance journalist and a very tight economy.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.680]   I am for sale.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.960]   My position has always been that, well no, I'm for sale.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.560]   I'm absolutely flat out for sale.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.400]   My position has always been if you pay me enough money that I never have to write or
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.160]   work again, I'll take it and I'll say whatever the hell you want me to say.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.400]   We're talking about a couple million bucks, but well spent I think.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:23.040]   Some tech guy in our chat room is saying, time for Andy to kill that bird.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.040]   Okay.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.200]   I like this one.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.680]   You've walled your heart against joy.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:36.280]   I think you need to take a good look in the mirror because when you put point one finger
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:41.400]   against a really happy judgmental bird, you're pointing three fingers at a thumb against
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.560]   yourself.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.560]   Think about that.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.560]   What do you think about that?
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.560]   It's also the Allen.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.320]   It's also the left hand rule for electromagnetic by the way.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.080]   If you want to know where what direction the magnetic field is is vectoring towards, you
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.440]   wrap your fingers around like the direction of the field.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.080]   The index finger points to one vectorly.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.080]   I'd like to sing a little song right now.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:06.840]   Green, Finch, and Lynette Bird, mockingbird, Wild Bird, tell me why you sing.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.840]   All right.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.840]   That's a little song time.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.840]   Just a little song time.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.840]   Thank you.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.840]   A little night music for you all.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.680]   So glad I was here to see that in person.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.880]   Let's get to our picks in just a second before we do that.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:21.080]   We do have somebody who actually pays us for advertising.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.600]   It would be audible.com.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.040]   They do great audiobooks.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.040]   You all know about it.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.000]   I know Scott does.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.200]   And Andy does.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   We all listen to audiobooks.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:35.400]   I mean, they're just a great way to learn and enjoy and spend time when you're stuck
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:40.680]   in a car or stuck on an exercise machine, which obviously Scott and I don't know much.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:49.200]   People are saying those guys look like they sit around a lot and eat chocolate and falafel
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.680]   a little later on.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.160]   That's Joe Chocolate, by the way.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.760]   I want to thank, you know what this is from?
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:59.200]   Is Amy Crichfield who used to work at Tech TV?
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.920]   And she now lives just down the road and she's working with Louis Rosado on his own chocolate.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.680]   Is Louis Rosado a sponsor of Twit?
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.680]   He isn't, but he ought to be.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.680]   Because I always mind having chocolate.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.520]   I don't want to eat tainted chocolate.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.520]   It ain't tainted.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.520]   Okay.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.520]   That's good stuff.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.520]   You know what?
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.520]   It's actually really interesting.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:19.040]   He said, I want to make really good chocolate.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.880]   And if you taste it, no, you're not eating it.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.880]   So you're probably saving it.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.880]   I'm saving it.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.880]   Saving it and savoring it.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.800]   Because you don't just eat chocolate randomly.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   You think about it.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.800]   You plan it.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   No, I blew it.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.800]   It's a moment in time.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.800]   I just gobbled it down.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.560]   See, if you were a true horizontally challenged broadcaster like myself, you would know these
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.560]   things.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.640]   I should learn.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:44.440]   I do know Audible.com, a great place to go to get your audio books, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/Macbreak
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.440]   for a free book.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.080]   If you're not already a member, and that's probably about five of you left who are not
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:54.200]   already members, and if it's more than that, I'm not doing my job, go to Audible.com/Macbreak
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.080]   and sign up, and they'll give you a credit toward a book, and it could be any number
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.080]   books.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.400]   Andy, do you want to recommend something this week?
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:03.800]   Yes, I actually picked out, because I was looking through my previous picks, and noticed
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:08.520]   that a lot of them were very much to give everybody the impression that I actually graduated
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:13.720]   from high school, which is a lie, of course, which is why I've overcompensate by picking
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.040]   the fall of Roman Empire, that sort of stuff.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:22.360]   So I thought I'd come with a really good fun one this time, and I'm choosing Tom Clancy's
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:25.440]   third or fourth novel, Debt of Honor.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:29.360]   Tom Clancy, he's a Mac guy, very big Mac guy.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.360]   He's very big Mac guy.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.480]   As a matter of fact, he's often, when he sends email, or at least when he used to send email
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:39.480]   to me, his SIG line was like a quote that used to be a quote with a fighter pilot.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.440]   It's saying, "Never ask a man what kind of computer he uses.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:46.160]   If he's a Mac owner, he'll tell you if he's not, why embarrass him?"
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.120]   I love it.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.680]   I'm now a Tom Clancy fan.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.680]   I like that.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.680]   That's good.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:55.320]   He writes these really taught technical thrillers.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:43:01.080]   He has this incredible talent as a writer to write an 800 page novel that will cause you
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:05.000]   to call in sick for two consecutive days, because you're like, "I'll just reach the
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   end of this chapter."
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   They get to the end of the chapter.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.960]   I just need to read the next page to see what happens.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.960]   Then I'll just read to the next, this chapter.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:17.240]   The debt of honor is the choice because it is actually part of a two volume story.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:21.120]   The last page of this one becomes the previous page of the next one.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.880]   So he basically wrote an 800 page thriller that is absolutely unput downable.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:32.280]   In the plot of this one, it's basically about how the United States is being attacked by
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.360]   Japan financially.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:40.120]   The idea is to bring the dollar system down to replace the dollar as the international
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:44.200]   unit of currency with the Japanese yen, which turns, of course, into a shooting war.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   Lots of technological things get into get employed.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.200]   Lots of beeping devices.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.840]   Lots of things that can kill people and clever in technological ways.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.080]   And one of the most incredible endings of a thriller ever.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.160]   I read this book for the first time when it actually came out.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:01.160]   And I had to wait another year to read the next page of it.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.720]   And it was one of those things where you just turn the page and then you see the author
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.040]   bio, then you turn it back to read the last, turn it back forward because you can't believe
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:12.040]   that that's it, that he just, he edited it in the most fantastic way and you're desperate
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:15.200]   to know what happens next, but there is no next for another year.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.640]   Well, that's what, that's what Del Hokey's saying in our chat room.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.880]   After you finish it, you have to get executive orders.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.240]   You have to get executive orders.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:25.120]   Executive orders is also interesting because this is, I think this is actually one of the
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.960]   last emails I swapped with them.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:30.960]   There is, again, that won't reveal anything about the plot because that last page is
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.280]   a killer of debt of honor.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:38.000]   But there, there's a group is sending terrorist devices to places where lots of people are
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.160]   gathered.
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:43.000]   And there's one day in which they deploy all these devices at once and some of them go
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.360]   off, some of them don't.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:49.200]   One of them is at an event that is referred to as a major international electronics trade
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.280]   show in San Francisco in January.
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.960]   Ooh, what could that be Tom Clancy?
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:54.960]   I knew, exactly.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:59.120]   I knew he was a fan, so I emailed him and said, no, no, this is Mac world Expo, isn't
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.120]   it?
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.720]   And he replied back, well, I never mentioned what it is.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:06.120]   But there's a reason why that's one of the sites where the device did not go off and
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.760]   nobody got killed.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.840]   He protected Mac users.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.840]   How do you know Tom Clancy?
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.840]   Did you just kind of exchange fan letters?
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.920]   I bumped into him outside of Mac world Boston in 1988.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.520]   It is one of those, you're Tom Clancy, aren't you?
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:23.720]   I just, I don't want to interrupt you.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.360]   I just want to say I'm really big fan.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.920]   You were a really novel.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:31.120]   And you know, pee, you know, just one of those big fan boy sort of moments.
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:35.240]   We swapped, it would be presumptuous for me to say that I really know.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:38.960]   And we swapped a few emails because that was back in the days when if you were a big
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.960]   famous author, you could just have your email address out there.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.400]   I haven't heard from him or I sent him email like in years and years and years.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:50.840]   I'm sure that he wouldn't know me from Adam, but he was a big, big, I'm sure he still
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:52.080]   is big, big Mac fan.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.080]   That's me.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.200]   But again, it's the product that I'm pitching here.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.560]   It's hard to talk about an 800 page novel.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:03.120]   And again, I'm talking about double that because these are two books side by side that you just
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.120]   can't wait to find out.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.120]   I love that.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:10.520]   I like to get the longest audible book I can because then you get really into it, right?
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.520]   Exactly.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:16.560]   You don't want it to end like this commercial, but afraid all good things.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.560]   Just kind of do it.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.560]   Dad of honor.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:21.480]   That's our pick from any good choice that I'm going to put it right on my laudable list.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.600]   I can't wait to, I can't wait to listen to it.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.400]   I, I have to say I often listen to history.
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:32.480]   I do a lot of fiction, but I don't do, usually I don't do like genre fiction, but I, you
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.160]   know, when you do it, it gets you and it sucks you.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.200]   And then you're sad when your drive's over.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.120]   That's the kind of book you sit in your car.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.600]   You're already there and you sit in your car for another hour.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.840]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:47.720]   Many titles to choose from 45,000 plus and this is a great one.
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.440]   And we do thank them for their support.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:55.960]   I forgot to mention there's a lot of, I've seen a lot of chatter online from people who
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.880]   say 10.5.2 is just buggy is get out of it.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:05.280]   Has anybody had trouble with the 10.5.2 update which came in I think last week on for, for
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.280]   a leopard?
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.280]   No, not me.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.280]   Any.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.400]   Yeah, the beginning of the show I had a Colonel Panic.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.400]   Did you really?
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.400]   No interesting.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:19.000]   And I've had, I've had random things where my computer literally, something that I wouldn't
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.240]   expect on a Mac, the mouse just stops.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:25.000]   No, I could just, I'm not going to go any further and then I just wait and I want.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   That was fixed.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.120]   That was a real problem and that was fixed a few updates ago.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.120]   Yeah, not mine.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.480]   I think with the firmware update have you applied all the firmware updates?
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:33.480]   Yeah, I have.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.320]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.320]   I might.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.080]   This laptop is just, I think I just bought a leopard.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.560]   But we still only have it on about half our machines.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:44.640]   I've been using it on everything and I haven't had problems but I've heard from people, including
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:49.520]   Chuck Friedman, a guy I know who does a Mac podcast which name escapes me otherwise I give
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.520]   you a plug.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.520]   Sorry, Chuck.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.520]   I'll find it.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.040]   But he's had just the worst problems.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:58.240]   But you know, you start to think, well, if one guy's having a lot of problems but most
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:03.560]   people or nobody I know is having that problem, maybe there's a hardware issue or something
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.160]   specific to him, I don't know.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:10.480]   All right, well, I just thought I'd raise that ask you guys because I have, because that's
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.640]   almost news in this.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.320]   Well, I have seen almost news.
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:18.200]   I have seen, well, I've seen a lot of traffic about it and I just wondering if it's not on
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.200]   my computer.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.200]   All right.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   Okay.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.200]   Okay, boss.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.080]   Let's get to our picks and we'll start with Scott Boring because he's sitting right across
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:28.800]   from me and he's got a big hammer and he's not wearing a kilt.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.400]   I've seen that website.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:37.640]   Well, my pick is a weird pick because it's a hybrid between two programs well known.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.600]   So it's not one of these programs is not the pick.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.600]   Okay.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.520]   You have to have both of these programs for the pick.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.520]   Okay.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:49.240]   My pick is Photomajico, the great slide show program from Germany.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:55.560]   Which you recommended before in combination with aperture because they work together.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.560]   They work together.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:05.560]   If you have the 1.5 or newer aperture and you have the Photomajico Pro 2.2, you now can
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:12.760]   simply choose your aperture library in Photomajico and drop your pictures right in as opposed
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:16.440]   to going outside the program and it is a seamless integration.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:19.480]   Does Apple provide an SDK for developers to do that?
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.040]   Well, they have plug-ins available now for our record.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:23.760]   You did 1LxRite for DB Garage.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.760]   So yeah.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:31.200]   They have an SDK for plug-ins and so they worked with Photomajico however they did and
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.200]   it is seamless.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:37.040]   And of course now, you know, we wish aperture had an export slide show button.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.040]   Right.
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.040]   But it doesn't.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.640]   You can make these beautiful slide shows just an aperture.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:41.640]   Right.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:42.640]   But then you can't hand them to anybody.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:43.640]   Oh, really?
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.640]   That's a weird thing to leave out.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.640]   You can't.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:47.640]   You can print out a PDF.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.560]   No, you can export them and you can effect upload them.
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.240]   But it's not like a quick flash movie.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.240]   Oh, it's not a movie.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.600]   Yeah, it's a slide show for a website where you can put it on a key or something.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.760]   But I'm talking about being able to turn it into something you can just give anybody.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.760]   Like a DVD.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.760]   I see.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:08.880]   And so I use aperture in conjunction with Photomajico for that and it looks great and
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.760]   so you know, Photomajico continues to impress me with how quick it is to make something that
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:17.440]   looks very complicated in 20 or 25 minutes.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:20.680]   And then actually I should say that the third part of this pick would be GarageBand where
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:23.200]   I made the music for my most recent side slideshow.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.200]   I'm writing all this stuff.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.200]   Do you put these online?
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.200]   Can we see these?
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.960]   Well, the one I just made is of my Raptor photographs.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:34.120]   And this will be written up at Twipp Photo, first part of next week, TwippPhoto.com for
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.480]   Alex and I show this week in photography.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:39.160]   And I've got a review of this combination.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.400]   And it's actually quite interesting.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.400]   Cool.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.160]   I forgot to plug Twipp.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.160]   That's okay.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.160]   Great show.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:47.160]   I'll plug it again at the end of this show.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.160]   But it really is.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.720]   If you're in a photography worth listening to.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.960]   And I still am a Lightroom guy.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.960]   You're an aperture guy.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:52.960]   I'm a Lightroom guy.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.840]   But you're slowly winning me over with these stories.
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:55.920]   Well, I'm not trying to win it.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.360]   I think both programs have merit.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.360]   Both programs have a place.
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:02.520]   I'm really liking the localized corrections in Lightroom 2.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:03.520]   Boy, is that slick.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.520]   If you were a Windows user, you got to use Lightroom.
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.520]   Right.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:07.520]   You don't have a choice.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:11.360]   If you got a PowerBook 12-inch PowerBook or a Mini, you probably want to use Lightroom.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:15.760]   But the aperture, especially with the 2.1 version, it's very fast.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:19.360]   It doesn't require the heaviest hardware like it used to.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:22.200]   And you know, I've been playing with Lightroom.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.440]   And it's interesting what I miss from aperture.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.200]   I miss my vault.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.800]   I miss having a managed library.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.160]   Some people hate that, but I love having a managed library.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.400]   You know, Adobe says we do that.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.400]   But I think you're right.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.320]   I don't think it does a very good job.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.240]   I'm constantly looking for my catalog.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.240]   Right.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.240]   Well, which drive is that catalog?
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:41.080]   See, I'm going to start using expression media, the old iView.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.080]   Right.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.640]   I used to use that before you at least came out.
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:45.960]   But I have to say, aperture gives me a piece of mine.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:46.960]   I got my vault.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.400]   I know my stuff's backed up.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.320]   It's easily the best at helping you pick your images.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:55.480]   I can go through, I'm working on a book right now called Wolfscapes.
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.640]   All my Wolf photographs.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:01.000]   I'm narrowing down 5,000 keepers into the top 200, maybe one hundred.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.720]   See, in aperture, I just go through my press, I have, you know, I could press 1 through 5
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.640]   to rate them or I could press P to pick it.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.040]   And I just go click, click, click, click, click.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.040]   It's very easy in aperture.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.040]   I've been to Lightroom.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.600]   Well, it isn't in aperture as well.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:17.840]   But the one thing I like about aperture is the stacks capability where aperture will go
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:22.360]   through and automatically stack all the images that were shot like in a 5-frame burst in
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.360]   one little groove.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.360]   And that's going to...
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:26.360]   It won't do that now.
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:30.400]   On the other hand, Lightroom has, because it's Adobe, you can say, "Take these pictures
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.400]   and make an HDR.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.400]   Take these pictures and make a camera."
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.400]   Exactly.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.240]   And it opens up Photoshop and then it does, if you have Photoshop.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.240]   That's right.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.800]   Now, Alex has come up with a very interesting thought that someday we might write a mini
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:43.160]   Photoshop and drop it into an S plug-in for aperture.
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.160]   Then you could...
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.160]   I don't even think you need to write a...
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.760]   I mean, I think that if you look at Pixelmator or Acorn...
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:48.760]   Acorn already put it.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.760]   Acorn.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.760]   They could get it done now.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.760]   You know?
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.760]   So it's...
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.040]   And our next one is going to be an HDR...
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:59.360]   We're doing an HDR toner that we're working on right now and then we're also going to put
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.360]   conduit right into aperture.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.360]   So we're...
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:03.360]   Is it pretty easy to use that SDK?
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:04.360]   I mean, is it fairly simple?
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:07.360]   I mean, if you're a Coco developer, it's nothing.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.240]   So it's a really easy...
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:13.200]   It's much easier to develop than trying to develop cross-platform.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.880]   We made one Photoshop plug-in and left us kind of.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.800]   Well, for more on aperture, a twit would be a great place to go.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.240]   I'm sure you talk about it a lot.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.480]   And of course you have Fred on, who's the Lightroom guy.
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.480]   So it's an awesome sort of...
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.480]   So nobody can accuse us of...
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:26.480]   Right.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.480]   It's equal time.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:30.600]   In fact, I accused Lightroom of not having great archiving and Fred...
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.760]   When I was on twit, Fred said, "No, it does!"
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.520]   So he's standing up for Lightroom in there.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.280]   And so you're picked Photomagic O+ aperture.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:43.080]   As a combination and maybe a little garage band thrown in for some music.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.760]   Andy Enoco, your pick.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:53.040]   My pick is actually an online comic called The Misadventures of Steve and Steve.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:54:02.360]   If you go to this artist's website, it's edpiscour.com, edpskor.com/steve.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:09.160]   He's written a three-page comic of detailing Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak's early days.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.160]   Oh, fun.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:18.360]   When I tell you that the first panel involves Steve and Steve dressed up as the Mad Hatter
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:23.080]   and a Bunny Rabbit complaining about having to take these horrible jobs to support themselves
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:27.920]   when they could be making a fortune off of their rainbow boxes for making illegal phone
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:28.920]   calls.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.680]   You're often running.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.400]   So it's a little fictionalized.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:39.160]   It's a little bit, it's based on an incident that any real fan of Apple history knows about.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:43.440]   This was, I was trying to figure out, I had to go find my Apple history books to find
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.840]   out how much of it was real, how much it was not.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:51.840]   They did have those jobs, along the long litany of jobs that they had when they were trying
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.720]   to figure out how to get multi-billionaires.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.600]   Among them was as costume characters at, I believe, an amusement park.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.600]   Really?
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:05.120]   They got caught trying to sell, this is a story you will hear a lot, I think from Woz, if
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:09.120]   you hear him speak more than six or seven or eight times, where they got caught with
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:15.040]   one of their, they had these boxes for making phone calls without paying long distance call
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.240]   right exactly.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:20.160]   They got caught by a police officer who knew that something, they're doing something but
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.880]   didn't know what it was.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.640]   Of course, they managed to top themselves out of it.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.640]   I just read it again for the end time.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:31.960]   That's the first time I realized that Woz is wearing the bunny suit of course, but he's
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:36.200]   also sort of drawn as silent bob because he doesn't say a damn word of the panels.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.160]   It's all Steve Jobs is doing all the quick talking.
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:43.160]   It probably was silent Steve Woz, wasn't it?
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.160]   Exactly.
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:48.440]   Woz always tells a story that anytime he'd come up with something, Jobs would say, "I
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.440]   think we can make a business out of that."
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.440]   That was all he did.
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:53.600]   I think we can make a business out of that.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:56:00.160]   All right, the misadventures of Steve and Steve Edpiscor, P-I-S-E-D-P-I-S-K-O-R.com.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.160]   I can't wait to read it.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.160]   Slash Steve.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.160]   Slash Steve.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:04.160]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:11.360]   So I have, this is actually from the MBWI Dias tag on Delicious.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.680]   We don't do any work.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:13.680]   We just read Europe.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:19.120]   You go to Delicious and tag it with MBWI Dias and we will look at it and steal it.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:23.360]   So this was on the unofficial Apple Weblog.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:30.120]   This is called FunPHUN 3.5.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.880]   And don't get Fun 1.0 because it really wasn't.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.760]   It wasn't very fun.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:37.800]   Now what this is, it's zero Alex's.
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.800]   It's very inexpensive.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.680]   It's a physics simulator.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.080]   You can actually draw a little.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:49.160]   You can, it's a 2D physics simulator which may seem like a little basic thing.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.680]   It's open source.
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:51.920]   And I think it's open source.
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:55.520]   Anyway, so what you can do is you can build little boxes and draw little springs and little
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.520]   chains.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:58.920]   And it's a rough, there's, there's.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.920]   This is like crayon physics, which was really cool.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:02.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:07.760]   No, and it's really, it might even be done by the same folks actually.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:11.640]   But Fun 3.5, it is one of those things that you can just doodle with.
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:14.640]   You know, you're waiting somewhere, you're playing around with stuff and you want to just
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.760]   kind of play around with the physics.
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:21.200]   And there was this thing that we were addicted to a while ago called Interactive Physics.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:23.080]   But it's a little expensive and overdone now.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.920]   It's like 250 bucks.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:26.520]   But this is just kind of a fun little one.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:29.160]   The interface is a little nasty.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:33.320]   But the actual, you know, the fact that you can just kind of hand draw stuff and play
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:36.760]   with it, it can, it, it's surprisingly addictive.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:41.480]   So, and that was, it's, yeah, worth definitely checking out.
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:44.560]   And that is that you can get it.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:45.560]   It's fun.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:46.560]   You know, we'll put it in the show notes.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:48.560]   Fun.cs.umu.se.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:54.560]   That's because it was a doctoral thesis project.
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:55.960]   Yeah, and it's super cool.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.880]   So, so anyway, definitely, definitely check it out.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:02.840]   I'd love to see someone really do something that's much more, a very refined version.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:04.800]   Well, I'm still waiting for crayon physics to look.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:08.440]   We all saw that YouTube video that looks like the coolest game ever.
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:09.440]   Where you draw.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.280]   Well, you can draw stuff in fun.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.280]   So you can.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.280]   Yeah, it seems similar to this.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:20.680]   It's not, it's not what the old interactive physics did, but, but it's still very, very
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:21.680]   awesome.
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:26.080]   This one, this one is more for your type because it's kind of got, it looks almost in a way
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:30.680]   like one of those high end drawing programs, right?
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:32.680]   Like three, three, three animation pro.
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.320]   If I, I can figure it out.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.320]   It's pretty, it's pretty rough.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:39.640]   The interface is pretty rough, but the, the actual workings of it is, is a lot of fun.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:40.640]   Cool.
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:41.640]   I can't, I'm playing with it right now.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:42.640]   Looks really neat.
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:46.080]   Fun by Emil Emmerfeldt.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:49.680]   And he's Swedish as all good people are.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.200]   All right.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.440]   That's a nice Volvo.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.000]   It's a Voodoo Volvo.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   So my pick I was good.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.680]   I did it last because I thought maybe some of you guys would have picked it.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:58.800]   So I didn't want to get in your way.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.280]   It's a program called Times.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.280]   It's a new news reader.
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:04.120]   And I know we don't really need a new news reader.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:07.320]   We've got net news wire, which is fantastic.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:12.080]   We've got, you know, Google reader, which is both net news water and Google reader are
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:13.440]   free.
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.920]   But Times, I have to say, I think is worth taking a look at.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:20.240]   It's $30, but you can download a free trial.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.800]   And it is just gorgeous.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:26.320]   It's exactly what you think an Apple app should be.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:29.800]   The idea is, you know, he says, I don't like how news readers look.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:35.160]   They're, they, they look, you know, the emphasis on what you've read.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.560]   It's just a ton of stuff.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:41.280]   He makes, he made this look like a newspaper with very simple tabbing.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:44.800]   It's got, you know, even a newspaper-ish kind of interface, very cocoa.
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:47.360]   It is exactly, I think, what a Mac app ought to be.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:48.360]   Now, there's some problems.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:49.360]   The first version was a little buggy.
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.360]   They've updated.
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:52.120]   I think it's 102 now.
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:54.480]   And it's still, it crashed a couple of times on me.
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.960]   But in, in, in, and I'm not recommending the 30 bucks because there are great free news
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.320]   readers out there.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:04.200]   But on the other hand, I'd kind of like to support this guy because I think what he's
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:10.360]   doing is advancing the metaphor of an RSS reader in a way that is very appealing for
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:11.720]   real people.
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.160]   So it comes already with a, I can't remember if it's on this computer, I think I have
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.160]   it on the other computer.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.200]   So I can't show you Scott.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:23.720]   But it comes with a bunch of, you know, bookmarks that probably are, are good enough for, you
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.800]   know, ant, ant fanny to say, okay, this is fine.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:30.040]   This is all I need.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.040]   It's from acrylic.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:36.380]   So it's acrylicapps.com/times.
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.800]   And I've just, I'm very impressed.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:42.280]   Now, I'm not going to use it because for one thing, it doesn't have the delicious integration
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.920]   I need when I'm, when I'm reading stories, I'm looking for stories for Twitter, Macbreak,
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.600]   weekly, and I want it to be able to quickly bookmark it to delicious.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:52.120]   I suppose I might be able to write an Apple script to interface it with the POCA, which
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.800]   is what I use, but it doesn't right now.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.680]   You know, there are few things that I don't like about it.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:02.000]   But I think for a lot of people who aren't reading news pay, reading news readers because
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.360]   they're too ungainly and ugly, this is a very good choice.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.200]   I mean, it really feels like you're reading a newspaper.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.280]   It's the perfect Mac news reader and I've played with them all.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:14.080]   Fire and just, I play with fire.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.440]   I play with fire, but now I'm playing with times.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.480]   Acrylicapps.com/times, definitely worth taking a look at.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:26.840]   And I'm hoping other Mac, this is, you know, this is that new delicious generation of
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.840]   developers.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.240]   You know, they've kind of all learned that name from Delicious Library, where they're
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:36.800]   making apps for the Mac that are really elegant and gorgeous and really beautiful.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.200]   Delicious Library is a great example.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.920]   This, to me, feels like that same style of programming.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.000]   I hope they do more with it.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.240]   I hope they clean it up.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.880]   And guys, if, I'll tell you what, I'll pay the 30 bucks.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:52.160]   If you had delicious integration or even POCA integration, you got my money because I'd
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.400]   love reading news.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.080]   This is the best way to read news.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.280]   It is called times.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.280]   It's from acrylicapps.com.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.880]   $30, but you can try it for free.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.040]   And those are our picks for the week.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.040]   Falafel awaits.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.840]   I think we better wrap this up.
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.920]   Hey, I got one announcement, Leo.
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.680]   Yes, sir.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.640]   We are doing a bunch of classes in June.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:17.440]   I just want people to know.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:22.160]   We're putting together a four-day podcasting bootcamp, so it's audio and video.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.960]   It's kind of a brain dump of everything we've figured out so far.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:30.160]   Which it usually is, but we figure out more all the time, so it gets longer and longer
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.160]   and longer.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.160]   Right, right.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.160]   So it's four days.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.160]   This is not a seminar.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.160]   This is hands-on.
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.160]   So this is like in the studio.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.160]   Oh, good idea.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.160]   I began with footage.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.760]   So it's only, it's only, there's only 16 seats.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.680]   Pixelcore.com if they want to know more.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:46.560]   No, go to Eventbrite and just, if you use a search for Pixelcore, you'll find it.
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.560]   So what everybody's using now is Eventbrite.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.560]   Is that the new?
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.080]   Well, for this kind of stuff, it's very inexpensive.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.520]   It's very expensive and easy.
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.320]   I saw a few real-loves using it for a meetup.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.920]   And it seems like a lot of people are starting to use Eventbrite.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.840]   Yeah, it's really convenient and easy.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.480]   It's not taking over from upcoming though.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.240]   It's for people who want to do commercial events.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.240]   Right, right.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.240]   So we have three up there.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.240]   We have the podcasting bootcamp.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.440]   We're doing a two-day green screen intensive and then a visual effects bootcamp the week
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.440]   after.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:14.240]   So anyway, so there should be, so definitely check that out.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.000]   And it's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.480]   I'm actually teaching it myself.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.480]   So, yeah.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.480]   Cool.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.480]   All right.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.720]   Eventbrite.be.com and search for podcast.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:29.640]   Yeah, just search for PIXACORE or PXE podcasting number.
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.720]   If you search for PIXACORE, you'll see it.
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:34.720]   And I sent you a link for the show notes.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.640]   Also, I'll put it in the show notes.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.160]   Also one of mine people that you and Alex Scott do a great podcast, now probably the
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.600]   number one photography podcast on the internet.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.160]   It's just this weekend photography.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.640]   I listen to it every week.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.640]   Lots of great stuff.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:50.040]   In fact, after we finish the show, maybe you have some lunch, maybe you could break
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.040]   you brought some camera stuff up here.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:56.280]   You could do a little mini video version for the folks who are watching on video.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:01.520]   If you do want to watch on video, we are doing all the podcasts on video now at twitlive.tv.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.520]   There is a chat room there.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.520]   You could participate.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:08.160]   Or you can also use our Twitter account if it's twitter.com/twitlive, both to find out
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.320]   when we're broadcasting.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.640]   Because I post the broadcast schedule there every morning.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.560]   But also to feedback us.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.360]   Is that a verb?
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:21.000]   You may feedback us from twitter.com/twitlive if you're Twitter.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.600]   Make sure you check it on UrbanDiction.com.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.440]   The kids might have verbed it before you and it might mean something really personal.
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:32.720]   I've been feedbacked and boy am I sore.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:33.720]   Really?
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.320]   I already had to go to Canada against that.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.480]   You're so true.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.560]   You really do have to check UrbanDiction.com.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.800]   Alex is of course also at pixelcore.com and pixelcore.tv for all the podcasts from the
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.880]   pixelcore and they're more all the time.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.360]   Scott is at pedango.com.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.720]   He does the Apple phone show at applephoneshow.com.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.840]   I'm sure you have a lot to say about the new 3G phone.
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:58.640]   We got crews covering it top to bottom and we even have people inside.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.760]   Are we going to WDC kids?
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.320]   Are we all going to be there?
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.320]   Alex you're probably going.
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.320]   I'm going to go.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.320]   Do you have some?
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.320]   No.
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.480]   I think my new model for all this stuff is I just stay here.
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.480]   And then we Skype.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.040]   Well we can do live feeds via Skype.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:18.360]   I'll send somebody down with a laptop and an EVDO card and a camera.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.360]   And I'll say Scott you come out of the thing and we'll get it live.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:26.840]   And so my idea is this is going to be kind of like the poor man's tech CNN where I just
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:33.920]   sit here like a spider growing fatter and fatter and with my tentacles reaching out.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.680]   And then people who want to see what's going on we can get to every conference just by
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:37.680]   covering it that way.
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:42.880]   We'll be there and when we get our first 3G iPhone we're going to bring it into the
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.120]   studio and put it on my new show called Unboxed Sessions.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.440]   Well that's a new show where you open up new stuff.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:54.760]   It's yeah we just like one of my staff said you know Scott the UPS truck stops at our
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.720]   office every single day.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.920]   Oh my yeah.
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:03.040]   And so why don't we just so everybody can live vicariously through you when you buy new
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.040]   junk we'll open it so we're going to open and let everybody see what they would get
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.400]   if they bought the new 3G iPhone.
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:10.240]   We're going to do that within hours of receiving it.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:14.200]   I really wanted to do that but then I realized I can't compete with Scott because he gets
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.960]   much more junk than I do.
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:19.320]   You know I have to pay for my junk.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:23.880]   Listeners on the internet you can actually get videos of women unwrapping.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.880]   That's a lot more interesting than 3G I know.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.600]   Well we do have a woman unwrapping it.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:34.200]   Leona Wayula from Girls Gone Geek TV joins Akim our German engineering friend and they
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.640]   are the ones doing the Unboxing.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:40.920]   I just I want you to succeed I just hope you know what you're competing against.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:45.760]   I don't Andy I don't need the whole pie I just need a little slice.
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:54.440]   That's what he said so she said and now of course Scott is also doing Girls Gone Geek
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.400]   at Girls Gone Geek TV so you've got a lot of podcasts.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.400]   We got like 16.
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:06:59.400]   Cheese Louise.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:03.120]   Is there any one place people can go and find out about all of them?
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.120]   Pidango.com.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.120]   P-O-D-A-N-G-O.com.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.120]   Because he's the president of Pidango.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.120]   I'm the president of Pidango Productions.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:16.120]   Oh see we have two different we have one company Pidango.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.120]   Pidango owns Pidango Productions.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.120]   I'm the president of Pidango Productions.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.320]   And then there's a president of Pidango which is my buddy Doug Smith.
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.320]   Yeah I'm a Doug.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.320]   Last guy.
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.560]   Andy Naco is at the Celestial Waste of Ben with CWOB.com.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.800]   Eternally beta for your enjoyment.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.800]   Exactly.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.800]   I'll also for my own laziness too.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.800]   But if you want to say it's for your enjoyment yeah.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.800]   Well go work.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.520]   And pictures of the bird being strangled will appear there momentarily.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:41.520]   Thank you everybody.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:45.760]   I'm just telling that bird that there are people out there who love it.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.080]   That is a very good bird.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.800]   Don't listen to what the naysayers and the haters go.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.400]   Sing sing sing.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.360]   And by the way you can follow the bird on twitter.com/Twitter.
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:56.360]   Bird's talk you know.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.320]   There was a whole movie about what they do and they get mad.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.400]   I wouldn't get so if you were for you.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:05.160]   Another Mac break is broke.
