[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.280]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the latest Apple news. And guess
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.760]   what? It's Pinkish. Joining me right now with his Pink iPhone 6S Plus, Renee Ritchie from
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.760]   mymoore.com. We've got the silver on the... What do they call it? Aluminum on the 6S Plus?
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.880]   Yeah. Silver on the 6S and so much rose gold on the 6S Plus. It really, there's a lot of
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.800]   expanse on the back of that stuff. It's like that dress, Leo. Like it looks gold, then
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.060]   it looks white, then it looks pink. It's going to be controversy. Yeah, I really want... I'm
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.640]   here to tell you, while if you look at it straight on, and that's why all the pictures
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.040]   look pink, it is pink. But tilt it just a little bit, it gets coppery, and then a little more,
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.360]   and it turns gold. It's actually... I sound like a rationalizing. It's actually very manly.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.480]   It's like a party on a phone. Andy, Andy, Andy, and I was also here from the Chicago
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.600]   Sun Times. Hi, Andy. Hello, Leo. I hope that to see... I was actually looking forward to
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.640]   having a rose gold phone, and somebody... People in the press have been ruining it by saying
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.440]   that, "Oh, no. There's a trend for men to get pink iPhones." They're calling it "bros gold."
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:16.000]   Like, "No, nobody's rolling it fast." You're stupid. You're trying to get a... Take an individual's
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.680]   personal preference and elevate it into a lifestyle trend. Stop doing that. Gros gold. Go get a
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.320]   cookie, get your blood sugar back up. You will stop coming up with ideas like trying to put
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:33.320]   a doll press delete... Bro in front of things. Yes, the pressing... Broze gold. So, as you pointed
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.760]   out before the show began, and I'm now scanning through it because I didn't know it had come
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.080]   out, a non-tech Joshua Ho has put out... They usually really focus on benchmarks and numbers,
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.680]   getting down and dirty on it. They've put out their preliminary results in the new iPhone.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.560]   Renee, you're going to have to summarize for me.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.360]   So, in the proud tradition of Anand and Brian Clue, they're just getting deep into the silicon
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.120]   here. By the way, we should mention that both Anand and Brian Clue now work for Apple.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.280]   Yes, but Anantec has been bought by Perch. So, they're the same company as laptop mag and
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.520]   Tom's Guide and Tom's Hardware. And they have a strong road map about what differentiates them.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.120]   And it's the numbers. It's the geeks. It's the benchmarks. It's the deep dive.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.120]   So, they're going to continue that, which is great. Yeah, and Josh is enormously intelligent.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.680]   I think he's about 12 years old. I don't mean that. No, he's a kid. Yeah, it is crazy. I was
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.040]   more than he said. Anand started when he was in high school. I interviewed him when he was 16.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.000]   It's the tradition. It's amazing. And they're getting into...
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.040]   The technology, like we were talking about, is dual source. I mean, so getting parts from TSMC,
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.560]   I think, getting the right order, and Samsung. And that's really hard because they're on
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.600]   different processes and you want similar results. But last year, we saw the iPhone shipped with the
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.200]   A8 processor and the iPad Air 2 did. But the iPad Air... I've had many didn't. There just weren't
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.840]   enough processors. And this year, they're setting tens of millions of phones and they don't want to
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.680]   run out and dual sourcing it is super smart. But it's the details and they're like what they're
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.440]   doing with the NAND flash storage in order to get the site. It's similar to what they were doing
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.600]   with the MacBook storage. And when the difference between those devices starts to disappear,
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.160]   the idea of how powerful and how performant you can make a mobile device gets really, really interesting.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.520]   They always... I didn't know this, but a NAND says they'd always written their own or designed their
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.360]   own custom controllers for the SSD, the storage and the phone. And then this controller looks a lot
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:32.280]   like the MacBook SSD controller. Apple's always really focused on speed and SSD on the computer side.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.320]   It does make a difference though. On this one... So they're using different kinds of RAM. I don't
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.360]   know if it's the same for the S models yet, but for the 6 and 6 Plus, they were using MLC multi-layer
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.520]   for the lower storage devices and TLC twin layer and TLC is cheaper NAND, but they're doing a lot to
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.720]   sort of mitigate this or make it just as fast for normal operations even though it isn't traditionally
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.880]   as speedily as speedy technology. But I have to say this phone is a beast. And boy, if you look at the
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:07.400]   NAND read and write benchmarks, it is so far beyond... The 6S Plus is so far beyond anything
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.160]   we've seen before. Twice, almost twice the speed of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.840]   It's what you get when you have the kind of money Apple does, but you're also writing for
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.400]   a specific operating system and platform. For example, in Qualcomm makes a chip, it might get sold for
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.240]   a Windows phone and for an Android phone. So it's got to support OpenGL, but it's got to support
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.160]   DirectX and you're carrying sort of that load whether you use it or not. And Apple can write
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.600]   specifically for what they want to do with the phone. Although that's for sequential reads.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.720]   The random reads actually that S6 beats it. Which I... Who knows?
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.800]   Although they're saying that might be a limitation of the test and not a limitation of the data.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.120]   So they're going to look at it. Yeah, that seems a little odd to be.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.320]   On a sequential reads would do better on a spinning medium, but I shouldn't make much
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:58.520]   difference on a random access medium like NAND chips. Nevertheless, we're seeing a pretty speedy
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:04.840]   little device. And it's almost as fast on Chrome Safari and IE as the Surface Pro 3.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:11.640]   Which is pretty good for a mobile device. And just in my pure anecdotal experience,
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:19.000]   iPhone 6s plus feels extremely snappy. I was actually crediting some of that to the fact that
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.800]   it finally has two gigs of RAM. Yeah, it's also got as much faster as a 1.8 gigahertz.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.000]   Now it's called a Twister, the Apple A9 Twister processor in it.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.760]   Apparently the S6 also uses NVMe. So it's a similar
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.640]   NAND technology, which would explain why it's up there.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.800]   This is one of the reasons why I'm looking forward to the iPad Pro so much.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.760]   That's it's an iOS device, but it really shows you how much performance
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:48.200]   a phone or laptop leaves on the table when it's just has to use off the shelf components.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.200]   When you really do build everything to work together for this one application,
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.720]   you'd leave nothing on the table. Metal performance, as one would expect extremely good,
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.280]   almost competitive with the Air 2, which is the current metal.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.360]   Metal is the DirectX, the gaming subsystem for graphics.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.560]   It's Apple's version, yeah. Yeah, and very good. I mean, just impressive as heck.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:19.240]   You leave nothing for the swim back. Yeah. Web browsing battery life,
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:25.240]   also better than anybody else in the market for the 6s plus, as you might expect a little bit worse
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.720]   on the 6s. Yeah. I'm sorry, no, the 6 is better than the 6s plus, sorry.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.920]   But close, unfortunately, we'll look at benchmarks and go,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.440]   well, I see that it's better and it's not that you could ever measure the difference between
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.240]   12.90 seconds and 13. Well, they're static. They're synthetic. Sorry, they're synthetic.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.400]   Nobody sits there and goes ching ching ching ching page after page after page.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:53.000]   I've been finding the battery life fix to be supremely good on the 6s plus easily gets me
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.320]   through the day. Even yesterday, when I used it a lot, I demoed it a lot. I unplugged it very
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:04.600]   early in the morning, went to bed late and I still had 20% left. And that, if there were nothing else,
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:11.640]   that would predispose me to use the iPhone. It's hard the first day when you set up the new phone
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.000]   because iCloud photo, I really want to download everything. Yeah, and everything wants to re-index
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.520]   and spotlight. So some people panic immediately and they say, "Oh, the battery is terrible." But
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.080]   if you usually let it go that day, by the next day, it's willing to go in half. I never judge
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:28.840]   in the first few days I'm playing with a thing more than I should be. You can't judge battery life
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.760]   until you get it back into kind of a normal rhythm. It was great as iOS 9. If you go to the battery
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.360]   thing and you go into preferences, it now shows you background and foreground activity. So it'll
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.840]   tell you it's using the power because you're leaving the screen on or because you're transferring
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:46.360]   stuff. So it's much more easy to see why and where the power is going. The others, I'm sorry to leave
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.560]   you out of this, Andy, but we just don't want you to feel too bad with your old phone.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.240]   It's coming this week. Oh, you're getting a lot good. Yes. Oh, good.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:01.720]   I think you'll be suitably impressed. Of course, the question always, when there's an
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:07.720]   S update, or any update, should I get the new phone? And surprisingly, for this one, I think that
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:15.880]   this is better than the 6 or the 6 Plus that you probably should get it. Some of the features,
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:21.160]   like 3D Touch, are much more significant than I had originally thought.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.480]   Yeah. I think 3D Touch is really the key. There are a lot of little improvements, but
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:31.080]   they've never added to the vocabulary of iOS as they have with this one feature.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:37.560]   And now I've had multiple chances to actually, now I have a couple of days with someone else's
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.440]   iPhone 6P, and the ability to simply drill down into a feature and just
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.200]   convert. Here's what I want to do to that thing getting done in the limited least amount of steps
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.120]   possible. That's going to be transformative. That's the one thing that would get me. If I
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:11:00.200]   if I bought an iPhone 6 like late last year, and I'm trying to think, geez, should I spend $800
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:05.240]   to replace a really good phone, that would be the one thing that might tip me towards actually
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:12.280]   doing that. Although I still worry about replacing $800,000 phone every one year.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.160]   But that's the one thing. But I think one business trip in which you're trying to make
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.360]   reservations, you're trying to pull up notes, you're trying to get this, that, and the other
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:25.400]   done, and you get to do it not by navigating through eight different apps, but by simply tapping
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.480]   an icon eight different times. That might be the thing that says, you know what, before this,
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:35.000]   I've got I've got five minutes before the doors, cabin doors close. I'm using those five minutes to
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.560]   go into the Apple store and have one of these phones waiting for me by the time I get home,
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.000]   because that's going to be that's going to be a frustration saver.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:51.160]   Josh, let me show some people some of the nice features of 3D touch. So there's oh, there's still
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:58.600]   a tap as always. You could just tap the phone. You can also tap and hold, not press, but hold.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.960]   You don't have an over the camera shot. We're working on the shot. Tap and hold. So,
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.360]   for instance, if you want to get the jiggle, jiggle, jiggle on the icons, you tap and hold.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:13.480]   Is that right? No, you do have to press a little bit, don't you? Tap and hold. There we go.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.520]   Still, that's a little bit difficult still. It takes a little practice to get to that point.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:25.400]   But if you press, there's a haptic tap. Okay, there we go. Let me find it in here. Okay.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:33.480]   Okay, here we go. There we go. So there's a, if you press and hold, there's a haptic tap.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.240]   So that pops up a menu up to five items in that menu, right?
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.800]   A four items. Yeah. Four items, two lines each with an icon. Yeah. And of course,
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.760]   you don't know, it's kind of like right clicking. You don't know what you're going to get. You
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:51.560]   also don't know if an app will do anything. Most apps, not from Apple don't. And even some apps
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:57.160]   from Apple don't. The settings doesn't do anything. One tip is that they have both static and
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.560]   dynamic commands. And the dynamic ones won't populate until you've launched the app at least
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.480]   once. So sometimes people will press the icon and nothing will happen. But then just press the app,
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.720]   the app will open. And after that, you'll see like your messages, your contacts, your videos,
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.720]   all that will pop up. I love it that the contacts give you the three people you've called them or
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.080]   their phone gives you the three people you've called the most and then create new contact.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.400]   That's these are the kinds of things that just power users. It just makes such a big difference
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.440]   for. And I guess everybody will become a little bit more of a power user once you start getting
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.760]   used to using this. You do have to learn a little bit about which apps will do it.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.400]   The only third party app I found so far that does it is Instagram, right?
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:41.080]   Instagram does it work flow does it? Apple has a list up on iTunes now is about a good
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:50.040]   dozen of really popular ones that support it. Yeah, good. Instagram does it and I think does it
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:57.400]   both on the icon. And of course, it's up to the developer to choose the four items that's going
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.720]   to populate that with in this case, for Instagram, new post view activity search and direct
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:07.480]   some sensible. But it also does it within the app, which is which is pretty nice. If you see
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:13.560]   somebody on Instagram, you like, and you force touch, or what do they call it? Pop peak. Yeah,
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:19.000]   you can peak peak. You peak by holding the button, then you can see their other posts,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.920]   which I think is great. So there's going to be some discovery involved because not everything
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.960]   even in the app does that. And there's no, I don't, you know, maybe it's documented somewhere,
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:33.560]   but who reads manuals for apps? So I movie Dropbox, Shazam, things, Evernote, Pinterest,
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.760]   endless alphabet and open tables so far. I use open tables. So often that's good. All right.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:45.000]   I think this is, as you say, Andy, this is the first time in a long time. In fact,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.240]   the first time I can remember since iOS came out that there's been a significant new user
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:54.920]   interface feature. It's very much on trend. Everywhere you go, developers and operating system
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.720]   architects are trying to find ways to make you never ever have to launch an app. How quickly
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.080]   can they get you to the feature within the data within the app that you're looking for?
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.800]   I've been saying for a while, because, and I'm stealing this from Phil Liben, who he's to run
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.120]   Evernote, that we're going to move it. We're going to move eventually to the post app world.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:17.720]   And everybody says, well, what does that mean? How do you not have apps? But this is a first step
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:24.760]   into that post app world. The idea that you don't have to always be living inside an app, that you
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:30.680]   can move fluidly around. The other nice, really nice thing, and I thank Jason Snell for showing me,
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:36.440]   because I did not know about this feature, is the force touch and swipe from edge.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.640]   That's not something I don't know if that's been documented or where it's been documented.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:48.040]   But you can, so if you have to swipe in from the left edge with a force touch, and then you're
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:55.240]   either going to get the recents switcher, which is newly designed. But the greatest thing, and
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.840]   really useful for entering passwords, for instance, when I'm first setting it up,
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:04.360]   you know, everything's in last pass. So I'm in an app and I want to quickly swipe over to last
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:10.840]   pass. So if you swipe it all the way, you go to the last app you used. So it makes it very easy to
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:16.680]   go back and forth between an apps and last pass and quickly enter passwords and stuff. I just,
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.520]   I'm very happy with it. And it's nice because if you just swipe, you go backwards within the
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.680]   hierarchy of the app, but if the force swipe, you go back within the hierarchy of the apps,
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:30.520]   so inter versus intra app, and it's very similar motions. Yeah, so we, this is, I guess, the back
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.320]   button that we have so for so long wanted. And it's really better than a back button because the
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.720]   because the behavior is predictable. And it's direct manipulation, which most people find easier to
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.680]   understand. Right. And also the off and we'll throw up labels there. You see that even if you don't
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.040]   have force touch, you will see in the upper left hand corner of the screen and iOS nine,
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:53.000]   you will see a back button and then love that what you're going back to. Yeah. So I have to,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.720]   but that's even after a whole summer of using iOS, I'm still instinctively looking for where is the
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.320]   I am someplace where I'm done with this screen, or I don't want to be here anymore. How do we get
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:05.880]   back where I was before the back's just people mocked the back button on Android. But but
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:10.600]   honestly, that was a very big difference in a big. I'm just, you know, I'm just thrilled to see all
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.320]   the cross pollination between iOS and Android these days. I mean, there's during the Google event
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.000]   today, there are people saying, Oh, so I guess the Google was just playing catch up with Apple,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.120]   just like there are people saying, Oh, good, good, the iPad pro, I guess, I guess Apple's just,
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.480]   you're trying to do the surface pro. No, it's great. When all these companies are saying,
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.080]   that's a really good idea. It would really help out our users. We're going to do it. We're going to
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:35.000]   put our own spin on it. And we're going to find a way that makes sense for us with our own aesthetic
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.640]   and for our own principles. But anything that makes it better for all users, who cares where
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.440]   came from? Yeah, I said, I said on the Google event, Oh, Microsoft must really feel validated
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:49.240]   because everybody's copying the surface pro three. And then I realized maybe they don't feel so validated.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.720]   They feel ripped off. I don't know. I'm not going to speak for you, Microsoft.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.000]   And since he is a user feature, though, like the more normal people can just pick up something
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.960]   and use it, the better it is for everybody. Yeah, I don't, I don't have to represent a company.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:07.480]   Oh, there's Jim Dowryple. His update has completed, ladies and gentlemen, from the loop insight.com.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.320]   Jim Dowryple, he updated his beard today and it just took a little extra time. No,
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:22.840]   you were you going to El Capitan, Jim? Well, I had a 15 inch pro. And I updated the version of El Capitan,
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:30.120]   but the computer had died in the meantime. So, you know, it had to recover, which I must say,
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:36.360]   as a test worked out very well. It may be late for the new, which I'm sorry about.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:43.560]   No, no problem. But but it was a good test because it rebooted itself and, you know,
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:49.560]   a couple of times and everything was fine. I love the fact that you can do a network
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:55.400]   install of the operating system on Mac and Tasha's. They deserve so much credit for that,
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:01.160]   because if you don't have a boot disk, you let's say your Mac drive just dies,
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.400]   which I take it is what happened to you. You put a new drive in, but you don't have any way of
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:11.880]   instance, you just do a network install of the operating system, recover your data because you've
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.760]   been backing it up. And you're good to go. And I've done this a number of times now. And it really
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:21.800]   is a marvelous situation. Do you use iCloud backup? Is that why it was easier? Actually,
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:28.280]   it was it was the battery that died. Oh, mine. Oh, that's weird. During the during the update.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:33.320]   Oh, so you know, you trashed the drive. Yeah, it just kind of cracked. And then when I restarted,
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:38.520]   it just it just recovered and everything was great. Can I add one point to what Andy was saying?
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:43.720]   Sure. About what you guys were just talking about before I magically showed up in the background.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:54.760]   You know, I I agree that having companies take an idea and expand on that idea and making it their
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:20:00.440]   own is a great thing. It's a great thing for the users and that kind of competition is great.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:07.400]   Where I think we'll probably all agree that it's not so great is when companies like Samsung come in
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:16.440]   and just copy, you know, edge for edge feature for feature and do nothing else with it. That's
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.320]   to me that that's a real problem. And that that's why I have such a problem with Samsung. You know,
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:28.680]   I think HTC over the past couple of years have done some great work. You know, they've tried and,
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:35.000]   you know, unsuccessfully, sadly, that to make things work. Microsoft with the surface, I gave
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.160]   Microsoft credit for for the surface and their idea. I don't think it was a good idea because
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:47.880]   we're just not ready for it yet. But they didn't just copy the iPad. They they took that idea and
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:54.920]   the things that they have worked with before in in tablets a decade before Apple did and made the
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:01.640]   surface and it's great. It's great that they took that and ran with their own idea. So, you know,
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:06.520]   there's a big difference in what's happening in the market with tablets and smartphones and some
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:13.960]   of the companies that are are trying to advance the technology. I agree 100%. I was in the Metropolitan
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.280]   Museum of Art a couple of weeks ago and saw someone who had a permit to actually reproduce a painting.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:24.840]   So she had the she was making this beautiful copy of this 100 year old American painting.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:30.120]   And when I blogged about it, I reflected on the difference between copying something and
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:35.160]   reproducing it that she wasn't just simply saying, I want exactly one of these. It was,
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:40.680]   I want the rebuild this and understand everything that this artist went through as they were
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.560]   conceiving this and in doing so, learn something about how great things are created. And I think
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:49.400]   that engineering works the same way. You can tell in the case of Samsung where they will just
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:54.120]   simply say, Oh, that's nice things. Things I think will have it versus how other companies do it,
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:59.160]   which is which is to say, I really like the way that fingerprint recognition works on the iPhone.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.840]   Let's try to understand all the decisions that Apple put into this. Let's understand the reasons
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.960]   why it works so well. And then let's let that inform us as we erase the whiteboard of all the
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.800]   notes we made and then create something that works for us. So that's that's an excellent point.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.960]   Well, it would be great if if somebody came out and said, you know what, I think what Apple did with
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:23.320]   the the iPad is completely wrong. That's not the way that it should work. And that's kind of how I
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:28.840]   feel that Microsoft did it. They said, no, one operating system, you know, across the board.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.400]   And that's, you know, that's different than what Apple did.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.400]   We all learned that lesson. Oh, congratulations. You know, but they didn't
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.800]   innovate. You want to do it.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.120]   I have to point out though that there are some things that are so small they don't need to be
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:48.840]   reinvented a trash can, for instance. And of course, Apple was pissed when Microsoft had a recycle bin
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.640]   on Windows, went even sued him. But that's an example of what are you going to rethink,
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:58.360]   reinvent the trash can draw the trash can to make a different name.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:04.040]   Samsung is that they'll put like the touch ID or whatever interface and they don't make it match
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.480]   the rest of the interface. It's like they take one part of a car, stick it in a plane and say,
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:13.320]   done. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, whatever. I mean, look, you know what, start feeling bad for Samsung
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.160]   because things are going to get a lot worse. Yeah, especially with Nexus is like that is the
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.880]   market. You know, after seeing this Google event, I think that there, you know, yes,
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:27.080]   Microsoft should be thrilled that Google has acknowledged that a keyboard with a tablet,
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.080]   with a hinge makes a lot of sense as Microsoft as Apple has with the iPad Pro.
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:40.440]   But I think the real message of the new Nexus phones is you'd be crazy to buy a modified Android
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:45.320]   device. If you can get it, if you can get hardware that's as good as Samsung's or HTC's
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.080]   with a pure Android, you'd be what there's no more. Isn't that weird though, like you have the
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.760]   surface, which is I mean, they try to position it against the iPad or the MacBook, but it really
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.920]   is positioned against the OEMs as well. And the next is they position they go out of their way to
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:01.320]   show what versus the iPhone, but it clearly is also positioned against their OEMs. And it's a weird
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.240]   position that both Google and Microsoft find them in when they make their own hardware and they have
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:10.120]   but it's a very different relationship because remember Android OEMs are the same as as Windows
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:15.480]   OEMs. They're not paying as much. In some cases, many cases are not paying anything. That's a
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:21.000]   different world. People choose Android not because they want to make a compatible device. They choose
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.120]   Android because it's a free operating system. It's easy to do. I was talking to Phil Baker,
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.840]   who was the product to develop the PONO player for Neil Young. I said, why did you choose Android
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:36.200]   for the PONO player? Because it's free. That's a very different experience than the OEMs for Windows.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:46.360]   How did you like AC/DC, Jim? It was incredible. Incredible. Great show. And I went to Yaxing for
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:53.080]   lunch. Yaxing is the dim sum place in San Francisco. You liked it? And Anga Sheng was sitting right
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:25:02.200]   beside me. What the what? Did you say anything? I said hi. Hi, Angus. Love the shorts.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:08.520]   Angus, what's up? I had to look up his age because he's running around on stage. He's running up.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.280]   He's climbing on the speakers. He's doing all the stuff he did for he's done for 40 years.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:19.400]   So he's 60 and he looks great. Yes, he does. And he went out there for two hours
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.120]   and blew everybody away. Was amazing. Yeah, that's solo.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.800]   Is he doing this selfie harder to get to the Johnny Ives selfie though, Jim?
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:33.320]   Did you come on Jim? Admit it. You did a little of the oh, let me see what's going on on my phone.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:41.800]   Little of that, right? Come on. That's me. They wouldn't have anything to do with
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:48.360]   any pictures or any of course not. Yeah. And most of them won't when they're they're out for.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.760]   No, I don't blame them. Don't bug celebrities. I just hate it when I'm bothered to meal.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:58.920]   Those paparazzi, they've just got to stop still having scored a la port selfie.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:06.920]   There's not much to man. You got speaking that though. You got me hating the Twitter interface
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:12.200]   even worse. You ever have the thing where like you click into it and then you get to see what
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.120]   the last update was for like one quarter of a second for it re-updates and things scroll down.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:23.720]   So I got a subliminal look of was that Jim having a selfie with Johnny? I can't I could not find it
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:28.600]   again. It was like the chair was was. If it were if it were anybody else, I would think that,
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:33.640]   okay, no, I just saw somebody with a shave in the head next to it. But no, it's somebody somebody
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.600]   in the chat room, copy 386 Jim says they should rename yank sing to sushi DC.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:45.080]   They can expand their clientele in all kinds of ways, couldn't they?
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.960]   We can just go up at night and hang that sign over the
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:57.560]   Singsi DC. So talking about other features, what you've missed is just a tour of a new iPhone
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:05.320]   six features, six S features. And you please pitch in with your favorite. We were showing
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:12.520]   the new Force Touch features and you got to give any of the swipe in from the side with Force Touch.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:17.640]   But I have to say there the keyboard yet Leo. Yeah, let's talk. That's exactly where I was going.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:22.440]   It was with the keyboard here. Okay. First of all, thank you for lowercase. I know I know John
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:28.520]   Gruber has turned it off in accessibility, but I for one, I really liked the lowercase. I know what
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:35.240]   I'm doing. Yeah. So why? I like it. I saw that that John didn't like it. I couldn't figure out why,
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.160]   but some people have a harder time reacquiring a glyph if it changes. Like you're looking at the
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.080]   letter A, then it changes to a lowercase or uppercase and it takes you a second to
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.400]   re-acquire that glyph and some people find that a little annoying. He said it was blinky
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.640]   blinky, but remember this was also when he was using it in beta. Maybe maybe it did look a little
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.960]   blinky blinky or something in beta. It's very smooth. It's just how a digital device should be.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.880]   Every every other smartphone does it this way. The age of the typewriter is over. Yeah,
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:05.720]   it's not a select ring and finally Apple acknowledged that. But no, I was going to talk about one of the
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.680]   just coolest features and without force touch, you might not know it exists. But because on the
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.960]   iPad, you use two fingers and you get the cursor control on the iPhone. You force you force touch.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:21.800]   When I show this to people in lieu of the magnifying glass and I say, see, you can go anywhere and
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:28.760]   you move the cursor. They they squeeze. They go crazy. You still have you still have this double
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:33.480]   press double force press. Oh, you can you can do it right away. When we double double force press
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:39.240]   on the on the text. No, on the trackpad. So press down on the track to turn the trackpad. Now,
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.920]   now release a little bit and press again and it should just highlight the words for you.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:48.280]   Oh, it gets the word you can double. Yeah, so press down and hold down and then sort of press
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:54.360]   deeper. This is one of those things where you're learning things that there you go. Yeah,
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:59.240]   that take a little while to kind of internalize mechanics, you know, physically get the muscle
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.760]   what a what a what a great week for Blackberry to debut their brand new and
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:09.720]   bright up chemical keyboard. Did you see? Did you see the CEO was it, John Chen try to demo
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:16.360]   the new Blackberry? It's not as easy as my base. I need to do force touch on the Blackberry.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:22.280]   With the real with a hammer. Yeah, exactly. But say maybe he'll give you an iPhone if you break
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.600]   enough of them. I'm going to say this is a good week for Apple and Google and a very bad week for
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:33.400]   anybody else who makes smartphones. Anyway, I really I have I love this. I think this is
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.720]   you know, I don't know. It's so funny. I don't know why I guess because you needed the force
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:44.600]   touch hardware. But this is thank you. It's so much of a better way to move the cursor around
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:50.520]   in text. I just love it. Yeah. Okay, so we showed the slide over. We showed the three. Oh, we didn't
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:56.440]   show live photos. Live photos does not work. Unfortunately on the on the home screen, but it
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:01.480]   does work on the live the lock screen. So this is one of the stock live photos that comes with
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:06.200]   the iPhone. Of course, you'll replace it with your own. But just the built in animation.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:13.240]   I'm loving live photos. Yeah, especially when it's a pet or a child or just a moment that you
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:20.040]   really want to capture. You nailed it. The child is the is a great one because they're moving.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:25.880]   They're they're not static creatures. Pets to I have a great one of Aussie. I don't see how I can
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:35.560]   find it looking out the window with the wind in his hair. And it's it's just so great. Well, I have
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:45.720]   a cat instead of a dog. But this cat is yawning. So so you can have a great picture of your pet.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.960]   But there's something more when a child and you get a little audio and you get a little video
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:53.320]   and the child is moving. I don't know why it does that weird thing at the beginning of the
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:57.160]   summer. I did wrong. That's the other thing from the JPEG to the ball file. Yeah, you have to that's
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:02.680]   another thing you really have to learn how to take these and not put the phone down too fast.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:08.200]   But once you do, my advice, you said you told it was your advice. I think Renee,
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:14.840]   leave live photos on because it doesn't matter if you didn't do it right because the times you do,
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:19.800]   you will be so grateful. And you can go back and delete them if you're out of space.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:25.320]   And you can always turn live photos off on an individual photo. If it's so bad,
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:32.440]   you know, you can just turn it off and then it's done. Yeah. Of course, the issue with live photos,
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:38.120]   and you know, I posted that lovely picture of Aussie to Instagram and immediately just flattened
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:43.800]   it. And I would really love to see more people support live photos. It will have to be on iOS,
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:49.960]   you think? I mean, it's a JPEG file and a mob file together. So theoretically, other people could
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:56.680]   hack it. And MOV, quick time MOV file. Yeah. Well, I saw Serenity's hack. Was it Serenity's?
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:03.160]   It was on iMore where you at? Okay, it's simple. You want to put that live photo on Instagram,
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:08.120]   no problem. You get it, you need a cable, you hook it up to a Macintosh, you download a GIF,
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:13.720]   I think it was yours, Renee. You download a GIF program that converts the mob file into a GIF,
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.240]   and then you copy it back over to the iPhone, and then you upload it to Instagram. See, that was
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:22.120]   Serenity's. Mine was just use one phone to film the other phone, and then upload that. Oh, I like
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.360]   that. She's way smarter than me. Yeah, Mel. Yeah, but nobody's gonna do that. That's crazy.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.520]   It will be nice when Facebook supports this. I will you'll see a lot of these, I think. Or workflow,
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:34.600]   we'll just do something like automatically turn it into a GIF for you and upload it. Work flow
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.640]   could do it. That's right. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Somebody's asking iBookery in their chat room.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:46.600]   Hi, iBookery. Met him at the event in New York City. Good to see you again. Ask you to, how about
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:52.200]   space considerations with Live Photo? Yeah, they're twice the size. So, like, if you shoot
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.400]   everything as a Live Photo, you'll go through your storage twice as fast, but most people won't
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:00.120]   keep every one of them. So just occasionally go through and delete the ones you don't want.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:09.400]   See, I keep all of mine. And my usage of the iPhone has changed so much over the years that
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:18.440]   I only keep optimized versions of everything on the iPhone. My music is all in the cloud. So,
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:24.920]   I have a ton of space on my phone. So, live photos really wasn't a huge consideration.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:31.400]   It's a good point. If you use iCloud Photo Library and turn on optimized only,
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:36.280]   it will optimize the live photos as well. Yeah, you'll get the thumbnail and it'll send the rest
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:42.600]   to the cloud. So, it will reduce the size of that. So, I think Apple, that is... I'm not a fan
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:47.400]   of technologies that happen behind your back and just assume they know what the right thing to do is.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:52.840]   But this is one exception where I think they really does make a difference. You just say,
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.360]   hey, just put the optimized version on my phone. I'll let you make sure that it might
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.760]   not run in this space. I think that's a really... it works very well. Yeah, Apple's always very
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.240]   smart about that, for instance. All the way back when they introduced HDR, it will sidecar both the
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:09.000]   HDR version and the original version. So, that... or when you use one of those,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.400]   okay, lame Instagram type effects with the camera app that you accidentally trigger,
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:18.440]   I accidentally triggered those all the time. And I was so mad because I thought that it had shot
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:23.720]   like a morning's worth of pictures with a stupid super saturated polaroid effect until I got home
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:28.360]   and docked the phones out and say it's all right. They saved both kinds. So, they're really,
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.520]   really thoughtful in all things. So, Renee, can you walk me through... somebody in the chat room
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:38.040]   wants to see side-by-side apps. Now, it really doesn't make a lot of sense on a small screen.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:45.240]   I think mostly for the iPad Pro, but I can't do it, right? No, it's iPad only. It's iPad only.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:51.800]   Okay. Can I do a picture in picture on the iPhone? No. No. All that's still iPad only. Okay.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:59.240]   That stuff even works really well in the iPad mini. I even don't... I even have the iPad mini too,
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:04.840]   which can't do live apps side-by-side. But just the ability when you get a notification that says,
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.120]   "Hey, you've got an iChat message," to simply swipe in from the right,
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:15.240]   "Gavil Live Tile," that simply has... Here's the messages app to actually respond and have a
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.000]   conversation and then swipe it back and be right back where you were before without having every
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.040]   left, the document you've been creating or whatever it is you've been watching or reading,
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.680]   that's such a time saver. All right. So, I think I've gone through most of the new features.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:34.360]   As you mentioned, I think we mentioned this last week, the fingerprint reader is so fast that you
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:39.240]   have to change your behavior. You're one of those people who uses the home button to quickly get a
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:44.280]   look at notifications. Oh, it's locked, so it's not going to do that. This is not my phone, it's leases.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:49.720]   But if you use the home button to pop up the screen, you immediately go right out of it.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:53.320]   The fingerprint reader is so fast. So, you have to start using the on/off button. If you want to
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:57.080]   look at notifications or see what time it is. Really cool thing too is the 3D touch. They even,
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.760]   like for example, if you're in your messages and you just see the list of faces, you can 3D touch
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:05.320]   on those faces to get other contact options. You can do that in the series search screen as well.
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:09.160]   So, they've gone through and populated a lot of, just if you play around with it, you say,
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.760]   "I wish I could do that." Sometimes you really can do that. And then again, it accelerates you
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.120]   through the operating system. Yeah, look at that. So, this is messages, this is my information.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:21.400]   Because it knows I'm on an iPhone, it says FaceTime Audio, Message, FaceTime,
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.840]   Mail, Add to Exer. That's really nice. That is just, that is really nice.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:30.120]   There are features though, like this force swipe in from the left that aren't immediately obvious.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:36.040]   Are there any that I've missed? Most of them are just those. Like in maps, you can go and you
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.720]   can force press and get a bunch of autobots. Most of it is a straight force press. The edge gesture
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.640]   is really just to differentiate it from trying to hit an icon or trying to do a regular swipe.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:47.720]   So, that one's a little bit differently. You got to get used to pressing down and then swiping.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:54.440]   But most of them are really simple. And a lot of finding out where everything is. Yes.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.080]   It's just exploring. A new app is installed,
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:06.760]   force touch on the icon and see what happens. Yeah. I would recommend going through settings.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:12.600]   There are lots of new things and changes and differences. And it's probably worth just at least
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:18.680]   once going through them. For instance, and I just really love this. There are so many things that
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:26.040]   I really rejected on the old iPhone. They kept me off of the iPhone that they fixed. This is one.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:33.240]   Notifications normally are grouped by app. And you have to painstakingly go through each app to
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:39.960]   delete them. And that X is so tiny to clear them. But now you can change the sort order to recent
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:47.400]   and turn off group by app. And suddenly your notifications are in chronological order
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:54.440]   with one delete button up at the top. Oh, sweet mystery of life. I have found you.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.520]   You can also go in and change the 3D touch fund. It's either lighter or heavier.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.720]   And I did that too. Yeah. What did you do with yours?
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:06.200]   I have mine on medium still because I was treating it too easily with light. So, I went back to medium.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:11.320]   I switched to light because I like it a little bit better because I was getting blisters on my
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:15.480]   and there was a great tip from Paul Kefasas of Rogameba. If you're having trouble doing the
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:20.920]   jiggly mode, you can just press as hard as you want on a folder because a folder has no 3D touch
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:25.640]   state. It'll automatically go into jiggly mode. Sweet. Where do I turn off? Where do I change?
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:31.320]   How general accessibility? Oh, it's an exciting. Yeah, you must go into accessibility. You might
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:35.640]   say, well, I don't need, but there are so many things in here that you might want turning off
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:42.680]   motion, for instance. That's where John Gruber goes to turn off the lower case keys on his keyboard.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:48.680]   Weird, but possible. And then here's a 3D touch section. And yeah, I turn mine to light. It's
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:55.320]   light, medium, or firm. And then you can test it and see, well, is it how hard do I have to do it?
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:01.080]   The haptics on this make the difference, don't they? That feedback really is important.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:07.320]   Well, really is. It makes you feel like you're actually doing something when you press on it.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:13.880]   And having that feedback, it's an interactive type of gesture. Yeah.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:18.280]   And they had four middle engineers working on this, just really, really talented people.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:23.080]   That engine is not small. You get that in here. They had to reduce the size of the battery,
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:30.120]   kind of rejigger the insides of the device. It has to feel real. That whole 3D touch idea,
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:37.080]   that was mine. Nice. Well, I really mocked it because I've used force touch and I found it
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:41.400]   not to be intuitive and not to be very useful. But this is not that. So if you thought,
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:47.240]   well, I've tried force touch on a MacBook or on my watch, I don't like it. This is 3D touch.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:51.400]   They were right to rename it. It's a different thing entirely. It's like a warp tunnel through
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:57.320]   iOS layout, so I keep describing it. Yeah. It makes you hopeful for whatever they might show off
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:04.280]   a WWDC next year to make force touch a little bit more rational, a little bit more consistent
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.320]   on all these other devices, because I had the exact same complaint as you did.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:13.320]   I don't, even after a whole summer of wearing Apple Watch, I don't instinctively look to force
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:18.760]   touch things because my brain has not been wired yet to expect force touch to do something consistently.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.520]   Right. But even through the, even just a couple days I've had with the new iPhones,
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.680]   it's like, nope, I know exactly how this works. I know exactly what to expect from it. And your
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:34.840]   force touch and like, what, like the doodah, man. Wow. Write that down. I think we have a show title.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.200]   I finally got a show title.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:43.480]   Finally, you're the number one generator of show titles. I don't know. I'm going to see,
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:50.040]   I'm going to see the show titles genius and others. I'm like, Salieri, I can see the genius
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.040]   that God isn't planted in the green without.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:59.400]   As a hearing aid where I really like it, one of the ways that Apple does accessibility better
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.160]   than anybody else, the support for hearing aids is really fantastic. They actually have
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:07.720]   custom drivers in here. I don't have my hearing aids paired with this phone. But once you do,
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:14.600]   you can actually pass audio into the hearing aids so you can listen, which is actually a very
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:19.720]   good stealth way to listen to an audio book on your hearing aids that's legal in every country.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:27.320]   So what in the world? Carplay, I really want this to work, but I don't have one yet that does. But
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:34.520]   that's going to be a nice feature as well. So anything else? I mean, just the new camera. I mean,
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.760]   it's amazing. We haven't even talked about the new camera yet.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:42.680]   You know, okay, I was okay. I don't want to be one of those nitpeckers Jim Dalrymple hates so much.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:50.440]   But I don't know why, but I expected more from the new camera. Look, Apple's always had one of
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:54.920]   the best cameras, not the best necessarily, but one of the best cameras. And this one's good.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:42:02.200]   You know, it doesn't blow me away. Does it maybe maybe knee glasses along the
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:11.960]   damn you Jim Dalrymple. I took it for a walk through New York City late at night.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:17.720]   I know those are the low lights were very, very good. Although my ACDC pictures didn't come
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:22.600]   out in all that great. So if you have live photo turned on, it reduces the low light.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:29.400]   You want to turn live photo off if you're going to know that.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:34.120]   This is a panel. Did I have better seats than you Jim or worse?
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:41.640]   About the same, I think. I think about the same. I was over to the left or the right.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:48.840]   Oh, you had more home plate access. Yes. Thank goodness for giant screens.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:53.960]   It's all I can say because Angus was a little danny. And I didn't bring my horns.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:59.400]   I was did you bring your horns Jim? I did not. I didn't bring mine. I'm minor under my hat all
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:05.720]   the time. He brought the beard. I don't know when that became a thing, but it is the thing
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:13.320]   at an ACDC concert to wear blinky horns. Everybody does ever since the ACDC figured out that people
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:21.640]   would buy them for like $30. That's when now I have to say this if you've ever tried to take a
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:26.280]   concert dis picture distant from the stage with a camera phone, this actually is pretty impressive.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:32.360]   I mean, that's a low very low light. It's dark basically with extremely bright light in the middle.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:43.720]   Now, I have some pictures that I took of the ACDC show in August. So with the iPhone 6 plus,
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:50.120]   and I mean, you couldn't make out any detail in those photos. It was just when the lights shine.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:58.040]   It was just like a white light on the stage. That's all you saw. You couldn't see any
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:02.120]   detail like you can on these ones. This is about as challenging an environment for any camera as
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:08.760]   you can imagine. Color balance, weird, dark to very, you know, dynamic range, infinite.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:13.720]   The detail on the people's heads is very good. I mean, it's not a great picture. I'm not saying,
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:19.960]   but you're right. I mean, this is zoomed in. So the thing 12 megapixels gives you is the ability
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:25.400]   to zoom without degrading the photo as much. And as you can tell, I mean, this is quite, you know,
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:32.280]   from that, actually, I think that's zoomed in as well, from that to this is quite a zoom. It's
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:38.200]   probably 100% zoom to the point where you can actually see there are little tiny figures on
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.480]   the stage down there. There's Brian Johnson on the left, a little tiny Brian Johnson.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.280]   We couldn't quite capture the blood moon, but I've gotten closer to the camera.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.880]   Yeah. I mean, look, if you're taking pictures of the moon with a camera phone, forget it.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.520]   Yes.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:54.680]   But better than previous. So it is. So I'm not saying not to say it's not improved.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:59.560]   I don't know what I was expecting. I was expecting SLR quality. That's obviously
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.400]   kind of the forecast.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:06.600]   The 4K is pretty, especially on the 6S with the 6S plus with the OIS for video.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.520]   And you're shooting in 4K and you're walking around and it's still really steady. It's very nice.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:13.640]   I mean, that that is highly zoomed. The detail is there.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:20.200]   I don't know what what you think is so bad about that.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:24.440]   It's not. It's fantastic. I'm just saying, I wish I guess I thought it was going to be even better.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.200]   Wow.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.400]   I know. This is.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:31.000]   All right. You're right. You're right. This is pretty darn good.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.520]   This is when all the lights are on.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.640]   And you got live flash selfies. Now, Leo, you can actually hold your phone,
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.600]   get a flash and a live photo at the same time and live flash.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:46.840]   Lisa, let me see if I can zoom out on these because Lisa and I did that and see if I can find the.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:51.640]   So this is a live flash selfie. Actually, this is pretty challenging environment because
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:58.920]   you've got a real mix of lighting and so forth. And that's the screen is lighting up on the phone.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.520]   That's impressive.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:05.400]   This is by the way, a live. So when El Capitan comes out, I'll be able to animate this, right?
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:09.800]   But this is what I like about live photo is you get both.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:17.160]   It degrades well in an environment where you can't do the video. You get a pretty great result.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:24.520]   Through the link in the in the show notes from Lisa Bettany's camera test that she does every year.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:28.840]   Oh boy. I can only imagine. Yes, she likes to do multiple cameras and so forth, right?
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:33.560]   Every iPhone single iPhone ever made. And with a really good A.B.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:38.440]   Really good A.B. control. So you can check between the. It's especially interesting,
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:44.760]   the differences between the six and the six plus and the six P plus because it doesn't look like
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:51.000]   it's revolutionary, but it looks like they fix those little cases in which the six plus
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:58.520]   couldn't do a terrific job. The six P that the excuse me, the six S plus now doesn't even
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:03.640]   better job. We've come a long way, baby. Yeah. That's the original iPhone. That's about as
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:07.000]   blurry as you can get. I don't know if you can see this on the screen, but we have come a long
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:15.560]   way, baby. But you're right. Even from the six to the six S is a pretty. Yeah. And a lot of these,
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:20.360]   the difference between the last generation of this one aren't revolutionary. But when you see
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:28.040]   individual test where for this one instance, you were going to be glad that you had a better edge
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:32.760]   detail that you had better. They changed like the sometimes the simple things like they just
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.960]   changed the tone mapping to make sense for this particular situation. Yeah. Thank you, Lisa,
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:42.440]   for doing this. I thank you for doing this, Lisa, because I was really I was
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:47.320]   sure about it. I didn't think my trenches were isolated deeply enough. Deep, deep trench
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:53.320]   isolation. I was called a heretic for pointing that out. Here's a sailboat at sunset. That's the
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.480]   example of you. It's hard to tell the difference. Yeah, those look very similar. And I think that's
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:02.440]   probably what it is is that I'm not looking at conditions that you're going to see the difference,
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:06.680]   but you sure could see the detail difference on the close up. Yeah. Just difference between
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:12.520]   eight and 12 megapixels. Yeah. Worthy of admission. Yeah. Yeah. Color rendering is similar.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:19.240]   You know, it's a subtle difference, I guess is what I'm saying. God,
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:24.440]   I'd like to see what her shooting rig looks like because she has pictures of like where you can't
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:29.320]   see the clouds move. So she must have been able to take like nine pictures in 10 seconds or five
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:33.880]   seconds. She must have like a bandolier like Chewbacca and just yes.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:39.800]   Well, she's got to have a hardware rig, right? Where they're all mounted. The problem is the
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:46.520]   same angle on each of them, right? Yeah. Very little change. Yeah. I bet you actually set up a
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:50.920]   tripod and just had it. We'll get Lisa to call us and tell us how she did this.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:57.400]   Yeah. This is an example where we're in daylight. It's not a particularly challenging photo,
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:01.960]   and there is just not that much difference. Any camera can take a good picture there.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.640]   Yeah. Well, that's the point. Yeah. It's just a really good wide range of test setups there.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:10.760]   Yeah. I think the pencils were clear. There was a difference. Yeah. But if you look to the earlier
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:16.920]   ones and then look to the later. Well, obviously. Yeah. I think that's what it, you know, that's
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:23.720]   what everything is. Well, I guess, but the question is who should upgrade to the six s? I mean,
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:28.680]   should you upgrade to the six s if you've got a six? If the 12 megapixels over the eight is
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:33.240]   very important to you or the 4k video is important to you. It also does 1080p slow motion. So if you
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:38.680]   had this slow motion, you really wanted it in 1080p. Right. You get that now. I think, you know,
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:44.280]   the flesh tones are maybe a little more realistic on the face. Yeah. She looks more Canadian.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:51.000]   I think anybody in a free park is going to look Canadian, frankly. Oh, now, now you're just
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.560]   showing off those deep blue eyes. Look at that. This is a zoomed in. And that's where you see
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:01.000]   the detail. That's one thing a 12 megapixel anything will give you is this ability to zoom a little
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.680]   bit and still get a good image. That's a pretty big deal. Yeah. It's not going to be possible to
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:13.000]   ever do an optical zoom on a real phone camera. Right. So you often have to trade off stuff to
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.280]   get the higher density sensor like that. But it's often worth it if you just get the ability to
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:24.920]   crop a little bit or even just to get that extra detail. I often remind myself that it's not just
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:28.600]   for yourself today that you're taking this picture. It's also for yourself 10 years from now and 20
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:33.000]   years from now. Right. And you might be happy that whatever software using 10 years from now has
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.320]   16 megapixels of data to work from instead of just 12 or 8. And by the way, Reed Lease is
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:43.320]   text because as a professional photographer, she sees more than you or I. And in here, for instance,
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:49.160]   she says with the iPhone 6s, we see a return. This is the 6s to a more highly saturated and
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:55.640]   contrasted style, somewhat more like the 5s. In fact, the 6 kind of was an aberration more.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:00.520]   Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say by looking at those photos.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:06.360]   Yeah. The 6 is a little bit over-brightened, for instance. She says there's more detail in the
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:12.280]   clouds, but and this is important, there's still quite pixelated and that's due to the noise reduction
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:16.680]   Apple's applying. She says there's a tough balance between reducing noise and increasing
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:21.480]   pixelization, something Adobe's been trying to master for years. As a photographer,
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:25.640]   I would love to be able to tweak the strength of this noise reduction algorithm with a slider
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:31.880]   or manual setting. Yeah, a lot of times I would prefer to have more noise and less pixelization.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:39.480]   Apple's going for the basic common denominator here and that's a consumer.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:45.480]   That's what they're going for. And most consumers wouldn't know the difference between noise reduction
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:51.000]   and or care for that matter. They just want to put the camera up and take a pick.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.760]   This is a good example though of an image that looks clearly better on the 6s.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:01.640]   The sunset image here is an even darker image. We'll go from the 5s
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:12.040]   version to the 6 where they really did brighten it to the 6s. Yeah, the 6s is more like the 5s,
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:17.880]   isn't it? And it's low light reproduction. I forget the description. I know it's a
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:24.120]   minority. But they're doing an HDR version of the noise reduction where it's trying to make
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:30.840]   sense of what's a sky and what's a large surface. I bet if you did an AB comparison in this picture
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:40.680]   of coins in very low light, most people would say I prefer the 6 to the 6s because the 6s is
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:48.280]   noticeably darker. But she says the 6s has more contrast detail and less noise.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:55.800]   So that's something a pro might say. I prefer the 6s but an amateur might just say, oh, you know,
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:01.960]   I can see the coins in the 6 version. This is boy, I'm so glad she does this.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:07.880]   Yeah, it's pretty impressive. Yeah. It's not just not just to the technical
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:12.600]   achievement, not only how easy it is to check it out, not only how deep her explanations go,
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.720]   but also it kind of infuriates me that her test photos are all beautiful.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:20.920]   It's not just here's the crap in this corner of the eye. I don't have fear. Here's the sky in my
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:26.360]   back. Not only her picture is better, but she's beautiful and smart. Some people just get it all
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:33.400]   in one package. That's me. It's like Jim. Like down rimble. If Lisa had a beer, it should be
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:39.000]   perfect. Yeah. Yep. That's all she needs. I'll send her a note to that effect. Send her a beer,
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.320]   too. If you want to read, read the full article, which you should snap, snap, snap,
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:50.680]   dot photos, snap, snap, snap, dot photos. It's the camera plus a blog. But of course, Lisa was
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:55.400]   one of the founders of camera plus and she posts this every year there. And this is really great,
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:54:02.200]   really nicely done. Let's take a break. Jim down rumple is here from loop insight dot com.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:12.520]   Back home after his jaunt to see Angus at Sushi DC and also Renee Richie from iMore.com,
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:19.880]   who thank you for continuously laughing at my poor joke. I think just this cheers you up.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:27.160]   It just this is cheers you up. You go, oh, I like it. I really, I'm not kidding. I
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:33.400]   use it sounds like I'm being facetious. It's a cheerful color. Well, it's like the gold isn't
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:38.040]   gaudy gold. It's more champagne. This isn't like hot pink flamenco anything. This is just a nice
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:43.560]   yeah, it's like casual about it's a casual pink. It's not pinky pink. Yeah. There's something about
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:48.600]   it. I just it's a happy color. You know, there's a lot of psychology and I think that really is
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:52.200]   that's a happy color. I want to hear that video so badly. We spent a lot of time
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:58.200]   understanding the right as a color. You know, they did. You know, they did. Someone said,
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.880]   someone said hot pink and that was just the wrong answer. It was just the wrong answer.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:07.480]   We threw everything out. Yeah. And pink again. Andy and I was also here from the Chicago
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:13.320]   Sun Time. It's rose gold. It's not the color pink that we chose. That's important. It's all the
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:20.520]   colors pink that we said no to. A thousand. Okay, Andy should be on that video too.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:27.320]   We need to get him in a white room though. Our show today brought to you by Unity. You
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:34.920]   guys probably all know about Unity. It's a free free home media server. That is so awesome. You
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:40.440]   it's kind of frustrating when you know you have the movies and music you want to play. It's on your
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:46.200]   computer over there and your stuff is your phone is over here and you're you're you're at work
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:50.920]   and it just really it's it's so frustrating. You don't want to upload them to the cloud. There's a
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:56.280]   better way. There's unity. It's free. It's easy to install. It's a mobile app that unifies your
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:00.680]   media from any computer you own and gives you access to all your files big and small right from
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:09.240]   your iPhone or your iPad with unity. You run the unity client on your desktop. Very quickly. I
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:15.400]   have this another thing because it very quickly indexes all the media on that system. And then
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:20.600]   you can see it anywhere you go over the internet. You can even share your media with friends via
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:26.040]   peer to peer. Your friends can stream it directly from your computer stream your videos from home
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:32.280]   while you're at a friend's house or at a hotel. And if you install unity on several computers this
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:37.640]   is really cool. It will actually unify all of the files in one place. You don't have to go from
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:42.440]   hard drive to hard drive finding that one file. You can automatically merge iTunes accounts and
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:49.480]   libraries. That's really nice. Access Lightroom and Apple Photos as well. Auto Discover GoPro
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:53.720]   videos so you can access and share them more easily. You can even use AirPlay to stream that
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:57:01.240]   music or video to your TV. And it's free. Get your own private personal media server with Unity today.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:10.600]   Access all your files on demand for free. Get unity.com/twit. G-E-T-Y-O-U. Get it. N-I-T-Y.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:21.400]   Unity is in you, N-E-T-Y-O-U-N-I-T-Y.com/twit. I'm going there right now. You've not used this
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:27.320]   before? I have not. I'm surprised. It's really cool. Unity. And it has some features that no other
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:35.160]   media server has and the price. You can't beat it. So who watched the Google event? We broadcast it
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:39.560]   live. If you didn't see it you can watch it on our Twit Live specials. Feed. I came in a little
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:44.200]   early this morning. We just ended it in fact right before Mac Breakley launched most of it.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:49.720]   It was interesting because it was very clear that at least with the phones,
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:57.800]   I guess with the tablet too, Google was directly addressing Apple. And also Chromecast. Remember
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:03.320]   one of the points that kept hitting was that well because we use all the CPU power of the phone
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:07.080]   instead of on the device, that's how we can sell these things for $35. You can have them all throughout
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:12.840]   the house, which is particularly timed for a price jump of 50 bucks for the Apple TV.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:21.720]   It wasn't as arrogant as they've been in a few years past, but definitely that presentation was
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:25.320]   very cognizant of who they're competing against. Well, and even showing Google Photos,
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:29.240]   really Google Photos and Apple Photos are now not only exactly the same name, but directly head to
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:38.040]   head and in features and capabilities. Apple's always been very good with originally with Mobile
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:44.200]   Me and then with iCloud, it was a little break in the action briefly, but at creating shareable
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:51.400]   folders that all your family members could upload to. And they've always been very good at that,
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:58.440]   but Google shot across the bow. In fact, it looks, dare I say it even easier if you're using Google
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:04.200]   Photos, you just select the photos you share to somebody. And if somehow creates a cloud-based
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:10.040]   album just by doing that, they can put photos there. It'll even have credit photo credits as to
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:15.560]   whose photos those are. That all looks pretty nice. I think Google Photos was born of Google
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:19.640]   Plus's cloud infrastructure, so they should probably do all that really, really well.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:24.760]   And also built in notifications whenever that album is updated, which seems like it's really
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:30.600]   nicely integrated into the whole experience. We're not seeing features that have never been seen
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:36.200]   before in a photo sharing site, but never as a part that seems like this is a holistically
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:43.320]   considered part of the experience. The phones are, as I mentioned, probably not going to hurt Apple.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:49.240]   There may be a move to Android app in the Google Play Store. I don't think there's really any need
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:53.160]   from-- I mean, a move to iOS app in the Google Play Store, but I don't think there's a need for a
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:57.960]   move to Android app in the-- I don't think people go much in that direction. So if you and me, Andy,
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:03.800]   we're the only two that have done that. I might be moving back. I'm here to tell you, at least for
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:09.800]   a couple of months until I get that new 6-speed. 13 million, Leo. 13 million. That's how many people
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:14.680]   bought it in the first weekend. That's a record, right? After analysts say, "Oh, it's going to
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:19.640]   disappoint." The ear of the iPhone is over. I think you could have credibly said last year.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:24.200]   And Apple's numbers were great last year, of course, because they opened up to China. But
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:30.440]   this is a significantly better phone than last year's iPhone. They made a lot more of them. They
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:34.200]   had much more supply to meet the demand. Right. They could meet the demand. That's another thing.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:39.720]   Although they're out now, right? Or no. Yeah. They can do-- I'll tell you what, there's new
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:45.800]   shipments in the Apple store. So I have an anecdote. Meghan Moroni, who does iOS today with me,
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:50.040]   really wanted an iPhone. She ordered it and wasn't going to come to October 5th. She ordered
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:01:00.280]   the 64-gig rose gold 6S plus. And so she went to an Apple store, local one here, and the guy said,
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:06.360]   "Here's the trick. Call me in the morning because they get new shipments every day or most days."
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:12.040]   And so the trick is to call in the morning and say, "I want that one. I'll be right there."
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.520]   And she was able to get exactly what she wanted by doing it that way.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:20.120]   So if you're worried about-- maybe not the same in Canada, but if you're worried about the delay
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:26.520]   of three to four-- I'm sorry. You had to come to New York to get it, didn't you?
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:33.720]   He's crying now in his beer. If you're worried about a three to four week delay, that is one way to do
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:39.800]   it is just get a friendly Apple store employee to let you know when they come in.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:48.760]   And I honestly think you do want it. Now, I also think that Google has done a really good job
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:55.320]   with these new Nexus phones and maybe more significantly. They've priced them significantly
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:07.640]   lower. Even the top of the line, 128 gigabyte 6P is 649, which is $1 less than Apple's least expensive
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:12.040]   iPhone. It's always been good at keeping prices low for the Nexus line. They were
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.480]   usually targeted developers, and while it's not clear they're still targeting developers at all,
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.920]   they're still keeping the prices low as they possibly can. Yeah.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:24.200]   Yeah. Essentially, too, I don't think that they're-- I'm still compiling my notes from the
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:29.320]   announcement, but I don't believe they announced any partnerships with Best Buy or with carriers
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:34.040]   to sell them through stores. I believe that you can only get them through the Google store.
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:38.280]   Outside the US, it's carriers and retailers. Yeah, they've done that in the past, and I would
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.640]   wouldn't be surprised if they added retailers down the line. But yeah,
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.800]   and outside the US carriers have it. Because, remember, last year they had problems--
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:51.400]   I was almost ready to pull the trigger on a Nexus 6. I actually had the money, like,
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:56.440]   again, in an envelope taped to the bottom of my desk, but you could not find a Nexus 6 phone
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:02.360]   with 64 gigs of storage anywhere. And by the time they actually started to become available to the
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:06.280]   Motorola store and the Google Play store, enough months had passed by that I'm like,
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:11.880]   well, maybe I should just buy an iPad mini with this money. Yeah. You want my Nexus 6? I'll just send it to you.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:18.040]   That's OK. They're going to push out Marshmallow and all their Nexus devices. This is, of course,
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:23.080]   always the problem the Google faces, which is that Android, because there's so many people that make
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:28.280]   Android phones and it's an open platform, they can't force upgrades, and most phones don't ever get
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:34.520]   upgraded. Marshmallow will come out next week, and some fraction of the phones, probably a few
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:39.560]   percentage points will get it in Android right away. Compare that to Apple, which is more than 50%
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:43.880]   of what was the current adoption on iOS 9? It's more than 50%. I don't think they've updated it yet,
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:49.240]   but with 50% within a couple days, which is amazing. Yeah. It's an interesting difference, though.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:53.800]   Google has been trying to address that by putting more and more features out of the OS release
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:04:00.120]   and into actual Google Play apps. So, for instance, you needed an entire update to iOS to get the new
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:05.320]   music app, but Google can simply update the music app discreetly. They can also update the keyboard
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:09.720]   discreetly. They can update the camera app discreetly. They put a whole bunch of different
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:14.840]   parts of the OS and this thing called the Google Play services, so they can update that as a separate
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:23.480]   unit. So, it remains such a big problem, despite all of this, that when I recommend Android to
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:27.880]   people, so if you can get an access phone, get an access, because it's the most hassle-free way
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:33.080]   of getting security updates as quickly as you can possibly get them.
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:38.360]   Right. It's kind of ironic. I feel so I don't think that, as I mentioned, this is going to hurt
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:42.680]   Apple in any way, but I do think these new Nexus phones are going to hurt Samsung. And, in fact,
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:46.040]   Samsung is getting just a little bit desperate. They actually tried it. Is that glitter on those?
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:51.640]   Do they put glitter on them? Actually, they up all night putting glitter on them. They're trying to
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:05:02.200]   sell S6 edge phones to people in line to get the new iPhone. I don't think it worked all that well.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:10.520]   It literally, I think it's actually a gold S6 edge. I don't know.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:15.240]   It's just desperation. I mean, it's awful. Yeah, really.
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:21.560]   That exactly is the message to take away. Not you don't get take away. Oh, this is a better phone
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:26.040]   what you get is, oh, please buy this phone before you buy it. A couple of years ago, I think Andy and
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:30.760]   I were in line for the Samsung event and HTC was doing the exact same thing to the Samsung event.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.680]   It's just nothing says we're not number one. The sign might as well say we're not number one.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.400]   Yeah. Yeah. We're not number one.
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.640]   As I recall, they're giving out snacks and beverages to which.
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:44.920]   He keep the phone, but give me the cookie and give me the bottled water.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:53.960]   I don't celebrate it because I really think there should be a vital market with lots of people
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:57.160]   making competing devices is good for us end users.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:00.680]   It's make a phone that's so good no one wants to be in that line.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:03.000]   Right. That's that's how you compete. Yeah.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:12.920]   Did you see it was a great article and I don't know if it got in here. I may not have. So I might
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:19.560]   have to refer to it myself was a I read it in the New York Times, but it was actually
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:27.400]   New York Times re printing an article from Atlas Obscura about the got Atlas Obscura got a
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:33.320]   cultural historian to review Apple the Apple stores to come into the Apple stores.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:38.760]   Did you read this? What a great article. I don't know. It's like I'm not a cultural historian,
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:43.640]   but like there is it's an interesting read because he's comparing it to like ancient temples about
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:48.120]   how you should have a religious experience as you move in where you they want to send you through
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:51.880]   these big doors so that you get the sense of how small you are in relationship with experience
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:56.520]   you're about to have. And then they send you into sort of like a lower tunnel so that you can
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:01.800]   basically be in a crowd of people that then opens up to a large worship space where you see the first
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:07.080]   signs of daylight from from a skylight above and a lot and it's it was interesting hearing him
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:13.800]   compare these to historic archaeological sites. But I was just thinking I like having open spaces
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:18.920]   to shop in. I don't like shopping in a submarine and natural light is a good thing to have and
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:23.800]   I don't know how much aesthetics. But do look at this picture of the Paris Apple store.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:31.640]   Yeah. There is a certain meal before you're new. Like God. Come on, really?
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:35.320]   You know, attention to the man behind the moon cat. There's no cat that comes. You can't prove a thing.
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:43.320]   Well, as an example, you should be belching fire every every 12 seconds. You did mention the
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:50.520]   example of most stores have stacks that you can't you know you browse you walk down aisles.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:54.920]   grocery store is a good example or a bookstore. You walk down aisles. You can't see anybody else
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:08:00.520]   in there and and churches don't do that. They want it to be a communal experience.
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:06.760]   And Apple has done that very effectively. Of course, who knows? I mean, it was Steve Jobs. I'm sure who
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:14.280]   and Ron. What's his name? Johnson Johnson. I'm sure who made the decision and whether they were
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.920]   consciously thinking about churches. I don't know. But because it is a better experience. It's an
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:25.560]   open store and all of that. You see the pictures of the Johnny I've designed Belgian Apple store.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:31.400]   They're actually live trees inside. Wow. You walk through this beautiful forest.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:41.080]   The Erica Robles Anderson is a professor at NYU in cultural history. So she and the reporter
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:47.880]   walked to the Apple store in Soho. She said they had giant ropes. That's oh no. She actually
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:53.400]   compared it to the Samsung store nearby, which had giant ropes outside as if anticipating a giant
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:58.120]   crowd in a big and big bouncer looking people in fancy suits and then crickets.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:04.280]   She says, and this is I think a studio was a deep misunderstanding about special access
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:08.040]   as opposed to what Apple has built, which is the feeling of being in it together.
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:14.520]   As though you were fighting something, even though it's the most valuable company in the world,
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:19.480]   the Apple Basilica on Fifth Avenue is just beautiful. It really is. It's a basilica.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:25.320]   But that's important to the Apple experience. It comes from the early days of Apple where you were
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:34.280]   David and IBM was the Goliath, but it has persisted even though Apple is in no way, not a Goliath now.
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:40.040]   I just think it's a difference between how the emotional relationship that people have with
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:45.480]   Apple products versus any other maker of any other product. You really do feel as though it's a big
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:50.360]   deal if you were to switch from Apple, an Apple, anything to a non-Apple, anything,
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:56.040]   because you do feel as though on some emotional, illogical level that this is a values purchase,
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.960]   that you feel a connection to the people who make this thing because you feel as though
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:05.640]   these are people you enjoy spending time with. Whereas as good as an HTC phone or Huawei phone
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:10.120]   is or Samsung phone is, you could switch from one to the other without really even caring.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:14.920]   I don't think anybody would ever come to a Samsung store because they exclusively want to buy
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:19.320]   only Samsung products. Even if they want their next notebook to be a Samsung notebook, they will
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:24.040]   go to a place where you can find all kinds of different Windows notebooks. So I don't know
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.120]   how much of that is a religious experience and how much of that is just simply here's these things
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:33.240]   are being sold differently from people. There's no call to HP. Yeah, right. There's definitely
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:37.480]   a church of Apple though. But interestingly though, because a lot of people in the Apple
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.080]   community, especially the developer community, they could probably tell you the principal people
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:45.080]   involved in making those the new features that we talked about. And even though it's a ginormous
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:49.960]   company, it's still a company that prizes very small groups and single contributors who do a bulk
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:55.480]   who kind of own a feature. And that gives it this different vibe. It gives it this vibe of being a
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:02.280]   small sort of scrappy company even within the confines of massive employees. And that is,
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:06.200]   it's kind of different to a lot of companies that do build things by committee or build things by
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:10.120]   massive department. It's so personal. It keeps it personal on a personal scale,
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:14.200]   even though it's on massive. Someone's drawing it. It's not just eight banks at computers who's
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:18.680]   rendering it out. Professor Robles Anderson actually studies the role of media technology
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:23.080]   in the production of public space. And one of the things she points out is that churches have
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:29.480]   always used technology. She said, we forget that cathedrals were basically high-end technology,
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:34.840]   as was Stonehenge. And the Buddha's carved into mountains. More recently,
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:41.320]   the first installation of a jumbo Tron was at California's Crystal Church. People have used
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:48.840]   technology for a long time to speak to the gods. It's very, I think, I thought this was so great.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:54.360]   Yeah. She says communal ritual is always part of technology. Early computers came into group
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:59.080]   spaces like families and offices. PowerPoint presentations gather people to look at giant
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:04.120]   screens, even using an iPhone to tune out the human beings around you requires being part of a
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:09.720]   larger group. And Apple, more than any other technology company has been able to access both
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:15.320]   these experiences, the individual and the collective. They feel iconic, Professor Robles Anderson says,
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:22.040]   like an emblem of the personal, just as you said, Renee. And yet, it's a cult, right? It's so
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:26.840]   obviously a cult. We all have to wear a Bruins hat. It's terrible.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:32.680]   Zandy and I know you can get out of the cult anytime. But they cult. They wouldn't want you back.
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:37.560]   There's a whole list of stuff that I wish that people would stop saying. I know cult is a
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:42.200]   pro-apple and anti-em, and that is one of them. Because I think that was more true.
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:51.160]   Cults get together in the face of the fight to find approval for irrational thoughts that are
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:57.320]   self destructive in the long run. That was certainly true of all of us in 1996, 1997.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:03.960]   I was certainly determined to keep using a Mac until you were a cult member then.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:09.480]   Exactly. Well, you know what? If Apple's going to be dead in three months, and I'm going to just
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:15.400]   write that wave all the way into the cliff. I didn't jump off now. Why not jumped out then?
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.200]   Right now, it really is a personal preference. I think that it's interesting to consider how
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:25.720]   much of our decisions are emotional decisions. That's not a bad thing either because we're supposed
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:30.280]   to have joy and have pleasure in the stuff that helps us get us through the day.
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:36.440]   What's wrong with using an Apple device that in whatever irrational ways and
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:41.400]   whatever emotionally manipulative ways make us feel happy and make us feel positive?
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:47.240]   If I can say something about the cult, and I think I speak for all members of the cult.
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:51.640]   If you decided to voluntarily leave, we don't want you back.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:57.000]   I'm the prodigal son. Remember, you slaughtered the fattened calf. I'm back, baby.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:04.840]   That's fine. I'll just be here in my driveway building my ark. You enjoy the golden calf.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:08.680]   You like the calf. You're getting a lot of good use out of that golden calf.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:16.680]   I have to say, in so many ways, I am so, there's still the little niggling things I don't like.
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:23.240]   I feel like I had to enter my password literally five times to set up this phone.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.920]   I have a very long random password. Rene and I were talking about that earlier.
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:33.400]   It's a little frustrating. Apple's so secure. I'm going to talk about this with Steve Gibson.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:39.400]   Apple has decided we're going to be secure to the point where they're almost paranoia.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:46.520]   There's no reason why, with a fingerprint reader and I've entered my iCloud password
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:53.000]   in and it's stored in a secure store and I validated it with a fingerprint. I'm in using the phone
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.960]   with a fingerprint. There's really no reason to keep asking for that over and over and over.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.280]   I deal with store from iCloud. If you do an encrypted backup from iTunes, you won't need it.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:05.080]   No, no, I didn't though. That's because I was setting up from scratch.
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:09.480]   But if you do it from setting up from scratch, it should propagate that to I message into FaceTime,
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.760]   but it doesn't always work. Sometimes the different servers aren't all firing at the
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:16.360]   same time and then we'll pop up asking you. Or if it can't authenticate it for that service
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.120]   at that time, it won't store the passwords. We'll pop up and ask for you again.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.120]   But that doesn't happen very often for me.
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.600]   Oh, so maybe it was just, OK, all right, I take it back.
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.960]   Happened on one of my phones. One of my phones was perfect. One took that same as Leo.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:32.600]   I kept it. And then I wanted to solve my watch. I asked two or three more times.
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:36.440]   So just give me a minute and let me check the cult record.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:42.200]   I'm in trouble now. The high priest is going to whack me.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.320]   You see, the thing is like you have a selfie with Johnny Ives.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.160]   So you're not in a position to say that.
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:50.680]   To joke about like this is an occult.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:58.040]   It's just a bunch of friends hanging out using the same exact technology.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:59.480]   And the code word is not aluminium.
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:04.520]   And he did you notice that? Did you notice that in the Google event, too?
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:09.000]   There was it was introduced by a fellow with an American accent who said that six piece made of
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:15.400]   aluminium. Well, like to be fair, he's from Ireland. And as he got more excited about the
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:20.120]   stuff, his Irish accent started to sneak in. So he said he comes by it honestly.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:25.320]   But I did find it odd that when you go to the Google store in the United States to buy the phone,
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.600]   it also says aluminium as one of the colors.
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.080]   Well, they're their tax offices kept in Ireland.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:35.320]   That's it because we don't want the money to go into the United States.
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.840]   Not reputation, no, it's a hair.
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.600]   Faith and Bigara.
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:43.720]   So and I don't mean to be again, Jim, one of those nitpicky guys.
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:47.000]   I'm just saying it's not it's not heaven on earth. It's not perfect,
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.800]   but it's very impressive. And there's some stuff in there that just really works well.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:56.440]   And well, and the reason that everybody keeps putting a future updates and and
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:57.560]   right. That's not perfect.
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.240]   It's not perfect. Yeah, you always have to improve.
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:03.720]   I am thrilled and I'd asked you this, Renee, I just want to give you some feedback because
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:08.520]   when I first last year when I used the six plus, I was a little disappointed that most
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:12.840]   applications would just blown up. All you got the only experience you got was the God, that's big.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:18.040]   Because they hadn't updated it to take advantage of the variable sizes.
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:23.320]   I'm here to tell you a year later that most have in fact, I'm using Tripit.
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:29.560]   And I go to it and I go, oh, I had forgotten how bad these blown up applications look.
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:33.080]   I've been using these nice applications. And almost immediately,
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:38.920]   a half a day later, Tripit gets updated and now it uses the updated for the six plus for the six
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:42.040]   plus. They all waited a year. Speed test on everybody. That's weird.
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:49.240]   But once that happens, then you really are genuinely using that extra real estate in a nice way.
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:53.000]   And it's really beautiful. And because that's the same system that's used for split
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.280]   at first split few apps and for everything else, once you do that, a lot of the other stuff just
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:01.240]   comes automatically for you. Yeah. Let's take a break. I want to talk about
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:05.480]   Capitan because it's going to be here tomorrow.
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:13.480]   Manana. And we got to get ready. I'm so glad to have Andy and not go here. He and I,
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:20.120]   we may be apostate. We may be heretics. But we're good. You can damn it.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:23.480]   No, I'll take that. No, Andy,
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:27.160]   I'm going to do it. Andy with Android curious for like a year, Leo. He can't just label them in.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:33.080]   I am, I am, I'm ecumenical. That's what I embrace all faiths. My mind is my, the doors of my
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.000]   church are open to anybody. We're not, we're not, you don't need to drop your pants to prove that
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.800]   you've been circumcised to enter this church. But that's all right. Right here. The cult of Apple
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:46.680]   rejects your ecumenicism. Okay. Well, if you have, if you have a blackberry, we will have a
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.760]   conversation that we haven't seen in the phones in the past five years, but still with love,
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:57.320]   you can enter my job. I got love for you. Also, Renee Richie from iMore.com. A great place to go.
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:03.080]   If you've got a new iPhone or you just got iOS nine, your run down on iOS nine features
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:11.000]   is the best out there. As always, iMore really has the, has become the place to go to learn what's new
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.880]   and how to use it. And there's a lot of new stuff on the new iPhone that isn't immediately obvious.
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:20.040]   And so it's really a good idea to do that. Thank you for being here, Renee. And of course,
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:27.400]   from loop insight.com, Jim Dowlrimple, metal head. How's Megadeth doing? They're still, they're still
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:32.440]   out there, right? Megadeth's awesome. Still rocking. You know, you know what I find interesting?
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:36.600]   What's that? Last week, I mentioned Megadeth this week. Jason asked me to come back on the show.
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:44.040]   Uh huh. You see? You see, we're all metal heads here. We're in the cult of Megadeth.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:51.640]   Actually, I'm in the cult at Casper. Let's talk about our mattress for a moment. Casper mattresses.
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:58.920]   They are made in the United States using state of the art technology. They really are amazing
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:05.560]   mattresses, obsessively engineered latex and memory foam combined. And you're going to get a
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:11.320]   better night's sleep and a brighter day ahead because frankly, the whole day relies on the
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:16.040]   good night's sleep. Here I am in my jammies. Look at that box. That's the queen size.
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:24.200]   It's tiny. You take the mattress out. It's wrapped in Tyvek. They give you a cutter to open it up
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:31.080]   and it goes, "wish!" And it doesn't exactly inflate, but well, I guess it does. It's suddenly
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:35.400]   a full-sized queen mattress. And coming in a box that size is awesome because, for instance,
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:40.520]   for my son, I got it for his third floor walk up. It was much easier for him to get it into the room
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.880]   and then open up the box. I don't know how we're going to get it out. But you know what mattress
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:48.440]   from Casper is so affordable and maybe we'll leave it there for the next guy. Now, you may say,
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:52.840]   "but I have to try the mattress." Look at that. Look how cushy it is. And yet it's very firm.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:59.880]   It's a perfect combination. Also, breathes nicely. So those hot summer nights, they weren't
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:06.600]   sweaty and hot at the La Porte House. Even Aussie loves our Casper mattress. Now, here's the deal.
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:11.160]   You do get to try it out, but not in some brightly lit showroom with a sales girl giving you a
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:17.800]   stink eye and five minutes and out. You get to try it out for 100 nights. And if at any time in
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:23.560]   those 100 nights, you say, "yeah, I don't want it." They'll come and get it free. They will pick it
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:27.400]   up. They send it to you free and they'll pick it up for free and they'll even refund you every
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:33.320]   penny you paid. So it's completely risk-free. Buy it online, direct from the factory. That's why
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:38.680]   the prices are so low. The delivery is free and painless returns within a 100-day period.
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:45.160]   You're going to love the Made in the USA, State of the Art technology, the Casper mattress.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:50.840]   $500 for a twin is an amazing price. So much lower. And that's because they're selling direct to you.
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:56.440]   And by the way, we're going to get you $50 off when you use our offer code MACBRAKE. So here's the
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:03.160]   deal. Go to Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R.com, offer code. Actually, go to Casper.com/MacBreak.
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:07.240]   But as we'll send them every signal we can that you heard it on MacBreak Weekly,
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:13.160]   Casper.com/MacBreak. And then promo code MACBreak, you'll get 50 bucks off and Casper will love us
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:24.360]   just a little bit more. Casper.com/MacBreak. All right. El Capitan. You know, with all of this
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:28.200]   excitement over the iPhone and iOS 9, I think El Capitan got downplayed a little bit.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:35.320]   Yeah. Should we be more excited? I wish they, I mean, I'm happy it's coming out right now because in
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:38.840]   previous years, one of the problems would be like they would introduce iCloud Drive, but you couldn't
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:44.600]   use it on the Mac and now Notes is on iOS 9, but it's not yet available on the Mac. And having
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:48.520]   them this close together is much better for anyone who wants to use all those features together
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:53.080]   quicker, but it's much harder when you have to review all of them. Yeah. A lot of work for us.
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:59.720]   Yeah. Of course, one of the reasons you're going to want to upgrade if you have a new iPhone is so
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:05.480]   you can do live photos, right? Yep. Are there any changes in handoff and continuity? Is it all
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:09.960]   pretty much the same there? So they're building off of continuity and extensibility a lot. You might
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:15.080]   not see it like there's no new like there's no new tethering or no new like continuity feature to
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:19.320]   call up, but that technology is being used for everything like indexing activities and you get
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:24.680]   the same content blocker extensions and audio unit extensions. So instead of making an audio
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:29.320]   plugin now, that's an official extension technology. So there's just a lot of things that are replacing
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:34.120]   older versions, older versions of content blockers were just plugins that ran at runtime and could
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:40.040]   snoop on you worse than any traffic, sorry, than any tracker JavaScript could. And now that all
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:44.920]   runs as part of the extensibility architecture as no idea what page you're on is pre-compiled
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:49.400]   for performance. So there's a lot of little things using all those architectures, but it's harder to
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.400]   point to one or two big features using them. Compi three, eight, six, and our chat room says,
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:59.880]   so far users report El Capitan contains a whole lot of snappy faster. Is it faster, Jim? Do you
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:07.800]   notice that? Yeah, it is a lot faster. It's faster in doing everything. And I it's hard to really
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:13.960]   measure speed when you have a fast computer and a fast operating system like
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:21.800]   Yozamite as we say in Canada. Where in Canada do they actually say everywhere?
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:30.120]   Everyone says doofies say. All right. What does it say it again? Because I never heard that
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:33.960]   before. Say it again? Yozamite. Yozamite. That's how it's spelled.
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:42.520]   Yozamite. So when it was a pretty fast operating system, but when you upgrade to El Capitan,
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:51.080]   you do notice speed increases. And it's these things that help with efficiency and just it,
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:59.160]   a lot of it is perception, but perception is reality. If something seems speedier because
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:04.840]   they've taken some time to clean it up and make it a little bit faster, that all helps.
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.960]   A favorite feature, Jim?
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:18.760]   This is like a snow leopard, right? This is like a mountain lion. This is like the talk.
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:25.960]   Yeah, but it's kind of like, for me, it's kind of like the six S as opposed to, you know, like a
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:32.200]   forest. I think the the six S version is probably the best S version. It's absolutely.
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:39.000]   Yeah, that they've ever put out. So El Capitan, you know, it does have a lot of great things in it,
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:46.760]   but it's just overall the way that they put it together and the fact that it is so fast.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:55.720]   That's that's really what it I mean. When you looked at Yozamite, it came in with some new things,
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:01.960]   like continuity and handoff and things like that. And there was some questions,
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:09.000]   sometimes whether it all worked or sometimes it didn't. And this time, without Capitan,
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.520]   everything just seems to work. It's just there. Is it time, Andy, to kind of rethink operating
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:19.960]   system upgrades? I mean, when they come out every year, it isn't as big a deal.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:26.600]   Yeah, I think that's absolutely true. I think whereas you really should update your phone every
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:31.080]   single time a new update is available because a, why not and be Apple always almost always
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:36.280]   delivers a transformative experience with Mac OS, you can really get away with putting it off. I mean,
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:42.120]   I will admit in this office right now, I've got one, two, three different Macs, and they are running
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:47.800]   three different versions of the operating system because I've got I've got an old iMac that's
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:54.440]   running an old beta, but it works fine for the mostly web stuff that I want to do. I have a
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:59.640]   dare touch the operating system on the machine that runs my podcast, my Skype for me because it's
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:04.360]   stable and it works. And I've got my MacBook in front of me that runs the most modern one. So it
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:09.080]   really comes down to when do you finally download an app that tells you I'm sorry, I will not run
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:13.160]   unless you're running the latest version of the operating system. Or when do you see that one
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:18.040]   feature that really does it for you? For me, for El Capitan, the new version of Spotlight is enough
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:23.400]   to justify the upgrade because just the ability to have this little central dashboard that I bring
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:28.760]   up with just a command space and then ask a question like what document did I work on last
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:33.560]   Wednesday and there it is in front of me and also pulling stuff from the web and pulling stuff
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.640]   from my contacts and just integrating all that into like we're just talked about before without
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:42.440]   having to dip into a multiple apps, just simply ask a question, find the information presented to
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:46.920]   me. That's enough of a time server that's worth it. But no, I don't think that people necessarily
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:52.200]   need to upgrade every single every single time immediately when Apple comes up, the new Mac OS.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:28:00.120]   You know, just further thing on Andy's point, there are a lot of people and musicians included
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:11.640]   and being a creator of music on my Mac. My music system, although new is always a version behind
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:19.800]   in the OS because music companies are famously slow at putting out updates for the current OS.
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:26.040]   So if you have an operating system with your music software that is working, you keep it.
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:34.360]   It's only after the companies come out with their updates and then you let other people
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:40.920]   install it and find out if there are any problems. But yeah, that machine for me is always a version
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:46.120]   behind and it's got nothing to do with Apple or the company. I mean, it's just the way that
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:53.080]   that it goes. But I always keep it that way. Although unlike say, well Yosemite or one of the
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:29:00.120]   bigger upgrades, this one is not so changed that it would you recommend as Alex Lindsey does
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:08.360]   waiting till the fix of the first update? Don't update 10.11.
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:14.520]   Download 10.11.1.
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:22.120]   Yeah, don't take the red up. I've been using Al Capitene now for a few months and you could
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:27.720]   tell early on that it was a beta. But the version now is great.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:33.480]   This was a public beta, right? Yeah. I'm so glad Apple's doing that. All the companies now are
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:40.280]   doing that Microsoft as well. And I think it's just now the way to do it. Apple has an advantage
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:45.000]   because Apple hardware is much more heterogeneous than Windows hardware. So I would think with an
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.720]   extensive public beta and who knows, is it millions of people using it, hundreds of thousands,
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:58.600]   that most of the big bugs have been squashed. That's just the right way to do a new operating
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:02.120]   system. And there is one thing to keep in mind is that if you do want to use a lot of the features
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:06.280]   that rely on having both iOS 9 and the latest version of OS 10 installed, like using the new
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:11.560]   Notes app, you're going to have to update all your devices to the latest. That's so smart Apple
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:15.880]   because it really is an incentive. There's a push if you have the iPhone. Now, here's the
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:22.040]   really the kind of the big question though. With John Syracuse and no longer doing the long reviews
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:31.080]   on ours, Technica, it's up to you Renee. So my review did not, a bunch of them went up today.
[01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:35.240]   Your fingers are still blistered from the iOS 9 review. Let's give them a break.
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.280]   I'm at a hundred and I'm at 124,000 words this month Leo.
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:44.840]   By the way, I saw your post. Congratulations. Big milestone. How many millions of words now?
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:49.400]   Four million or nine more? Four million words. How many articles?
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:52.840]   10,000. About one or two of them are actually okay.
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:58.760]   10th. No, no, you're being humble. 10,000 awesome articles. Four million words.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:03.560]   That's pretty impressive. I'm not a writer, so I don't know if that's unusual, but it seems
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:07.480]   like it's an unusual number. It's pretty awesome. It's an indicator of any life.
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:14.600]   I mean, you're an Ironman. That's congratulations. Thank you very much.
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:18.520]   How do you know what the word count is? Is there like a database of all your articles that you just
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:24.920]   ran a WC against? No, they set up a bunch of reports a long time ago and they recently refreshed
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:29.720]   them. And I was one of the people testing to see if the new reports worked. So I went in and I
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:34.600]   and it was right after the iOS 9 review went live. And I just saw the time to date number and I
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:39.480]   like that that's wrong. This whole thing is not working properly. It's a fucking here. The guy
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:46.040]   who programs, I don't know. That's right. So Andrew Cunningham and Lee Hutchinson taking over for John.
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:52.760]   Actually, I think there's a third author in here as well. Ilyich von Menyemun, who did the
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:57.880]   networking section. So it took three people to replace. One Syracuse. But you understand why
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:02.840]   Syracuse retired because that's just got to be a killer thing to do to write these massive
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:13.960]   reviews. A couple of points in here, OS 10, 10.11. This is the very first, I'm sorry, the fourth
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:20.440]   in a row, fourth straight release of Mac OS not to drop support for older Macs. So
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:28.600]   that's actually, I think really good news. It means you don't have to don't fear the reaper.
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:36.120]   In the words of Lloyd Blueister cult, IP six support, IPV six support good.
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:46.120]   This is the networking stuff, man, security strong transport security. I'm in just in page 11. I mean,
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:53.880]   there's another it's endless endless sea of information. See, I just copy Renee's and put my name on it.
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:33:00.840]   You just say, it can be done. Yep. It's no, it's it's great. You just do the new version of
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:05.160]   web journalism where you say, according to report posted today at Iowa, then you quote the whole
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:10.280]   thing. Yeah. And you don't think back to it. You go pancakes. Yeah. Perfect. I'm crying because Andy's
[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:16.840]   actually absolutely correct. Of course it happens. It's very sad. The good news is ad blockers are
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:22.120]   going to put those guys out of business. Have you noticed by the way the ad blockers have stopped
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:27.720]   working and think I think they stopped working on I'm more depends on the ad blocker. It depends
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:30.440]   on how they talk because they're not really ad block. And I think that's the source of the
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:34.280]   confusion is that they're technically not ad blockers. They're content blockers. And it's up to the
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:38.360]   developer to figure out how to implement them and they can block entire elements like entire divs
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:43.560]   or classes of CSS. They can block scripts. They can block they can make it a black list that
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:47.480]   only allows some through a white list that only blocks some. It's incredibly flexible. You can
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:51.880]   get rid of web fonts. You can you can literally do anything. And I think that's the challenge is
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:55.800]   developers are trying to figure out we're blocking too much now and we're breaking the site. We're
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:59.720]   blocking too little and we're letting ads through and trying to find some sort of balance of the two.
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:05.800]   Well, I'm here to tell you one blocker pretty much lets all your ads through now. So congratulations.
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:12.040]   On some sites are just saying please come back when you turned off your ad. I mean,
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:14.920]   there's it's going to be one of those cat and mouse games. Although,
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:19.880]   some of those love more of those recently. Yeah. And you know, I also noticed that the ad blockers
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:24.760]   are now there no longer at the top of the, you know, app list, app store downloads. And
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:28.920]   I have a feeling that this is going to maybe a temp is to teap out. Maybe I made too much of a
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:34.760]   big deal out of this and we can all go along with our business. I think the stat was I forget
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:37.880]   who said it was someone said there was like a it was a single digit increase. Yeah.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:42.280]   Yeah. But it showed up. I mean, there's there's a lot of bad guys in this because you know,
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:47.400]   as much as there are there's big networks like Google and at you know, Google's ad exchange and
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:52.600]   I forget the competitors name. But there's also companies that sell databases that stop tracking
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:56.280]   and try to prevent ads. But then you can pay your way into those database. I mean, it's it's
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:02.280]   entire thing is a very complicated business. I'm just looking at, I mean, I don't know how to
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:09.560]   summarize a, you know, 14 page article on El Capitan. You should probably all go read it
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:19.000]   at ours, Technica.com. I don't, lots of numbers and stuff.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.200]   Then if you want to, people, it was like the transit and maps is really good if you're in a
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:29.320]   city that supports it. The new notes app is fantastic. Being able to pin tabs and turn off
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:35.880]   audio sources in Safari is very reduces your stress level considerably. There's a lot of really nice,
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:39.960]   not flourishes really, but nice touches that just make the experience better.
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:46.840]   Yeah. Yeah. Jason Snell, writing at Macworld. Nice. I guess they
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:52.680]   decided they needed somebody to write a review. He says solid is a rock. He says he's been using
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:36:01.240]   it all summer as I guess you guys both have as well. All right. So I guess the question is,
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:04.920]   how soon should we upgrade? Should we do it tomorrow?
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:11.240]   Except with the exception of people, as Jim mentioned, who have, you know, older or production
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:15.080]   software that you absolutely have to make sure it's going to work. Yeah. I don't care.
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:20.760]   Those that are doing any kind of production on their machine, make sure your third parties
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:26.760]   support the new upgrade before you do it. The last thing you want is to start up,
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:35.880]   just names here, Microsoft or Adobe or Pro Tools or whatever doesn't support this and you can no
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:42.360]   longer work. That's bad. Yeah. Or like, levelator doesn't work. So if you use to use levelator to
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:45.800]   magically make all your podcasts down normal, that doesn't work anymore with it. Yeah. I'll
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:50.680]   cut it down. So I generally like to advise people to usually wait a couple of weeks,
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:54.680]   because that's been all the, the can compatibility and compatibilities are going to shake out.
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:59.480]   Also, I recommend that you get SuperDuber or Carbon Copy Cloner. My favorite is SuperDuber.
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:04.840]   Yes. Whatever it is, whatever your backup scheme is right now, even if you're using,
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:09.400]   even if you're using Apple's, do an entire snapshot the night before so that you can absolutely freeze
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:14.040]   that hard drive in its current state. And so it's the easiest way to get up and running again,
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:19.720]   if that things happen. And it's also, I think, just good practice to, in addition to that backup
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:25.000]   that keeps changing and changing and changing with every hour to simply have for this, for the cost
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.280]   of this really, really cheap, you know, you can buy a hard drive like this for like 60 or 70 bucks.
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:34.520]   And now I have a snapshot of here is what my world looked like on my MacBook in September of
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:39.240]   2015. And you put a label on this, you put this in a safety deposit box, you put it away. And
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:44.520]   three years later, when you're wondering why your trip to Yosemite pictures never wound up on Google
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:49.000]   photos or on Flickr, you can say, okay, here is the snapshot of what my hard drive looked like
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.680]   during that trip. I bet that there is probably going to be in my photo library somewhere.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:58.760]   And it's bootable. Yeah. So if anything happens to your upgrade,
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:04.520]   and you need to continue working today, you can just plug that in, boot from it, and you know,
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:09.720]   go as if nothing had happened, and go back and fix things. This is a backup that I just made
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:16.200]   two days ago for exactly that reason. Yeah. Also, I mean, it's like boarding an air. It's like
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:19.880]   trying to get off an airplane. If you if you try to update the very minute everyone else is,
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:23.720]   you're going to have server time alleys and slow down low. And if you don't need it immediately,
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:27.400]   and most people don't just wait for the afternoon, wait till tomorrow and do it at your own pace.
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:34.600]   Well, how does this work? I should remember it. Apple doesn't push it on you or remind you of
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:39.000]   it right away. But after a little while, it's going to say there's an update, right? Yep.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:47.960]   How long? I forget for OS 10, but it's I usually got them within hours, if not a day. Okay.
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:52.360]   But you can safely ignore that for a little while. And it'll be from page on the Mac App Store.
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:56.360]   So you see it. You won't you won't you won't miss it. Right. Upgrade in place,
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:00.760]   install in place. You don't have to do a clean install. Apple's really got that down, I think.
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:10.040]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've updated three computers now in place. And all of them have worked great.
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:18.280]   Oh, man, it doesn't take long. Lisa at a Chico reporting and business insider. An analyst
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:25.640]   from let's give him a name or her name. Ananda Barua at Breen Capital says Apple could be
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:34.360]   doing a cheap iPhone this spring. Wrong. Wrong. No, I doubt it very much. It could.
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:40.600]   It could. That's in our gravity and atmosphere. It's possible for a new phone to be sold at that
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:44.360]   date time. You're absolutely correct. Apple could have figured out a way to pour beer from the lightning
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:50.520]   force. A new lower end iPhone. This happens every year like clockwork, either a smaller
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:55.000]   functional iPhone model or a skinny iPhone, six size phone would allow Apple to tap into the
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:00.760]   emerging market, lower functional ASP sensitive of the smartphone market. A market Apple has
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:04.120]   never cared about. Thank you very much. Well, I mean, the thing is with Apple, we talked
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:08.520]   about this before, they're a company whose businesses is to try everything. If a blogger or an
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:13.240]   analyst can think about it, Apple has had those CNC machines and Johnny's office are not for show.
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:16.440]   Right. They try everything and then they figure out what makes sense for their company. You don't
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:21.160]   get to a thousand knows without trying a thousand different phones. Right. In fact, they did try
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:28.840]   a small iPhone six and rejected it. When you're the most profitable company in the world,
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:36.120]   country, practically, certainly more profitable than most countries, when you're selling them
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:40.680]   faster than you can make them, I can't imagine any incentive for them to make an expensive one.
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:46.840]   Let Android chase to the bottom. The iPhone probably should be a premium product, right?
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:57.640]   I agree. Aaron Sorkin says Tim Cook. Oh, I don't know. I got to. So, Tim Cook, as you remember,
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:02.760]   I think we talked about it, said he really thought that all of these Steve Jobs movies,
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:07.240]   and I imagine includes the books as well, are kind of opportunistic. And he doesn't go see him,
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:13.080]   and he doesn't like it because to him, Steve Jobs is a real person. And he doesn't like what
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:19.880]   Hollywood does with real people. Aaron Sorkin on the circuit to promote the Steve Jobs movie,
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:31.400]   which comes out Friday, I think, apologizes for saying he was in an interview that if you've got
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:36.920]   a factory full of children in China, assembling phones for 17 cents an hour, you've got a lot of
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:44.600]   nerve calling someone else opportunistic. There are no children assembling in China,
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:49.800]   assembling iPhones for 17 cents an hour, Aaron. Yeah, that's definitely the God-winning of any
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:55.000]   any argument about Apple to say, well, how about your labor practices in China? It's like,
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.840]   okay, hey, how is that relevant? And do you have your facts actually straight about
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:03.160]   labor practices in China? That's, that's quoting Mike Daisy, it must be true.
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:09.800]   I think he was quoting who was I a Bartlett writing, writing, writing, writing, writing.
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:16.040]   Partlet says Aaron has never liked technology. It always makes me nervous. You know, the social
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:22.840]   network was mostly fabricated, the story of Facebook. I'm nervous. Have any of you seen the
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:30.600]   movie at jobs? No, no. You're going to go see it, right? I feel like I got it. I still feel
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:34.600]   guilty that I had to see the as see the first jobs movie on that.
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:39.640]   That Ashton Kutcher movie was horror. Yeah. And so if it made $33,000 nationwide,
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:44.280]   instead of $33,000 minus $11, I feel I feel some responsibility for that.
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:50.600]   It was just it was just ungodly. I guess it's not this weekend. It's October 9th. So that's
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:55.400]   next weekend. Yeah, premiered at the Toronto Film Festival or Sundance, I think. Yeah, Sundance.
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:01.240]   It was out. People have seen it. Woz saw it. Woz said it was pretty good. That's he hated the
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:06.440]   Kutcher. Well, was was was was involved with this movie as a consultant? I think so.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:09.160]   I think that he had some involvement in one of the I know he wasn't involved in the first one.
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:13.720]   It's going to make it better if Woz has something to say about it. He said he liked the acting.
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:23.000]   Read between the lines. Soarken said nobody got rich making my
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:28.200]   right errand and that Cook should actually see the movie before declaring
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:35.400]   an opinion. He has since apologized saying, I'm sorry, but we were both wrong, which is a very
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:43.560]   weak apology. Well, also also kind of arrogant saying that apologizing to himself on behalf of
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:49.560]   Tim, right? Right. Right. Maybe not a good new Tim Cook. He told the weekly Tim Cook and I probably
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:55.960]   both went a little too far and I apologize to Tim Cook. I hope when he sees the movie, he enjoys
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:02.680]   it as much as I enjoy his products. I hope you enjoy your iPhone that will be stuck on Iowa 8
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:07.800]   forever because it's never getting any more updates. He pushed iOS 6 to my device again by a
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:13.720]   polygon. He is now out of the cult. Yeah, you're out of the cult. You're out of the cult, Sarken.
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:17.320]   Yes, we're turning his yellow toga.
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:25.400]   I'm just hoping for a good movie. I think most people who I've spoken to in new Steve Jobs don't
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:29.160]   want to see it because they don't want this sort of commingling with their actual memories.
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:32.920]   Fact and fiction. Right. But for me, I'm just going to look at it as though it is a
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:39.880]   fictional movie. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I got to say that I have a friend who had a
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:44.840]   movie made about him and it's just a very weird thing to say, "Well, here's the person that I
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:50.040]   knew for 20 years and now here's the..." Even though in my case, it's a documentary, here is the
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:55.320]   version that is being presented to people and even though it's accurate, even though it's fair,
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:59.640]   and even though it's balanced, it will never be that person that you knew. So you can understand
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:03.320]   why anybody who knew Steve Jobs might decide, "You know what? I just... I don't need to see it."
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:11.960]   Seems to happen every time a new iOS comes out. Somebody figures out how to bypass the lock screen
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:17.400]   and get information out of the iPhone. This is apparently... I haven't tried it, but apparently
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:23.160]   still affecting iOS 9. Here's what you do. Wake iOS, enter an incorrect passcode four times.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:26.680]   On the fifth time, enter three or five digits, depending on how long your passcode is. By the
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:33.000]   way, thank you Apple for making the passcode six digits much improved. And for the last one,
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.240]   press and hold the home button to invoke Siri immediately followed by the fourth digit.
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:43.240]   After Siri appears, ask her for the time. Tap the clock icon to open the clock app and add a new clock.
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:48.680]   Then write anything in the "Choose a City" field. Now double tap on the word you wrote to invoke the
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:53.880]   copy and paste menu. Select all, then click "Share." Tap the message icon on the share sheet and type
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:46:00.120]   something random. Hit "Return and double tap" on the contact name on the top. We're almost done.
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:05.720]   Select "Create new contact" and add "Top Add" photo, then "Choose photo." You'll now be able to see the
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:11.000]   entire photo library on the iOS device, which is still locked with the passcode.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:17.400]   How is it that somebody comes up with these steps? I mean, did they sit down for...
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:21.560]   Do you have no life? Do you have no life? Do you have no life? Do you go through this? I don't know how
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:25.400]   they ever do it. I really do. The thing is, like what Steve Gibson is famous for saying is that
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:29.320]   you can have security and you can have convenience and the lock screen has to be both. So if you have
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:33.480]   control center enabled, it's convenient, but someone can grab your phone, put an airplane mode,
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:37.560]   and that's you're done. The same way they can, Siri is super convenient, but someone else can use
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:41.560]   that convenience against you. So if you're security-minded, turn off control center, turn off
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:45.400]   notifications center, turn off Siri. It's easy to do in the settings and your phone is super
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:49.320]   secure. If you want the convenience, though, you're dealing with holes in the lock screen.
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:55.560]   It's very simple. Siri leaks information in other ways as well if you leave her on in the lock screen.
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:47:01.080]   If you're worried about this, turn off Siri in the lock screen. Frankly, I find the convenience
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:07.160]   of being able to say, "Hey, you know who anytime." Great. By the way, the new Siri is much improved.
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:13.560]   I love it that we were taking a walk. We saw a street sign we didn't recognize.
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:19.400]   Something called a speed table. Lisa goes, "Hey, S, what's a speed table?"
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:26.200]   We were both kind of taking it back. She said, "Well, I found the answer. Would you like me to read it to
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:35.560]   you?" We said, "Yeah." She explained what a speed table was as we were walking by. It was like,
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:41.240]   "I am living in the future." That was amazing. What's nice is if you say make a call, it knows
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:44.120]   that you're talking to us, but it puts it on speaker. It doesn't make you have to go and press the
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:51.400]   button. It just knows that you want that. It was pretty impressive. Although, as I mentioned last
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:57.960]   week, she's still not quite as smart as Google, but she's getting there. Now you can have a choice
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:03.560]   of four voices, six voices in English. George and his friend are both turned into male British so
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:09.400]   they can have Jarvis on their phone. I've played with them. The Australian ladies, nice. I still use
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:19.080]   a lady. They all sound somewhat snotty. Maybe I'm projecting, but they all sound a little bit like,
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:24.360]   "Okay, well, I'll give you the information." Remember the early turn-by-turn direction
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:28.120]   systems, the dedicated ones that you'd miss a turn, it would just be so disappointed with you?
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:35.640]   We're recalculating you, idiot. Maybe we're projecting. Maybe I'm projecting, but it feels
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:41.720]   like Siri's a little haughty. It's not going to do what Google does because Apple doesn't give it
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:45.800]   access. It doesn't do any operations on the cloud, which is where Google gets all their strength from.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:50.840]   It's doing device side aggregation. That's the trade-off you make. If you live in the Apple world,
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:56.200]   Apple doesn't know as much about you, but that's what you wanted.
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:59.880]   It's nice to have choice. You have choice.
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:06.600]   My bookery says, "Siri can hear you calling her not as smart as Google. Watch out."
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:11.000]   Wait till you're sleeping, love her. You will be sorry.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:18.120]   The Siri voice is a little bit, the standard one. She just sounds like she's talking down to me.
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:22.520]   Like, you poor human. All right, I'll give you what you want, but boy.
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:29.960]   I would love to hear, "Well, I can't, this is very sexist." I was going to ask Megan this.
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:35.640]   Why can't we have Scarlett Johansson's voice? Or Wally? There's a lot of
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:37.160]   celebrity- - Or Wally. - over at Homer Simpson.
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:39.800]   I mean, doesn't mark it up. - Yeah. I want Ozzy.
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:47.880]   You're pet- - Not my dog. He's talking Ozzy Osbourne, who my dog is named after, I might add.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:53.160]   Jim, what you want to know? What, Jim?
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:55.000]   Sean Connery, hold all fine.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:00.280]   I loved my old Tom Tom. You could get celebrity voices. I loved that. So cool.
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:04.200]   For a while, I had Dennis Hopper, but he was so stoned.
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:09.560]   I think you should turn left here, man. I- - Oh, three blocks in the door. Sorry.
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:15.240]   Because when you're navigating through an unfamiliar city, the thing you don't want is
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:16.360]   clarity. That's it.
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:23.960]   And then I tried Gladost, remember from Portal, the evil computer, and I'm not kidding. She would
[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:26.760]   say the wrong directions. - Wow. - When it left it.
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:29.880]   Wow. - Yeah. And then you'd get there and she'd say, "There's no cakes."
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:32.040]   - I had Jim and I had to ask it, right? - Yep.
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:33.640]   Nope. - Yep.
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:37.000]   - Jim, that's it. We need you. You have to- that's what we need.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.160]   A Jim Siri. The Dalrymple. Hey,
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:44.440]   hey, Dalrymple. - All the information just laugh at you.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:47.080]   - By the way, hey, Dalrymple would be a much better trigger phrase.
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:50.920]   - Yeah. - Although Siri with trained-
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:55.720]   now that we can train her to our voice, she doesn't wake up as much by accident as I used to.
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:51:00.280]   It used to be terrible. I could- I actually had to disable the "Hey, Siri" feature.
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:05.560]   Now, everybody who's listening heard me say, "And if- how many of you did your phone wake up?"
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:09.640]   Everyone in the car. - Sorry. - Hey, Siri.
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:12.120]   - Sorry. - Yep.
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:13.000]   - What? - Yep.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.360]   I really wish Amazon was- - That's what I figured.
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:22.440]   - I really wish Amazon was stopped running that commercial during Big Bang Theory about the
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:26.360]   the echo with the new news features because as soon as it comes on-
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:27.400]   - Yeah. - My echo-
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:28.440]   - Lights it wakes up. - Here's-
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:30.440]   - Here's the news of the day. - Oops, I started-
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:31.640]   I didn't mean to say that. - In sports.
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:35.480]   - Yeah. - Yeah. They're gonna have to watch out in ads now, weren't they?
[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:37.480]   - Let's take a break. - I was-
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.720]   Go ahead. - I was just saying that that would
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:43.560]   actually be kind of brilliant if they- if they pre-programmed into the system,
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:49.880]   like make- make existing Google owner- make existing owners feel good about themselves.
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:53.240]   And so whenever there's a commercial on the people who have already bought it,
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:56.760]   Alexa will come out and say, "That's okay. You can go make yourself a snack.
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:58.280]   Thank you for already buying me."
[01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:00.760]   [laughter]
[01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:01.480]   I've heard a lot-
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.160]   - Some code phrase in the commercial. - Yeah.
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:06.360]   Thank you for already- but you are already one of us.
[01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:11.160]   You could use another one. I can order for you right now.
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:14.360]   Well, then- you know what? I wish Amazon would do that with the echo.
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:18.040]   Let us have- I mean, you can only only have two words, Alexa or Amazon.
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:22.680]   Give us a variety of choices. Moto X did it. It can't be that hard to do.
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:25.160]   And I wish Apple would do it with a- a Siri.
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:28.760]   Give us some other phrases we could use or at least- or let us choose our own phrase.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:35.560]   I just prefer that, but- is that too- maybe it's too hard to do, I don't know.
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:39.000]   Well, I think one of those things is because they do have small teams and they're really focused
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.800]   on teachers is that there's a list- it's like what Jaws React famously said.
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:43.320]   It's on the list. I can't tell you where.
[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:44.360]   - Yeah, it's on the list. - It's on the list.
[01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:50.200]   Yeah. Just like deleting bloatware and- and the Stocks app is on the list for Tim Cook.
[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:55.560]   I thought that was interesting. Google said for their new phones and for the new OS,
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:53:00.040]   you can delete anything. There's no- nothing blocked.
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:02.440]   Oh, the phone app is gone. I hope I wish I paid for that one.
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:05.320]   - Yeah, that would be a mistake. - Do not delete the phone app.
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:07.080]   How do I get that back?
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:09.400]   Actually, you can delete the phone app as the store app you can't delete.
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:11.160]   Don't delete both the store and the phone app.
[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:14.120]   - We had to delete a Google Play and now- - Yeah.
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.240]   Now you're really in trouble.
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:16.200]   - But I was empowered.
[01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:20.440]   Okay, there's a few apps you shouldn't be able to delete.
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:22.520]   You can't make that case for the Apple Stocks app.
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:25.800]   Our show today brought to you by Linda.com.
[01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:28.760]   What a great place to go for people who like to learn.

[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:47.800]   It doesn't have to be professional.
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:50.120]   You want to redesign your website.
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:51.480]   You want to master Excel.

[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:06.760]   they just added two excellent courses for beginners.
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:10.600]   The introduction to photography and getting started with photography.
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:13.320]   They also do these five day photo challenges,
[01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:16.360]   which will help you improve your composition skills,
[01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:18.120]   plus new courses on color correction,
[01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:21.480]   and making selective adjustments in Adobe Camera Raw,
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:24.600]   mastering curves in Photoshop.
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:26.920]   Boy, once you learn curves in Photoshop,
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:29.880]   you're a power, a force to be reckoned with.
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:35.960]   You can also start at the beginning with the fundamentals of Photoshop CC 2015.

[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:53.880]   what's that big one on the right?
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:54.360]   I don't know.
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:55.720]   It is.
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:58.840]   Is that a case?
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:00.840]   It's giant.
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:02.280]   Yeah.

[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:27.720]   Last week, when Jim was on, he picked Megadeth.
[01:56:30.280 --> 01:56:33.880]   Has I choose Megadeth as his pick of the week.
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:36.760]   I'm going to give you a chance to pick another something or other.
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:37.560]   Okay.
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:45.880]   This week, I'm going to pick a band called Blackstone Cherry.
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:47.080]   Never heard of them.
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:48.520]   They're from Kentucky.
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:53.800]   Rock band, but not metal.
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:55.720]   Just good.
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:57.560]   Is it southern rock?
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:56:58.360]   Straight ahead.
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:01.400]   Not really southern rock.
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:03.640]   It's just straight ahead rock.
[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:05.400]   They're just such a great band.
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:11.720]   I think four or five albums out.
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:13.480]   All great music.
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:15.640]   It's just so good.
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:17.240]   I actually really like the name.
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:22.120]   That's not a reason to like a band, but it sounds like it.
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:23.480]   Straight ahead rock.
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:25.400]   There's nothing fancy about it,
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:28.920]   but it's really, really, really good.
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:29.400]   Love it.
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:33.720]   Here's a little magic mountain from Blackstone Cherry.
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:36.680]   Jim Delrable is going to pick a band every week from now on.
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:40.280]   My favorite album is Folklore and Superstition.
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:41.000]   Cool.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.640]   It's an older one, but I love it.
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:45.480]   Yeah, it'd be a great one to start with.
[01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:45.720]   Nice.
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:49.880]   Helpless cordies in our chatroom says he loves Blackstone Cherry.
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:51.480]   Have you heard of Stone Sour?
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:53.400]   Yes, another good one.
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:00.360]   We people who don't know Jim don't know that he's a musician on his own ride.
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:01.640]   Do you have a band, Jim?
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:02.840]   No.
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:03.320]   Why not?
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:05.960]   But you'd love to in that.
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:06.600]   Yeah, I do.
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:07.000]   I do.
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.080]   I love getting up and pointing.
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:10.440]   Just sit in with people.
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:10.920]   Yeah.
[01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:12.120]   When he's a band.
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:16.440]   Who's your favorite person you've ever sat in with?
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:19.160]   Oh boy.
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:24.360]   Do you ever get to sit in with the Sabbath?
[01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:25.560]   Yes.
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:28.040]   I was on stage when they were doing their...
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:29.640]   I saw that picture.
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:34.040]   Doing the sound check before the show last year.
[01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:34.920]   I saw that picture.
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:43.480]   You know, I've played around with Sackwild and played with Roger Daltry and
[01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:46.520]   all kinds of people.
[01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:47.160]   I don't know.
[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:49.080]   Roger Daltry, that's sweet.
[01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:50.120]   That's nice.
[01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:54.360]   It's hard to say who the favorite is when you're talking
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:57.000]   such great musicians.
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.040]   There is a slash.
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:58:59.480]   Slash.
[01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:00.120]   That's...
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:03.880]   I mean, it's hard to beat that.
[01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:04.920]   It's hard to beat that.
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:05.320]   You know?
[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:11.000]   So yeah, I don't know that I could really pick a favorite.
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:11.720]   It's just...
[01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:15.640]   Each experience is just kind of different in its own way.
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:17.960]   Hey, we should mention, I just noticed your tweet.
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:23.640]   And your article on the loop, insight.com, loopinsight.com.
[01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:26.040]   This is the day.
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:30.280]   September 29th is three months into your Apple music
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:32.040]   if you subscribed on day one, right?
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:35.400]   So will you get billed tomorrow?
[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:42.040]   Well, if your three months are up,
[01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:44.920]   that just gives you some instructions on how to go check.
[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:45.480]   Right.
[01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:48.360]   And if you want to keep it or...
[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:50.360]   You can get the family plan, the individual.
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:56.440]   Or you can turn off automatic renewal and your free trial will end tomorrow.
[01:59:56.440 --> 01:59:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:57.640]   Last chance.
[01:59:57.640 --> 02:00:01.720]   But it will tell you, if you didn't join day one,
[02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:04.360]   it will tell you how much longer you have, right?
[02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:07.480]   You could join, could you join today and still get three months free?
[02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:10.280]   This is the last day you could do that though, right?
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:12.200]   Or no?
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:12.920]   I don't think so.
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:14.360]   It will always be three months free.
[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:14.840]   Yeah.
[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:15.240]   Okay.
[02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:16.920]   Okay.
[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:17.160]   Cool.
[02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:20.120]   According to South Park,
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:21.400]   slash isn't a real person.
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:23.320]   Just point it in the end.
[02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:26.520]   Thank you, Jim.
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:27.640]   It's always great to have you here.
[02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:28.360]   Thanks for being here.
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:29.400]   I appreciate it.
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:29.880]   Love it.
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:31.480]   Loopinsight.com.
[02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:32.920]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:36.520]   So I was just going to enter what I thought I was going to be my pick.
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:38.200]   And I saw that Andy beat me to it.
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:39.560]   Oh, son of a gun.
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:40.360]   So I...
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:42.280]   There was another one I had as a backup,
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:43.640]   just in case I was going to mention both of them.
[02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:44.440]   So I'm going to focus on that.
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:46.520]   It's called Just Press Record.
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:49.160]   And there's a couple apps that I find are missing from the Apple Watch.
[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:51.320]   So like I'd like to be able to dictate notes.
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:52.680]   I'd like to have a voice recorder.
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:55.880]   I'd like to have some of those apps that are on the iPhone, on the Apple Watch.
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:59.000]   But Apple's created, instead of making them, Apple's created frameworks.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.440]   What developers make them.
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:02.200]   So they have access to the microphone now.
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:03.720]   So you can download an app.
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:06.360]   I'm using Just Press Record because Renee recommended it.
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:07.800]   And it's working really well.
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:09.640]   You download it, you load it onto your iPhone.
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:11.640]   It transfers over to your Apple Watch.
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:13.880]   And then you just press the button, you say what you want to say.
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:15.960]   And it creates an audio file for you.
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:18.280]   And then you can either take it off the iPhone app,
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:22.120]   or you can send it to somebody over iMessage or email, or any of those other things.
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:24.200]   And there's just something really convenient.
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:27.880]   And you could do it more or less using Siri previously.
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:31.800]   But it was always in the confines of having to be in a message.
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:33.320]   And this just lets you do it whenever you want.
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:34.440]   You can just sit there.
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:37.560]   It's great if you're in the car and you don't want to take out a computer or take out your phone.
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:41.560]   You just want to dictate something, some notes to yourself, a message to somebody else.
[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:45.000]   And you pick up your watch, you press a button, you record, you say what you want to say,
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:46.920]   you stop it, you've got your file.
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:48.440]   It's super convenient.
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:52.360]   It's one of those things that it's simple, but it works the way it's advertised.
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:55.160]   And I've been using it for the last couple of days and I've been enjoying it.
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:02:00.040]   It's so funny because I've been looking for a good audio recorder for my iPhone.
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:02.680]   Could I use the watch as a microphone?
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:05.480]   Yeah, I mean, it's not as good.
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:07.640]   I don't believe it's as good a quality.
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:08.840]   No, it's not a sound.
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:12.600]   Mike is so good that radio stations tell me to use that instead of my other headphones.
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:18.280]   Or if you're just away from your phone, it's across the room and you're incredibly lazy human
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:21.320]   being like me and you just want to make yourself a quick reminder.
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:23.880]   You just talk it out and it works great.
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:26.120]   Excellent. And how much is that?
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:29.000]   I had it in front of me a second ago.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.960]   So did we have the screen, can you pull that up again, Josh?
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:35.880]   And I can tell you, $4.99 in the US anyway.
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:40.200]   Open Planet software, just press record.
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:42.600]   Make a note of that.
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:43.720]   And it syncs over iCloud.
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:46.280]   So once you record it one place, it's just synced all your devices.
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:49.320]   Hey Siri, remind me to buy just play record.
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:51.400]   I love that, by the way.
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:54.200]   I love the hey Siri, remind me of this.
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:54.520]   Yeah.
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:56.440]   Whatever I'm doing, it just remembers that.
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:56.920]   What?
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:02:58.200]   How does it know?
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:01.880]   So when they make continuity, they do this thing called activity indexing.
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:05.800]   So that continuity could know how to transfer where you are in one app to another device.
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:10.040]   And now the back button uses that because it remembers where you were in an app.
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:13.000]   And I'm listening, I did this the other day, I was listening to security now.
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.720]   I said in overcast, I said, remind me of this.
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:18.440]   And because Marco had enabled continuity for a cast,
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:22.120]   it remembered that podcast, I listened to something else, went back to reminders,
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:23.640]   pressed the button that was right there.
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:24.040]   No.
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:26.440]   And it can be emails, messages, anything.
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:28.200]   Remind me of this, it takes whatever you're doing.
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:28.680]   Oh my God.
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:30.600]   Now it puts it into reminders.
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:32.680]   Too bad you weren't in the cult anymore.
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:35.480]   Oh my God, I want back!
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:37.640]   I'm in, please Jim!
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:39.720]   I use a lot, it's great.
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:40.680]   What do I need to do?
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:44.840]   Whip round watches, Leo.
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:46.520]   We have round watches.
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:48.600]   They don't look like gadgets.
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:53.000]   It's hard.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.440]   Is that what you can use that with his life on now?
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:56.520]   We live in amazing times.
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:00.520]   The fact that you have a choice and it's such a hard choice to make is a good thing.
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:01.880]   Sometimes you make the wrong one?
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:03.000]   Apparently.
[02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:05.080]   No, no. You know what?
[02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:09.240]   I've moved to full speed ahead to the iPhone 6s plus.
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:10.040]   I just love it.
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:11.080]   Just love it.
[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:12.600]   I'll give you a hard time on this week in Google.
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:14.040]   Well, that's the problem.
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:14.600]   I can't win.
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:19.080]   I'm screwed either way.
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:21.160]   There's one church or the other going to hate me.
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:23.480]   Well, see, that's good.
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:27.080]   I got people thinking that if I say good things about Apple,
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:29.000]   people think I'm an Apple fanboy.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.040]   If I say good things about something that's not Apple, I'm an Apple hater.
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:34.120]   That means that I think I'm doing a pretty good job.
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:35.480]   I want to be hated by everybody.
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:37.000]   That's what keep your Pulitzer Prize.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.840]   Everybody on the stage on the Google event was wearing the Moto 360.
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:46.360]   That seems to be the in watch for the smart kids.
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:47.880]   I notice you're wearing one as well.
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:48.120]   Yep.
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:50.040]   I really like it.
[02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:55.720]   I mean, I don't even have this pair to my iPhone yet.
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:57.800]   And I just like it.
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:01.080]   As a physical object, I just like it better than more than the Apple watch.
[02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:03.480]   I've been wearing the Apple watch a lot for, you know,
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:05.240]   because one thing I'm in back in the call.
[02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:10.280]   And I learned this is I got the advice from you.
[02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:12.280]   Go to Amazon or maybe was it somebody else?
[02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:12.280]   Nice.
[02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:13.640]   Maybe it was no, it was Andy.
[02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:15.800]   Go to Amazon by a $35 band.
[02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:18.840]   It looks just, I mean, it's not, but I don't care if it's not as good
[02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:19.560]   because I throw it away.
[02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:21.960]   Get another one when I, yeah, I got that one.
[02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:22.920]   Same one you got, Andy.
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:26.680]   You know what I want though is the floral elastomer band.
[02:05:26.680 --> 02:05:29.160]   I got the midnight blue floral elastomer and I quite like it.
[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:29.960]   I think I need that.
[02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:31.160]   But you have a black watch.
[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:32.120]   I got the same thing.
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:34.680]   And you can match the Apple smart enough to make all the watch faces,
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:38.280]   match the bands, whatever you band you get it matches.
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:39.320]   I need to do that.
[02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:40.920]   That's the thing when you make the watch,
[02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:42.440]   watch faces really, really dull.
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:46.040]   They'll, you can put any sofa in a gray painted room.
[02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:47.080]   It'll do a flash.
[02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:50.200]   Andy, don't you want to get in the cult again?
[02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:52.760]   I like my watch face.
[02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:55.240]   We have a rocket ship and a planet that walks around the.
[02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:58.200]   Andy, what you're talking about?
[02:05:58.200 --> 02:05:59.400]   I have seizures.
[02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:00.520]   Much of the week.
[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:06.360]   My book the week is a really cool Apple watch app actually called Sleep Plus Plus.
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:09.800]   It's made by the same guy who makes a pedometer plus plus,
[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:12.680]   which is my favorite step app for the Apple Watch.
[02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:16.680]   And it is a sleep tracker that works as a native Apple Watch app.
[02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:21.960]   So it doesn't work as well as some other like phone apps do,
[02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:24.760]   where you simply tell it that at some point I intend to go.
[02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:25.720]   I'm in bed right now.
[02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:27.800]   At some point I'm going to stop reading and go to sleep.
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:30.840]   You have to actually activate the app and press button saying,
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:32.200]   okay, I'm going, I'm turning off the lights.
[02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:33.160]   I'm going to sleep right now.
[02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:35.640]   But it will run in airplane mode.
[02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:39.800]   So it'll only take, it will take a lot less time off of your watch battery
[02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:40.920]   than you think it will.
[02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:44.200]   And it will simply watch you while you sleep over the next,
[02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:47.400]   hopefully, six to eight hours and tell you how many times did you wake up?
[02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:52.040]   How much real sleep did you get based, of course, on how much you're moving around
[02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:53.240]   during the sleep period?
[02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:56.200]   And it's a really, it'll feed that information into the health app.
[02:06:56.200 --> 02:07:00.040]   It's a really, it's something that I think that everybody should try out,
[02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:04.200]   some sort of a sleep tracker app, because I had no idea how poorly I was sleeping
[02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:08.120]   until the first time that I was wearing a fitness band and enabled that feature overnight.
[02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:12.360]   Or I thought that, you know, over the course of a week when you realize that,
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:15.080]   oh, well, geez, I got to, I got, I have this breakfast meeting at nine.
[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:16.680]   I got to leave the house at six in the morning.
[02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:17.560]   I'll finish this first.
[02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:19.560]   Okay, I only got three hours of sleep tonight, but that's okay.
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:20.440]   I'll make it up tomorrow.
[02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:25.960]   Then you realize that no, I was pulling four to five hours of sleep for four days out of the week.
[02:07:25.960 --> 02:07:29.800]   I need to get on that because that's going to have repercussions, I think.
[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:34.360]   So it's, it's, it's not perhaps as important a metric as how many steps do you take with the
[02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:36.840]   course of the day, how many calories do you burn over the course of the day, how much are you
[02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:38.040]   standing up and sitting down?
[02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:39.400]   But it's a valuable metric.
[02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:41.080]   And I'm glad that I have exposure to that.
[02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:45.640]   So it's the only one that I've tried so far that works on the, uh, natively on the Apple Watch,
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:49.800]   because I think that I've tried the ones that, uh, they run on your phone and you just sort of
[02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:51.640]   like keep it somewhere in your bed.
[02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:55.400]   Uh, you have the, you wear pajamas like night, then I, now we have,
[02:07:55.400 --> 02:08:00.200]   I mean, the old 1950s pajama designs where they have a pocket for your cigarettes in bed.
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:01.320]   Now you can use that.
[02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:02.520]   Now you can use that for your phone.
[02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:03.960]   Is that what that pocket's for?
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:08.200]   That's, I found that out that that's why that, that's why the pajamas have pockets because
[02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:09.160]   people have cigarettes.
[02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:09.720]   Cigarettes.
[02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:13.640]   Oh, and I'm like, oh my God, that's the worst idea.
[02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:16.760]   Because I always worried, I always wondered about that.
[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:18.280]   Why is there a pocket?
[02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:19.960]   What are you going to put in that pocket?
[02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:20.840]   Oh my God.
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:22.440]   It was, I almost wish I hadn't known.
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:23.080]   Is that okay?
[02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:27.480]   So I guess spontaneous human combustion isn't really a thing because anyway, um,
[02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:31.320]   Wow, but yeah, no, it's a, it's a, it's, I like the kinds that are wearable,
[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:34.440]   whether you wear it on a $30 fitness band or something more expensive.
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:36.280]   I'm glad there's a native watch app for it.
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:40.520]   I would like it to get a little bit better because again, you have to press a button to say,
[02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:41.880]   okay, I am going to sleep.
[02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:44.600]   No, and that never really works.
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:49.080]   Uh, I have, uh, when I was testing out the Microsoft band, all you do is say that I intend
[02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:53.640]   to go to sleep at this point and then it will, it won't start until it detects that you are
[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:58.040]   actually gone to sleep and you're no longer, you know, out and about, but a good, good first
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:08:59.400]   start. Also, great app.
[02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:03.400]   Uh, I like pedometer plus plus a good chance to do a second recommendation for that as well.
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:07.560]   So I was very happy to, it's a free download and give them some money and you don't have any ads
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:11.400]   and on the, uh, on the phone version of the app, I was just happy to get the chance to give
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:12.360]   that person more money.
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:15.720]   Do you say you wear your, in order to do this, you have to wear your watch to bed.
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:16.680]   You'd have to wear your watch to bed.
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:18.200]   You don't like that. Yeah.
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:20.440]   Well, I mean, it's, it's going to be okay.
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:23.560]   Most people would wonder if, uh, there's going to be no battery left.
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:25.960]   Also, most people are going to be charging their batteries overnight.
[02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:29.720]   Right. I don't think that's a big deal because number one, it doesn't knock that much battery off,
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:34.600]   especially if you put it into airplane mode beforehand, which is something that the maker
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:39.800]   recommends you do. And also, I mean, it's given that this watch charges in about an hour.
[02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:43.560]   I get out of bed, I make breakfast, I shower, I shave, that's an hour.
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:46.360]   Uh, so by the time I'm actually ready to act, I watch on my wrist.
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:47.560]   It's going to be charged up anyway.
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:50.120]   You might be interested in, um, in my pick.
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:50.920]   So go ahead. Sorry.
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:51.720]   Renee, did you want to say?
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:53.000]   No, I was just going to say it's under a score.
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.560]   David Smith, um, that is the developer who did it.
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:58.200]   And he's, he's really good at making these kinds of apps.
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:01.560]   And if Georgia was here, she would remind me to tell her one that sleep is super, super important.
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:03.320]   And we often don't prioritize it enough.
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:04.760]   And that's the reason I started using it.
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:08.680]   I was using the pedometer app and she would just complain and complain about my, you know,
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:09.720]   poor sleep hygiene.
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:11.880]   So I'm, I'm using this as an attempt to get better at it.
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:14.120]   How the hell does she know what your sleep hygiene is?
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:15.320]   Cause yeah, I complain like, did you sleep?
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:18.360]   I'm like, no, and I complain and then, you know, I'm not, you know,
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:19.320]   I'm writing way too much.
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:22.920]   These devices are counter productive for sleep.
[02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:24.920]   You're shining a bright light in your eyes.
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:28.200]   And of course, the first thing I do when I can't sleep is I fire up my iPhone,
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:29.560]   which a lot of people leave notific.
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:34.120]   I mean, I've shared a hotel room with Phil Nickinson and 18 devices are pinging every three minutes.
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:36.840]   Yeah, no, I, I've learned how not to do that.
[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:38.200]   Thank God.
[02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:42.520]   You might be interested in my pick, Andy, because I am wearing, you may notice,
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:43.720]   as well as an Apple watch.
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:49.080]   On the other hand, I'm wearing this little weird misfit and the misfit is,
[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:53.560]   and by the way, the misfit is well designed in that you can, you can wear it in a little rubber
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:53.800]   band.
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:56.280]   It's very lightweight, a little disc, but you don't have to.
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:04.520]   In fact, it comes with a, a little magnetic clip that is really quite strong that we can,
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:07.160]   you can flop over on anything you put in a pocket.
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:09.960]   I've, I've worn it to bed in my jammy waist bands.
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:13.240]   Works quite well. And this thing auto senses sleep.
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:15.640]   I mean, it just basically says, oh, you're not moving.
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:18.600]   You're either dead or you're asleep, but either way, I'm going to start recording.
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:20.920]   And so it is a sleep tracker.
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:23.480]   It's, it's a fitness tracker.
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:25.000]   There's some things I really like about it.
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.080]   You can, it doesn't have a display.
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:29.000]   So you don't have to charge it.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:35.320]   It has a little, you know, dime battery in it that will keep this going for a year.
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:39.960]   And that's why I like it for a sleep tracker, because I don't have to worry about it.
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:41.960]   It shows you the time in a weird way.
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:43.800]   That's the minute hand.
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:45.080]   There's the hour hand.
[02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:50.360]   It also shows you by lighting up around the circumference how close you are to your goal.
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:56.120]   And it syncs using BLE with the iPhone, uses Bluetooth with Android devices,
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:11:58.840]   has a pretty nice app that will show you your sleep.
[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:01.240]   It will also show you activity, obviously.
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:06.440]   But the same company that does the misfit, it's misfit.com, also makes something called the bedit,
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:12.920]   which is a sleep monitor that just straps to your, what looks to be very much like a Casper mattress.
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:17.320]   And that way you don't, it just leave it there.
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:18.440]   And it has a smart alarm.
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:19.800]   It'll kind of wake you up.
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:21.560]   They make a variety of devices.
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:25.720]   This is a fitness device that also has a switch in it.
[02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:30.280]   I have the Fitbit, or not Fitbit, misfit, which is a little confusing,
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:34.360]   misfit shine, which at least $70 and get it for cheaper.
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:37.560]   But they have a $30 version that does pretty much all the same things.
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:39.880]   You can swim with it too.
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:44.440]   Or if you want to spend a little more money, you can get one that actually is Jewell's
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:50.680]   that you can hang around your neck, or this you can put almost anywhere on your body.
[02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:55.800]   And it's waterproof, but the one that's designed specifically for swimmers will actually detect
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:12:58.840]   laps. It'll know when you switch direction.
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:01.880]   So I've tried a lot of fitness trackers.
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:03.720]   I think none of them are perfect.
[02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:08.680]   The nice thing about the Apple Watch and the Moto 360 is they give you a heart rate,
[02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:12.360]   which is a very important number to keep track of when you're exercising.
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:17.800]   But at least for just steps and for sleep tracking, I really like the misfit.
[02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:23.160]   And it's pretty affordable $30 starting price, M-I-S-F-I-T.com.
[02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:25.320]   Hey, we're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:28.120]   But I do thank you all for being here.
[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:31.080]   Andy Inako is at the Chicago Sun Times.
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:36.440]   And you can catch his work there, but also at cwob.com, his website.
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:41.800]   And of course, every week here, he's also does Andy Inako's almanac on the five by five
[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:43.400]   network for Dan Benjamin.
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:44.520]   That's a great show.
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:50.280]   If you'd like to hear about his enthusiasms, of which he has a great many.
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:51.960]   Is that what we're calling it now?
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:52.360]   Yeah.
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:54.280]   It's very delicate.
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:54.760]   I appreciate it.
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:57.080]   You're very enthusiastic.
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:13:59.240]   Andy had one of his enthusiasms.
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:00.760]   He won't be able to do the show today.
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:03.480]   He has the vapas.
[02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:05.160]   They're still holding him down.
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:07.160]   I like that.
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:07.880]   That's a good word.
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:09.640]   I have to remember that.
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:11.160]   ReneeRitchie, I'm more.com.
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:13.880]   His enthusiasm is writing a lot.
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:17.640]   He's obsessive about it, but that's all to the good of all of us because
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:21.640]   there's no better place to go to get the latest information about Apple.
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:22.280]   Everything.
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:23.560]   I'm more.com.
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:24.520]   Thanks for being here, Renee.
[02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:25.560]   Appreciate it.
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:26.840]   And don't forget it's a podcast.
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:28.440]   Debug and the others.
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:32.760]   Oh, and I should mention that Motivet by Srinidhi called
[02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:36.280]   well Jason Snell and the rest of the gang, the incomparable radio theater today,
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:37.480]   has me guy English.
[02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:39.800]   You, I believe Leo.
[02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:43.560]   Some guy named Leo Laporte as the announcer, right, Andy?
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:45.400]   We're always the announcer.
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:47.000]   But it's a role.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.680]   I was a villain in an early.
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:49.640]   Oh, were you?
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:51.480]   Jason said I could be a villain someday.
[02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:56.520]   So if you want to listen to Leo and I make absolute great character acting,
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:14:59.880]   we set the bar higher than ever for radio theater.
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:01.000]   You can listen to the latest episode.
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.680]   I'm trying to talk Jason and letting us do one here in the studio,
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:06.920]   kind of live-ish like you did on stage.
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:10.440]   If we can get everybody together because I would love to do that.
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:12.120]   I always wanted to do radio theater here.
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:13.480]   It would just be so much fun.
[02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:16.040]   And you have a great writer and everything.
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:17.160]   Thanks Renee.
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:21.160]   And thanks, of course, to Jim Dalrymple who will be rocking out
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:23.560]   at a dim sum restaurant near you.
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.720]   Loopinsight.com.
[02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:29.640]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:31.160]   We do Mac Break Weekly 11 a.m.

[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:39.160]   I'd love it if you'd join us and watch and be in the chat room,
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:40.440]   participate in the show.
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:41.160]   We always like that.
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:43.480]   As you can see, I use the chat room like crazy.
[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:48.520]   But if you can't, on-demand audio and video is always available after the fact.

[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:54.280]   We had a little pagination error.
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:56.600]   It looked like we only had 12 shows for a while.
[02:15:56.600 --> 02:15:57.800]   We fixed that.
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:15:59.240]   All the shows are available there.
[02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:03.800]   We also can get the 10 latest shows from our podcast feeds.
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:06.440]   And those are published at iTunes and everywhere, you know, Stitcher.
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:10.040]   We even have a great bunch of apps, third-party apps written
[02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:16.040]   for us by our fans, for iOS, Android, Windows, phone, Roku, etc.

[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:24.920]   Get back to work 'cause you know what?
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:26.760]   Break time is over.
